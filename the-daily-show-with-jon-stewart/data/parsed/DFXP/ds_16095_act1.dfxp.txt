JULY 25th, 2011 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DALE HE SHOW WITH SWRON STEWART    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NEIL PATRICK HER IS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW AS YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR VIEWERS LIVE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. (LAUGHTER) I DOT LONGITUDES AND LATITUDES BUT I REALLY DON'T--  (LAUGHTER) AN EXPERIENCED--   (LAUGHTER) A LOT OF MAP LOVERS IN THE AUDIENCE. ANYWAY, IN THE HEMISPHERE HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST WEEK A WEATHER PHENOMENON OF  EXTREME HEAT CALLED LABS, FALARO WHERE THE SUN GETS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE EARTH TO HUG IT. AND THEN DO THIS TO IT IT BUT WHERE WE HUMANS SAW HARDSHIP, TV WEATHER NEWS  PEOPLE SAW HOT-PERTUNITY.
WE JUST TOOK THIS JUSTY T BONE OUT OF THE FRINGE AND SEE IF WE CAN COOK IT ON THE  DASHBOARD OF A CAR.
YOU CAN REALLY COOK EGGS ON A STREET, BAKE COOKIES ON A DASHBOARD.
THE MAC AND CHEESE HAVE COOKED.
I WILL TASTE THE PIZZA.
THE PIZZA IS ACTUALLY FULLY COOKED. IT IS NOT GLOBAL WARNING, IT IS GOD PREHEATING AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, THIS GUY MAY BE EAT PIZZA STRAIGHT OFF THE SIDEWALK, BUT AT LEAST HE  DIDN'T USE A [BLEEP] FORK WHEN HE ATE IT. AS LONG AS I LIVE-- YOU DON'T EAT, OUT THERE, YOU DISRESPECT ME, YOU SON OF A--  (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE LIGHT. (LAUGHTER) WITH MORE ON THE SOARING WEEK END TEMPERATURES WE'RE JOINED WITH OUR SENIOR  REPORTER WYATT CENAC. WHY DO WEATHER PEOPLE ALWAYS RESORT TO THESE INCREDIBLY GIMMICKY STUNTS WHEN  DISCUSSING EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS?
JON, IT'S ABOUT TAKING COMPLICATED SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON AND MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE. 103 HE AGREES WITH 70% HUMIDITY, A, BUT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS DOES IT HOTTEN FOOD? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO THE GIMMICK, THE PIZZA, THE STANDING OUTSIDE IN THE HURRICANE S JUST A  WAY FOR US NONSCIENTISTS TO UNDERSTAND EXTREME WEATHER?
WELL, REALLY ANY WEATHER. FOR INSTANCE THE HEAT WAVE BROKE TODAY BUT IT'S STILL OVER 80 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT  OR TO PUT INA THAT IN TERMS RUBES LIKE YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND, EGG SALAD SANDWICH WARMING WEATHER. (LAUGHTER) THIS HAS BEEN OUTSIDE ALL DAY, WITH THIS GLASS OF MILK.
Jon: I DON'T THINK-- NO I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD EAT THAT.
OH, YEAH, OH-- OH, OH, MAN, THAT IS SUCH FLAVOR. OH. I SHOULD WASH IT DOWN WITH THIS LUMPY MILK.
Jon: I DON'T --
OH, OH-- .
Jon: I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE EATING --
YOU SHOULD CALL ME ONE OF THOSE VANS WITH THE LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF IT YOU KNOW  WHAT, I'LL CALL IT. WEHOO WITHIN WEHHOO.
Stephen: .
Jon: I TOLD YOU NOT TO EAT THAT I'M NOT SURE WHAT ANY OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO PROVE.
IT PROVES I'M A WEATHER REPORTER, JON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL WEATHER REPORTER. I KNOW SOME SCIENCE. AND I ALSO HAVE A MOUTHY, OUTGOING PERSONALITY. OH GOD, IT HURTS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, WYATT, WYATT CENAC, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A STAIN. THERE YOU GO. WOW. IF WE HAD TAPED THAT BIT IN THE STUDIO WE WOULD HAVE A HUGE PILE OF EGG SALAD TO  CLEAN UP RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) GOOD THING THAT WAS OUTSIDE ON NEW YORK'S PIZZA STREWN SIDEWALK. ACTUALLY, THE HEAT LAST FRIDAY DOVE DRO ME NOT MOVIE THESE TORE SEE THE NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA MOVIE. AWESOME. TERRIFIC, INSPIRING MOVIE ABOUT A 98 POUND WEAKING WHO THROUGH SHEER DETERMINATION, COURAGE AND A THERMEM THAT RENDERS IM-- TAKES DOWN AND DEFEATS JAMES CARVILLE.
I'M GOING TO GET THE-- ANYWAY THE MOVIE IS A FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF WHAT OUR COUNTRY  CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND THEN I CAME HOME AND SAW THE  NONFICTION VERSION OF THE FILM.
THE AGO RI MONDAY US NEGOTIATIONS COULDS LAED ON FRIDAY WHEN HOUSE SPEAKER  JOHN BOEHNER WALKED OUT.
THE LATEST ROUND OF TALKS BROKE DOWN AGAIN OVER THE WEEKEND.
CAN A DEAL BE REACHED OR IS THIS ATMOSPHERE JUST POISON.
Jon: CAPTAIN AMERICA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME GET YOU CAUGHT UP. WHILE MANY AMERICANS WERE ENJOYING AMERICA'S FAST FOOD SIDEWALKS AND JUSTY  DASHBOARD STEAKS OUR COUNTRY MOVED CLOSE EVER TO SELF-INFLICTED ECONOMIC  COULDS LA, SOMETHING WE HAVE KNOWN HAS BEEN COMPANYING FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN  TOLD, IT'S COMING.
TREASURY SECRETARY TIM GEITHNER SUT APPROXIMATINGING A DATE ON WHAT SAYS WOULD BE A  NATIONAL DISASTER, AS EARLY AS PARCH 31st.
WE CAN GIVE CONGRESS UNTIL THE END OF JUNE.
GEITHNER SAYS THE NATION WILL DISOLVE ON ITS DEAD JULY 8TH.
MOVED THE DROP DEAD DATE FROM JULY 8TH TO AUGUST 2 WND IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT  BY THE SECOND THEY WILL PUT OUR-- THEY WILL DOWNGRADE OUR CREDIT, FIRST TIME IN  HISTORY, AND IF THAT HAPPENS, ARE YOU GOING TO SEE CAT STRAFK DAMAGE ACROSS THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND ACROSS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
Jon: THE ONLY OTHER CATASTROPHE THAT'S MOVED ITS DATE THIS OFTEN WAS  SPICERMAN TURN OFF THE DARBLING. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) 112th CONGRESS HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNABLE TO MUSTER  A DEBT SEALING AGREEMENT TO AVOID EYE HOLY UNNECESSARY DEFAULT, PROBABLY BECAUSE  ITS SUCH A COMPLICATED THING WE WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO DO IT IN THE PAST 102 TIMES. (LAUGHTER)
WE'VE RAISED THE DEBT CEILING 17 TIMES UNDER REAGAN -- TIMES UNDER HW  DUSH, FOUR AND PRESIDENT CLINTON 7 UNDER GW BUSH, SO PARENTLY FOR PAST CONGRESSES  IT IS AS EFFORTLESS AS THIS. BUT OF COURSE FOR THIS CONFERENCE, CONGRESS, IT'S HARD TO GRAB A ZIP LINE WHEN  YOU CAN'T SEE IT. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE BAD AT THEIR JOBS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS CONGRESS IS BAD AT ITS JOB, I'M JUST SAYING THAT THIS CONGRESS IS EQUIVALENT TO A SKUNK WITH ITS HEAD IN A JAR  OF SKIPPY PEANUT BUTTER. OF COURSE, THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THE DEMOCRATS WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD NOT TOLERATE.
DEMOCRATS ARE NOT SUPPORTING ANY CUTS IN BENEFITS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY.
YOU CANNOT ALLOW MEDICARE TO BE CUT.
DON'T SLASH MEDICAID.
LET'S RAISE TACKS ON THOSE WHO HAVE HAD A BREAK FOR THE LAST DECADE.
WE HAVE TO RAISE REVENUE.
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING DONE WITH REVENUE TO MAKE THIS FAIR.
Jon: THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN'T TOLERATE.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO AGREE TO TAX HIKES.
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT RAISING TAXES IS THE ANSWER HERE.
SHORT-TERM WASHINGTON SOLUTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS THE BEST.
THE ONLY WAY I WILL VOTE ON THIS DEBT LIMIT THING IS IF IT IS THE LAST TIME WE DO IT.
WE'RE OUT OF ROAD IT KICK THE CAN DOWN, NOW IS THE TIME TO DEAL WELL IT.
Jon: AT LEAST TWO THINGS ARE CLEAR, HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER DIE SHORT-TERM  DEAL WITH TAX INCREASE, DEM CAN'TS WON'T WITHOUT TAX INCREASES.
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID HAD TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD  AND CAME UP WITH HIS APPROACH T WOULD CUT 2.7 TRILLION DOLLARS, NO TAX INCREASES, AND RAISE THE  DEBT 150E8ING TO GET THIS COUNTRY THROUGH 2012.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER SAYS HE AIMS TO UNVEIL THE FRAMEWORK FOR A  NEW SHORTER TERM PLAN THIS AFTERNOON IT WOULD MEAN REVISITING THE DEBT CEILING NEXT YEAR.
THE BOEHNER PLAN DID INCLUDE SOME REVENUE INCREASES.
Jon: SO BOTH SIDES SWITCHED, EVERYBODY CAVED AND NO ONE AGREED. DEMOCRAT HARRY REID'S NEW PLAN IS NOW TO THE RIGHT OF REPUBLICAN JOHN BOEHNER  WHOSE NEW PLAN SAYS HEY, THIS SUCKED SO MUCH LESS'S DO IT AGAIN IN NINE MONTHS. MY QUESTION TO CONGRESS AND I THINK A QUESTION THAT MANY AMERICANS MAY BE SHARING AS  OF TONIGHT IS THIS. DO YOU WANT OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP SO BAD BUT DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO  LEAVE, SO YOU'VE ALL DECIDED TO ACT LIKE SUCH GIANT BLOOEP WLOOEP-- [BLEEP] YOU  FORCE US TO BREAK UP WITH YOU, BECAUSE IF SO, JUST GET THE [BLEEP] OUT.
