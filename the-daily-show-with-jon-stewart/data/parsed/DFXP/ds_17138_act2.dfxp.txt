Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE OLYMPIC GAMES -- THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN LONDON HAVE INSPIRED THE WORLD. THERE'S ANOTHER CONTEST CLOSER TO HOME THAT IS PERHAPS EVEN MORE DESERVING OF OUR ATTENTION. JASON JONES HAS MORE.
HAROLD BROOKS OF HEBRON, MAINE LOVES THE OLYMPICS SEW DECIDED TO HOST AN ATHLETIC CONTEST IN HIS BACKYARD.
BY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HAVE COMPETITIONS IT RELIEVED PEOPLE FROM A DAY TO  DAY STRESMS WE CALLED THE REDNECK OLYMPICS.
ONE PROBLEM THE USOC DIDN'T LIKE THE WORD OLYMPICS. WHY WOULD THEY GIVE A (bleep) ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING FUN IN A FIELD.
THEY NEED TO PREVENT CONFUSION. PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THE RED NECK OLYMPICS IS SOMEHOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNITED STATES OLYMPICS.
RIGHT PEOPLE WITHOUT A TV OR INTERNET CONNECTION OR EYES OR A BRAIN WOULD DEFINITELY THINK THAT.
IT'S POSSIBLE, SURE.
WHAT ARE THE RED NECK OLYMPICS SUPPOSED TO DO.
CHANGE THEIR NAME FROM OLYMPICS.
TO WHAT?
RED NECK GAMES.
IT'S TAKEN. IT'S WHEN YOU BEAT A MAN TO DWET A CAT FISH. SEW CHANGED IT TO RED NECK BLANK. WOULD PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THAT SNEENS HE NEEDED MY HELP. I'M GOING GIVE YOU ALL THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF AN NBC-STYLE COVERAGE.

SHE'S DOMINATED THE REGIONAL COMPETITION BUT DOES SHE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN ON THE BIG STAGE. WELCOME TO THE RED NECK BLANK AQUATICS CENTER. I FOUND OUT YOU ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT. TWO DAYS AGO YOU HAD SURGERY.
I DIDN'T HAVE SURGERY I GOT MY (bleep) PIERCED.
WELL, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
SHE COMES BOUNDING OUT AND RIGHT TO A BACKSIDE GATOR THERE. THE SIGNATURE MOVE. THE DOUBLE FLOP. SHE NAILED IT. ARE YOU SEEING THIS? ARE YOU SEEING THIS? AN HISTORIC PERFORMANCE. YOU JUST TOOK GOLD. HOW DO YOU FEEL.
I FEEL GREAT I BEAT THAT RUSSIAN SLUT.
YOU CERTAINLY DID AND I BET YOUR FAMILY IS PROUD OF YOU.
THAT CONCLUDES THE COVERAGE. BEFORE WE GO WE'LL CHECK BACK IN WITH YUMMY. IF THE USOC NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO TRIUMPH IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY?
