MAY 12, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, HAD  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: GOOD EVENING! WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. WE HAVE A TERRIFIC PROGRAM FOR YOU. THE LOVELY KRISTEN WIIG WILL BE JOINING US FROM "S.N.L.," AND  ALSO-- YOU KNOW, SHE ACTUALLY IS IN A MOVIE THAT'S COMING OUT THIS WEEKEND. IN FACT, IT SEEMS ALMOST EVERY TIME THESE INCREDIBLY TALENTED PEOPLE STOP BY TO SAY HELLO TO  ME FOR FIVE MINUTES, THEY COINCIDENTALLY HAVE A MOVIE COMING OUT THAT SAME-- I DON'T  KNOW HOW IT WORKS OUT THAT WAY, BUT IT... IT... ( LAUGHTER ) REAL QUICK. AS YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT, THERE WAS A POETRY READING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I BELIEVE IT WAS THE FIRST POETRY READING AT THE WHITE HOUSE SINCE BILL CLINTON'S  INFAMOUS 1996 CELEBRATION "A NIGHT WITH THE MAN FROM NANTUCKET. " BUT AMERICAN POETS, YOUNG AND OLD, SPOKE OUT ABOUT A WIDE VARIETY OF SUBJECTS FROM THE  IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO MEMORIES OF A FAVORITE TEACHER TO HOW HARD IT IS TO  FIND A NICE BLAZER ON SHORT NOTICE. ( LAUGHTER ) EH( BLEEP ). IT'S TONIGHT? DOES THAT'S WALLPAPER COME OFF? LAUGH AND OF COURSE, THE PROGRESSIVE RAPPER COMMON, WHO WAS THE SUBJECT OF FOX NEWS  CHANNEL'S LATEST EXERCISE IN FITS OF HISSY, HE PERFORMED TO THEIR CHAGRIN, SPOKE OUT ABOUT  COMMUNITIES TRYING TO OVERCOME A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE TO OBTAIN A MORE POSITIVE FUTURE. OF COURSE, THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WOULD INTERPRET HIS PERFORMANCE. FOR THOSE WHO HUFF ONLY THE HEADY MIX OF PARTISAN HACKRY, CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, AND MANUFACTURED OUTRAGE, KNOWN AS "FOXYGEN"-- ( LAUGHTER )  IT LOOKED A LITTLE-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE HIGH-FIVED WHEN WE CAME UP WITH THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) COMMON'S PERFORMANCE LOOKED A LITTLE MORE LIKE THIS  ♪ AND NOW BLACK, Y'ALL, AND NOW, BLACK Y'ALL, AND NOW ♪ ♪
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY INVITE SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO BLOW UP THE ENTIRE BUILDING? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, YOU GET THE SENSE WHEN WH FOX NEWS HOSTS AND PUNDITS  ARE DONE WITH THEIR PROGRAMS THEY LOOK BOTH WAYS AS THEY LEAVE THE OFFICE AND RUN AS FAST  AS THEY ( BLEEP ) CAN TO THEIR CAR. ( LAUGHTER ) THE LARGER PROBLEM FOR FOX AND THEIR PROTEGES-- AND BY PROTEGES  I MEAN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT-- IS HOW DO YOU COMPETE WITH A COMMANDENER CHIEF  WHO HAS CAPTIVATED AND QUITE FRANKLY, HYPNOTIZED YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE DEFT USE OF THE  LANGUAGE OF THE YOUNG-- YOU KNOW FREE-VERSE POETRY? ONE CONTENDER MAY HAVE THE ANSWER.
A SIGN OF THE TIMES WHEN NEWT GINGRICH OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HE DID IT ON TWITTER, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVER TO ANNOUNCE HIS  RUNNING VIA A TWEET.
Jon: OMAN. HE ANNOUNCED ON TWITTER. WHAT'S THE MATTER, WAS TUMBLR DOWN? WAS VIMEO 4 CHANNELS... THAT IS SOME pets.com... ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND MY COMPUTER. ( LAUGHTER ) SO LET'S SEE GINGRICH'S HISTORIC TWEET. TODAY I'M ANNOUNCING MY CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU CAN WATCH MY ANNOUNCEMENT HERE H-T-T-P, COLON, BACKSLASH, BACKSLASH, BIT, DOT, L-Y, BACKSLASH, LOWERCASE "K," BIT "E," LITTLE "B," LITTLE H-7-D. ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT A MINUTE, HIS TWITTER ANNOUNCEMENT IS JUST A TLOINK A YOUTUBE VIDEO? WHERE DOES THAT GO, TO A GROUPON DISCOUNT ON GINGRICH BUMMER STICKERS? ACTUALLY, THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH-TECH WAY TO ROLL OUT YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN AD. I HOPE THE YOUTUBE ANNOUNCEMENT ITSELF MEASURES UP.
I'M NEWT GINGRICH, AND I'M ANNOUNCING MY CANDIDACY FOR  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN RETURN AMERICA TO HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY, TO FULL EMPLOYMENT, TO REAL SECURITY, TO AN AMERICAN ENERGY PROGRAM, TO A BALANCED BUDGET.
Jon: BACK UP 3 ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHO THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO DO YOUR STATEMENT OF THE  ART CAMPAIGN COMPUTER LAUNCH IN A SEARS PHOTO STUDIO BOOTH? ( LAUGHTER ) WITH A CASIO ACCOMPANIMENT. THAT'S NOT MUSIC TO LAUNCH A HIP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. THAT'S THE MUSIC FOR A MOTHER-DAUGHTER WALK ON THE BEACH IN A MASSENGIL AD. STILL, GINGRICH ANNOUNCING ON TWITTER AND YOUTUBE INSTEAD OF ON TELEVISION AND A NEWSPAPER  IT'S AS THOUGH NEWT HAS ABANDONED OLD MEDIA WHILE IT WAS SICK OR POSSIBLY DYING TO TAKE  UP WITH NEWER, YOUNGER, MORE ( BLEEP ) MEDIA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I-- I'M A LITTLE BAFFLED AS TO WHY HE'S DOING IT.
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE IS THE CANDIDATE OF THE 21st CENTURY.
SMART MOVE. HE'S TRYING TO SHOW EVEN THESE OLDER GUYS ARE YOUNG AND HIP AND USING FACEBOOK AND TWITTER.
IS NEWT GINGRICH A PAST GENERATION GUY OR CAN HE HOOK UP WITH THE NEW GENERATION? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SGLON YOU KNOW HOOK-UP MEANS ( BLEEP ), RIGHT? YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS? ( APPLAUSE ) LOOK, NEWT-- AND I SAY THIS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, NEWT, AND I  HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU, BUT THIS WHOLE TWITTER, YOUTUBE THING IS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR  YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT COOL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE UNCOOL. LET ME PUT IT TH IN LINGO YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE WHAT MIGHT BE KNOWN TO YOUR GENERATION AS A SQUARE. ( LAUGHTER ) LOOK AT YOU. PHYSICALLY. YOU RESEMBLE A SQUARE. YOU PHYSICALLY-- LOOK AT YOUR HEAD. YOUR HEAD LOOKS LIKE THE BOX A SLIGHTLY SMALLER SQUARE HEAD WOULD COME IN. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH IS FINE, BUT EMBRACE WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE A SMARTIE-PANTS POLICY WONK GUY. YOU SHOULD ANNOUNCE THROUGH THROUGH A MEDIA FORM WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CHARACTERS LIKE TWITTER. DO IT THROUGH A SUDUKEO PUZZLE WHICHES IS AWE KNOW, IS A LARGE SQUARE MADE UP OF A SERIES OF  SMALLER ONES. LET'S FACE IT, NEWT, IF YOU WERE A SUPERHERO YOUR POWER WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO TURN THINGS BEIGE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOUR THEME SONG WOULD BE-- YOU WOULD NOT HAVE A THEME SONG. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? AND YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN YOUR POWERS WHEN YOU WERE BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE UNSALTED SALTINE. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS TWITTER THING WILL NOT MAKE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOU. IT WILL JUST MAKE YOUNG PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD LIKE WHEN THE ABC NEWS PROGRAM  "20/20" DECIDED TO APPEAL TO A YOUNGER DEMGRAPHIC, SO THEY  CREATED "20/20 DOWNTOWN" WHICH THE THE SAME ( BLEEP ) SHOW. EXCEPT INSTEAD OF JOHN QUINONES HOSTING INSIDE A STUDIO, THEY MADE HIM STAND OUTSIDE IN A  BROWN LEATHER JACKET. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, NEWT, YOU CAN PUT ON A TURTLENECK AND A LEATHER JACKET, AND GIVE YOURSELF A BEIBER, BUT NO MATTER HOW CLEVER-- NO HOW CLEVER YOUR HASH TAGS,, THIS IS  HOW THE NEW GENERATION WILL ALWAYS SEE YOU.
EXCUSE ME. I HAVE ALLERGIES. ( LAUGHTER ) SGLON EXTREME ALLERGIES! NEWT, THE NEW GENERATION STILL ISN'T GOING TO WANT TO HOOK UP WITH YOU. THEY SMELL THE PANDER. THEY RESPECT AUTHENTICITY, SO GET OFF TWITTER. GET BACK TO CRUNCHING NUMBERS ON ELECTORAL DISTRICTS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU CAN SCARE ENOUGH  TOLD PEOPLE TO GET SBOU THE OVAL OFFICE, OR, AS I'M SURE IT WILL BE RENAMED UNDER YOUR TENURE, THE RIGHT ANGLE ROOM. ( APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
