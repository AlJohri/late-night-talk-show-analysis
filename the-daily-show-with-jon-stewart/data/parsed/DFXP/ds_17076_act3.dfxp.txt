(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN NBA LEGEND. NOW AN ANALYST FOR TNT'S INSIDE THE NBA. CURRENTLY THE JOURNEY TO COMFORT CAMPAIGN. FOR REAL. PLEASE WELCOME SHAQUILLE O'NEAL. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
YES, TELL ME.
Jon: THAT WAS EXHILARATING. NOW I KNOW HOW MY SON FEELS. I DO THAT TO HIM AND HE TRIES TO DO THAT TO ME. I THINK LIKE, OH. I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN. IS THIS NOW... DID THAT TIRE YOU OUT AT ALL? I FEEL LIKE THIS IS NOT ENOUGH REFRESHMENT FOR YOU. HOW BIG IS YOUR MUG AT HOME?
IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THAT HIGH. ABOUT THAT THICK.
Jon: THIS IS MORE LIKE THE THING YOU RINSE YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH AFTER BRUSHING YOUR TEETH.
THIS WOULD BE LIKE A SHOT GLASS. EVEN THOUGH I DON'T DRINK... IN PUBLIC. MORE LIKE A SHOT GLASS.
Jon: I CAN BARELY LIFT MINE. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S DIFFERENCES. HOW ARE YOU DOING, BY THE WAY? IS IT HARD FOR YOU RIGHT NOW? YOU LOOK STILL LIKE....
ACTUALLY, I'M LIVING FABULOUS. I'M COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKIN. I'M STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE. I'M WORKING ON MY PH.D. I GRADUATED MAY... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I'M STILL SEXY. I STILL HAVE SOME FIRMNESS IN MY ASS. AND OTHER THAN THAT....
Jon: I ACTUALLY WAS NOT GOING TO MENTION THAT EARLIER. BUT I CAN ATTEST TO THE FIRMNESS. WHAT IS THE Ph.D. YOU'RE GETTING IN MAY? WHAT IS THIS?
IN H.R.D., ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP AT BEHRER UNIVERSITY. I GRADUATE MAY 5.
Jon: NOW, YOU ARE IN SCHOOL. IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BLEND IN AS A STUDENT? IF YOU SIT UP FRONT, BASICALLY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE THERE'S A CLASS GOING ON. WHAT IS THE FEELING OF YOU IN CLASS? HOW DO YOUR OTHER CLASSMATES DEAL WITH YOU?
THEY LOOK TO SEE IF I REALLY AM DOING THE WORK. THEY LOOK TO SEE IF I REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I LIKE TO DO MY HOMEWORK. I LIKE TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. WHEN THE TEACHER IS ASKING THE QUESTION, I GO (DEMONSTRATING). I KNOW THAT ONE. I KNOW THAT ONE.
Jon: DOES SHE SEE YOU WHEN YOU DO THAT?
YES, SHE DOES.
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY THINK YOU WOULDN'T DO WORK? BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF YOUR MATTER AS IT IS AT YOUR STATUS AS AN ICON AS A LEGEND WHY  WOULD YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL TO SCREW AROUND? IT MAKES NO SENSE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
Jon: I AM RIGHT.
IT'S JUST THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. LIKE WHEN I'M IN CLASS, THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY GIVE ME THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT IS HE DOING HERE? I THINK I'VE PUT....
Jon: YOU KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THAT.
YES.
Jon: WEDGEY. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COLLEGE POLICY IS ON THAT. JUST ONE OF THOSE REAL QUICK AND THINGS ARE OVER. ARE YOU ABLE TO FIT IT IN. YOU HAVE YOUR JOB AS AN ANALYST. IS IT DIFFICULT... YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO HAVING... YOU STILL LOOK LIKE YOU CAN PLAY. I BET YOU COULD. IS IT HARD NOW TO SIT AND WATCH THE GAMES AND ANALYZE IT AND NOT LET THE COMPETITIVE  JUICES START TO FLOW AND WANT TO DIVE OUT THERE AND PLAY.
IT'S FUN. I TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH. I TRY TO BE LIKE YOU WHEN I'M ON TV. I TRY TO....
Jon: I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT I'VE BEEN A ROLE MODEL FOR YOU.
YOU HAVE. I TRY TO....
Jon: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA... IF I COULD DUNK ONCE, I WOULD GIVE IT ALL UP. BECAUSE MY SON NOW, HE VERY MUCH... FIRST OF ALL HE'S A HUGE FAN OF YOURS. HE LOVES BASKETBALL. HE'S SAYING TO ME I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER. I DON'T KNOW AT WHAT AGE DO I BREAK TO HIM THAT HE'S JEWISH? LIKE I DON'T KNOW. HOW DO YOU EVEN SAY THAT?
WELL, WHEN YOU SEE HIM TONIGHT, TELL HIM UNCLE SHAQ SAYS (SPEAKING YIDDISH). TELL HIM THAT.
Jon: NICE.
AND THEN TELL THEM (SPEAKING YIDDISH) AND THEN TELL HIM THAT HE CAN MAKE IT. HE CAN MAKE IT.
Jon: I AM GOING TO TELL HIM THAT. I'M GOING TO ENCOURAGE HIM. IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. WHO IS MAKING THE FINAL IN THE EAST?
THE KNICKS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SHAQUILLE O'NEAL, EVERYBODY.
