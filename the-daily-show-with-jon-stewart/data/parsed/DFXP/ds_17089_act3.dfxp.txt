(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, VERY FUNNY ACTRESS WHO NEW SHOW FOR HBO IS CALLED "VEEP".
YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE.
WHAT? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOUEL THAT (BLEEP)ING FOR BRAINS PRESIDENT THAT...
MADAM, IF YOU WOULD LISTEN TO ME...
I WON'T LISTEN TO YOU FOR ONE SECOND. I'M NOT INTERESTED..
PLEASE BE QUIET! THE PRESIDENT IS EXPERIENCING SEVERE CHEST PAINS. WE JUST GOT WORD FROM SOUTH AFRICA, WE NEED TO GET TO THE WEST WING IMMEDIATELY.
OH. I'M SO SORRY.
MA'AM? IF YOU COULD JUST MAKE YOUR WAY IN THIS DIRECTION PLEASE.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JULIA LOUISE-DREYFUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S A DELIGHT TO BE HERE.
Jon: THE SHOW IS GREAT.
THANK YOU, SIR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: I DO NOT REALIZE THIS IS ARMANDO' NUCCI FROM "IN THE LOOP."  AND HOW MUCH CURSING IS IN THIS PROGRAM?
A ON THE OF (BLEEP)ING CURSING.
Jon: (LAUGHS) THERE YOU GO. WHY NOT? YOU ARE THE VICE PRESIDENT.
I AM. I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT AND WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS THEY  SAID YOU'RE PLAYING AN UNHAPPY VICE PRESIDENT AND I THOUGHT AH-HA, THAT SOUNDS FUNNY. BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE'S NOT A SINGLE POLITICAL PERSON WHO ASPIRES TO THE VICE PRESIDENTSY.
Jon: NO.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND YOU'VE GOT TO THINK... YOU KNOW, JOE BIDEN...
GOD LOVE HIM.
Jon: GOD LOVE HIM.
RIGHT.
Jon: HE'S PROBABLY SITTING IN SOME OFFICE, NOBODY TALKS TO  HIM, HE'S GOT HIS SHIRT OFF. (LAUGHTER) BIG BOWL OF CHEESE CURLS.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Jon: JUST SITTING THERE WAITING FOR THAT "SIR, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE  SITUATION." HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT?
I'VE... I MET A COUPLE VICE PRESIDENTS. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY WHICH ONES EXCEPTLY SAY I DID MEET WITH VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE  BECAUSE HE MENTIONED IT SO I GUESS NOW I CAN. AND HE WAS UNBELIEVABLY NICE AND REALLY WHAT I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT MEETING HIM AND MEETING  OTHER PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL, FRANKLY, IS IT'S LIKE THOSE IN BETWEEN MOMENTS. LIKE, WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GOT SECRET SERVICE THERE AND YOU NEED TO GET UP AND GO TO THE  BATHROOM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND DO THEY FOLLOW YOU DOWN THE HALLWAY? THESE KINDS OF... THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE SHOW IS ABOUT BUT... (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BUT?
BUT...
Jon: THAT COULD BE ANOTHER SHOW. I COULD SEE THAT AS A SHOW.
THAT COULD BE A SPINOFF.
Jon: THAT COULD BE A SPINOFF. "BATHROOM RUN."
BUT WE GOT A LOT OF BACKSTAGE TOURS AND STUFF OF CAPITOL HILL  AND WE GOT TO GO TO THE SENATE, TO THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF VERY INTERESTING LITTLE TIDBITS I  THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW.
Jon: SURE.
ONE, IS YOU'RE WALKING ON THE SENATE FLOOR, ONE OF THE  SENATOR'S DESK-- AND, GOD, I CANNOT REMEMBER WHICH ONE, DOESN'T MATTER-- IF YOU OPEN IT UP, FILLED WITH CANDY.
Jon: WHAT? (LAUGHTER)
SWEAR TO GOD!
Jon: WHAT KIND OF CANDY?
GOOD CANDY.
Jon: LIKE CHOCOLATE?
KIT-KATS, REESES. THE WHOLE DEAL.
Jon: WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT BY WATCHING C-SPAN.
CANDY DESK.
Jon: CANDY?
I SWEAR. NO WONDER...
Jon: ANY PENS? JUST CANDY?
JUST CANDY. JUST CANDY. THEN I WENT TO SENATOR AL FRANKEN'S DESK AND IY LITTLE NOTE AND I STUCK IT IN HIS DESK  AND I LEFT THE BUILDING. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE NOTE SAYS?
I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY LEFT YOU IN HIS OFFICE WHEN THEY LET YOU IN THERE.
Jon:THERE.
NO, ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE.
Jon: WHAT DID THE NOTE SAY?
IT SAID "SENATOR, THE PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS DESK."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: (LAUGHS) I CAN JUST IMAGINE IN THAT MOMENT GOING "I NEED A (BLEEP)ING CANDY BAR! ANYBODY GOT A CANDY BAR! I NEED A CHARLESTON CHEW!" ARE THEY EXCITED TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE  PORTRAYING THEM DID THEY WELCOME YOU? I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THE TWO TOWNS THAT ARE MOST SIMILAR IN THIS COUNTRY ARE LOS ANGELES AND WASHINGTON. LOS ANGELES IS WASHINGTON THAT THINKS IT HAS POWER AND LOS ANGELES PEOPLE ACT LIKE THEY HAVE POWER. IN WASHINGTON THEY HAVE THE POWER BUT THEY WOULD REALLY JUST BE WATCHING T.V. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING. I THINK FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE CORRECT. IT'S A VERY... THE PARALLELS ARE PRETTY INTENSE IN TERMS OF  PUTTING ON A FACE LIKE I'M DOING RIGHT NOW FOR YOU.
Jon: STOP IT!
YOU'RE VERY NATURAL. YOU'RE A VERY NATURAL PERFORMER.
AND WHAT'S BEHIND THE CURTAIN. AND THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW IS ABOUT BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT... I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE  WELCOMED US AND STUFF BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT... NOT TONS AND TONS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE WORRIED  THAT WE'RE PARROT AGO SPECIFIC PERSON WHICH, OF COURSE, WE'RE NOT. THIS SHOW IS NOT ABOUT...
Jon: THIS IS NOT "GAME CHANGE." IT'S NOT A REAL STORY. THIS IS A DYNAMIC.
IT'S COMPLETE FICTION. YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT PARTY WE'RE IN, WHAT PARTY THE VICE PRESIDENT IS IN.
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING.
YOU'LL NEVER MEET THE PRESIDENT. IT'S... IT'S ALL VERY CRAFTY.
Jon: DO YOU HOLD THAT OUT AS A LITTLE BIT OF... THERE COULD BE A PLOT TWIST WHERE WE  MEET THE PRESIDENT OR THE PRESIDENT...
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
Jon: COULDN'T WE PRETEND THAT WE'RE...
NOT GONNA HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER) NEXT QUESTION. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SON OF A BITCH! HOW MUCH FUN IS IT... YOU CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THESE LABORS OF LOVE. DO YOU JUST... DO YOU GET THE ENERGY FROM FINDING SCRIPTS THAT TICKLE YOU, THAT INTEREST YOU? WHAT IS YOUR... THE WAY THAT YOU APPROACH THE NEXT THING?
DOES IT MAKE ME LAUGH? IS IT FUNNY? I MEAN, REALLY.
Jon: AND YOU GET TO WORK WITH GUYS LIKE ARMANDO IANUCCI.
HE'S FANTASTIC. YOU SHOULD SEE "THE THICK OF IT." IT'S A U.K. SHOW. YOU CAN GOOGLE THAT AND CHECK IT OUT. IT'S COOL.
Jon: I HAVE GOOGLE.
YOU DO?
Jon: I JUST GOT IT ON MY COMPUTER, TANDY 1600. I PLAY PONG ON IT. I'M ON THE EDGE, BABY. "VEEP" PREMIERS ON HBO THIS SUNDAY.
THE 22nd.
Jon: APRIL 22. 10:00 P.M.
