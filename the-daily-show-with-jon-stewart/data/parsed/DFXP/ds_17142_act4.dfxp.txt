SO NICE TO SEE MR. CORDDRY. THAT'S OUR SHOW. HERE'S THE DEAL. WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK WE WILL BE AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL  CONVENTION IN TAMPA. JUST A QUICK PROGRAMMING NOTE, WE ARE ON TUESDAY NIGHTS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT  DURING THE CONVENTION WEEK BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AND CONFUSING  AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR REGULAR FANS. YOU'RE WELCOME. (LAUGHTER)
HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN
