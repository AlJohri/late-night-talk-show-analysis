Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR WHOSE NEW FILM IS CALLED "THE CHANGE-UP."
I'M NOT MITCH.
WHAT?
I'M MITCH.
SOMEHOW WE SWITCHED BODIES.
I'M DAVE.
OH.
WE PISSED IN A MAGIC FOUNTAIN AND NEXT DAY IT DISAPPEARED.
AND THEN WE WERE LOOKING FOR --
AND WHEN THEY FIND IT WE'RE GOING TO SWITCH BACK.
BECAUSE WE WERE DRINKING.
WE WERE DRINKING.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. CAN YOU GET THE TWINS.
PUMPKIN.
MITCH, NO, NO, DON'T CALL ME PUMPKIN, OKAY. YOU PROMISED ME THAT YOU WOULD --
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW JASON BATEMAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SEEK IT IN. SOAK IT IN. VERY NICE. VERY NICE. EYE --
YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO PRETTY.
Jon: AND CAN I SAY SOMETHING, YOU ARE PRETTY. DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU --
DID WE GET THAT ON THE CAMERAS.
Jon: YOU CAUGHT IT. YOU CAN TiVo IT AND FREEZE IT. JUST KNOW IT CAME FROM HERE AND HERE. JUST KNOW THAT. [LAUGHTER] LET ME ASK YOU THIS THE SWITCH, YOU AND RYAN REYNOLDS, IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU SWITCH NOTHING CHANGES. YOU ARE BOTH VERY HAND SOME MEN WITH GOOD PERSONALITIES. YOU WOULD SWITCH WITH HIM AND GIRLS WOULD STILL --
YOU ARE ALL AROUND IT. IT'S CRAP. THE MOVIE IS GARBAGE. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS WHAT I'M GOING TO PROMISE YOU. WHILE IT IS A TIRED, SOME WOULD SAY PLEASANTLY FAMILIAR PREMISE.
Jon: PLEASANTLY FAMILIAR, THANK YOU WITH VERY ENGAGING ACTORS AND A LOVELY INGENUE.
AND A 12-PACK BETWEEN US. OUR OBLIGATION IS TO PLEASE YOU POST SWITCH. WE KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO PEE IN A MAGIC FOUNTAIN. YOU ARE SAYING ENTERTAIN ME AFTER THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. WE DO IT THE R RATED VERSION. THE OTHER FILMS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD. LIKE FATHER LIKE SON, THE SLAUGHTER VEHICLE THING YOU MENTIONED, LINDSAY LOHAN THING. WHEN YOU SWITCH BODIES WITH SOMEBODY AND YOU GET INTO DODGY SITUATIONS AND THEY ARE ALL  UNDER THE CAPITAL R CATEGORY.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT I THINK YOU ARE SAYING. THESE ARE TWO MEN SWITCHING. THESE ARE NOT BOYS SWITCHING. YOU USED TO LIKE YATZHEE AND NOW YOU LIKE -- (bleep) THIS IS LIKE OH, MY GOD YOU ARE TAKING  ME ANDALLY. -- ANALLY THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.
Jon: I'M TELLING YOU. I LIKE WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE. YOU DO IT EFFORTLESSLY AND IT'S WHAT I RESPECT AND ADMIRE ABOUT YOU. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I RAN INTO YOU -- YOU THINK THIS IS A CHARM AND WITT AND INTELLIGENCE HE BRINGS TO A  TELEVISION SHOW.
IT'S REAL.
Jon: STOP IT. I RAN INTO THIS MAN ON THE STREETS, STREETS OF NEW YORK WHERE YOU DON'T TRUST ANYONE.
I WAS SUPPLEMENTING MY INCOME.
Jon: STOP. AND HE BROUGHT THE SAME AMOUNT -- WE DID A SEGMENT ON THE STREET. I COULD HAVE THROWN TO COMMERCIAL TWICE. PEOPLE STAYED WITH IT.
THIS GUY WAS ON HIS WAY --
Jon: I PARTIED. HE SAW ME --
I MENTIONED CAPITAL R RATING. THIS GUY --
Jon: TELL THEM WHAT I WAS UP TO.
THE WIFE AND KIDS WERE OUT OF TOWN.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.
IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT. THE SUN WAS BEAUTIFULLY RESTING IN THE RIVER. AND THIS HELLCAT WAS ON HIS WAY TO NOT ONE SLICE BUT TWO SLICES OF PIZZA.
Jon: TELL THEM WHAT ONE OF THEM WAS. ONE WAS PLAIN BUT ONE WAS --
MUSHROOM!
Jon: MOTHER (bleep) BOOYA. ATE THEM BOTH! BOTH!
COME ON!
Jon: BOTH SAME SITTING. THAT'S WHAT I DID. IT
IT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY TRIP. RIGHT THERE AT THE TAIL END OF MY TRIP.
Jon: I ENJOYED IT. IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
Jon: WE DO A LITTLE Q AND A IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW AND A GENTLEMAN ASKED ME IF JASON  BATEMAN WOULD BE ON THE SHOW. I KNOW YOU MIGHT GET TIRED OF THIS. HE ENJOYS YOUR WORK IN ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE'S A MOVIE COMING OUT THAT WOULD CONTINUE THE NARRATIVE ART, THE  CHARACTERS, THAT TYPE OF THING. HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THAT IS IN THE WORKS.
THE MOVIE, YES IS IN THE WORKS. HOWEVER. --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHOW FEEL LIKE REAL TOOLS WHEN WE'RE ASKED  THIS QUESTION WHICH WE'RE ASKED OFTEN AND WE WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER IT. BUT THERE'S NEVER A SIGNIFICANT UPDATE. THAT DOESN'T STOP THE FRINGE MEDIA, PRESENT COMPANY EXCLUDED --
THANK YOU SIR.
SAYING THERE'S NO UPDATE TO WRITING A HEADLINE BATEMAN TALKS  ABOUT ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. I HESITATE TO ANSWER BUT I WILL SAY WE WILL MAKE THIS MOVIE, THE SECOND THEY MAKE THE BOSSES DEAL  HIS NAME IS MITCH. HE'S THE GENIUS. I HOPE THEY GIVE HIM EVERYTHING HE IS ASKING FOR BECAUSE THE MAN IS THE SECOND COMING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'LL SAY THIS TO YOU THE CHANGEUP IS IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. YOU GIVE THAT GUY EVERYTHING HE WANTED INCLUDING A MUSHROOM SLICE. THROW IT IN FOR
