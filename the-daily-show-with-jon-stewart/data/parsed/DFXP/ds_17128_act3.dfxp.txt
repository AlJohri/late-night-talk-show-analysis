A WHOLE LOT, MAN. MOVIES --
Jon: YOU ARE A KILLER WHO STRIPS AT NIGHT.
IT'S A ROMANTIC COMEDY. RIGHT AFTER THAT SCENE I BREAK INTO SONG AND DANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT HAPPENED. YOU SAID ONE OF US WAS GOING TO BE SHIRTLESS. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE YOU.
Jon: ARE YOU -- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. BECAUSE YOU ARE USUALLY BIGGER THAN ME BUT I FEEL LIKE AM I MISSING -- YOU SEEM -- THAT'S A  BIG SUIT. ARE YOU WEARING A BIG SUIT. WHAT IS GOING ON?
IT'S BACK HERE. IT'S SEWED UP.
Jon: OH, MY GOD -- WHAT IS GOING -- ARE YOU OKAY? WHAT IS --
I LOST 16 POUNDS YOU NEED TO LOSE ANOTHER 15.
Jon: YOU SEEM FAT.
IT'S FOR WORK, ACTUALLY. I HAVE SOMETHING COMING UP IN MIDDLE SEPTEMBER PLAYING A REAL LIFE GUY NAMED RON WOODDRUF. IN THE EATS 80s IN DALLAS WAS A HETEROSEXUAL GUY, A ELECTRICIAN GOT H.I.V. NOT SURE HOW HE DID IT. SOME TIME HE SPENT WITH LADIES AND DOING SOME DRUGS.
Jon: THIS IS FOR A ROLE.
THIS IS FOR A ROLE.
Jon: THANK GOD BECAUSE I THOUGHT. YOU GET AN ACTOR ON THE SHOW AND THEY ARE LIKE I'VE DECIDE I'M  ONLY GOING TO GET ASPARAGUS. ACTORS CAN BE A LITTLE --, YOU KNOW?
NO, NO, NO,.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER DONE SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAD TO PHYSICALLY TRANSFORM.
I'M USUALLY BETWEEN 178 AND 200.
Jon: YOU AND I SHARE SO MUCH EXCEPT THE HEIGHT NECESSARY TO PULL THAT OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] AS SOON AS YOU SAID THAT RANGE I WAS LIKE WOW THAT'S ON MY MEDICAL RECORDS, TOO. I NEED TO START EATING ASPARAGUS. THIS MOVIE RIGHT HERE. FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU ARE GETTING THE ENERGY YOU GOT, TWO KIDS, ANOTHER ONE ON  THE WAY. MAGIC MIKE, KILLER JOE YOU ARE WORKING ON THIS OTHER THING. ARE YOU FEELING LIKE THIS IS THE MOST FERTILE TIME OF YOUR CAREER?
FERTILE IS THE WORD.
Jon: IN EVERY WAY SHAPE AND FORM.
THINGS ARE STICKING EVERYWHERE.
Jon: EVERYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH.
Jon: IS IT FOR YOU -- SETTLE DOWN, PEOPLE. I'LL HAVE THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THIS ALL WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, YOU ARE TAKING ON MORE AND MORE CHALLENGING ROLES. YOU COME OUT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE PARTS OF AN ACTORS CAREER. YOU COME OUT, YOU ARE A STAR. YOU ARE IN THESE -- NOW YOU ARE DOING ALL THE REALLY INTERESTING -- IS THAT A  CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO BRANCH OUT AND CHALLENGE YOURSELF WITH OTHER THING?
YEAH, YEAH THE SCRIPTS I WAS GETTING TWO YEARS AGO EVERYTHING  I READ I WAS LIKE OKAY I DID A VERSION AFTER THIS BEFORE. THINGS THAT WERE NEW I THOUGHT I COULD DO THAT TOMORROW. IT'S NOT A BAD THING. LET'S GO BACK, WORK ON FAMILY, MAKE SOME OTHER THINGS STICK. [ LAUGHTER ] TAKE OUR TIME AND WAIT UNTIL WE GET SOMETHING THAT ARRESTS ME A LITTLE BIT, SCARES ME A LITTLE BIT. THESE FIVE INDEPENDENTS CAME BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK. ALL THE ROLES WERE VERY DIFFERENT. THEY ALL WERE CHASHTS THAT REALLY DON'T PANDER OR PLACATE  TO ANYBODY'S RULES BY THEIR OWN, A SINGULAR-WILLED CHARACTERS THAT I WAS A LITTLE BIT SCARED OF BUT I WAS GOING TO DIVE IN  AND COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE AND FIGURE OUT WHO THE GUY IS. THEY WERE ALL GOOD DIRECTORS. NONE OF DIRECTORS ARE GOING TO SAY LET'S BRING IT BACK TO  CONVENTION, LET'S PLAY IT SAFER.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE LEARNED MORE IN THIS STRETCH THAN YOU HAD THROUGH THE  PREVIOUS BLOCK OF TIME IN YOUR CAREER?
HHHHMMMM -- I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE BEEN LEARNED MORE. BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE CHAINS OFF WITH THE ROLES AND THE PEOPLE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. I'VE LEARNED THAT IT'S KIND OF SAME WAY MAKING A FILM WHEN IT'S  GREAT LIKE THE VERY FIRST FILM I DID "DAZED AND CONFUSED."
Jon: GREAT FILM.
RICHARD LINKLETTER. I LEARNED IN THAT HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE, SHOW UP. HE LIKE MANY OF THESE DIRECTORS CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN DO YOUR WORK. EVERYONE GIVES THINGS. YOU STEAL THINGS. IT'S A GREAT TO BE STOLEN FROM ON A SET AND IT'S A SAFE PLACE TO COME AND PLAY.
Jon: I'VE NOT HEARD IT'S A SAFE PLACE TO BE STOLEN FROM AND  THAT USED TO BE, IN FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE MOTTO OF NEW YORK CITY. THEN WE CHANGED IT TO THE BIG APPLE.
IT'S THE --
Jon: COME HERE AND LET US TAKE YOUR (bleep) WAS THE ORIGINAL. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE GUYS DOING NICE THINGS, TRYING THINGS. KILLER JOE IS A HELL OF A MOVIE.
