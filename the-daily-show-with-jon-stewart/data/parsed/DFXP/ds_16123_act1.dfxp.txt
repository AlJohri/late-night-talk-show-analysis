FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OH, MY GOSH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. BILL O'REILLY, MY OLD FRIEND BY O'REILLY IS GOING TO BE ON THE  PROGRAM, AN I'LL SAY IT RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN WATCH THE REST OF IT ON THE WEB. THAT'S RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] AS WE SAY IN THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD, [BLEEPED]. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE BEGIN... WE DON'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT. [LAUGHTER] VERY RESPECTFUL IN THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE REPUBLICAN FIELD FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WHICH DESPITE NOW  BOASTING NO FEWER THAN EIGHT VIABLE CANDIDATES AND NEWT GINGRICH HAS STILL LEFT THE  REPUBLICAN BASE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES, BUT ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES LOOKING FOR THEM? IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S INDECISION 2012 INDECISION EDITION. CHRIS CHRISTIE, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND PART-TIME BOBBY BAKALA IMPERSONATOR SPOKE LAST  NIGHT AT THE HOLIEST SITE IN REPUBLICANISM, THE REAGAN LIBRARY, AND WAS PROPOSITIONED  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.
ARE YOU RECONSIDERING OR ARE YOU STANDING FIRM?
LISTEN, I'LL BE REALLY SUCCINCT ABOUT THIS. I SAW SOMETHING GREAT ON THE POLITICAL WEB SITE, AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE AN ADVERTISER FOR  PLITICO, BUT THEY PUT 1:353 OF MY ANSWERS BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK. EVERYONE GO TO POLITICO.COM. IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE. CLICK ON IT. THOSE ARE THE ANSWERS.
Jon: OH, IT'S LIKE A TREASURE HUNT. I LOVE IT. IT'S LIKE A LIVE LINKING TO ANOTHER WEB SITE. FOLLOW THE CLUES AND REVEAL THE SECRET MESSAGE.
YOU'RE STILL SAYING CATEGORICALLY NOT RUNNING.
I'M NOT RUNNING. I'M 100% CERTAIN I'M NOT GOING TO RUN.
I DON'T WANT THE RUN. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M READY TO RUN. FIRST IN YOUR HEART YOU HAVE TO WANT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I DON'T WANT IT THAT BADLY.
Jon:, INSECURITIABLE. WHEN URGED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, CHRIS CHRISTIE POINTS PEOPLE TO A TWO-MINUTE MONTAGE OF UNEQUIVOCAL, NO, I AM NOT RUNNING. INTERPRET THAT FOR US, OH GREAT POLITICAL PUNDITS.
NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE APPEARS TO LEAVE THE DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN.
CHRISTIE LEFT THE DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN.
FOR HIMSELF.
CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS LEFT THE DOOR OPEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY.
JUST A SLIVER OPEN. HE LEFT A LITTLE SLIVER OPEN.
CHRISTIE'S COMMENTS ESPECIALLY ARE A RORSCHACH TEST, SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE, HEAR WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.
YOU HEAR WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. EVERYONE ELSE HEARS, I'M NOT RUNNING. A RORSCHACH TEST? YEAH, YEAH, IT'S A RORSCHACH TEST. IT'S A RORSCHACH TEST. TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE. WHAT DO YOU SEE? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WAS THAT A BUTTERFLY HUMPING A MONGOOSE? [LAUGHTER] HE SAID NO. AND IF I REMEMBER FROM MY FRESHMAN DORM ORIENTATION CORRECTLY, NO MEANS NO! SO BACK UP, NO, OH, COME ON, BABY, CAN'T WE JUST FORM AN EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE. COME ON, LET ME TOUCH YOUR SUPER PAC. NO CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS GIVEN YOU HIS ANSWER. STOP GRINDING UP AGAINST HIM AND ASKING IF YOU CAN JUST PUT THE TIP IN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SON OF A BITCH. AT LEAST NOT ALL PUNDITS WERE BLINDED BY THEIR DESIRE TO SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.
I THINK THAT WE CAN TAKE GOVERNOR CHRISTIE AT HIS WORD. I THINK HE KIND OF PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF SPECULATION THAT HE WOULD RUN BY THE  ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE MADE TODAY.
AND IF I WERE THE MEDIA I WOULD BY GOSH GO BACK THE LAVISHING UNWARRANTED ATTENTION  ON OTHER POSSIBLE NON-CANDIDATES WHO HAVE SENT MAYBE MORE MIXED MESSAGES. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S SARAH PALIN WEARING WHAT APPEARED TO BE A VEST MADE FROM  THE PELT OF A COOKIE MONSTER SHE SHOT FROM A HELICOPTER. [LAUGHTER] COULD BE... COULD BE FOUND ON FOX LITERALLY LESS THAN A MINUTE AFTER CHRIS CHRISTIE HAD SPOKEN. LIKE AN ALARM WENT OFF THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE. TO REASSURE THE NATION THAT NOT EVERY POSSIBLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAD MADE A CLEAR DECISION.
OKAY. FOR LOGISTICAL REASONS, THOUGH, CERTAINLY DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE. THROUGH MY PROCESSION OF DECISION MAKING WITH MY FAMILY AND WITH MY CLOSE FRIENDS AS TO  WHETHER I SHOULD THROW MY NAME IN THE HAT FOR THE GOP NOMINATION OR NOT FOR 2012, IS A  TITLE WORTH IT?
Jon: I GET IT. IS IT WORTH THE SCRUTINY ON YOUR FAMILY, THE INCREDIBLE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS THE  PRESIDENCY OF THESE UNITED STATES, THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD LITERALLY ON YOUR SHOULDERS. THAT'S REASONABLE AND I AM ASSUMING I AM CORRECT IN MY ASSESSMENT OF YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS.
IS A TITLE WORTH IT? DOES A TITLE SHACKLE A PERSON? ARE THEY, SOMEONE LIKE ME, WHO IS A MAVERICK, I DO GO ROGUE AND I CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT, AND I  DON'T MIND STIRRING IT UP IN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK AND DEBATE AGGRESSIVELY AND TO FIND  SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT OUR COUNTRY IS FACING. THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONSOLATION PIECE IN MY PROCESSION. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE BIGGEST CONTEMPLATION PIECE IN YOUR PROCESS IS THAT BECOMING THE  PRESIDENT WOULD DIMINISH YOUR POWER? IT'S NOT THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE PRESIDENCY, IT'S THAT THAT  BALLPARK AIN'T BIG ENOUGH TO CONTAIN YOUR AWESOMENESS. THE PRESIDENCY WOULD LIMIT YOU HOW?
DOES A TITLE TAKE AWAY MY FREEDOM TO CALL IT LIKE I SEE IT AND TO AFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE  THAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY? DOES THAT PROHIBIT ME FROM BEING OUT THERE, OUT OF A BOX, NOT ALLOWING HANDLERS TO SHAPE ME  AND TO FORCE MY MESSAGE TO BE WHAT DONORS OR WHAT CONTRIBUTORS OR WHAT POLITICAL PUNDITS WANT  IT TO BE.
Jon: YOU'D BE THE [BLEEPED] PRESIDENT. YOU WOULD BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF HISTORY'S GREATEST FIGHTING FORCE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT... WHAT... WHAT POSSIBLY DO YOU MEAN? AND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND, I AM NOT TRYING TO TALK YOU INTO RUNNINGFUL -- RUNNING. [LAUGHTER] BY MOST PEOPLE'S STANDARDS, THE PRESIDENCY IS ONE OF THE HIGHER-LEVEL POSITIONS WE HAVE  IN THIS COUNTRY. PERHAPS I AM NOT GIVING YOUR RENEGADE ALASKAN BIRD SPIRIT ENOUGH CREDIT. [LAUGHTER] WHAT PAILIN WISDOM WOULD A PRESIDENTIAL RUN SILENCE? I KNOW YOU'RE A BIG DEAL, YOU'RE A FORMER GOVERNOR AND YOU STARRED ON A SHOW ON THE SAME  NETWORK THAT HAS BROUGHT US THREE SHOWS ABOUT DWARFS. [LAUGHTER] BUT, IF I MAY, YOU SPENT YOUR SUMMER VACATION ON A CONSTITUTION-WRAPPED BUS THAT  YOU SIGNED SHUTTLING BETWEEN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, GIVING SPEECHES LIKE THIS?
I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT MY PLAN IS.
I WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE OF OBAMA'S MANIPULATION OF U.S. SUPPLIES OF ENERGY, DRILL HERE, DRILL NOW. I SUPPOSE TO ELIMINATE ALL FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX.
Jon: HERE'S THE THING. YOU COULD HAVE A COLORFUL BUS AND DRIVE TO EARLY PRIMARY STATES OR GO AROUND TELLING  PEOPLE WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT, BUT WHEN YOU PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER, THERE'S  REALLY ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES. YOU ARE EITHER RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR YOU ARE A CRAZY PERSON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
