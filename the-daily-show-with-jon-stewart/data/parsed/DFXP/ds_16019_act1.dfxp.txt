FEBRUARY 2, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
HEY, WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. WE HAVE ON OUR PROGRAM TONIGHT, MATTHEW PERRY, THE WRITER, DIRECTOR, STAR OF "MATHEW PERRY'S DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN."  HE IS-- I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S TYLER PERRY. I APOLOGIZE. AND, YET, I PLAN TO CHANGE NONE OF MY QUESTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) AS YOU KNOW, TODAY IS GROUNDHOG DAY WHICH MEANS WE GET TO FIND  OUT HOW MUCH LONGER THIS BRUTAL PICTURE WILL LAST. WE'LL QUICKLY TAKE A LOOK AT A PICTURE OF PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL AND SEE IF HE SAW HIS SHADOW. OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD ( LAUGHTER ) I GUESS THAT MEANS SIX MORE YEARS OF WINTER. AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO GROUNDHOG. WE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE "MESS  O' SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT O' POTAMIA" ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER SIX DAYS OF PEACEFUL  PROTESTS IN EGYPT, 30-YEAR PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK FINALLY TOOK TO THE AIRWAVES ON TUESDAY NIGHT.
I WAS NEVER, EVER INTERESTED IN BEING A DICTATOR.
Jon:  I JUST KNEW AS A CHILD I WANT THE TO OPPRESS PEOPLE. BUT I DIDN'T MAYBE BE AN ASSISTANT MANAGER NOBODY LIKES, AN UNREASONABLY STRICT TEACHER. BUT TO BE HERE ( BLEEP ) OVER YOU PEOPLE, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE. ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT, WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN? I DON'T REMEMBER. ( LAUGHTER ) HOSE ME, ARE YOU STAYING OR ARE YOU GOING?
I TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, AND REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT I DID NOT  INTEND TO RUN FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL TERM BECAUSE I HAVE SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN MY LIFE  SERVING EGYPT AND ITS PEOPLE.
Jon:  EGYPT, YOU CAN'T FIRE ME, I QUIT BECAUSE YOU'RE A BUNCH OF STUPIDHEADS. STUPID. ( LAUGHTER ) THE TAKEAWAY IS, HE'S LEAVING. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HEARD. THEY CAN ALL HEAD BACK TO THEIR LIVES, THE NEW MUBARAK-LESS CABINET BEGIN THE DEMOCRATIC  REFORM PROGRESS.
( translated ):  I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPERVISE THE NEW GOVERNMENT ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU'VE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE, HAVE YOU? THIS IS NOT THE PART WHERE YOU STAY. THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU TAKE A BUNCH OF GOLD BRICKS, MAYBE A PRICELESS ARTIFACT, AND HOP A  PLANE TO DUBAI. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD.
YOU HAVE NOW PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES OF BOTH SIDES THROWING ROCKS, THROWING BOTTLES.
AS NIGHT FELL, WE STARTED HEARING HEAVY GUNFIRE.
INCENDIARY DEVICES BEING LAUNCHED OFF THE TOP OF THAT BUILDING. THAT IS A VERY OMINOUS FEELING.
STAMPEDING AND ATTACKING SOME OF THE ANTI-MUBARAK PROTESTERS, ON CAM EXPEL HORSEBACK.
Jon:  I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THE PRO-MUBARAK DEMONSTRATORS SEEM TO BE  SLIGHTLY MORE ORGANIZED AND ARMED AND HAVE HORSES ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT A SPONTANEOUS ERUPTION OF  PRO-MUBARAK SENTIMENT FROM EMPED EGYPTIANS TRAINED IN THE ART OF WHIP-BASED CROWD CONTROL  ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
WE WERE SET UPON BY PRO-MUBARAK SUPPORTERS PUNCHING US IN THE HEAD. THE CROWD GET THROWING MORE PUNCHES, KICKS. SUDDENLY A YOUNG MAN WOULD COME UP, LOOK AT YOU, AND THEN PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, HOSNI, NOW YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. HANDS OFF ANDERSON COOPER. THERE IS NOT TO BE A CIVILRY WISP OUT OF PLACE ON THAT MAN'S GLORIOUS HEAD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON, THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO IS  ALLOWED TO PHYSICALLY ASSAULT ANDERSON COOPER.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I PUNCHED YOU?
IT'S LIKE THE SIXTH TIME ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  AND EVEN SHE IS GRANTED THE HONOR BUT ONCE A YEAR. FOR MORE ON THE UNFOLDING SITUATION IN EGYPT, WE GO LIVE TO ASIF MANDVI IN CAIRO.
THANK YOU, JON, THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE IN EGYPT, THE SITUATION --
I'M JUST GOING TO INTERRUPT VERY QUICKLY. ARE YOU NOT IN EGYPT ( LAUGHTER ).
NO, IT'S EGYPT, I'M IN EGYPT.
Jon:  ASIF, I SEE THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL BILLION BEHIND YOU. THAT CAPITOL DOME--
OKAY, I AT THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY THAT IS TECHNICALLY EGYPT. DISPL YOU WERE --
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN EGYPT-EGYPT.
JON, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE TURNED ON THE NEWS LATELY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT IS ( BLEEP ) CRAZY IN EGYPT RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE PUNCHING COOPER, AND HE'S ARMED! ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  HE'S GOT A GUN?
TWO OF THEM. ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA. OH, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  HOW ARE YOU GONNA-- HE HAS BEEN WORKING OUT. HOW ARE GOING TO THEN COVER-UP THE PROTESTS?
WELL, THERE ARE SOME HERE AND THEY'RE PRETTY INTENSE, TOO. TAKE A LOOK.
HEY, HEY HO-HO.
I WAIT WADED INTO THE PROTESTS OUTSIDE OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON TO  UNDERSTAND THE GLOBALLINGS IS OF THIS REVOLUTION.
WE WANT A DEMOCRACY. WE WANT SOMETHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE IN.
HE NEEDS TO STEP DOWN RIGHT NOW.
STEP DOWN RIGHT NOW?
THIS VERY MINUTE.
AND THEN WHO WILL AMERICA PUT IN HIS PLACE? WE WON'T HAVE TIME--
THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO PUT SOMEONE IN HIS PLACE. THAT'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICANS VERY NERVOUS.
DO YOU WANT TO TELL US WE ARE NOT ADULT ENOUGH TO CHOOSE OUR  COUNTRY-- TO CHOOSE OUR LEADER?
HOW ABOUT THIS-- WE GET TO PICK YOUR CANDIDATE BUT YOU GET TO VOTE.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
OKAY, WE WON'T PICK YOUR CANDIDATES ALONE. ISRAEL WILL HELP. HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW WHO WE'RE EALING ABOUT?D HOW CAN AMERICANS BE SURE WE CAN  TRUST THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE.
TRUST THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE?
Reporter: ARE YOU TRUSTWORTHY OR ARE YOU NOT TRUSTWORTHY?
I'M TRUSTWORTHY.
THAT IS WHAT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY WOULD SAY. YOUR AMERICAN SIDE HAS TO BE SAYING I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST THE EGYPTIAN SIDE. FINISH THIS SENTENCE FOR ME, "BLANK TO AMERICA."
UHM... GO, AMERICA.
GO, AMERICA. LIKE, GET LOST, GO AWAY.
NO, GO, AMERICA BUT ADJUST JUR POLICY ON EGYPT.
ADJUST YOUR POLICY?
ADJUST YOUR POLICY. I THINK OBAMA--
THAT SOUNDS LEEK A VEILED THREAT. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS REVOLUTION ARE CLEAR.
WILL THE VOID LEAVE ROOM FOR RADICAL ISLAM?
IS IT AN ISLAMIC EGYPT?
WILL THERE BE MORE RADICALS TAKE OVER.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE ARABS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE ISLAM BROTHERHOOD.
I AM CRIN.
ARE YOU CHRISTIAN YOU LOOK MUSLIM-Y TO ME. MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR NAME MAYBE YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO, LIKE, CHUCK.
IT'S ALL ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, AND PEOPLE LIKE JEWS OR CHRISTIANS OR MUSLIM, WE ALL HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS.
WHERE NOW CAN AMERICA SENDS ITS PRISONERS TO MAKE SURE THEY GET TORTURED PROPERLY IF WE  DON'T SEND THEM TO EGYPT ANYMORE?
IT'S VERY SIMPLE-- THEY BEEN OWN OPEN A NEW GUANTANAMO BAY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDWEST.
OBVIOUSLY, THESE PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HOW A DEMOCRACY REALLY WORKS. BUT HOPEFULLY, THEY CAN LEARN
