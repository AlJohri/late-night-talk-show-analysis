SEPTEMBER 26, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUESTS TONIGHT TEXAS CONGRESSMAN AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER RON  PAUL WILL BE JOINING US. ( APPLAUSE ) ON THE SHOW. I'M SORRY. I MEANT RICK SANTORUM WILL BE HERE. I APOLOGIZE. QUITE DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON THAT. IT'S LIKE WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE FULL OF TEACHERS OF THE YEAR. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: PLAYING HOOKY FROM WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. CAN THEIR BE TRUANCY FROM A TEACHER OF THE YEAR CONFERENCE? "A DOG ATE MY CONFERENCE SCHEDULE." ANYWAY CONGRESSMAN PAUL, OF  COURSE, TURNING IN ANOTHER FINE PERFORMANCE LAST THURSDAY WHEN THE REPUBLICAN  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES GATHERED IN FLORIDA FOR THE FOX NEWS GOOGLE DEBATE. THE 83rd SUCH DEBATE SO FAR THIS YEAR FOLLOWING OF COURSE THE PREVIOUS CNN TEA PARTY  DEBATE, THE REAGAN LIBRARY DEBATE, THE HISTORY CHANNEL CIVIL WAR RECREATIONIST DEBATE, THE TRON DEBATE. THE "ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK" DEBATE, AND THE "DON'T  TELL RICK SANTORUM WE'RE CANCELING THE DEBATE" DEBATE. BY THE WAY, SANTORUM... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YEAH. SANTORUM STILL CAME IN FIFTH IN THAT DEBATE. THINGS AREN'T GOING HIS WAY. SO WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY LEARN ABOUT THE CANDIDATES DURING THEIR THIRD DEBATE IN 15 DAYS? PROBABLY NOTHING. BUT THE AUDIENCE CONTINUES TO SURPRISE.
IN 2010 WHEN I WAS DEPLOYED TO IRAQ I HAD TO LIE ABOUT WHO I WAS BECAUSE I'M A GAY SOLDIER. I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB. MY QUESTION IS, UNDER ONE OF YOUR PRESIDENCIES, DO YOU INTEND TO CIRCUMVENT THE  PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE FOR GAY AND LESBIAN SOLDIERS IN THE MILITARY?
(AUDIENCE: (BOOING).
Jon: YEAH, BOO. I GIVE THE AUDIENCE CREDIT. IT TAKES A LOT OF BALLS TO BOO A GUY WHO CAN STICK YOUR HEAD IN HIS BICEPS AND CRACK IT  LIKE A WALNUT. LOOK AT THOSE THINGS. THOSE AREN'T BICPEPS. IF I'M SURE IF THIS GUY TURNED INTO THE HULK, HIS ARMS WOULD STAY THE SAME SIZE. THEY WOULD JUST TURN GREEN. BUT OF COURSE RICK SANTORUM HANDLED THIS UGLY INCIDENT BEAUTIFULLY. NO, HE DID NOT CHASTISE ANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE CROWD FOR THEIR DISGRACEFUL OUTBURSTS, BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE DON'T ASK DON'T TELL.
THAT POLICY WOULD BE REINSTITUTED. AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN, I WOULD NOT THROW THEM OUT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR  TO THEM BECAUSE OF THE POLICY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. BUT WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD IN CONFORMITY WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE PAST WHICH  WAS SEX IS NOT AN ISSUE. IT SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE. LEAVE IT ALONE. KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. WHETHER YOU'RE HETEROSEXUAL OR HOMOSEXUAL.
Jon: WHAT PLANET DO YOU (BEEP) LIVE ON? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HONESTLY. WHAT PLANET? THAT SEX IS NOT AN ISSUE? YES, THE ARMY HAS NEVER MENTIONED SPOUSES HETEROSEXUAL OR HOMOSEXUAL. WE NEED TO GO BACK TO AN ARMY WHERE SOLDIERS NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. LIKE THIS CHANT: I DON'T KNOW KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD ESKIMO GENITALIA ARE MIGHTY COLD. THE CLASSIC AIRCRAFT, THE MEMPHIS PAT. AND THE PLANE THAT DROPPED THE ATOMIC BOMB, THE ENOLA "NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS."  THE GUY IS AN IDIOT. NO DISRESPECT. AHEAD OF RICK PERRY, PERRY HAD MOSTLY STUMBLED THROUGH THE TWO PREVIOUS DEBATES YET  RETAINED HIS FRONTRUNNER STATUS. WOULD THE THIRD TIME BE THE CHARM?
I THINK AMERICANS JUST DON'T KNOW SOMETIMES WHICH MITT ROMNEY THEY'RE DEALING WITH. IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT WAS ON THE SIDE OF AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT QUALIFY HE  WAS FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT? WAS IT BEFORE HE WAS BEFORE THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HE WAS FOR  STANDING UP FOR ROE VERSUS WADE BEFORE HE WAS AGAINST ROE VERSUS WADE? HE WAS FOR RACE TO THE TOP. HE'S FOR OBAMA CARE AND NOW HE'S AGAINST IT. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: MITT NAILED IT. CAN'T BELIEVE MY ADVISORS TOLD ME NOT TO GET HIGH BEFORE THIS DEBATE. I'M TELLING YOU. I'M KILLING HIM. HOLY (BEEP). IF I'M ROMNEY, I DON'T EVEN ANSWER. I JUST CEDE MY TIME BACK TO RICK PERRY. "NO, NO, I CEDE BACK TO PERRY. HE'S DOING GREAT. KEEP GOING." THE THIRD PERRY DEBATE WAS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST TWO. PERRY DEMONSTRATING AN INCREDIBLE UNLEARNING CURVE. HEY, MAN, IT'S EARLY. NO HARM. NO FOUL.
RICK PERRY IS NOT PREPARED FOR THE PRESSURE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL STAGE.
YOU CAN REPLACE HIM WITH A CARDBOARD CUT OUT AND NOT NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE.
PERRY DID HORRIBLE AT THIS DEBATE.
RICK PERRY SUCKED THE OTHER NIGHT.
YOU CAN READ IT ANY OF THOSE THREE WAYS. PERRY REALLY DID THROW UP ALL OVER HIMSELF AT THE DEBATE AT A TIME WHEN HE NEEDED TO RAISE  HIS GAME.
Jon: EVERYTHING HUME SAYS HAS GRAVITAS EVEN WHEN HE'S SAYING, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, CHRIS, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME. REALLY IN MY ESTIMATION THE TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY REALLY HAD DIARRHEA IN HIS OWN HAIR. HE REALLY LOOKED LIKE HE HELD IT UP FOR THE CROWD IN TERMS OF... LOOK, LOOK. LOOK AT MY POOP PANTS. THAT WAS AT A TIME WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THE GOVERNOR REALLY NEEDED TO JUST ANSWER  THE QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF TAKING A DUMP IN HIS OWN PANTS. PERRY IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. I GUESS ONCE AGAIN ROMNEY IS IS THE FRONTRUNNER.
ALSO ONCE AGAIN WE'RE HEARING THOSE CALLS FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE TO JUMP INTO THE RACE.
RENEWED TALKS THAT NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE MIGHT VERY WELL JUMP IN THE RACE.
DOUBTS ABOUT PERRY FUELING A NEW PUSH TO GET CHRIS CHRISTIE IN THE RACE.
Jon: YOU WANT TO ADD ANOTHER CANDIDATE? IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS A SEASON OF AMERICAN IDOL IN REVERSE. WHERE EVERY WEEK WE JUST ADD SOME OTHER IDIOT. ALL THAT'S MISSING IS THE HUMILIATING AUDITION WHERE THE CONTESTANT MANGLES ONE OF YOUR  FAVORITE SONGS. ♪ OUT OVER THE... ♪♪
Jon: THAT HURTS ME. FIRST YOU GUYS WANTED BACHMANN AND THEN PERRY. NOW KRISTIE. YOU KNOW WHAT? REPUBLICAN BASE, MEET ME AT CAMERA 3. HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT MAYBE YOUR CANDIDATES AREN'T THE PROBLEM. MAYBE IT'S YOU. YOU SEEM HARD TO PLEASE, TO FIGURE OUT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YOU'RE UNREALISTIC. I MEAN, YOU'RE PRO-LIFE YET....
YOUR STATE HAS EXECUTED 234 DEATH ROW INMATES, MORE THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNOR IN MODERN TIMES. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT WAS THAT? YOU'RE AFRAID OF DEATH PANELS YET FOR UNINSURED COMA PATIENTS....
ARE YOU SAYING THAT SOCIETY SHOULD JUST LET HIM DIE?
AUDIENCE: YES.
Jon: THAT'S THE CROWD, YEAH! YOU GUYS SUPPORT THE TROOPS. WELL EXCEPT FOR CAPTAIN CREATINE OVER HERE. IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICAN BASE IS AT WAR WITH ITS OWN TALKING POINTS. I WANT SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO CUT TAXES AND BALANCE THE BUDGET. SOMEONE WHO IS A KILLED ORATOR BUT DOESN'T TALK ALL FANCY. THE CHILD OF POOR IMMIGRANTS WHO WILL BUILD A FENCE TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. SOMEONE WHO'S STRONG ENOUGH FOR A MAN BUT PH BALANCED FOR A WOMAN. SOMEONE WHO WILL ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES BUT NOT SHOW THEIR ARMS. I FEEL LIKE IF THIS MAN CAME ALONG TODAY THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE WOULD BE, I DON'T  REALLY GO FOR THOSE HOLLYWOOD TYPES. IT'S LIKE YOUR IDEAL CANDIDATE IS A RARE SUPER HEAVY ELEMENT THAT COULD ONLY EXIST IN A  PARTICULAR PARTICLE ACCELERATOR. AND EVEN THEN ONLY FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND. BEFORE YOU ALL REMEMBERED HOW MUCH YOU HATE SCIENCE. YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK IN THE MIRROR. YOU NEED TO TAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND NOT COME AWAY THINKING THERE'S  SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS MIRROR. AND NOW YOU WANT CHRIS CHRISTIE. SURE YOU DO.
THE FOLKS WHO CRITICIZED MY APPOINTMENTS OF MOHAMMED ARE IGNORANT, ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT  OF THAT, AND HAD CRITICIZE HIM BECAUSE HE'S A MUSLIM AMERICAN. THE SHARIA LAW BUSINESS IS CRAP. IT'S JUST CRAZY. AND I'M TIRED OF DEALING WITH THE CRAZIES.
Jon: HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
