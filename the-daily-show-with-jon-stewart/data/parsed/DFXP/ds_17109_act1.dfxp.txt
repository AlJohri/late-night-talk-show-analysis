JUNE 6, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE? MICHAEL FASS BENDER IS GOING TO BE JOINING US FROM THE NEW  RIDLEY SCOTT FILM "PROMETHEUS." TRUE STORY, THE ORIGINAL TITLE  WAS "SPACE IS NICE." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THEN THEY THOUGHT, WHAT  ABOUT "PROMETHEUS"? AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE HMM. (LAUGHTER) LET'S START TONIGHT, OF COURSE, IN WISCONSIN IN OUR LATEST INSTALLMENT OF... ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES, THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAYS  WHEN COWS SMOKED AND DRANK. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING! BACK IN 2010 CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN BY  A MARGIN OF 52-46. IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE WALKER SLASHED BUDGETS AND CONSTRAINED UNIONS AND DID THE KIND OF  THINGS YOU WOULD IMAGINE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS WOULD DO. SO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN SAID "WHOA! WAIT! WHAT? WHAT? YOU NEVER SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE THIS CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN-Y." (LAUGHTER)  THEY MOVED TO RECALL HIM LIKE A LEAD-PAINTED TOY MADE IN A NONUNION CHINESE SWEATSHOP. (LAUGHTER) SO AFTER 18 MONTHS, A MILLION PETITION SIGNATURES AND, I DON'T  KNOW, $50ISH MILLION, GOVERNOR WALKER WOULD HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS TYRANNICAL BEHAVIOR. AND FEEL THE WRATH OF A VENN VENGEFUL WISCONSIN ELECTORATE.
Reporter: SCOTT WALKER REMAINS WISCONSIN'S GOVERNOR.
BEATING TOM BARRETT 53-46.
Jon: HA HA! TAKE THAT! WANT TO GO AGAIN, TOUGH GUY? HOW'S E 55% SOUND? (LAUGHTER) YES, THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN SAYING... OH, I'M SORRY, YOU  DIDN'T HEAR US THE FIRST TIME? YEAH, YEAH, WE SAID WE LIKED THE TYRANT-Y UNION CUTTING GUY. HE'S OUR GUY. LIKE WE SAID 16 MONTHS AGO. SO WHAT THE (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) AND HAS NOW BECOME CUSTOMARY, THE NEWS NETWORKS FUNCTIONEDLESS LAST NIGHT AS REPOSITORIES AS NEWS AND ANALYSISES AND MORE AS  EXTENSION OF THE WINNING AND LOSING CAMPAIGNS. FOX WENT WITH GLOAT FEST 2012.
SCOTT WALKER ROUTE IT HAD RECALL. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE!
LOSING IN WISCONSIN, AGAIN, A PROGRESSIVE STATE, BY A LARGE, HUMILIATING MARGIN.
THEY GOT TRUMPED. THEY GOT SPANKED.
THEY'RE BASICALLY WALLOWING IN THEIR OWN UNPOPULARITY.
OBAMA'S GOOSE IS COOKED! (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: OR, TO PUT THAT A DIFFERENT WAY... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) SO IF FOX WAS HIGH, MSNBC MUST BE MSNB-SAD.
TO SAY I'M SHOCKED AND STUNNED IS PRETTY MUCH AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
Jon: SHOCKED AND STUND IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. NO, IT FEELS TONIGHT MORE LIKE MY HEART WAS (BLEEP)ED BY THE DEVIL. (LAUGHTER) NO, WAIT, THAT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT. (LAUGHTER) TO WANT I FEEL BETWEEN... SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SHOCKED, STUNNED AND DEVIL HEART (BLEEP)ED. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS ED SCHULTES. INDEED, MSNBC PASSED THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF GRIEF LAST NIGHT. STAGE ONE, DENIAL.
YOU KNOW, NBC IS CALLING IT FOR WALKER, OKAY, I THINK IT'S  AWFUL CLOSE AND THERE'S A LOT OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS YET THAT ARE STILL OUT.
Jon: YEAH, NO. (LAUGHTER) STAGE TWO, DENIAL.
THIS WILL NOT BE A MASSIVE WIN FOR SCOTT WALKER.
Jon: YEAH. (LAUGHTER) FINALLY STAGE THREE JUST REALLY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INDUSTRIAL-GRADE DENIAL.
TONIGHT THE REALLY BIG WINNER THE WISCONSIN RECALL ELECTION IS PRESIDENT OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JUST LIKE OBAMA DREW IT UP ON THE CHALK BOARD, HEY, GUYS, I GOTTEN A IDEA. WHAT IF WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE THE CORE OF WHAT WE BELIEVE SOUNDLY REJECTED BY  VOTERS IN A SWING STATE FIVE MONTHS BEFORE THE NATIONAL ELECTION. IT MIGHT JUST BE B THE BOOST WE NEED. (LAUGHTER) AS IN ANY STATEWIDE RECALL ELECTION, IT'S NOT WHO WINS OR  LOSES, IT'S THE DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS WE CAN INFER FROM THEM. FOR THE RIGHT...
THE UNIONS TOOK IT ON THE CHIN.
DESTRUCTION OF THE UNION POWER.
THIS IS A DEVASTATING BLOW TO UNIONS TONIGHT. DEVASTATING.
Jon: WOW, I PICKED THE WRONG YEAR TO OPEN MY GIANT INFLATABLE PLACARD STORE. (LAUGHTER) PERHAPS THE LEFT HAS A MORE MEASURED INTERPRETATION.
IF THE REPUBLICANS CAN USE POLICY AT THE STATE LEVEL TO KILL UNIONS, THERE WILL NO  LONGER BE TWO SIDES COMPETING WHEN IT COMES TO BIG MONEY IN ELECTIONS. REPUBLICANS WILL ESSENTIALLY BE RUNNING UNOPPOSED. FOREVER. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU OUT THERE IN THE NATION, IF YOU'RE WATCHING, DEMOCRACY DIED TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WAY TO GO, WISCONSIN! THANKS FOR KILLING DEMOCRACY, ASS (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE WE TURN TO SAMANTHA BEE IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. MADISON, WISCONSIN, SAMANTHA BEE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT'S IT LIKE UP THERE?
WELL, JON, I DON'T KNOW IF DEMOCRACY LOST OR IF UNIONS ARE DEAD OR WHAT. ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN!
PEOPLE HERE ARE VERY UPSET AS YOU COULD IMAGINE HERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE POURED THEIR LIVES INTO THIS RECALL EFFORT.
YEAH, THIS IS A CRIMINAL.
THAT'S THE CRIMINAL?
CRIMINAL OVERTONES.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT MOTHER (BLEEP)S.
Jon: THAT'S A TON OF ANGER.
AND THIS FROM WISCONSINITES, THE NICEST, CALMEST, MOST NONSHOUTY PEOPLE YOU'LL EVER MEET. WISCONSINITES ARE THE CLOSEST THING THIS COUNTRY HAS TO CANADIANS. FRIENDLY, GENEROUS, EVEN-TEMPERED. BUT THIS RECALL HAS CHANGED ALL OF THAT.
THE MILWAUKEE MAYOR WAS SLAPPED WHILE GIVING PERSONAL THANKS TO SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS  AFTER THAT CONCESSION SPEECH. APPARENTLY THE WOMAN WHO SLAPPED THE MAYOR WAS NOT HAPPY HE CONCEDED WHILE VOTES WERE STILL  BEING COUNTED.
Jon: HOLY CRAP! THAT LITTLE WOMAN SLAPPED THE CANDIDATE SHE SUPPORTED! YOU EXPECT THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IN NEW YORK.
NO QUESTION! NEW YORKERS ARE A *S (BLEEP)S.
Jon: TOTALLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MASSIVE DICK HEADS. BUT NOW WISCONSIN HAS TASTED THE DOUCHEY-NESS. THEY'VE GOT DOUCHE FEVER. IT'S THE CONTAGION SCENARIO WE'VE ALWAYS FEARED. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: IS IT TO TOO LATE TO STOP DOUCHE FEVER? WHAT CAN WE DO?
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO RESTORE NICENESS TO WISCONSIN. WE CANADIANS HAVE THE ANTIBODIES. I'VE BEEN BITING EVERYONE I CAN.
Jon: YOU'VE BEEN BITING EVERYONE?
YES, I HAVE. YES, I HAVE.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
YES, IT IS, FOR MY CHOLESTEROL. (LAUGHTER) DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL FILLED WITH CHEESE?
I DOCHEESE.
Jon: I DO NOT KNOW THAT.
I KNOW!
Jon
