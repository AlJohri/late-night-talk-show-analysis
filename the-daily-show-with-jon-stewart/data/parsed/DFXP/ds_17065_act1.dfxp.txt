FEBRUARY 28, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AN   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY SAME IN JON STEWART. WE HAVE -- MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SEESTEPHEN MERCHANT WILL BE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. WHEN HIS PARTNER RICKY GERVAIS WAS HERE WE HAD A REFINED CONVERSATION WITH RACCOON AND  PANDA SEX SO DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT TONIGHT. BUT YOU MAY WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN WE DO. I'M GOING TO SAY ROMNEY WON ARIZONA HANDELLY BUT THE BIG RESULT WAS MICHIGAN WHERE ALL  FOUR CANDIDATES WERE DEFEATED BY A LATE SURPRISE ENTRANCE THE SCHITCY WHEN FROM I UNDERSTAND  HE MADE IMPRESSIVE PROMISES.
WHEN YOU ORDER THE SCHITKY YOU GET THE LITTLE ONE.
Jon: IT'S A POPULOUS MESSAGE THAT RESONATES IN THE DIFFICULT YET SCHMOOTZY TIMES. ROMNEY KEPT PUTTING HIS FOOT IN THE MOUTH HE HIRED SEW OWN MOUTH DOESN'T GET FEET IN IT AND  SANTORUM RELEASED A ROBO CALL TELLING DEMOCRATIC VOTERS TO VOTE FOR HIM SINCE MICHIGAN'S  REPUBLICAN PARTY IS OPEN TO ALL VOTERS AND MITT ROMNEY DIDN'T CARE FOR THE TACTIC.
OUTRAGEOUS AND DISGUSTING. IT'S A NEW LOW IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I THINK RICK SANTORUM HAS A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO.
Jon: YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SPLAINING TO DO, THE CLOSE ET HE  WILL GET TO THE IT WILL TINO VOTE. WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THE TAPE EXISTING OF MITT ROMNEY ENDORSING THAT VERY SAME  PRACTICE, PERHAPS MY MITT ROMNEY FLIP-FLOP FINDER --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- KNOWS THE ANSWER.
IN MASSACHUSETTS IF YOU REGISTER AS AN INDEPENDENT, YOU CAN VOTE IN EITHER THE  REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. WHEN THERE WAS NO REAL CONTEST IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY I WOULD VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRAT, VOTE FOR THE PERSON I THOUGHT WOULD BE THE WEAKEST OPPONENT FOR A REPUBLICAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT A DISGUSTING THING TO DO. YOU HAVE SOME SPLAINING TO DO. WOW. CAN'T BELIEVE THIS THING WAS ONLY $10 AT TARGET. LOOK, NOW FLIP-FLOP FINDER WE HAVE ROMNEY FLIP-FLOPPING ON THE SUBSTANCE BUT IN THE CLIP WITH  SANTORUM HE CALLED THIS PRACTICE DISGUSTING. DO YOU HAVE A CLIP OF ROMNEY PERHAPS FROM HIS PAST NOT ONLY ADMITTING TO THIS PRACTICE OF  VOTING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S PRIMARY BUT ADMITTING IT IN A 12-YEAR-OLD GLEEFUL GIRLY VOICE. PROBABLY NO WHAT I NEW YORK CITY WHAMMIES.
WHEN YOU REGISTER AS A INDEPENDENT YOU COULD VOTE AGAINST BILL CLINTON. I USED TO VOTE AGAINST TED KENNY.
Jon: I USED TO VOTE AGAINST TED KENNEDY [SQUEALING] HE HAS AN ADRENALIN RUSH. WHO NEEDS PARTYING OR CURSING WHEN YOU HAVE CROSS PARTY ENDORSING. I'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT. THAT GUY MAKES IT WAY TOO (bleep) EASY. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE, THE MAIN STORY TONIGHT THE ECONOMY. THE DOW CLOSED ABOVE 13,000 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR YEARS TODAY. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ARBITRARY INDICATOR MAKING A MOVE THIS FIRST FEBRUARY.
A WHOLE SLEW OF GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND A RECORD-SETTING DAY ON WALL STREET. THE JOBLESS RATE IN JANUARY FELL TWO TENTHS OF A POINT TO 8.3%, THE LOWEST IN THREE YEARS. THE ECONOMY CREATED $243,000 JOBS. THE DOW SOARED TO THE HIGHEST CLOSE SINCE BEFORE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.
Jon: YOU HAD TO GO AND GET BETTER WHILE OBAMA WAS STILL IN OFFICE, DIDN'T YOU?  YOU  COULDN'T HOLD OFF NINE LITTLE MONTHS. NOT TEENY TINY LITTLE MONTHS. IT'S GOOD NEWS UNLESS YOU WORK FOR A MEDIA ORGANIZATION WHOSE JOB IT IS TO MAKE SURE OBAMA  DOESN'T GET REELECTED. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? TO THE RETURN-A NATEOR.
IT'S AN ANEMIC RECOVERY.
THERE AIN'T NO RECOVERY.
ABOUT HALF THE DECLINE IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS COME FROM PEOPLE DROPPING OUT OF WORK  FORCE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DISCOURAGED. THE REAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS WELL INTO THE DOUBLE DIGITS. THE ECONOMIC DATA OBAMA IS PEDALING IS -- PEDDLING IS PHONY.
IT'S HOW YOU FEEL IN THE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE  ELECTION REGARDLESS OF NUMBERS, HOW DO YOU FEEL? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET ME SEE IF I GET THIS STRAIGHT, THE NUMBERS ARE REAL BUT THEY ARE NOT G. IN  FACT, THEY ARE BAD. ACTUALLY THEY ARE FAKE. EVEN IF THEY WERE REAL AND GOOD IT WOULDN'T MATTER BECAUSE IT'S  ABOUT HOW BAD YOU FEEL AND THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN. [ LAUGHTER ] FOX NEWS --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THEIR EARLY FEBRUARY PUSHBACK ON THE ECONOMIC INDICATORS IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU RARELY SEE FOX THIS DISORGANIZED. LUCKILY ON FEBRUARY 10th THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SENT OUT THIS PUNDIT PREP  DOCUMENT, LET ME SHOW IT TO YOU. IT'S A DOCUMENT EMPHASIZING HOW TO MITIGATE ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY BE OCCURRING FROM THE IMPROVED ECONOMY. IT FURNISHES REPUBLICAN PUNDITS WITH THREE KEY AREAS TO FOCUS ON, THE NATIONAL DEBT, UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PRICE OF GAS. LET'S WATCH AND SEE IF THE FEBRUARY 10th PLANTING TAKES ROOT. FUR PLAYING ALONG AT HOME AND LOOKING FOR NATIONAL DEBT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE PRICE OF GAS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE DEBT IS THE ISSUE.
WHY ISN'T THE NATIONAL DEBT THE MAIN ISSUE?
RISING UNEMPLOYMENT. THE COUNTRY IS DEEPER IN DEBT.
15% U6 UNEMPLOYMENT.
8.5 UNEMPLOYMENT AND FOUR BUCKS FOR GAS.
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT GAS PRICES YNCH IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS.
$3.57 AND YOU MIGHT BE ASKING THE QUESTION WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUTï¿½i THIS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BINGO! I HAVE MY WHOLE -- WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS? OH, MY GOD GRETCHEN IS UNABLE TO HEAR HER OWN VOICE. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS SO TRAGIC. FOR HER. [ LAUGHTER ] SO A LOT OF PUNDITS -- A LOT OF PUNDITS AND NEWS SHOWS ON FOX SEEM TO HAVE CONSOLIDATED THEIR  NEGATIVE ECONOMIC SPIN AROUND THE SAME THREE DISTINCT DATA POINTS PROVIDED BY THE  REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE PUNDIT PREP NOTE. THAT'S NOT PROOSM YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF FOX'S TALKING HEADS, I  DON'T KNOW READING THE MEMO ALOUD MUCH TO THE CHA GRIN OF ONE OF THE TALKING HEADS SITTING  NEXT TO THEM, DO WE?
THE RNC SEES TROUBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT REGARDING THIS. THEY SENT OUT SOMETHING ACCORDING TO THE PAPERS CALLED PUNDIT PREP FOR THE TALKING  HEADS TO GOOD OUT. THEY SAY THE THREE BEST WAYS TO DEFINE THE BARACK OBAMA ECONOMY, THE NATIONAL DEBT, WHICH IS SKYROCKETING, THE UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH IS NORTH OF 8% AND GAS PRICES.
Jon: FASCINATING. AND WHILE WE'RE HERE MR. DOOCY WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THE PIVOT FROM REVEALING THE GAME TO  PLAYING IT?
AND GAS PRICES.
THEY ARE IMPACTING YOU. HOW HAS IT AFFECTED YOU? WHAT ARE YOU GOING WITHOUT? E-MAILzV US, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S LIKE HOSTING A SHOW WITH A LAB WHEN THIS GUY IS ON THERE. HE JUST GAVE THE GAME AWAY. YOU KNOW, THEY SENT UP A TALKING POINT WHICH BRINGS UP A POINT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. THAT RUINS THE GAME  IT'S LIKE SECOND AN E-MAIL TO SOMEONE THATS SAYS HEY CLICK ON THIS, IT  OPENS UP A VIDEO OF RICK ASTLEY SING" NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP"  WHICH UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT TO GET. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINGS HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT  WATCH HER LASERï¿½iï¿½r EYES WHEN SHIES REAISLES HE IS GIVING UP THE GAME.
CALLED PUNDIT PREP FOR THE TALKING HEADS TO GO OUT.
Jon: IT'S LIKE SHE'S GIVING THE SIGNAL TO THE HOST WRANGLER. IT'S LIKE DART HIM!
