Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FINALLY WADED INTO THE FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE. THERE'S STILL AN ISSUE AT HOME THAT YOU WILL NEVER HEAR THE REPUBLICANS TALKING ABOUT. JASON JONES HAS MORE.
WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN ERADICATING PREJUDICE IN THIS COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ECONOMIST DANIEL HAMMERMESH, ONE PART OF  SOCIETY IS STILL SUFFERING IN WAYS WE NEVER IMAGINED.
UGLY PEOPLE.
Reporter: UGLY PEOPLE.
IF YOU'RE BAD LOOKING, YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP WITH A SPOUSE WHO IS NOT AS GOOD LOOKING AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE  LESS HAPPY.
Reporter: ARE YOU CURRENTLY HAPPY?
YEAH, I'M A VERY HAPPY PERSON.
Reporter: OKAY. AND HE'S GOT A MOUNTAIN OF HARD DATA THAT SHOWS HOW THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND.
WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE TROUBLE GETTING LOANS. WHEN THEY DO GET LOANS THEY'LL GET LOANS ON WHICH THE TERMS AREN'T AS GOOD.
Reporter: YOU KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE....
AN ECONOMIST.
Reporter: UGLY.
NO, I'M A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS WHO HAS DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS. I WOULD THINK I'M AVERAGE.
Reporter: AS A COLD, HARD FACTUAL NUMBER YOU WOULD CONSIDER YOURSELF.
3.
Reporter: 3 OUT OF 10.
A 3 OUT OF 5.
Reporter: UNFORTUNATELY HAMMERMESH SEES DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS ALMOST EVERYWHERE HE LOOKS.
UGLY PEOPLE MAKE LESS MONEY THAN OTHERWISE IDENTICAL GOOD LOOKING PEOPLE. $230,000 OVER A LIFETIME COMPARED TO A GOOD LOOKING PERSON.
Reporter: HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE OFFICES AT GOOGLE.
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.
Reporter: IT'S A SPACE CANTEEN FROM STAR WARS.
WELL, AS I SAID....
Reporter: DO YOU KNOW HOW RICH THOSE UGLY PEOPLE ARE? THEY ARE FILTHY RICH. THEY ALL LOOK LIKE WALRUS MAN.
IF THEY WERE BETTER LOOKING THEY WOULD HAVE GONE ON TO OTHER THINGS.
Reporter: THEY WORK AT GOOGLE. IF UGLY AMERICANS ARE HURTING, WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THEM?
WE COULD EXTEND LEGAL PROTECTIONS TO HELP UGLY PEOPLE JUST AS WE DO NOW FOR  RACIAL MINORITIES, ETHNIC MINORITIES, WOMEN, DISABLED INDIVIDUALS.
Reporter: YOU'RE SAYING, LET'S SAY A QUADRIPLEGIC IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS A BAD LOOKING AMERICAN.
TO ME IF THESE THINGS ARE BOTH EQUALLY CAN'T BE FIXED, WHY THEN TO ME THEY MIGHT BE VIEWED AS BEING IN THE SAME GROUP.
Reporter: WOULD THOSE GROUPS BE WILLING TO SHARE A PIECE OF THE SOCIAL JUSTICE PIE? I SAT DOWN WITH ADVOCATES REPRESENTING AFRICAN AMERICANS, NATIVE AMERICANS, WOMEN, THE GAY AND LESBIAN COMMUNITY AND THE DISABLED TO FIND OUT.
HAVING A SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY LIKE QUADRIPLEGIA IMPACTS EVERY MAJOR LIFE....
Reporter: WHEN UGLY PEOPLE WALK DOWN THE STREET THEY GET FUNNY LOOKS.
OF COURSE THEY ALL ARE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING MOST  QUADRIPLEGICS CAN DO.
Reporter: THERE ARE NO ASSISTIVE DEVICES FOR UGLY PEOPLE. THEY ALL FOUND REASONS TO PUT THEMSELVES AHEAD OF UGLY.
ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATELY WE KNOW THAT.
I'M AGAINST ALL DISCRIMINATION.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME PRIORITIES. IF YOU'RE A SOCIETY, IF YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT, IF YOU'RE A CULTURE.
WHAT IS THE MARKER FOR AN UGLY PERSON? HOW DO YOU DEFINE AN UGLY PERSON?
Reporter: THIS GUY.
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS A PERSON THAT IS UGLY.
Reporter: HE RATES HIMSELF A THREE OUT OF FIVE. CAN ANY OF YOU IMAGINE THE PAIN OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 3/5ths OF A PERSON.
I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT QUESTION.
Reporter: EXACTLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T THINK OF IT.
THAT'S NOT IT AT YOU WILL.
Reporter: DESPITE THE REJECTION, HAMMERMESH REMAINS UNBOWED IN HIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY BEAUTY. I STARTED WALKING AROUND CAMPUS LOOKING AT EVERYBODY AND GIVING THEM A GRADE, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Reporter: THAT'S NOT CREEPY AT ALL. CREEPY OR NOT IT WAS SOUND SCIENCE. I JOINED HIM IN HIS LABORATORY. COME ON. THAT'S THREE 5s.
NO WAY. THREE AND TWO FOURS IF YOU'RE BEING GENEROUS HERE.
Reporter: WE CAREFULLY COLLECTED DATA. IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT THIS SEASONED ECONOMIST WAS BETTER WITH NUMBERS.
I GOT A 5, 5 AND A 4.8. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
TWO THREES AND FOUR.
Reporter: (BEEP) OFF. AS HE CONTINUED HIS RESEARCH AND HIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE, I REALIZED THE PIE MIGHT BE BIG  ENOUGH FOR MORE THAN JUST THE UGLY.
WE HAVE TO NOW GIVE BENEFITS TO OTHER GROUPS LIKE DOUCHE BAGS, YOU KNOW.
YOU COULD HAVE SAID THE SAME THING WHEN WE STARTED PROTECTING RACIAL MINORITIES  50 YEARS AGO.
Reporter: I'M A DOUCHE BAG. I DON'T GET JOBS ON ABC FAMILY BECAUSE I'M A DOUCHE.
I WOULD ARGUE THAT UNLIKE LIKE LOOKS WHICH IS HARD TO CHANGE, DOUCHE BAGNESS MAY BE  MUCH EASIER TO CHANGE.
Reporter: IT'S NOT. JUST ASK MY PRODUCER. YOU SEE, I CAN'T TURN IT OFF.
