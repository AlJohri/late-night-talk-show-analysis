JUNE 19, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD NIGHT TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT SUPPOSED TO BE SENATOR MARCO RUBIO FROM FLORIDA. UNFORTUNATELY HARRY REID SCHEDULED A LOT OF SENATE FLOOR VOTES FOR THIS EVENING. SENATOR RUBIO UNABLE TO GET AWAY. WHICH LEADS ME TO SATE -- SAY THE THING I SAY ALMOST EVERY DAY, YOU (bleep)ED ME AGAIN, HARRY REID. YOU (bleep)ED ME AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SENATOR WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK. IN HIS POLICE WE GOT VERY LUCKY DENISLEARY. GRACIOUSLY STEPPED IN HIS LACE. A YOUNG -- DLENIS LEARY. BOTH CANDIDATES FACE THE TASK OF SOLIDIFYING THE ENTHUSIASM OF THEIR BASE WHILE REACHING OUT TO  THE UNDECIDED TO COVER ALL OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE2012 PANDA EXPRESS EDITION SPONSOR BY PANDA EXPRESS. WHEN YOU NEED PANDA MEAT AND YOU NEED IT FAST. [ LAUGHTER ] THE FIRST RULE --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THEIR SLOGAN WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] THE FIRST RULE OF ELECTION YEAR SEDUCTION IS KNOWING YOUR AUDIENCE. BOTH GAVE SPEECHES THAT OFFERED DEMOGRAPHIC SNAPSHOTS OF THEIR CAMPAIGNS. BARACK OBAMA MUST APPEAL TO A DIVERSE ENDLESSLY FRACTURED COALITION OF COMPETING INTEREST  WHILE ROMNEY HAS TO BRING TOGETHER WHAT APPEARS TO BE 50 SHADES OF WHITE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THE DIFFERENT MAKEUP OF THIS STITTENCECIES DETERMINED THE STRATEGY. THE DEMOCRATS TORQUE WIN, MUST GO LORD OF RINGS STYLE. BRING TOGETHER ALL THE ARMIES OF MIDDLE EARTH. [ LAUGHTER ] TO FIGHT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE EVIL EYE OF MORMON. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'VE GOT TO BRING TOGETHER THE GAYS, THE ENVIRONMENTISTS,. [ LAUGHTER ] -- HIRED UNION LABOR --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- AND OF COURSE, SHORT, OFTEN BEARDED PEOPLE KNOWN FOR HOARDING GOLD, I DON'T KNOW  WHICH GROUP WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC STITTENCECY THAT THEY WOULD -- CONSTITUENCY THEY WOULD REPRESENT. [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, ROMNEY MUST HELP HIS MORE HOMOGENUOS CONSTITUENCY. LET'S REPRESENT HIS STRATEGY WITH -- I DON'T KNOW -- THE ALAMO. A LAST DITCH EFFORT BY WHITE AMERICANS TO KEEP MEXICANS OUT OF THEIR BASEMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO FAR OBAMA STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO ENTICE EACH GROUP WITH A DIFFERENT SPOISM HE HAS COME OUT  IN SUPPORT OF GAY MARRIAGE. HE HAS --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- SPOKEN ABOUT MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE GAVE SHIMON PEREZ THE MEDDLE OF FREEDOM. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD ONE. IT REALLY ALEVES ONLY ONE GROUP UNSPOKEN FOR.
THIS MORNING SECRETARY NAPOLITANO ANNOUNCED NEW ACTS MY ADMINISTRATION WILL TAKE TO MEND  OUR IMMIGRATIONS -- NATION'S IMMIGRATION POLICY. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO NOT PRESENT A RISK TO NATIONAL  SECURITY OR PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD BE ABLE TO REQUEST TEMPORARY RELIEF FROM DEPORTATION  PROCEEDINGS AND APPLY FOR WORK AUTHORIZATION.
Jon: THOSE WHO ARE STILL A RISK WILL BE TARGETED BY FLYING ROBOT DRONES WITH HIGH-POWERED LASERS. YOUR MOVE, DAVY CROCKETT, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
RICK SCOTT SAID IT'S AIMED AT CLEARING REGULATION ROLLS OF NONCITIZENS.
Jon: SO THE TIME HONOR YOD TRADITION CONTINUES. IOWA BEGINS THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND FLORIDA (bleep)S ALL OVER IT. WE'RE JOINED BY WYATT AND JOHN OLIVER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING HE IS. WYATT YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN, JOHN YOU ARE EM EMBEDDED WITH THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN. HOW DOES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAY IT'S JUST ELECTION YEAR PANDERING?
WHO WHO WHO, THEY WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR, THEY DIDN'T DO THIS FOR VOTES. THEY DID IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT BEING SAID, IMMIGRANT VOTERS WISH TO EXPRESS THEIR GRATITUDE AT THE POLLS THIS  NOVEMBER, THAT WOULD BE MUY, MUY BUENO, COMPREND SNERKS.
Jon: WHAT IS THE RESPONSE FROM REPUBLICANS? IS RESTRICTING VOTER ACCESS TO THE POLLS THE IDEA FOR THEM?
REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO STOP PEOPLE FROM VOTING THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE COLLEGE  STUDENT DOZEN IT SAFELY. THEY'LL MERELY BE ASKED TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN URINE FOR DRUG TESTING PURPOSES, FOUR GALLONS  OF IT.
Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF URINE.
EXACTLY, JON, WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT IS ANNOUNCING TOMORROW THAT ALL CHILDREN OF  JEWISH MOTHERS ARE NOW DOCTORS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT? CAN THE PRESIDENT DO IN A? THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO THAT?
OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT CAN DO THAT DR. STEWART. CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY. IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE. IN 1954 PRESIDENT TRUMAN TURNED ALL OF AMERICANS FILIPINOS INTO PODIATRISTS.
Jon: I THINK THE DEMOCRATS TOOK FLORIDA WITH IN A. THAT'S REALLY --
REPUBLICANS ARE RAISING THE VOTING AGE.
Jon: TO WHAT?
TO THAT PERIOD WHERE YOU ARE DEAD BUT YOUR FINGER NAILS AND HAIR STILL GROW. ROMNEY BAPTIZED THOSE DEAD PEOPLE.
Jon: JOHN?
CATS CAN VOTE. BIG ONES, LITTLE ONES, HOUSE AND WILD. THEY CAN ADOPT CHILDREN AND GET MARRIED BUT THEY CAN VOTE. REMEMBER KITTIES YES WE MEOW!
ALL POLLING PLACES ARE IN DOG HOUSES.
WE DON'T DO THAT TO THAT WOULD DELIBERATELY AILENCATE THE CAT VOTE!
Jon: AREN'T THEY CONCERNED THAT THIS TYPE OF SCORCHED EARTH  POLITICKING WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FIX THE PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA?
FIX THE PROBLEMS? [ LAUGHTER ]
JON, THE PURPOSE OF ELECTION ISN'T TO FIX THE PROBLEMS FACING THE COUNTRY. IT'S TO WIN!
RIGHT!
Jon: THANK YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
