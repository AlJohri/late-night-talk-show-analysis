(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ANCHOR OF CNN'S "360."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM ANDERSON COOPER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING UNDER THE WEATHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN ME FOR 20 MINUTES. YOBDZ.
Jon: I'M UNDERSTOODER THE WEATHER.
YOU LOOK REALLY SICK.
Jon: THANK YOU. I THOUGHT THE MAKEUP AND LIGHTING WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT. I APOLOGIZE. IT'S CRAZY, GROW TO CAIRO, HAITI YOU TRAVEL, YOU'RE FINE. THE PICTURE OF HEALTH. I RARELY GO ABOVE 14th STREET. (LAUGHTER) AND YET I'M A BROKEN MAN. HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER. YOU GOT BACK FROM EGYPT RCHBLT THERE ANY MORE PLANS TO SEND YOU TO PLACES WHERE YOU ARE IN DANGER?
I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO LIBYA, ACTUALLY. SO WE'LL SEE.
Jon: WHO DO YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ABOUT THAT? IF YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO LIBYA DOES CNN HAVE V TO SAY "ANDERSON YOU CAN GET ONE BUSINESS  TICKET."
WE GOT A CORRESPONDENT IN YESTERDAY THROUGH EGYPT BECAUSE THE LIBYANS HAVE GIVEN UP THE  EASTERN BORDER SO IT WAS A GUY WAVING HIM THROUGH SO HE'S GOTTEN INTO EASTERN LIBYA WHICH  HAS BEEN LIBERATED.
Jon: BUT CAN YOU IN ANY WAY GUARD HIS SAFETY? HE'S ON HIS OWN NOW BECAUSE THERE'S DEVASTATING VIOLENCE.
HE'S IN A LOT OF HARM'S WAY. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. THERE'S PRECAUTIONS YOU CAN KIND OF TAKE AND YOU TRY TO BE AS CAREFUL AS YOU CAN BUT THERE ARE  MERCENARY OUT THERE USING SNIPERS TO SHOOT PEOPLE. AS WE FOUND IN EGYPT, I'VE BEEN DOING WAR STUFF FOR ABOUT 18 YEARS AND....
Jon: DO YOU CALL IT "WAR STUFF" WHEN YOU'RE... (LAUGHTER) WHEN YOU'RE A WAR CORRESPONDENT DO YOU REFER TO IT AS "STUFF."  YOU KNOW, FRONT LINES AND (BEEP). (LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DA?
BUT WHEN IT'S THE STATE ITSELF, WHEN IT'S SOMEONE LIKE MUBARAK OR QADDAFI WHO IS  TELLING THEIR PEOPLE GO AND KILL REPORTERS OR KILL FOREIGNERS OR... IT BECOMES A WHOLE  DIFFERENT SECURITY ISSUE.
Jon: THEY WERE ARRESTING REPORTERS AND A TERRIBLE SITUATION WITH LARA LOGAN. BUT QADDAFI SEEMS LIKE A SPECIAL KIND OF CRAZY.
YEAH.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE TAPE WHERE HE'S HOLDING THE UMBRELLA.
AMAZING. THE WHITE UMBRELLA. YEAH. AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE... HE GAVE A SPEECH TODAY THIS LONG RAMBLING SPEECH WHICH FINALLY  EVERYONE JUST CUT AWAY FROM BECAUSE IT WENT ON FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.
Jon: EVEN LIBYAN TELEVISION CUT AWAY. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE HAVING A PROBLEM AND  YOU'RE A DICTATOR. LIBYA TELLS YOU "PUT ON ANOTHER SHOW."
HE CALLED THE PROTESTORS GREASEY RATS AND CAT WHICH IS I THOUGHT WAS A PARTICULARLY ODD PHRASE.
Jon: THAT'S ALMOST LIKE HEP JAZZ, HE'S GOING TO GO TO THOSE POETRY SLAMS. IT'S... I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT AND THE INTERESTING THING TO  ME WHEN YOU STARTED SAYING MUBARAK IS LYING AND HERE'S WHY IT ACTUALLY CAUSED CONTROVERSY
WHICH I WAS STUNNED BY. A REPORTER SAYING HERE ARE SOME LIES HE'S TELLING AND HERE'S WHY. AND PEOPLE GO OH, HE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.
IT WAS WEIRD. THERE WAS A GUY IN THE "L.A. TIMES" AND SOMEBODY ELSE ON A COUPLE OTHER NETWORKS SAYING I  SHOULDN'T CALL MUBARAK A LIAR. I'M NOT BIG ON CALLING PEOPLE NAMES OR I TRY NOT TO TAKE ANY POLITICAL STANCE BUT JUST BASED  ON FACT IT IS GUY IS LYING. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS... AND IT'S DEMONSTRABLY UNTRUE.
Jon: IS THAT MAYBE JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING YOU HAVE WITH MODERN JOURNALISM THAT THINGS  ARE DEMONSTRABLY UNTRUE YOU SHOULD THEN BRING ON... LIKE YOU SAY MUBARAK IS LYING BUT WE ALSO  HAVE SOMEONE HERE WHO BELIEVES HE'S NOT AND ALSO BELIEVES THAT  ICE CREAM CURES CANCER SO LET'S HAVE A FAIR DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. IS THAT... IS THAT AN ISSUE?
THAT'S A PROBLEM JOURNALISM HAS A LOT OF BEING AFRAID TO SAY  SOMETHING THAT IS DEMONSTRABLY NOT TRUE IS NOT TRUE. THERE ARE THINGS WHICH ARE FACTS AND I'M NOT SURE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE SHY AWAY FROM THAT.
IT'S VERY STRANGE AND WHEN YOU WATCH OFTEN TIMES NEWS NETWORKS THINGS THAT ARE GOING  ON AT OTHER TIMES ON THE NETWORK I KNOW THEY SAY "THOSE PEOPLE  ARE DIFFERENT" BUT THEY SAY TRULY OUTLANDISH AND CRAZY THINGS AND THEN YOU COME OUT  WITH I GUESS YOU CALL THEM... WHAT DID YOU CALL THEM AGAIN?
FACTS.
Jon: FACTS. (LAUGHTER) AND SO YOU PROVED SOMETHING AND THEN... THAT WAS THE THING THAT THEY CALLED OUT. I FOUND THAT FASCINATING.
I FOUND IT REALLY WEIRD. YEAH. I WAS SURPRISED.
Jon: HOW MUCH BACKUP DO YOU HAVE EDITORIALLY AT CNN? DO THEY BACK YOU UP I FEEL LIKE AT FOX ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THEY HAVE IS ROGER ALWAYS IS  VERY LOYAL TO THEM AND HE BACK THEM UP NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY SAY AND  BOY THAT TAKES LOYALTY. (LAUGHTER)
NO ONE WITHIN CNN HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH ME SAYING MUBARAK IS LYING. OTHER PEOPLE WEREN'T SAYING IT AND THAT'S FIND BUT TO ME I'VE  BEEN ON THE GROUND AND SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES HOW THE GUY IS LYING  AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THE TRUTH IS AND WHAT HE'S SAID ABOUT IT AND  I FIND IT WEIRD THAT THAT SEEMED TO CAUSE DRAMA.
Jon: WELL, I REALLY HOPE IN THE FUTURE YOU TAKE THINK A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT  THIS WHOLE OBJECTIVE REALITY THING. (LAUGHTER) VERY DISAPPOINTING TO ALL OF US WHO ARE BIG FANS OF YOURS. AND FOR ME THAT'S THE TOUGHEST THING IS WHEN I SEE YOU IN A  DANGEROUS PLACE IT'S... IT MAKES ME... I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BIG OLD HUG.
AW!
Jon: WE'RE BIG FANS OF YOURS. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE YOU IN DANGEROUS PLACES. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NOT THAT YOU CAN'T HANDLE YOURSELF. I SEE WHAT YOU GOT GOING. "360" AIRS WEEKNIGHTS ON
