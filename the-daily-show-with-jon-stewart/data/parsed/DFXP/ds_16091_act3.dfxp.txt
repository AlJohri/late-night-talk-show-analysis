(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ON BROADWAY STARRING IN HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING. YOU MAY KNOW FROM HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2.
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?
EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH WILL MULTIPLY.
Jon: COME ON. THAT LOOKS COOL. PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL RADCLIFFE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: I DON'T WANT SPOILERS. I DON'T WANT... I'VE NOT HAD A CHANCE. DOES HE GET HIS RING BACK?
YES. HE'S THE CENTRAL CHARACTER IN THIS FILM.
Jon: WHAT AN EXCITING TIME. HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW? IS IT EXCITEMENT OVER HAVING THIS DONE? IS IT MELANCHOLY? BITTER-SWEET? WHAT'S THE FEELING?
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WEIRD. IN THE LONDON PREMIERE I WAS VERY EMOTIONAL. I WAS KIND OF... IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE WE STARTED FILMING. I GUESS I'M KIND OF FOCUSED ON THE SHOW AT THE MOMENT AS WELL AS STILL DOING IT EIGHT TIMES  A WEEK. I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: ARE YOU DOING THE SHOW TONIGHT?
NO, NO. MONDAY IS OUR NIGHT OFF.
Jon: YOU GET ONE NIGHT OFF IN EIGHT SHOWS A WEEK. WELL, THAT IS THE LACYIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. TRY DOING FOUR 22 MINUTES.
IT'S KIND OF SAD AND WE'VE ALL HAD OUR GRIEVING PERIOD. IT'S VERY EXCITING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE IT.
Jon: IS IT HARD AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A PART OF IT FOR TEN YEARS, DO YOU GET JADED? IS IT HARD... DOES PEOPLE'S ENTHUSIASM, ARE YOU LIKE, OH, THAT'S NICE.
NOT AT ALL.
Jon: IT'S MAGIC.
NOT AT ALL. THAT'S WHAT'S KIND OF COOL. THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GREAT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN JADED. WE WERE EXCITED TO GO TO WORK. WE ALL LOVED OUR JOBS AND HAVING DIFFERENT DIRECTORS COME IN AND KEEP THINGS FRESH  AND WORK WITH THE AMAZING ACTORS. IT'S HARD TO GET JADED WHEN YOU'RE A 14-YEAR-OLD. IT CAN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.
Jon: THAT IS PART OF IT. AS A 14-YEAR-OLD BEING JADED IS IN MANY WAYS YOUR JOB. LIKE, GARY IS COMING. WOW. YOU'RE 14.
I KNOW BUT I DON'T KNOW I'VE BEEN GOOD AT THAT. THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT PEOPLE MY AGE. I THINK WHAT IS LOVELY IS THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM. I'M ALWAYS AMAZED WHEN I MEET A PERSON MY OWN AGE WHO IS ENTHUSIASTIC AND EXCITED. I ALWAYS LATCH ON THEM. COOL. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS RIDICULOUS PRETENDING THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT STUFF.
Jon: IT REMINDS ME OF STAR WARS. I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I'M A 4-YEAR-OLD MAN. AT A CERTAIN POINT GOING TO THE STAR WARS CONVENTIONS, YOU KNOW, BUT AS LONG AS MY SON  WILL DRESS UP LIKE OBI-WAN AND PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF COVER FOR ME, I DON'T MIND. I'M NOT JADED ABOUT IT AT ALL. I FIND THESE MOVIES TO BE WONDERFUL MORALITY TALES WITH GREAT CHARACTERS.
AND THEY'RE A HUGE AMOUNT OF FUN. AMY, MY... AND THE OTHER DAY I'M I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR WEEKS. I NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I'M A MASSIVE FAN WHICH IS A CARTOON. NOT ONE PERSON HERE KNOWS IT. I'M SCARED TO ADMIT THAT'S PERHAPS NOT THE ONE THING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED ME TO PICK  OUT OF HER CATALOGUE OF WORK. I SPENT THREE HOURS WITH THE CARTOONS. THIS GIRL I REMEMBER ASKING HER AT THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY, HOW DID YOU PREPARE FOR THIS SHOW? SHE WANTEDED ME TO SAY, WELL, I SIT IN A STABLE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. I WAS LIKE WELL I WATCH A CERTAIN THING.
Jon: I CAN TELL MY CHILDREN THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACTORS.
THAT'S ALL THE PREP YOU NEED.
Jon: I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. HERE ARE THE REAL WORLD IMPLICATIONS OF HARRY POTTER. WHEN WE'RE HERE ON THE VERY PRISTINE 11th AVENUE AND 52nd STREET STUDIOS WHICH IS NEW  YORK'S FAMED CRACK CORE DISTRICT, THIS IS A TOURNAMENT JUST THREE DAYS AGO. IT'S A TOURNAMENT, REAL PEOPLE PLAYING IT. WE ASKED THEM TO SUBMIT SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I WANT YOU TO SEE IT. LOOK AT THAT ONE.
DO YOU FEEL ANY GUILT FROM OUR ONGOING VIRGINITY. DO YOU ANY ANTI-WEDGEY SPELLS?
DAN IN THE BOOK IT WAS MENTIONED BUT NOT THE OTHER MOVIES.
CAN YOU TELL MY MOM TO PICK ME UP AT 5:00.
DID YOU EVER DO IT. WHAT IS "DO IT"?
LET ME THINK. YES, I FEEL VERY GUILTY. YOUR MUM HAS PROBABLY LEFT YOU THERE BY NOW. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OTHER ONES WERE. BUT THAT POOR KID THEY WERE LIKE TACKLING HIM.
Jon: I KNOW. HE'S 10.
HE'S THE SNITCH. SOMEBODY RUNS AROUND AS THE SNITCH. POUNCED ON.
Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT IS THE KID IN YELLOW. THERE'S A GUY BEHIND HIM WIELDING THE BROOM LIKE A CLUB.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.
Jon: LIKE CAPONE. THIS BROOM GIVES ME ENTHUSIASM. HAVE YOU ACTUALLY GONE.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN? IT WOULD BE CHAOS. I FOUND THE REAL....
Jon: IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE MADNESS.
IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE. I THINK I'D BE REALLY GOOD.
Jon: YOU'D BE, IN FACT, THE CHOSEN ONE.
NICE.
Jon: HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, IT IS IN THE THEATERS RIGHT NOW. YOU SHOULD GO SEE IT BECAUSE IT HASN'T EARNED ITS SECOND BILLION YET. DANIEL RADCLIFFE.
