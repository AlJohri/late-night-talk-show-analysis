NOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT MANY AMERICANS ARE FACING DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES RIGHT NOW, BUT  LET'S NOT FORGET THAT DISCRIMINATION IS NOT DEAD EITHER. HERE IS ONE TALE OF STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY. JASON JONES HAS MORE.
EVERY DAY MARK FEELS LIKE AN OUTSIDER IN HIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.
I'VE BEEN TOLD I INTIMIDATE PEOPLE BY THE WAY I LOOK.
HE CAN HARDLY WALK DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT BEING REMINDED THAT HE'S DIFFERENT.
PEOPLE CALL ME NAMES ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW, MEAT HEAD.
WHEN PEOPLE CALL YOU THE M WORD, HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?
YOU GET USED TO IT AFTER A WHILE. IT ROLLS OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.
LUCKILY HIS SHOULDERS CAN TAKE IT BECAUSE MARK IS A MUSCLED AMERICAN. A GROUP OF PEOPLE ROUTINELY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ALMOST EVERYWHERE THEY GO. BUT MARK RECENTLY FACED INTOLERANCE IN THE ONE PLACE HE THOUGHT HE WAS SAFE, HIS LOCAL  PLANET FITNESS GYM.
I WASN'T THERE A WEEK, AND I WAS TOLD, YOU INTIMIDATE THE  OTHER PATRONS AN WE DON'T LIKE YOUR TYPE HERE.
"YOUR TYPE"?
YEAH.
EXCUSE ME? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BARREL SHAPED?
I THINK HE MEANT MY TYPE OF HEAVY WEIGHTLIFTER. I STARTED TO REALIZE, I DON'T THINK THEY LIKE ME HERE, BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THROW ME OUT. WELL, GOD DAMMIT, I WAS WRONG. THEY THREW ME OUT.
THERE LAD TO BE A GOOD REASON FOR THIS NATIONAL CHAIN WITH NEARLY 500 LOCATIONS TO THROW  HIM OUT.
HE WAS GRUNTING IN THE GYM.
AND THAT'S AGAINST THE GYM'S POLICY.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SEEN IT. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A GYM MEMBER BEFORE?
NO.
WELL, WE HAVE SOMEONE PICK UP WEIGHTS AND GROWN. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE.
BUT IT IS A GYM, RIGHT?
YES.
THE MO-GRUNTING POLICY IS PART OF THEIR HOLE LISTIC APPROACH TO THE GYM.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE AND NOT HAVE THE WILL U.K.S IN THE GYM.
WHAT ARE THE LUNGS?
YOU KNOW, MEAT HEADS, BODY BUILDERS, JERKS.
THAT'S SOME PRETTY INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE.
THAT'S HOW WE FEEL ACT THESE PEOPLE. THEY'RE JUST NOT WELCOME.
SO NO JUDGMENT EXCEPT YOU GET TO JUDGE?
THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY. SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS NON-JUDGMENTAL GYM JUDGE AS TOO MUCH GRUNTING? HOW ABOUT THIS? [INHALES DEEPLY]
NO.
I CAN'T EVEN BREATH. I CAN'T... [SIREN SOUNDS]
THAT IS OUR LUNK ALARM.
WHAT IS IT?
THAT IS OUR LUNK ALARM. IT GOES OFF ANY TIME SOMEONE DROPS WEIGHTS OR GRUPTS.
YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S A LOT LESS ANNOYING THAN GRUNTING. AND IT'S NOT JUST GRUNGTSING THAT'S BEEN BANNED.
NO DO-RAGS ALLOWED. NO DO-RAGS.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DO-RAG.
I THINK THEY'RE GESTAPO TACTICS.
YOU MUST NO LONGER WEAR DO-RAGS, EVER.
THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES FOR LUNKS TO GO. THEY HAVE A LOT OF PLACES. ALL THE ANIMALS CAN BE IN ONE CAGE, AND THEN YOU HAVE PLANET FITNESS WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE CAN GO.
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE SAID THAT?
HITLER?
WHAT? NO. NO. I WAS GOING TO SAY THOMAS JEFFERSON.
I KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL NOW WHEN THEY'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW, DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
DO YOU EVER WISH YOU WEREN'T BORN THIS WAY?
I WASN'T BORN THIS WAY. I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT FOR YEARS. THAT'S HOW I GOT THIS WAY.
THERE HAD TO BE A WAY HE COULD BE PART OF SOCIETY.
ANY PILATES?
NO WAY.
ANY YOGA?
LOOK AT THIS BODY. DO YOU THINK I COULD DO YOGA.
MAYBE NOT, BUT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING I COULD DO TO HELP MARK. SEE, THERE'S OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE OUT HERE. THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR ME. I'M OUT OF HERE. WALKING.
SO FOR NOW HE WORKS OUT ALONE IN A YARD, MOVING [BLEEPED] BACK  AND FORTH, HOPING FOR A DAY WHEN HE CAN LIFT WEIGHTS FREELY AGAIN. IT'S SO SAD.
Jon: JASON JONES.
