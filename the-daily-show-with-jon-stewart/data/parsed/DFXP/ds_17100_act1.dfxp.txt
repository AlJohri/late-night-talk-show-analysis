MAY 7, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: EE-HOW. WEIRDEST AUDIENCE TONIGHT. IN CHINA, YOUR NAME SOUNDS LIKE (BEEP). WELL, IN IOWA THEY LOVE IT WHEN YOU MAKE FUN OF THEM. I REALLY... I'M JUST GOING TO STOP ASKING THEM QUESTIONS. SERIOUSLY, IN IOWA-- AND THIS IS TRUE. IN IOWA THEY ARE SO HARD UP FOR CELEBRITIES THERE'S A SIGN UP THAT SAYS, "HOME OF THE  FUTURE BIRTH PLACE OF CAPTAIN KIRK." IS THAT TRUE? I KNOW THAT IS TRUE. YOU WERE THINKING I WAS CREATING THAT TO USE HYPERBOLE TO CREATE HUMOR. (BEEP) TRUE. LET'S MOVE ON. BECAUSE I KNOW THE AUDIENCE AT HOME, THEY'RE LIKE, OH, GOOD, INSIDE JOKES. (SIGHING) ANYWAY, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. GUEST TONIGHT ADMIRAL GENERAL SHABAZZ ALADEEN, LEADER OF WADIYA, A SMALL OIL-RICH  AUTOCRATIC STATE IN, LET'S SAY, NORTH AFRICA. OUR NEW SEGMENT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANDER CAKES. FIRST UP, RUSSIA WHERE NEWLY RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT VLADE MILES AN HOUR PUTIN... JUST GO TO THE TAPE.
I MEAN IT'S POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE INSIDE THE KREMLIN. PUTIN IS SWORN IN AS RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT.
PUTIN WON RUSSIA'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN MARCH BUT OPPOSITION LEADERS CLAIM  THAT HE DID SO LARGELY BECAUSE OF FRAUD AND BALLOT STUFFING.
Jon: A BUNCH OF SORE LOSERS. AND BY "SORE," I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN BEATEN BRUTALLY. THEY ACTUALLY ARE BRUISED. PUTIN'S INAUGURATION BEGAN, OF COURSE, WITH THE TRADITIONAL SWEARING-IN BY PLACING THE  HAND UPON RUSSIA'S WINE LIST. AND THE PRESIDENTIAL STRUT THROUGH RUSSIA'S FAMED SALUTE TO THE VALUES OF THE  STRUGGLING PROCEED LEE TEAR YAT ROOM. THAT LOOKS LIKE THE INSIDE OF DONALD TRUMP'S ANUS. LOOK AT THAT THING. THE PEOPLE MUST CONTROL THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION. (BEEP) ARE THOSE DIAMONDS? SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT PUTIN'S MELODRAMATIC GOVERNING STYLE, HIS HARD-LINE  OPPRESSION OF FREE PRESS AND DISSENT IN ANY FORM, YOU HAD TO BE MOVED BY HOW MUCH PUTIN  IS ENJOYING THIS MOMENT. THERE HE IS. LIVING IN... LIVING THE DREAM. JUST BESIDE HIMSELF. OVERJOYED. CAN'T BELIEVE... HE SAYS, I HAVE BEEN HAPPIER GETTING A COLONOSCOPY. THIS MAN IS BEING... THE MAN'S FACE LOOKS LIKE HOW YOU WOULD IMAGINE A NOVEL  CHARACTERISTICALLY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WERE OVERJOYED.
PUTIN HAS POWER ILLEGITIMATELY ILLEGALLY COME TO POWER AGAIN.
Jon: WHAT A NICE MAN. HE WILL BE MISSED. MOVING WEST. SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COMBINE DISPARATE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH A VARIETY OF  CULTURES AND LANGUAGES, ONE MADE-UP CURRENCY, A GLOBAL FINANCIAL MELTDOWN AND A  SOCIAL SAFETY NET THAT OFFERS WORKERS 30 WEEKS PAID VACATION A YEAR, WORKERS RETIREMENT AT  26 AND CHOCOLATE. LET'S GO EUROPE. EITHER THE FAULT LINE BETWEEN EUROPE'S RULING CLASS AND ITS DENISONS HAS JUST CRACKD OPEN  OR MANCHESTER UNITED HAS DRAWN WITH BARCELONA. YES, AUSTERITY HAS PROVEN TO BE QUITE UNPOPULAR AMONGST THE NEWLY AUSTERE. IT'S EFFECTS ARE NOW BEING FELT ELECTORALLY.
IN GREECE THE TWO MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES CENTER RIGHT AND SOCIALIST PARTIES WHO  BACKED THE BAILOUT TOGETHER WON ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE VOTE. VOTERS REJECTED THEM BOTH IN FAVOR OF MORE EXTREME PARTIES ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT.
Jon: INTERESTING CHOICE. RATHER THAN CHOOSING A SINGLE PATH GREECE HAS GONE WITH THE BY POLAR APPROACH.
THE LEFT WING PARTY WHICH HAS A VERY RADICAL PROGRAM AND PROBABLY HOLDS THE SWING VOTES  IN THE PARLIAMENT NOW. YOU KNOW, IT'S BASICALLY AN OLD LINE COMMUNIST PARTY.
GREECE FOR THIS ELECTION OVER THE WEEKEND YOU SAW 20 NEO NAZI CANDIDATES WHO CAME  INTO POWER. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE 1974.
Jon: GREECE ELECTED OLD LINE COMMUNISTS AND NEO NAZIS TO RULE AT THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT GET US OUT OF OUR CHAOTIC POLITICAL SITUATION? WHAT IF WE TOOK TWO FAILED YET OPPOSING IDEOLOGIES, YOU KNOW, THE ONES THAT BATTLED IN WORLD WAR II, AND HIRED THEM? IT'S LIKE IF YOU TAKE A REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUP BUT INSTEAD OF CHOCOLATE AND  PEANUT YOU, YOU USE (BEEP) AND POISON. STILL NOW I MAY BE WRONG THOUGH. THESE ARE NEO NAZIS. THEY ANY BE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR NAZI CLASSIC. LESS HATE. MAYBE A YOUNG TUNE FOR THE KIDS TO DANCE TO. LET'S HEAR THEIR PLATFORM.
SEAL OUR BORDERS WITH MINES.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. (BEEP) SEAL YOUR BORDERS WITH MINES? I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS GREECE'S NEW TOURISM MOTTO. ALL RIGHT. GREECE WAS JUST ONE OF TWO COUNTRIES HOLDING ELECTIONS THIS WEEKEND. THE OTHER FRANCE. WHERE PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY SQUARED OFF AGAINST FRANCOIS HOLLANDE. FRENCH VOTERS GIVEN THE CHOICE A BUREAUCRAT WITH A IMPLAUSIBLY HOT WIFE OR THE BUREAUCRAT WITH THE  IMPLAUSIBLY HOT GIRLFRIEND. WHERE'S MY LIST OF THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT FRANCE. LET ME PUT THIS ON THERE. WHY DO ALL YOUR ELDERLY MIDDLE AGED BUREAUCRATS HAVE REALLY HOT SPOUSES OR GIRL FRIENDS? IT'S ON MY LIST WITH WHY ARE ALL YOUR SKUNKS SO DATE RAPEY? WHY WHEN YOU BUY BAGUETTE DO YOU ONLY GET HALF A BAG TO PUT IT IN? AND I MEAN, BAG IS IN THE NAME. WHY DO YOU PUT YOUR MOST HUNCH BACKED PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF RINGING YOUR HEAVIEST BELLS? DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR KIDS SHOULD BE DRINKING WINE? WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE WALKING AGAINST THE WIND? HOW WINDY DOES IT GET THERE? GIRARD DE PAR DUE. ANYWAY (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I HAVE A WHOLE LIST. I CAN KEEP GOING. ANYWAY, THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION HOLLANDE. HE PROMISED TO ECHBD THE SHARP CUTBACKS INITIATED BY SARKOZY. IN AN EXCITING MOMENT IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE VERY... GREECE AND FRANCE SENDING A COURSE-CORRECTING MESSAGE THAT THE AUSTERITY MEASURES IS PART  OF AN HE U STABILITY PACT WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE CITIZENS OF THOSE COUNTRIES AND WILL  NOT STAND.
GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL HAS ALREADY STARTED FIRING OFF THE WARNING SHOTS.
WE IN GERMANY ARE OF THE OPINION-- AND THAT INCLUDES MYSELF PERSONNELY-- THAT THE  STABILITY PACTS CANNOT BE RENEGOTIATED, MERCKEL SAYS.
Jon: GERMANY. I FORGOT EUROPE'S MOST POWERFUL ECONOMY HOLDS MOST OF THE CARDS. IN SOME WAYS THEIR POWER CAN NULLIFY THE EFFECTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES' ELECTIONS. THAT'S RIGHT. NEARLY 70 YEARS AFTER THE END OF WOFLD WAR 2, GERMANY CONTROLS ALL OF EUROPE. THE IRONY. THEY DON'T HAVE AN ARMY. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE KEY TO GERMAN WORLD DOMINATION WOULD WIND UP BEING AN  INTERNATIONAL BANKING CONSPIRACY? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
