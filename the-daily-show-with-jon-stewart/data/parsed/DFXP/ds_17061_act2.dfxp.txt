(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. LET'S CHECK IN WITH "BACK IN BLACK."
TEN DAYS AGO WE LOST A GREAT PERFORMER, WHITNEY HOUSTON. AND AS WITH PAST CELEBRITY DEATHS, THE MEDIA OBSERVED HER PASSING IN THE TRADITION OF THE  NATIVE AMERICANS-- BY USING EVERY PART OF THE TRAGEDY. (LAUGHTER) FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW WITH VERY LITTLE SKILL YOU CAN TURN A  SONG CATALOG INTO HOURS OF TERRIBLE SEGWAYS.
FOR A TIME, SHE WAS POP'S GREATEST LOVE OF ALL.
PLUS WHITNEY HOUSTON'S GREATEST LOVE. INSIDE HER ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH BOBBY BROWN.
AND FANS WHO, DESPITE HER SAD UNRAVELING, WILL ALWAYS LOVE HER.
WE WON'T HAVE TO BE REMEMBERING HER SOUND TRACK FROM  "THE BODYGUARD," IF ONLY SHE'D GUARDED HER OWN BODY BETTER. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
HEY (BLEEP) HOLE! SOMEONE DIED! CAN WE COOL IT WITH THE WORD PLAY? WHEN CRONKITE ANNOUNCED THE DEATH OF J.F.K., IT WASN'T WITH  A CLEVER "ASK NOT WHO GOT SHOT IN DALLAS TODAY." (LAUGHTER)  AS FOR CNN'S RESIDENT HEARSE CHASER NANCY GRACE, SHE MANAGED TO TURN THE TRAGIC ACCIDENT INTO  MURDER MYSTERY DINNER THEATER.
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS IN HER SYSTEM AND I'D LIKE  TO FIND OUT WHO, IF ANYONE, PUT IT IN HER SYSTEM OR GAVE IT TO HER. NOW, I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO WAS AROUND HER, WHO IF ANYONE GAVE HER A DRUG FOLLOWING ALCOHOL AND  DRUGS AND WHO LET HER SLIP OR PUSHED HER UNDERNEATH THAT WATER.
OF COURSE! SHE WAS PUSHED UNDERWATER! AND I KNOW WHO DID IT! THE DUKE LACROSSE TEAM! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) IT'S THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR SOMEONE DYING  AFTER YEARS OF DRUG ADDICTION. OF COURSE, WHILE THE THROWING OUT MURDER ALLEGATIONS IS ONLY THE FIRST STAGE OF GRIEF. SOON NANCY ENTERED THE SECOND STAGE-- DOUBLING DOWN.
CAN'T YOU JUST SAY "YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS WILDLY SPECULATING  AND I'M SORRY"? ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SHOULD BE SAYING?
THAT IS NOT SPECULATION, DAN.
IT'S NOT SPECULATION SHE MAY HAVE BEEN PUSHED UNDER THE WATER?
I KNOW THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE NEVER TRIED A MURDER CASE OR BEEN IN A MORGUE OR ATTENDED AN AUTOPSY. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE AN AUTOPSY.
YES. THAT'S WHY WE DO AUTOPSIES. THAT'S ALSO WHY WE WAIT FOR THE RESULTS (BLEEP) HOLE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND P.S., NANCY, I'VE BEEN TO A MORGUE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT? IN A MORGUE EVERYONE WHO'S HAD THEIR BRAINS REMOVED KEEPS THEIR MOUTHS SHUT! OF COURSE, NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT GOOD TASTE IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY LIKE ERIC BOWLEN. THE GUY WHO WENT ON FOX BUSINESS NEWS TO TALK ABOUT THE HEART BREAK OF LOSING HIS SAFETY  DEPOSIT BOX OF CASH ON 9/11. FOR HIM, WHITNEY'S DEATH WAS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR NONE OTHER THAN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN  MAXINE WATERS.
WHAT IS GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA? HOW'S THIS? CONGRESSWOMAN, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO WHITNEY HOUSTON. STEP AWAY FROM THE CRACK PIPE. STEP AWAY FROM THE COMPANY TPHABGS. STEP AWAY...
SHE'S NOT USING DRUGS.
IT'S GOING TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE. (BOOS)
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT! A BELOVED POP ICON'S DEATH USED TO CRITICIZE THE DEMOCRATS' CHOICE FOR THE BANKING COMMITTEE. BUT, HEY, WHY STOP THERE? WHITNEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ALL THOSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IF NOT FOR OBAMACARE! (LAUGHTER) THANKFULLY, ERIC BOLLING APOLOGIZED WITH ALL THE SINCERITY OF A KID DRAGGED TO  THE NEIGHBOR'S PORCH BY HIS DAD.
ALL RIGHT, BEFORE WE GET STARTED I JUST WANT TO SAY I WAS KIDDING ABOUT THE CRACK PIPE. JUST KIDDING.
(LAUGHS) I GET IT! THEY'RE BOTH BLACK LADIES! I LOVE YOU! YOU'RE GREAT, ERIC BOLLING. FINALLY A GUY WHO SAYS WHAT ONLY ASS (BLEEP)S ARE THINKING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHO? TOO SOON? JUST KIDDING. JON?
