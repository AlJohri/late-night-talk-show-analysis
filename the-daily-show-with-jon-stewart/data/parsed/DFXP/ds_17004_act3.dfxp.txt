(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR, YOU CAN CATCH HIM ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JASON SUDEIKIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APOLOGISE TO YOU, I HAVE WHAT THEY CALL STREP THROAT EVEN THOUGH I'M A GROWN MAN. THEY SWABBED AND I DID NOT WANT TO IN ANY WAY PASS THE STREP ON TO YOU, ALTHOUGH  NOW THAT I REALIZE THIS I DO USE MY JACKET TO WIPE MY NOSE.
YEAH WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T DO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A NOSE LIKE MINE.
I WAS GOING TO-- COME ON, COME ON, TAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF. YOU LOOK GREAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING MAN.
HOW IS THE SHOW THIS WEEK.
WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE WEEK SO IT'S GREAT NOW. WE GOT TWO DAYS TO SCREW IT UP.
Jon: "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" IS LIKE PUTTING ON EVERY WEEK, YEAH, AN HOUR  AND A HALF FULL ON BROADWAY THEE AT CALL PRODUCTION.
BIG OLD VARIETY SHOW.
Jon: THAT IS DIFFERENT EVERY WEEK. IT IS A MONSTER UNDERTAKING.
IT CERTAINLY IS I CERTAINLY HAD MY FEELINGS BEFORE WORKING ABOUT IT, ONCE YOU GOT THERE YOU BECOME INUNDATED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WEEK AFTER WEEK. YOU ARE LIKE THIS IS HARD AS HELL. AND THE VARIABLES ARE OUTSIDE-- WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND INTERNALLY  DIFFERENT MUSIC, DIFFERENT HOSTS. YOU GOT TO, WE CALL IT EACH WEEK LIKE STARTING AT THE BOTTOM OF SKETCH MOUNTAIN  AND TRYING TO PUSH THIS GIANT BOULDER, I THINK THAT WAS AMY POHLER LINE. WE HAVE REOCCURRING CHARACTERS, NOT AS MUCH WHEN WATCHING THE SHOW LIKE WHEN  I WAS GROWING UP AM BUT YOU ARE LITERAL LEIGH TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW  AND YOU FAIL AT LEAST 20 TIMES A WEEK. AND THEN YOU GET-- THEN HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T ON SATURDAY.
Jon: HOPEFULLY. I DON'T HAVE ANY FACTS TO BACK THIS UP--  (LAUGHTER) BUT I HEARD LAST YEAR 30  PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN AN AVALANCHE ON SKETCH MOUNTAIN.
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
NOBODY, IT'S TRUE.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY I DON'T HAVE THE FACTS BUT I HEARD THERE WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY  ON SKETCH MOUNTAIN.
AWFUL, HORRIBLE.
Jon: I DONE KNOW IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SAY THIS EDDIE MURPHY, IS HE COMING ON THE SHOW.
I DONE KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I AM-- .
Jon: THEY IF THEY DON'T TELL YOU.
THEY DON'T CLEAR ANYTHING WITH ME, NOT AT ALL, NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL. WHEN WE PICKED THE ELECTION IN 2008, HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. I DON'T HAVE THE FACTS TO BACK THAT UP.
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T.
Jon: NOBODY HAS THE FACTS TO BACK THAT UP.
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN CAHOOTS IT THERE. BUT NO, I DON'T KNOW. YOU MEAN THE GUY THAT PLAYED THIRD BASE FOR THE ORIOLES, EDDIE MURRAY.
Jon: SWITCH HITTER. TREMENDOUS BALLPLAYER.

Jon: I ALWAYS WANTED-- ED YEE MURPHY IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS TO COME BACK TO SNL  WOULD BE GREAT.
ONE OF THE BEST EVER. ON THE MT. RUSHMORE. I WON'T KNOW UNTIL SUNDAY. I GET THE BLINDERS ON, I'M THERE, I'M JUST DOING MY THING, IF EDDY MURPHY WHAT  WAS THERE I WOULD BE LIKE WHAT, NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING.
Jon: WHAT IS THE BEST BAND YOU EVER SAW, HAS THERE BEEN A MUSICAL ACT WHERE YOU  ARE LIKE I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THESE GUYS ARE HERE THIS WEEK.
WHEN YOU GET TO SEE YOU2 AND BONO, HE DOES NOT CARE WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE FACING, HE WILL JUMP UP, WALK AROUND, JUMP ON YOUR HEADS LIKE HE IS ROBERTO BENIGNI. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE TO SEE BUT THEN LIKE A PERSONAL FAVORITE ARE WILLCO, GETTING  WILLCO ON, THATS WITH A BIG MOMENT WHERE WE GOT TO SEE JUST THEIR NAME AS A  POSSIBILITY AND SETH MEYERSï¿½ï¿½ AND I ARE BIG FANS AND I WALKED IN SAND AID WILLCO  MIGHT MAKE THE SHOW. WE GOT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. AND AGAIN NOT HAVING ANY INFLUENCE, SETH HAVING MUCH, MUCH MORE INFLUENCE, AND LOREN HAVING THE MOST INFLUENCE OVER HIS OWN SHOW, WHICH IS GOOD TO HE NO. HE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON, LUCKILY. HAND THEY GOT TO COME ON SO, THAT WAS REALLY, REALLY NEAT, AND THE FOO FILERS JOO THERE IS THE SHOW AND THEN THERE IS ALSO PROBABLY A SOUND  REHEARSAL, WHERE THEY ARE PROBABLY JUST SITTING THERE WHERE YOU CAN PROBABLY TOUCH THEM.
PAUL McCARTNY, PAUL McCARTNY -- EVEN PLAY BUT REHEARSED MAYBE ON-- I AM  AMAZED, I LOVE THAT SONG. AND HE WAS DOING IT RIGHT THEREs, JUST HIM AND A PIANO AND WE ARE ALL LIKE 40 FEET AWAY.
Jon: YOU FORGET IT IS PAUL McCARTNY UNTIL YOU TRY TO TAKE A PICTURE AND A BIG  BLACK GUY SLAPS YOUR HAND AND YOU ARE LIKE RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. MY BAD, REGGIE, MY BAD.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW McCARTNY WAS CARRYING MUSCLE.
OH, YEAH, HE IS, SECRET MUSCLE. LIKE-- BEATLES MUSCLE, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT IS HAPPENING. IT IS LIKE YOU FIND OUT THAT LAST SECOND.
Jon: I ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW WHAT -- THEY SMELL LIKE --
