(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HI! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. QUICK QUESTION: ARE YOU WHITE? (LAUGHTER) IF SO, LAST FRIDAY'S DISMAL MAY UN EMPLOYMENT FIGURES WERE BAD. BUT NOT MINORITY BAD.
THE PERSISTENT UNEMPLOYMENT YOU HAVE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY  14% COMPARED TO WHITES WHICH IS 7%. LATINO COMMUNITY 11% UNEMPLOYMENT TO WHITES 7%.
WOW, DOUBLE-DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT FOR BLACKS AND LATINOS. THAT COULD REALLY HURT OBAMA'S CHANCES AMONGST... WELL, JUST THE LATINOS. I MEAN, THAT'S... LET'S BE FRANK. (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE ON THIS, WE TURN TO SENIOR LATINO ECONOMIC ANALYST AL MADRIGAL. AL, THANKS FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DOES 11% IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY PUT THE LATINO COMMUNITY IN PLAY  FOR THIS ELECTION?
I MEAN, IT MAY. BUT EVEN 11% PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE 98.7% UNEMPLOYMENT LATINOS FACE ELSEWHERE.
Jon: 98.... WHERE?
RIGHT HERE, JON. SHOW BUSINESS. (LAUGHTER) TELEVISIONE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU'RE LATINO AND OFF JOB IN SHOW BUSINESS.
YES, I HAVE THE JOB, JON. DO ME A FAVOR: TRY TO NAME ONE OTHER LATINO ON TELEVISION.
Jon: OH. ALL RIGHT, LET'S. ..
NOT GERALDO.
Jon: OKAY. OH!
LOPEZ WAS CANCELED JON.
Jon: (BLEEP). IS WHITNEY...
NO!
Jon: EITHER OF THE BROKE GIRLS?
YOU'D THINK SO, BUT NO. (LAUGHTER) "DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES" WITH EVA LONGORIA? THAT WAS CANCELED.
Jon: DOE EQUIS MAN? THE MOST INTERESTING MAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REAL INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT MAN IS?
Jon: WHAT?
HIS REAL NAME IS JONATHAN GOLDSMITH.
Jon: YES! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) O.K., SOFIA VERGARA, MODERN FAMILY HIT SHOW LEAD ROLE.
NOW, THAT DOES NOT COUNT BECAUSE SHE'S HOT FIRST, LATINA SECOND. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THERE ARE STILL ROLES.
YEAH, DEGRADING STUFF, STEREOTYPE STUFF. LATINO ACTORS ARE REDUCED TO HANGING OUT IN FRONT OF A HOME DEPOT WAITING FOR A PRODUCER TO  PULL UP WITH DAY WORK. NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING A HOUSE PAINTER WHO CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT! (IN A SPANISH ACCENT) YOU SAID PAINT THE WHOLE HOUSE. AREN'T THE WINDOWS PART OF THE HOUSE? AI, AI, AI, I'M SORRY!
Jon: (LAUGHS) WHO PAINTS THE WINDOWS? IT'S GOOD WRITING BUT YOU REALLY BROUGHT IT TO LIFE. FORGET SITCOMS. WHAT ABOUT DRAMATIC ROLES?
AT THIS POINT LATINOS WOULD BE LUCKY TO GET CAST AS THE SECOND GUY KILLED IN SOME  CRAZY-ASS SPACE FLICK. (IN A SPANISH ACCENT) DON'T WORRY, GUYS, I'LL CHECK OUT THE CAVE. IT'S GOT MY LEGS! AHHH! (LAUGHTER) UGH. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT ABOUT... WHAT ABOUT UNIVISION? TELENOVELLAS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
Jon: WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY?
Jon: TELENOVELLAS, UNIVISION? TELENOVELLAS?
I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH. I'M FOURTH GENERATION.
Jon: THANK YOU, AL
