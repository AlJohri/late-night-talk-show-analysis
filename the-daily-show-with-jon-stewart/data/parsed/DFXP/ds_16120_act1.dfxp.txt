BIG BUZZ AT THE U.N. TODAY AS DIPLOMATS LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING HOME EARLY FROM WORK.

Jon: AND THEN THE WIFE HAS THE LITTLE--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE PERFORMANCE OF SPONGE NUT CRAZY PANT AS SIDE--  (LAUGHTER)
THE U.N. HAD MORE PRESSING ISSUES TO DISCUSS. AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT ONGOING PROPERTY LINE DISPUTE IN THE AREA WHAT  EVERYBODY CALLS PALESTINE CALLS ISRAEL AND WHAT EVERYBODY BUT ISRAEL CALLS PALESTINE. SO FOR I GUESS AROUND THE PAST 6,000 YEARS, THESE TWO PARTIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SETTLE THE ZONING  DISAGREEMENT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, PERSISTENT BLOODSHED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SINCE THIS METHOD HAS PROVEN SOMEWHAT INCONCLUSIVE THE PARTIES  FROM TIME TO TIME SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE, PARDON THE PUN, UNORTH-- UNORTH DOX-- UNORTHODOX METHOD TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.
THE PALESTINIANS HAVE FLOWN A SYMBOLIC CHAIR TO THE UNITED FACIALS AHEAD OF  NEXT WEEK'S GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THAT'S WHEN PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT ABBAS PLANS TO MAKE A BID FOR U.N. MEMBERSHIP.
Jon: THAET, APPARENTLY THE UNITED NATIONS IS BRING YOUR OWN MOTHER [BLEEP] CHAIR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE U.N. PROVIDES THE TRANSLATORS, YOU PROVIDE THE CHAIR, AND HEAD PHONE  RENTALS ARE $3. (LAUGHTER) SMALL PRICE TO PLAY TO STEAL AND KILL WITH DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. OH, REALLY. (LAUGHTER) OH REALLY. (APPLAUSE) BELIEVE ME, YOU GET ONE OF THEM DIPLOMATIC LICENCE PLATES [BLEEP] RED LIGHTS. (LAUGHTER) THE CHAIRS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPRESSIVE PART OF THE U.N.. THE TURKS HAVE THEIR OTTO-MAN EMPIRE. SWEDEN BROUGHT THEIR NATIONAL CHAIR, THE GLURKE. (LAUGHTER) AND UNASSEMBLED PILE OF WOOD AND OF COURSE -- (APPLAUSE)
AUSTRALIAN RELIES ON POUCHIE, THE WORLD'S MOST PATIENT KANGAROO. POUCHIE. JOINING THE U.N. ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS JUST BRINGING A CHAIR.
WHEN I RECEIVED AN-- FROM A STATE FOR AN ADMISSION INTO THE UNITED NATIONS, I  REVIEW ALL THESE TECHNICAL ISSUES, WHETHER THIS IS IN PROPER FORM.
Jon: REALLY THERE IS AN APPLICATION PROCESS FOR JOINING THE U.N. WHO DID  NORTH KOREA USE AS A REFERENCE ON THEIR APPLICATION? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND SYRIA, A COUNTRY WHO HAS BEGUN FIRING AT ITS OWN PEOPLE, THEY MUST HAVE  HAD GOOD TEST SCORES OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM IN. ALTHOUGH I GUESS ONCE YOU GET TENURE. YOU KNOW, THE REAL ISSUE ISN'T REALLY THE CHAIR OR THE APPLICATION, AS WITH ANY  GOOD CO-OP, IT'S GETTING PAST THAT ONE HARD ASS ON THE CO-OP BOARD WHO ALWAYS  CHEWS PEOPLE DOWN, WITHOUT DOESN'T LIKE DOGS BUT HE HAS TWO GREAT DAINS BECAUSE HE  WAS GRANDFATHERED IN. (LAUGHTER) MADE ME SO MAD. SO ARE THE PALESTINIANS IN?
PEACE WILL NOT COME THROUGH STATEMENTS AND RESOLUTIONS AT THE UNITED NATIONS. ULTIMATELY THE ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS, NOT US, WHO MUST REACH AGREEMENT ON  ISSUES THAT DIVIDE THEM.
Jon: SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST OUR BUILDING. (LAUGHTER) AND PLEASE COME BACK ONCE SU HAVE A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FROM YOUR MORTAL ENEMY. (LAUGHTER)
ALSO WE'RE GOING TO NEED PAY STUBS. (LAUGHTER) SO THERE YOU GO, PALESTINE, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SETTLE YOUR DIFFERENCES WITH ISRAEL. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE AN IDEA, MAYBE THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT A SPELLING CHANGE? NICE. GOOD. GOOD. WAIT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
