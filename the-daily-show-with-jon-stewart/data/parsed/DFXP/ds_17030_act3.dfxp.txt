Jon: SO THEY'RE ORGAN SNICK.
YES, YES.
Jon: THAT'S VERY NICE.
THEY DON'T WORK AS WELL AS THE ONES AT RITE AID.
Jon: THOSE A R THE ONE THEY MAKE WITH THE PLASTIC COATING.
EXACTLY.
Jon: BY THE WAY, LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE I ENDED UP GETTING A NOTE FROM YOUR THAT YOUR  GRANDMOTHER WANTED TO TALK TO ME. OR YOU WANTED ME TO TALK TO HER? AND I... I DIDN'T GET BACK TO HER.
YEAH.
Jon: OR DID I...
OH, YES, YEAH. AND ALSO I WANTED YOU TO CALL MY GRANDMA.
Jon: YOU WANTED ME TO CALL YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
WELL, NANNY, JON STEWART IS TALKING TO YOU.
Jon: I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I GOT THE NOTE... THERE WAS NO NUMBER. IT SAID "I HAD A NOTE THAT SAID "CALL MY GRANDMOTHER" BUT THEN  THERE WAS NO NUMBER SO I SAT IN MY OFFICE LIKE, "GRANDMA?"  LIKE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. NOW WHAT WAS IT... FIRST OF ALL, "MONEYBALL." YOU WERE AWESOME THIS THAT.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: THAT WAS TREMENDOUS. (APPLAUSE) AND THAT THIS ONE LOOKS GREAT, TOO. I CAN'T WAIT TO TAKE MY KIDS TO IT. IT LOOKS GREAT.
YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE... YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THIS MOVIE.
Jon: IT'S ABOUT BABY-SITTING, I'M ASSUMING IT'S  "ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING." INTRO.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW AWAY MONEY BECAUSE YOU'D PUT YOUR CHILDREN IN THERAPY. IT'S KIND OF A RESPONSE TO THOSE AWFUL MOVIES WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU  DON'T WANT THIS GUY WATCHING YOUR KIDS BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO  GIVE THEM SOME CANDY AND THEY'RE GOING TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT. OUR VERSION IS LIKE, NO, NO, NO, REALLY... YOU DON'T WANT THIS GUY WATCHING YOUR KIDS. (LAUGHTER) SOMETHING REALLY AWFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THEY'RE NEVER COMING BACK FROM THAT.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKEN ON A DRUG RUN AND CHASE BID DRUG  DEALERS THROUGH NEW YORK CITY. IT'S SO (BLEEP)ED UP. THE MOVIE'S SO... IT'S A SO AWESOME. AND "MONEYBALL" IT WAS SUCH A CRAZY EXPERIENCE. LIKE, I'M STILL KIND OF... I DID CHARLIE ROSE TODAY WITH BRAD PITT AND BENNETT MILL CHER FOR  ME WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, SUCH A SURREAL... SNY NOW WHEN BRAD HIT BRAD  PITT IS IN THE ROOM, DO THEY SIT PEOPLE ACCORDING TO HANDSOMENESS?
IT GOES ME, BRAD, CHARLIE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY? THIS IS ANOTHER RANDOM SUBJECT. IT'S SHOT IN THE BLOOMBERG BUILDING AND BRAD WAS THERE AND PEOPLE WERE OUT OF THEIR OFFICES  WAITING LIKE IT WAS BIEBER FEVER. AND I WAS LIKE, MAN, IF I WAS YOUR BOSS I WOULD FIRE YOU PEOPLE. LIKE, I UNDERSTAND IT'S EXCITING THAT BRAD PITT THERE IS BUT YOU'RE AT WORK RIGHT NOW!
Jon: YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND, WORK FOR THEM IS FOLLOWING A TICKER.
EXACTLY.
Jon: SO THEY SIT IN THE THING AND THEY GO "OH, LOOK AT ALCOA."  AND THEN BRAD PITT'S HERE!
(LAUGHS) YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Jon: DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A JONAH HILL LINE.
THERE WERE THREE TEENAGE ASIAN BOYS THAT WERE PRETTY EXCITED I WAS THERE. THEY HAD A "CALL OF DUTY" POSTER THEY WANTED KNOW SIGN. BUT BRAD IS THE COOLEST GUY. HE REALLY IS.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE THAT.
HE IS!
Jon: NO, LET ME SAY THIS...
HE'S SO HANDSOME.
Jon: I WISH HE WAS. HE'S NOT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LIKE HIM SO MUCH. HE LET ME LIVE IN HIS... I WAS SHOOTING IN NEW ORLEANS AND HE LET ME LIVE IN HIS HOUSE. HE SAID... I'M LIKE, I'M THERE FOR THREE AND A HALF FOUR MONTHS  HE'S LIKE "THAT'S COOL. LIVE IN MY HOUSE."
Jon: CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION VERY QUICKLY? WAS ANGIE HOME? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW COOL IS THAT, THEN? HOW COOL IS HE? IS HE THAT COOL? IS HE LIKE...
HE'S NOT THAT COOL. NOT THAT COOL. BUT HE LET ME LIVE IN HIS HOUSE AND I WAS SHOOTING A MOVIE "21  JUMP STREET" IN NEW ORLEANS AND IT WAS SO FUN AND EVERY NIGHT  I'D GET PICKED UP IN A BLACK S.U.V. AND DROPPED OFF BUT PEOPLE IN NEW ORLEANS KNOW IT'S  BRAD PITT'S HOUSE, IT'S LITERALLY ON THE TOUR SO I WOULD GO HOME EVERYDAY FROM WORK AND  THERE WOULD BE A TOUR OUTSIDE AND THEY'D BE FREAKING OUT AND I'D GET OUT OF THE CAR AND  THEY'D LITERALLY GO... YOU COULD HEAR A COLLECTIVE AUDIBLE SIGH  OF ANNOYANCE WHEN IT WASN'T BRAD PITT. EVERYBODY WAS LIKE "OH, IT'S NOT HIM, JUST SOME GUY!" (LAUGHTER)  AND THEN YOU HEAR ONE GUY GO "OH, HEY, IS THAT... OH, OKAY. OH." ONE GUY BUT NOT LIKE "HEY, MAN." JUST LIKE "OH, IT'S THAT GUY."  JUST LIKE THAT. BUT I KIND OF GOT ADDICTED TO THAT SIGH OF LETTING PEOPLE DOWN. I KIND OF LIKED THAT.
Jon: SURE. YES.
SO MY PUBLICIST WHO YOU KNOW WHO IS BACKSTAGE HE SAID YOU'VE  GOT TO START STAYING UNDER AN ALIAS IN HOTELS BECAUSE PEOPLE  KNOW YOU'RE THERE AND THEY'RE CALL UP YOUR ROOM. SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO STAY UNDER SOMEONE'S NAME  WHO'S WAY MORE FAMOUS THAN I AM. (LAUGHTER) SO I STAYED UNDER TOM HANKS FOR A WHILE. (LAUGHTER) AND IT WAS SO FUNNY BECAUSE I'D ORDER ROOM SERVICE AND I'D SAY  "YEAH, I'LL HAVE EGGS BRING IT UP, WHATEVER YOU K K."  AND I'D LOOK AT THEM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE AND I'D LIKE LIKE "HELLO."  THAT'S SO NOT WHAT I WANTED. (LAUGHS)
Jon: THAT'S AN AWESOME DICK MOVE. THAT REALLY IS.
I'M A HUGE PIECE OF (BLEEP).
Jon: STOP IT. YOU'RE DOING GREAT. CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING. LOOK FORWARD TO IT AND SEE US AGAIN SOON.
LOVELY TO BE BACK HERE. THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: "THE SITTER" HOPES IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. JONAH
