AUGUST 17, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAIL SHOW. I'M JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT... OH, YOU'RE TOO KIND. OUR GUEST, FORMER REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIRMAN... OUR GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER REPUBLICAN PARTY  CHAIRMAN MICHAEL STEELE HERE ONCE AGAIN IN NON-PUPPET FORM. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. MUCH MORE DYNAMIC IN NON-PUPPET FORM. OUR COVERAGE OF THE ELEPHANT STAMPEDE TO THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES. AS YOU MAY RECALL, SUNDAY BELONGED TO THE FIERY CONGRESSWOMAN FROM MINNESOTA  MICHELE BACHMANN, WHOSE PERFORMANCE AT THE AMES STRAW POLE VAULTED HER TO THE FRONT OF THE RACE.
FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORY.
Jon: BUT THAT WAS SUNDAY. [LAUGHTER] AFTER CAREFUL REFLECTION, IT WAS DECIDED MONDAY AND TUESDAY BELONGED TO TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK  PERRY, WHOSE STUNNING ENTRANCE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE VAULTED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE RACE.
CHARISMATIC. HE BRINGS A NEW EXCITEMENT AND A LOT OF BUZZ TO THE G.O.P. LANDSCAPE.
Jon: IN FACT, PERRY REMINDS ME A BIT OF A FORMER REPUBLICAN  CONTENDER MICHELE BACHMANN, WHO BROUGHT SO MUCH EXCITEMENT AND BUZZ TO THE G.O.P. LANDSCAPE LO  THOSE MANY HOURS AGO. [LAUGHTER] AS OF TUESDAY NIGHT, MICHELE BACHMANN'S WIN AND RICK PERRY'S  JOLT OF EXCITEMENT BELONG TO THE AGES. SQUIRREL.
SO DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE FIELD, OR ARE WE WAITING FOR PAUL RYAN?
ARE WE GOING TO SEE SOME OTHER PEOPLE LIKE PAUL RYAN?
SOMEBODY WHO CAN MAYBE APPEAL TO MODERATE VOTERS, PAUL RYAN.
HE'S VERY YOUNG AT 41.
BUT HE HAS IDEAS.
I HOPE HE RETURNS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT WAS ALL FROM TODAY. WHY IS THAT? IT'S NEVER ENOUGH FOR THE MEDIA. THEY'RE LIKE CHILDREN. "MOM, CAN I GET A PAUL RYAN?" "I JUST GOT YOU A RICK PERRY, AND YOU ALREADY BROKE YOUR MICHELE BACHMANN."  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OH, AND BEFORE I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE, WHERE THE  [BLEEPED] IS YOUR RON PAUL? [LAUGHTER] AND DON'T TELL ME HE'S NO FUN TO PLAY WITH. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, IT'S NOT LIKE DURING THOSE TWO DAYS WITH RICK PERRY. WE DIDN'T HAVE SOME GOOD TIMES.
PERRY COMES FROM THE RADICAL COUNTRY CLUB THAT LOVES TO REMIND WHITE AMERICA PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS OTHER, NOT LIKE YOU.
GETTING AMERICA BACK TO WORK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT FACES THIS COUNTRY. BEING ABLE TO PAY OFF $14.5 OR $16 TRILLION WORTH OF DEBT, THAT BIG, BLACK CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER AMERICA.
THAT BLACK CLOUD PERRY IS TALKING ABOUT IS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: WAIT. WHAT? [LAUGHTER] PRETTY SURE PERRY WAS SAYING THE BLACK CLOUD IS THE DEBT. IN FACT, IF YOU KEEP THE SOUND BITE GOING...
THAT BIG, BLACK CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER AMERICA, THAT DEBT.
Jon: SEE. "THAT DEBT." AND WHILE THE NEXT DAY ED SCHULTZ DID APOLOGIZE FOR NOT  PLAYING THE WHOLE CLIP, HE NEVER ADDRESSED HIS INSINUATION ABOUT WHAT PERRY MEND WITH THE PHRASE  "BLACK CLOUD OVER AMERICA." BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE THING ABOUT BLACK CLOUDS. SOME PEOPLE SEE A RACIST AND SOME PEOPLE SEE GEORGE WASHINGTON WRESTLING A LEPRECHAUN. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY "THE DAILY SHOW" SENIOR RACE ANALYST WYATT CENAC. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WYATT, THIS WHOLE INCIDENT WITH RICK PERRY AND THE BLACK CLOUD SPEECH, WAS THAT RACIST?
JON, LET ME TAKE. THIS YES, IT WAS. YES, IT WAS. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY RACIST.
Jon: YES, JOHN OLIVER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
DON'T WORRY, WYATT, YOU DON'T NEED TO LOWER YOURSELF TO THIS  BLATANT DISPLAY OF BIGOTRY. DON'T WORRY.
ACTUALLY, JON, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS BIGOTRY.
STOP IT, STOP IT. YOU'RE UNDERSTANDABLY TOO ANGRY TO TALK ABOUT THIS. [LAUGHTER] LET ME CARRY YOUR BURDEN. I'M SORRY, JON, BUT THE POOR GUY HAS BEEN BEATEN DOWN JUST LIKE THOSE POOR PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE  "THE HELP."  [LAUGHTER]
WHEN YOU SAY "THOSE PEOPLE," ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE BLACK  PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WENT TO SEE "THE HELP"?
WHAT? WHY WOULD THEY BE MAD? IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.
NO, IT'S NOT. I'M SORRY. WE WENT TO SEE "THE HELP" LAST NIGHT. OLIVER LIKED IT TO A DISTURBING DEGREE.
YEAH. , I LOVED IT, JON. WHITE PEOPLE ARE AMAZING. [LAUGHTER] WE REALLY ARE.
Jon: CAN I ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION? THE TWO OF YOU WENT TO SEE "THE HELP" TOGETHER?
YEAH.
YES.
Jon: NOT LIKE "CAPTAIN AMERICA." YOU LITERALLY CALLED UP  SOMEBODY, LET'S GO SEE "THE HELP"?
YEAH.
YEAH, HAD DINNER AFTERWARDS. IT WAS GREAT.
Jon: TALKING ABOUT THE REAL ISSUE HERE. IT SEEMS LIKE RICK PERRY WAS CLEARLY REFERRING TO THE DEBT AS A BLACK CLOUD.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, JON. YOU CAN'T USE THAT TERM. NEITHER CAN I. ONLY WYATT CAN USE THAT TERM, IF HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH IT. BESIDES, THIS IS A PATTERN OF RACIALLY INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE FROM RICK PERRY. LISTEN TO WHAT THAT MONSTER SAID AT CPAC IN 2008.
I WOULD SAY THAT WASHINGTON IS THE BLACK HOLE WHERE TOO MANY GOOD IDEAS DISAPPEAR.
I AM SORRY YOU HAD TO HEAR THAT, WYATT.
HEAR WHAT?
"THE BLACK HOLE" IN WASHINGTON. RICK PERRY, WHY ARE ALL THE GOOD IDEAS DISAPPEARING? IS THE BLACK HOLE STEALING THEM ALL? YOU NEVER HEAR ANYONE SAY THAT ABOUT WHITE HOLE, JON. HONESTLY, WHAT YEAR ARE WE LIVING IN HERE?
WHAT'S A WHITE HOLE?
JUST A GOOD, CHRISTIAN, HONEST HOLE, A NORMAL HOLE. JUST A NORMAL HOLE. [LAUGHTER]
JON, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIG THAT DEEP. THERE'S REAL RACISM IN THE WORLD. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN DOUG LAMBBORN SAID THIS.
EVEN IF SOME PEOPLE SAY THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS OR THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE  THAT, THEY WILL HOLD THE PRESIDENT RESPONSIBLE. NOW, I DON'T WANT TO EVEN HAVE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM. IT'S LIKE TOUCHING A TAR BABY AND YOU GET IT... YOU'RE STUCK  AND YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM NOW. [AUDIENCE REACTS] YOU CAN'T GET AWAY.
HOLY CRAP.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY EVEN USED THAT WORD ANYMORE EXCEPT UNCLE REMUS.
I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT? ARE YOU TWO OFFENDED BECAUSE YOU BOTH USED TO BE BABIES?
Jon: JOHN, TAR BABY IS AN OFFENSIVE TERM.
NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S A STICKY BABY THAT'S BEEN COVERED IN TAR. IN ENGLAND WE CALL THEM TACKY TOTS. [LAUGHTER]
LOOK, JOHN, "TAR BABY" IS A TERM THAT CAN'T BE MISINTERPRETED. BLACK CLOUD IS COMMONLY USED AS A METAPHOR. THE REAL BIGOT IS ED SCHULTZ.
Jon: WAIT. WHAT NOW?
YEAH, YEAH, ED SCHULTZ HAS A LONG, DISGUSTING HISTORY OF USING RACIALLY CHARGED LANGUAGE.
CHUCK, SPECULATION IS THE RED HERRING.
RED HERRING? WHAT'S HE SAYING ABOUT NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
SO NATIVE AMERICANS ARE HERRINGS TO HIM, JUST FISHY, UNTRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE?
YEAH, THAT NEED TO BE CAUGHT AND FED TO OUR GOVERNMENT PENGUINS?
YEAH.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S A REACH.
IT IS?
IT IS, JON?
IS IT? IS IT?
IT IS REALLY A REACH, JON?
IS IT? IS IT?
IS IT REALLY REACHING THAT FAR? BECAUSE AFTER YOU SEE THIS, YOU MIGHT OWE US AN APOLOGY.
THE GREAT WHITE HOPE.
THE BLUE DOG, THE RED DOG, THE YELLOW DOGS.
THE WHITE MAN.
THE WHITE LIE. PURPLE-STATE VOTEDDERS.
BROWN SHIRTS.
RED HANDED.
THE YELLOW LOBSTER. [LAUGHTER] JON JON GUY,ER GOT TO TELL YOU, I THINK THAT ONE LITERALLY WAS ABOUT A YELLOW LOBSTER.
REALLY, JON? YOU DON'T THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT CHINA? REALLY? AN ASIAN LOBSTER ALL YELLOW WITH ITS PINCHERS COLLAPSED AROUND THE NUTS OF AMERICA? OH, I WONDER HOW THAT LOBSTER WOULD SOUND TO ED SCHULTZ. OH, HELLO, I'M A LOBSTER. HELLO, LOOK AT MY CLAWS. HEW-WOW.
Jon: THAT IS OFFENSIVE.
IT IS OFFENSIVE. SHAME ON YOU, SCHULTZ. LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
I CAN'T GET THE BAD MAN OUT OF MY BRAIN.
Jon: JOHN OLIVER
