Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. THEY SAY TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE. BUT THEY OFTEN SAY VERY STUPID THINGS. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO HEADED FISH A NEERING IDAHO'S RIVERS. THAT IS JUST WRONG. AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
IDAHO, SOME TO SOME OF AMERICA'S MOST BEAUTIFUL RIVERS. BUT ACCORDING TO CONSERVATIONIST MARV HOYT THERE IS A DARK SECRET LURKING IN THESE WATERS.
THE FISH ARE SUFFERING MASSIVE DEFORMITIES, DEFORMITIES YOU JUST DON'T SEE IN NATURE.
LIKE WHAT?
TWO HEADS.
TWO HEADS?
YES.
OH THAT'S A FISH.
YEAH.
THOSE ARE HEADS.
YES.
EW. OKAY, PUT THAT AWAY. PUT THAT AWAY. WHAT IS CAUSING THAT?
WELL, THAT WAS SELENIUM IN THE WATER. (APPLAUSE) AND WHAT IS SELENIUM.
IT TURNS OUT SELENIUM IS A TOXIC BYPRODUCT OF PHOSPHATE MINING, AND IN  SOUTHEAST IDAHO, ONE COMPANY LOVES MINING PHOSPHATE.
THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES THE SMOKY CANYON MINES.
HAVE YOU SHOWN SIMPLOT THESE MUTE ANT FISH PICTURES?
THOSE PICTURES CAME FROM SIMPLOT'S OWN REPORTS THAT THEY COMMISSIONED IN ORDER  TO GET AROUND THE CURRENT SELENIUM STANDARDS.
YOU SEE, WITH SIX OF SIMPLOT'S SIX IDAHOS TO MATE-- PHOSPHATE MINES CITED  FOR GROSSLY EXCEEDING FEDERAL SELENIUM LIMITS SIMPLOT 250K ACTION AND ISSUED A REPORT SAYING THE  FEDERAL LIMITS NEEDED TO BE HIGHER. I WENT TO SIMPLOT TO TALK IT OVER WITH A COMPANY SPOKESMAN.
YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THIS EXCITING TWO HEADED FISH THAT YOU GUYS ARE DEVELOPING?
WE REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU LEAVE THE PREMISES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ARE YOU-- WHO ARE YOU CALLING? >>.
HI, THIS IS DAVID AT THE SIMPLOT HEADQUARTERS. WE HAVE SOME PESKY REPORTERS HERE WHO WON'T LEAVE AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU  WOULD SEND AN OFFICER TO ESCORT THEM OUT.
SURE, SIMPLOT CAN BULLY ME BUT WAIT UNTIL THE EPA GETS THEIR HANDS ON THE REPORT.
ALL OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES REVIEWED THE REPORT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU ARE SAYING THE EPA SAW THIS REPORT.
UH-HUH.
I BET THEY WERE PISSED, RIGHT.
NO, THEY WERE NOT PISSED. THEY FAILED TO CAUSE A FACT THAT THERE WERE TWO HEADED FISH DEFORMITIES WERE IN THAT REPORT.
THAT CAN'T RIGHT. BUT IN FACT, THE EPA CALLED THE REPORT OUTSTANDING. AND THEY MAY EVEN USE IT TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SELENIUM STANDARDS. WHEN INTERVIEW REQUESTS TO THE EPA WERE IGNORED I HEADED TO THEIR OFFICES TO  SEE HOW THEY COULD OVERLOOK A TWO HEADED FISH. HI. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THE SPOKEY CANYON MINES.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM.
I'M FROM A RIVER UP IN --
NO, NO, WHAT COMPANY ARE YOU FROM.
I'M NOT WITH A COMPANY, I'M FROM A TWO HEADED FISH.
I CALLED THE POLICE BECAUSE I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU WAY YOU ARE GETTING IN OUR FACE.
I CAN'T REALLY MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. I'M A TWO HEADED FISH. I LIVE IN A RIVER.
YOU'RE NOT A FISH. YOU ARE A PERSON.
WHY WOULD THE EPA CALL HOMELAND SECURITY. I NEEDED ANSWERSMENT BUT EVERYWHERE I WENT NO ONE WOULD TALK. WHAT IS THIS? SIMPLOT RUN THIS WHOLE STATE. LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE PLACE I WENT IN IDAHO THERE WAS SIMPLOT. SO I LOOKED THEM UP. AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE LARGEST PRIVATELY HELD AGRIBUSINESS COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. THE GOVERNMENT OF IDAHO WORKED FOR SIMPLOT FOR 30 YEARS AND MARRIED JR  SIMPLOT'S DAUGHTER IDAHO CONGRESSMAN MIKE SIMPSON CHAIRS THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT  SETS THE EPA'S BUDGET. WHAT THE [BLEEP]? IS THIS AN ACTUAL CONSPIRACY?
IT CERTAINLY A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE.
THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS.
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YEAH.
WELL, I'VE RECEIVED THREATENING PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUGGESTED  THAT I DON'T WORK ON THIS ISSUE OR COME BACK TO CARIBOU COUNTY, IDAHO AGAIN.
OKAY. ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME? LOOK, NEXT TIME A FAKE REPORTER COMES TO ASK YOU TO DO AN INTERVIEW ABOUT SIMPLOT, YOU SHOULD LEAD  WITH THE STUFF ABOUT THE THREATS.
IF THEY WERE THREATENING THIS NOBODY, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY GOING DO TO  TELEVISION'S AASIF MANDVI, THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO COULD HELP, ERIN BROKE O VERY MUCH.
I HAVE UNCOVERED A REAL CORPORATE CONSPIRACY. WHAT THE [BLEEP] DO I DO.
YOU HAVE TO EXPOSE IT, MAN. YOU FOUND OUT THAT INFORMATION, YOU HAVE TO EXPOSE THAT INFORMATION. BLOW THE WHISTLE.
I DON'T WANT TO BLOW THE WHISTLEMENT I WANT TO BURY THE WHISTLE.
STOP BEING A PUSSY. IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GO OUT THERE AND MAKE IT RIGHT.
ERIN BROCKOVICH HAD GIVEN ME GOOD ADVICE. I HAD TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
SIM DOES PLOT, A TRUE AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY. AND A COMPANY THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT POLLUTING IDAHO. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SIM DOES PLOT.
NOT VERY MUCH.
OKAY, YOU LOVE THEM. YOU LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM.
YOU CAN LOOK IN THAT CAMERA AND SAY THANK YOU SIMPLOT.
NO, I WON'T.
JUST SAYS THAT, LOOK IN THE CAME RANCE [BLEEP] GUYS.
WELL, YOU HEARD IT HEAR, FOLKS, FISHERMAN IN IDAHO LOVE SIMPLOT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SIMPLOT AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS WATER. HERE WE GO. WE'RE ALL GOOD NOW, SIMPLOT.
AND THERE IS NO WAY WATER THIS CLEAN COULD CAUSE A TWO-HEADED FISH.
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME!
OH, JUST A DREAM. JUST A DREAM. HEY, YOU LOOK BETTER ON TV. AAAHH! SIMPLOT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
