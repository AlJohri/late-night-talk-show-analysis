Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS THE HOST OF CNN'S "LARRY KING LIVE."  HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "TRUTH BE TOLD," IT'S ABOUT HALF CENTURY OF ASKING QUESTIONS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM LARRY KING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT NIGHT TO HAVE ME ON. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT YOU CAN'T AVOID THAT. THERE'S IN THE A SHOW IN THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN GO ON THAT'S  NOT GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT.
WELL, YOU ARE THE ONLY SHOW THAT LED WITH THE ECONOMY. THEY REALLY HAD HIM AND YOU HELD HIM FOR ME.
Jon: I STARTED WITH THE ECONOMY, AND THEN I BUILT. NOW YOU'RE THE CLOSER, MY FRIEND HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? ARE YOU DOING YOUR STAND-UP TOUR NOW? ARE YOU OUT ON THE ROAD DOING IT?
I'M OUT. WE'VE DONLAN TICK CITY AND BOSTON AND INDIANAPOLIS AND SATURDAY NIGHT WE'RE IN VEGAS. AND IN VEGAS MY WIFE'S GOING TO OPEN FOR ME. WE'RE AT THE MIRAGE.
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.
THEN SUNDAY NIGHT IN PHOENIX. THEN IN SEPTEMBER I'M GOING TO EUROPE. I'M DOING COMEDY IN OSLO AND IN REYKJAVIK. BIG IN REYKJAVIK.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT BIG IN REYKJAVIK.
THEY LOVE YOU.
Jon: THEY LOVE ME THERE?
SOUTH REYKJAVIK. THEN I'M GOING TO COPENHAGEN. JEWISH BOY.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHEN DID THAT BECOME...
I TELL FUNNY STORIES.
Jon: AND IT TRANSLATES UNIVERSALLY.
FUNNY IS FUNNY. THEY'RE FUNNY STORIES. I'VE BEEN TELLING THEM FOR YEARS AT THE CONVENTIONS AND THE LIKE THIS. IS SORT OF A STRUCTURED SHOW. I DIDN'T RETIRE. I JUST LEFT...
Jon: HERE'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE. AS A COMIC I WORKED THE ROAD FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THEN I'VE SETTLED DOWN TO BECOME A TALK SHOW HOST. YOU WERE A TALK SHOW HOST AND NOW YOU'RE A COMIC. YOU AND I HAVE SOMEHOW SWITCHED IDENTITIES. THIS IS LIKE A BAD GEORGE BURNS MOVIE WHERE WE BOTH TOUCH A SKULL AT THE SAME TIME AND I  WAKE UP MAKED IN SUSPENDERS. WHAT HAPPENED? I'M LARRY KING.
I COULD NEVER LEAVE TELEVISION. I'M GOING TO BE DOING IT.
Jon: I GOT TO TELL YOU, CNN MISSES YOU DEARLY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME. IT'S TERRIBLE. YOUR VOICE ON IT, YOUR THING UNDERAPPRECIATED. NOW THAT YOU'RE GONE, NOT THAT THIS PIERS MORGAN GUY IS...
I MUST TELL YOU, YOU WERE ONE OF OUR GREAT GUESTS.
I ALWAYS ENJOYED IT.
YOU WERE TERRIFIC. YOU WERE HARD TO GETMENT YOU WERE NOT EASY TO GET. IT WAS EASIER TO GET AN E-MAIL FROM WEINER. THAN TO GET YOU ON AS A GUEST.
Jon: I DON'T DO A LOT BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS DOING THIS. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS SHOW ALLOWS ME SUCH A CATHARSIS. WHAT WAS THE EASE GUEST TO DEAL WITH AND WHAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT GUEST?
BILL CLINTON IS AN EASY GUEST BECAUSE HE'S VERBOSE. HE'S JUST TERRIFIC. A DIFFICULT GUEST, I'LL TELL YOU A FUNNY STORY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SHE PASSED AWAY, SO I CAN TELL THIS. LEARN NEVER TO OVERPROMOTE. WE BOOKED PHILLIES GATES. YOU KNOW WHO SHE WAS?
Jon: NO.
ROCK HUDSON'S WIFE. SHE MARRIED ROCK HUDSON IN THE EARLY DAYS. SO SHE'S DOING US EXCLUSIVES RIGHT AFTER HE DIED. SO WE PROMOTE HER ALL DAY LONG. PHYLLIS GATES IS COMING, ROCK HUDSON'S WIFE. SITS DOWN. HOW DID YOU MEET ROCK?
I WAS A SECRETARY FOR HIS AGENT AN WE DATED AND GOT MARRIED.
WHAT HAPPENED? DIDN'T WORK OUT. WE GOT DIVORCED. DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THAT HE WAS GAY?
NO. WHEN YOU FOUND OUT HE HAD AIDS, DID YOU CALL HIM? NO. I STARTED AT 9:00. IT'S THREE MINUTES AFTER 9:00. I GOT NOWHERE TO GO. WHAT MOVIES DID YOU LIKE OF HIS? SO YOU LEARN NEVER TO OVERPROMOTE. BUT IF WE HAVE JON STEWART, ALL DAY LONG.
Jon: YOU SEND STUFF ALSO TO COPENHAGEN, OSLO. YOU KNOW THIS THING IS GOING INTERNATIONAL. NOW, IS IT THE TYPE OF THING NOW, WHY NOT COME BACK AND DO ONCE A WEEK? WHY NOT COME BACK AND...
I'M DOING FOUR SPECIALS A YEAR. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OTHER THINGS. I'M GOING TO DO... I CAN'T NOT, NOT DO THINGS.
Jon: YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY THAN TEN PEOPLE I KNOW. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
I JUST HAVE A LOT OF STAMP NAP. I JUST... [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] , NO I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST.
Jon: DID YOU FIGURE OUT BY WIFE SIX YOU HAD A LOT OF STAMINA? WHAT DID YOU FIGURE?
MY WIFE AND I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WATCHING YOUR SHOW.
Jon: TRUTH BE TOLD, IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THE MASTER, LARRY KING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
