Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED TURN RIGHT AT MACHU PICCHU. REDISCOVERING THE LOST CITY ONE STEP AT A TIME. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARK ADAMS. SIR! NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
Jon: I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE MACHU PICCHU WAS SO... I GUESS CONTROVERSIAL. THAT IT NEEDED TO BE THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO DISCOVERED IT I GUESS WAS HIRAM BINGHAM.
HE WAS A YALE LECTURER WHO FOUND IT JUST ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO EXACTLY AND CAUSED A  LITTLE CONTROVERSY BECAUSE HE LATER TOOK FULL CREDIT FOR FINDING MACHU PICCHU AND LEFT  OUT THE FACT THAT THERE WERE THREE FAMILIES OF FARMERS LIVING UP GROWING TOMATOES  AMONG THE RUINS WHEN HE GOT THERE. HE CAME BACK A YEAR LATER.
Jon: DO NATIVE PEOPLE COUNT?
THAT IS PART OF THE CONTROVERSY.
Jon: AND YOU DECIDED TO RETRACE BINGHAM'S PATH TO MACHU PICCHU.
YES. HE DID A FAMOUS EXPEDITION IN 1911 ON WHICH HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOST CITY OF THE INCAS  WHICH WAS THIS LEGENDARY CITY THAT MANY BELIEVE THAT A GROUP OF INCA NOBLES HAD RUN OFF TO  WITH ALL THE TREASURES OF THE EMPIRE WHEN PIZARRO ARRIVED IN 1532.
Jon: THIS WAS TO ESCAPE THE SPANISH AND THEIR TAKEOVER.
THE CON QUIST TO DORES WHO ARRIVED, EXACTLY. HE ALSO GOT A HOT TIP THAT THERE MIGHT BE COOL RUINS.
Jon: A HOT TIP ON COOL RUINS.
EXACTLY. YOU HAVEN'T READ "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC" IN A WHILE.
Jon: NOW THIS BINGHAM WAS WRITING FOR "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC". HE REALLY PUT THEM FOR LACK OF A BETTER PUN ON THE MAP.
"NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC" WAS A FAIRLY SMALL MAGAZINE BEFORE MACHU PICCHU CAME OUT. THEY DEVOTED A WHOLE ISSUE TO IT IN 1913. IT WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS FOR EVERYBODY.
Jon: WHAT YOU FOUND ON THERE, HOW LONG DID YOU SPEND TREKING TO MACHU PICCHU.
WITH MY GUIDE JOHN AND THREE MULE TENDERS AND A COOK, WE WENT AROUND FOR ABOUT A MONTH THROUGH THE ANDES OF PERU.
Jon: HOW HARD IS IT TO BECOME A MULE TENDER?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LICENSING PROCESS BECAUSE JOHN  ON OUR FIRST DAY OUT GAVE ME A BIG LECTURE ABOUT HOW NOT TO GET KICKED BY A MULE. ABOUT AN HOUR LATER THE MULE TENDERS CAME BACK AND SAID HE JUST GOT KICKED BY THE MULE.
Jon: NOW YOU MUST PARDON ME FOR THIS. YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS SO MUCH OF THE EXPLORER TYPE. SO THIS STRIKES ME THE HARDSHIP OF THE ANDES WITH THE LACK OF BREATHEABLE AIR. VERY THIN OXYGEN UP THERE.
EXACTLY.
Jon: WAS IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU?
IT WAS UNTIL WE DISCOVERED THE MAGIC OF COCOA. THE COCOA LEAVES. WE HAD TO KEEP STOPPING AND BUYING THESE LARGE BAGS WHICH THEY LOOKED LIKE BAY LEAVES.
Jon: I'M FAMILIAR WITH... (LAUGHING) NO NEED, SIR.
I WAS HOPING TO GET LIKE A LITTLE OF THAT TONY MONTANA ACTION. IT'S MORE LIKE HAVING A NICE CUP OF TEA UNFORTUNATELY.
Jon: SO THE MULE TENDERS APPRECIATED THAT. SO YOU FIND OUT, WHAT DO YOU FIND OUT NOW ABOUT BEING... THE PEOPLE IN PERU ARE ANGRY AT THIS MAN. THEY SAY HE STOLE THEIR ARTIFACTS. WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER ABOUT THINGS?
THEY'RE RIGHT. HE DID HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF PERU THAT HE WOULD TAKE THESE ARTIFACTS  FROM MACHU PICCHU UP TO THE PEABODY MUSEUM AT YALE AND BRING THEM BACK WHENEVER PERU  ASKED FOR THEM. PERU STARTED ASKING FOR THEM A FEW YEARS AGO AND YALE BASICALLY SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD THIS STUFF IN OUR BASEMENT FOR A LONG TIME. YOU'RE GOING TO ASK FOR IT BACK NOW.
Jon: THEY'RE NOT EVEN DISPLAYING IT. IT'S IN THEIR BASEMENT.
MOST OF IT IS IN THEIR BASEMENT. THEY'RE STUDYING IT. MOST OF IT IS POTTERY FRAGMENTS AND HUMAN REMAINS.
Jon: MOST OF IT IS THE ANCESTORS OF THE PEOPLE REQUESTING IT.
BUT IT'S NOT KING TUT'S TREASURE. BUT BECAUSE IT IS THAT STUFF, IT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR PERUIANS TO GET IT BACK. YALE AGREED TO SEND IT BACK IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR.
Jon: IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE GENTLEMAN WHO DID FIND IT BEFORE HIM, THIS BURNS FELLOW....
HE WAS BASICALLY JUST THERE TO STEAL ARTIFACTS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.
Jon: HE WAS THERE 40 YEARS BEFORE.
1867.
Jon: HE ALSO PROBABLY FOUND THE COCOA LEAVES I WOULD MANAGE.
HE ALSO PROBABLY FOUND COCOA LEAVES.
Jon: YOU MET SOME OF THESE FOLKS AT THE EXPLORERS CLUB. IS THAT A REAL PLACE?
THE EXPLORERS CLUB IS A REAL PLACE.
Jon: DO THE PEOPLE AT THE DOOR EVER GO, WELL, HOW DID YOU FIND US? THAT WOULD BE A FUNNY EXPLORERS' JOKE THAT THEY COULD DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
I THINK THEY PROBABLY DO. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NEVER BEEN PULLED ON ME. THEN I LOOK LIKE THIS.
Jon: STOP IT. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU LOOK LIKE, IF DREW CARY MARRIED JOHN HODGMAN. THAT ONE IS GOING TO HAUNT YOU. BY THE WAY REALLY ENTERTAINING WRITING. REALLY FUNNY. REALLY INTERESTING STORY. YOU GUYS SHOULD PICK IT UP. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. MARK ADAMS. (
