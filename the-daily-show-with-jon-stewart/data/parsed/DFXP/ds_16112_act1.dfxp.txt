SEPTEMBER 2, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" TONIGHT. I'M JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM CNN, DR. SANJAY GROUP TAMP HE WILL BE HERE SHORTLY TO LOOK AT THIS THING. BUT BEFORE WE GET STARTED, OBVIOUSLY EARLIER TONIGHT THE COUNTRY WITNESSED HISTORY. TONIGHT WAS FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE TO INCLUDE THE CURRENT FRONT-RUNNER, GOVERNOR RICK PERRY. OBVIOUSLY THE DEBATE HAPPENED IN THAT SMALL WINDOW OF TIME AFTER OUR TAPING AND BEFORE OUR AIRING  KNOWN AS "THE TIME WHEN EVERYTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS."  [LAUGHTER] SO I CAN'T TELL YOU FOR CERTAIN HOW GOVERNOR PERRY FARED OR WHAT  IT WAS THAT CAUSED NEWT GINGRICH TO FLOP DOWN ON THE FLOOR INDIAN-LIKE STYLE AND BEGIN  THROWING HIS OWN FECES AT THE MODERATOR, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT HAPPENED. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THRVEG RIGHT NOW IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S A WATTLE BETWEEN MITT ROMNEY AND RICK PERRY. BOTH MEN HAVE BEEN GOVERNORS, AND BOTH COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY FOUND THEMSELVES CAST IN ONE OF THOSE MIDDLE AGED KAYAKER  WITH PROSTATE PROBLEMS ADVERTISEMENT. THOSE ARE SOME RUGGED, HANDSOME, BIG PROSTATE MOTHER [BLEEPED]. BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, RICK PERRY WASN'T WAITING FOR THE DEBATE TO TAKE  HIS SHOT.
A DAY EARLIER HE TOOK A SWIPE AT ROMNEY.
ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT'S CREATED JOBS ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WHILE HE WAS THE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, HE DIDN'T CREATE VERY MANY JOBS.
Jon: CLEVER. NICE DOWN-HOME QUALITY TO THAT. ALTHOUGH IF I'M PERRY'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER... [LAUGHTER] THE ONE CRITICISM I WOULD HAVE IS TO TRY NOT TO MOVE AROUND IN YOUR CHAIR LIKE YOU NEED YOUR  ANAL GLANSDS SQUEEZED. YOU MIGHT WANT TO PLANT YOURSELF AND JUST... GUESS WHAT? ROMNEY ISN'T GOING TO TAKE PERRY'S ENTRANCE INTO THE RACE LYING DOWN. YESTERDAY ROMNEY GOT OUT IN FRONT OF BARACK OBAMA'S JOINT SESSION JOBA LOU DISA SPEECH BUT  UNVEILING HIS OWN ROMNEY JOBS PLAN WHICH HE SHARED WITH AMERICA WHILE STANDING IN FRONT  OF AMERICA'S MOST PATRIOTIC SERVICE ELEVATOR.
IT'S ABOUT 150 PAGES WITH 59 DIFFERENT POLICY IDEAS. IF YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO GET ONE IN YOUR HAND, YOU CAN GO ON AMAZON KINDLE AND... I DON'T  KNOW IF IT'S FREE OR NOT, I HOPE, SO BUT MAYBE NOT. YOU CAN GET ONE OF THESE AND TAKE A LOOK. IT'S IN COLOR ON KINDLE
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR ECONOMIC PLAN COSTS PEOPLE TO GET. ALL RIGHT. LEFT  [LAUGHTER] AND SECONDLY, OH, GOOD, IT'S IN COLOR. BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOUR 150-PAGE ECONOMIC PLAN MIGHT BE BORING TO READ. GO AHEAD. WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR STRATEGY FOR CREATING JOBS THAT'S SUPERIOR TO THE PRESIDENT'S  PLAN, OF WHICH NONE OF US HAS ACTUALLY YET HEARD.
PRESIDENT BUM'S STRATEGY IS A PAYPHONE STRATEGY AND WE'RE IN A  SMART PHONE WORLD, AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT  HE'S DOING IS TAKING QUARTERS AND STUFFING THEM INTO THE PAYPHONE AND THINKING, CAN'T  FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S NOT CONNECTED ANYMORE, MR. PRESIDENT. YOUR PAYPHONE STRATEGY DOES NOT WORK IN A SMART PHONE WORLD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU KNOW, OBAMA IS NOT THE ONLY ONE CAUGHT IN THIS PAYPHONE SMART PHONE TRANSITION. I MEAN, SUPERMAN, YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR SUPERMAN TO CHANGE IN THE iPHONE? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT, OUR ECONOMY IS IN THE [BLEEPED]. ALL IDEAS ON THE TABLE. WHAT'S YOUR VISION?
I WANT TO DESCRIBE FOR YOU THE VISION I HAVE FOR WHAT THIS COUNTRY OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE DOWN  THE ROAD. AMERICA SHOULD BE A JOB MACHINE, JOBS BEING CREATED ALL THE TIME. WE SHOULD HAVE A JOB-CREATING MACHINE IN AMERICA.
OF COURSE. A JOB MACHINE. IT'S SO EASY. IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES. JOB MACHINE. AND INSTEAD OF GOING TO WAR, WE SHOULD COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF PEACE MACHINE. AND AN ANTI-CANCER ICE CREAM. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT, IDEA MACHINE?
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT, THIS BURDEN THAT WE'VE PLACED ON  SMALL BUSINESSES. WE'RE GOING TO SAY OVER THE DEPARTMENT IN GOVERNMENT, IF YOU HAVE A NEW REGULATION YOU WANT  TO ENACT, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE ANOTHER REGULATION OF EQUAL SCALE.
Jon: IT'S SO BRILLIANTLY ARBITRARY. [LAUGHTER] PERFECT. THERE YOU GO. YOU WANT HIGHER FUEL EFFICIENCY, DO YOU? WELL, THAT MEANS WE GET TO PUT MOUTH TURDS BACK IN BUNNIES. YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT SO WAD AL GORE CAN TASTE IT. LISTEN. ALL RIGHT, FINE, LET'S LET PERRY HAVE AUTHENTICITY, YOU'RE THE SMART GUY. YOU'RE THE NUMBERS GUY.
I JUST WANT THE TALK TO YOU ACT OUR ECONOMY. ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO AMERICAN FAMILIES. MIDDLE-INCOME AMERICAN, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN OUGHT TO HAVE THE HIGHEST INCOME IN THE WORLD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU DO REALIZE THAT IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, IF HE WAS THE RICHEST, YOU KNOW WHAT, [BLEEPED] IT, LET'S JUST INTRODUCE OUR NEW SEGMENT, "OH MY GOD, RICK PERRY IS GOING TO  BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
