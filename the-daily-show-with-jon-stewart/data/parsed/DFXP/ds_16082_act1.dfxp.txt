JUNE 23rd, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, BRUCE HEADLAM HERE TO DISCUSS PAGE 1, A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT "THE  NEW YORK TIMES", WHICH REVIEWING THE SAME FILM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RAVED ABOUT  IT, A MESS, DOES LITTLE TO ILLUMINATE. SO I'M THINKING IT MUST BE PRETTY GOOD. LET'S START QUICKLY RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK, OUR STATE LEGISLATURE THE MOST  DYSFUNCTIONAL IN THE NATION RAVES NEW YORK UNIVERSITY IS IN AN EXTENDED SUMMER  SESSION IN AN ATTEMPT TO PASS A LANDMARK BILL LEGALIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN NEW YORK. WORD IS THE VOTE IS NOW 31-4-- 31 FOR, 31 AGAINST. SO RIGHT NOW THEY ARE LOOKING TO TURN ONE VOTE GAY, I GUESS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: EVEN FOR A NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SIX PACK OF TWIQUIZA, LET'S GET IN THERE AND VOTE. WE ARE GETTING WORD THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VOTE IN THE NEW YORK SENATE EXTENDED SESSION. LET'S GO RIGHT TO IT.
THE SUMMERTIME FAVORITE IS NOW THE OFFICIAL STATE VEGETABLE. THE LAWMAKERS DIVIDED TO QUIV SWEET CORN TWO THUMBS UP OVER ONIONS.
Jon: IT'S RAINING MEN-- WAIT, WHAT? WAIT W WHAT DID YOU VOTE FOR? REALLY? A STATE VEGETABLE, CORN, FIRST OF ALL-- FIRST OF ALL, DON'T GET COCKY, CORN. YOU BEAT ONIONS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SECOND OF ALL Y ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A STATE VEGETABLE IN AN EXTENDED  SESSION OF THE SENATE, NO LESS.
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT WHETHER WE HAVE SWEET CORN OR ONION  OR ANY OTHER VEGETABLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO RECOGNIZE AND HAVE A STATE  VEGETABLE FOR NEW YORK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES. OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE CHAOS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AFTER YOU TAKE CARE OF THOSE IMPORTANT THINGS THERE WILL BE TIME LEFT OVER  THE PROMOTION OF THE BASIC CIVIL RIGHT FOR A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE. BUT OBVIOUSLY OUR MAIN STORY IS THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION LAST NIGHT. HIS FIRST SINCE THAT NIGHT TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN HE INFORMED US THAT HE HAD  PERSONALLY KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN WITH HIS BARE HANDS. AND HE IS WALKING DOWN THE SAME CARPET AGAIN! I WONDER IF WE GOT HITLER THIS TIMEï¿½ï¿½!
WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE SURGE AT WEST,rPOINT, WE SET CLEAR OBJECTIVES TO REFOCUS  ON AL QAEDA, TO REVERSE THE TALIBAN'S MOMENTUM, AND TRAIN AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES  TO DEFEND THEIR OWN COUNTRY. WE ARE MEETING OUR GOALS.
Jon: OH MY GOD, AFGHANISTAN WAR! IT'S FINALLY OVER, TEN YEARS. CAN SOMEONE GET ME A NURSE TO KISS IN THE STREET? I CANwTi BELIEVE-- TELL ME MORE!
STARTING NEJt MONTH WE WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE 10,000 OF OUR TROOPS FROM  AFGHANISTAN BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND WE WILL BRING HOME A TOTAL OF 33,000 TROOPS BY NEXT SUMMER.
Jon: HUH? THAT'S IT? CAME OUT TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE TROOPS, THAT YOU SENT TO AFGHANISTAN A YEAR AND A  HALF AGO ARE GOING TO BE INCREMENTALLY REMOVED FROM THAT COUNTRY OVER THEï¿½ï¿½ NEXT YEAR AND A HALF? PUTTING US AT A TROOP COMMITMENT LEVEL STILL ABOVE THE ONE THAT WAS THERE WHEN YOU TOOK OFFICE. I MEAN, IT'S NOT NOTHING BUT DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY DOWN THE [BLEEP] HALLWAY TO DO THAT? COULDN'T YOU JUST SHOUT IT AS YOU WERE WALKING BY? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HEY, WE'RE GOING TO TRIM BACK A BIT ON ONE OF OUR WARS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FYI. JUST DO IT AS A FACEBOOK STATUS UPDATE. YOU REALLY-- YOU HAD TO DO THIS AS A NATIONWIDE ADDRESS-- ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S SEE HOW IT PLAYED ON FOX, THE CONSERVATIVES, THE PORTION  OF THE COUNTRY WHOSE VIEWS ARE NEVER-- ALL RIGHT, JUST PLAY IT.
WHY DO I SEE POLITICS ALL OVER THIS. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PLAYING POLITICS.
THIS IS 100% POLITICAL.
CLEARLY MEANT TO MOLLIFY THE ANTI-WAR LEFT.
HE NEEDS TO APPEASE THE LEFT WING OF HIS OWN PARTY.
I KNOW HE'S GOT TO APPEASE THOSE MORON LIKE THE CODE PINK CHICKS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TO ME THE DEAD GIVE AWAY, THE DENTIST DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CODE PINK  ISN'T THAT HE CALLED THEM CHICK, BUT THAT HE THINKS THEY CAN BE APPEASED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SO THE SPEECH WAS LIKE RED METAPHOR THE LEFT OR SHOULD I SAY TOFURKEY, FOR THE LEFT. MAN, FOR THE LEFT. THAT SPEECH MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FINDING OUT THAT A VOLUME CO-- VOLVO AND SUB RO  MATED AND GIVEN BIRTH TO A RECUMBENT BICYCLE, RIGHT?
I'M DISAPPOINTED. REMOVING THE 33,000 TROOPS IN OVER A YEAR IN OUR BUDGET CRISIS IS NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH.
IT'S A NO-WIN POLICY.
IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IT'S GOING AT A SLOWER PACE THAN I THINK IS NECESSARY.
AFGHANISTAN WAR IS GOING ON TEN YEARS NOW, IF IT WERE A KID IT WOULD BE IN THE  FIFTH GRADE.
Jon: YES, THIS WAR IS LIKE A TEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD AND THAT'S WHY WE MUST END  IT -- WAIT, HOLD ON. (LAUGHTER) SIXTH GRADE SAY TOUGH YEAR, I WILL SAY. SO IT SEEMS THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS PULLED OFF AN INCREDIBLE FEAT. HE HAS GIVEN A SPEECH NOBODY LIKED. SOMEHOW HE HAS FOUND AND TOUCHED AMERICA ON OUR ANTI-G-SPOT. BUT I BELIEVE THIS SPEECH CONTAINED A STRONG HINT OF THE PROBLEM THIS PRESIDENT  IS FACING AS HE SEEKS TO CREATE THE OBAMA DOCTRINE FOR THE WAR ON TERRORISM.
WE MUST CHART A MORE CENTERED COURSE. LIKE GENERATIONS BEFORE WE MUST EMBRACE AMERICA'S SINGULAR WAR IN THE COURSE  OF HUMAN EVENTS AM BUT WE MUST BE AS PRAGMATIC AS WE ARE PASSIONATE, AS STRATEGIC  AS WE ARE RESOLUTE. WHEN THREATENED, WE MUST RESPOND WITH FORCE. BUT WHEN THAT FORCE CAN BE TARGETED, WE NEED NOT DEPLOY LARGE ARMIES OVERSEAS.
Jon: SEE THERE'S THE DILEMMA, BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY DEPLOYED LARGE AMIES OVERSEAS. WE'VE ALREADY DONE IT. THE OBAMA DOCTRINE APPEARS TO BE IN THE FUTURE I WILL TRY NOT TO GET US EMBROILED  IN SO MANY MONEY AND LIFE SUCKING CLUSTER [BLEEP] LIKE THE ONES WE APPEAR TO BE  EMBROILED IN AT THE PRESENT AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF. THE BUSH DOCTRINE IS CLEAR. YOU GOT TERRORISTS, WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU. BUT IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A GAME OF TERRORIST WHACK-A-MOLE. AND IT COST $9.7 BILLION A MONTH TO COVER ONLY TWO HOLES THAT YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE. SOMEWHAT UNSUSTAINABLE. OBAMA'S MAKING THE CASE THAT THE FUTURE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.
WHEN INNOCENTS ARE BEING SLAUGHTERED AND GLOBAL SECURITY ENDANG ARED, WE  DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN STANDING IDLY BY OR ACTING ON OUR OWN. INSTEAD WE MUST RALLY INTERNATIONAL ACTION WHICH WE'RE DOING IN LIBYA WHERE  WE DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE SOLDIER ON THE GROUND.
SEE, HE'S SAYING LET'S NOT PLAY WHACK-A-MOLE, LET'S PLAY BUCK HUNTER. (LAUGHTER)
JUST STAND BACK AND WAIT FOR A DICTATOR LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON TO WALK THROUGH THE  FOREST AND THEN-- BUT AGAIN WE CAN ONLY PUT A NEW STRATEGY IN PLACE ONCE WE HAVE ENDED OUR CURRENT ENTANGLEMENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE TONIGHT THAT I BELIEVE WE MAY HAVE  FOUND THE SOLUTION BURIED IN SOME OF THE POST SPEECH COMMENTARY.
THEY HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED FIGHTING SEASONS.
HAVING ALL THE SURGE FORCES LEAVE BY NEXT SUMMER IS GOING TO COMPROMISEï¿½ï¿½ NEXT  SUMMER'S FIGHTING SEE SOW-- SEASON.
THE FIGHTING SEASON BEGINS IN THE SPRING WHEN THEY FINISH HARVESTING THE OPIUM. AND IT ENDS IN THE FALL WHEN THEY NEED TO BE UNHARVESTING THE MARIJUANA.
SEE WE HERE IN AMERICA HAVE FOUR SEASON, WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL. IN AFGHANISTAN TWO SEASONS, FIGHTING SEASON BE, AND DRUG HARVESTING SEASON. (LAUGHTER) DOCTRINE IF YOU WILL TO WINNING THIS WAR, WE MUST AS A NATION DEVICE A NARCOTIC  THAT RIPEENS DURING THEIR SUMMER DRUG HARVESTING L LULL. PCP-EANUTS, IF YOU WILL. METH AM AT THE TIMEA MELON, NO, THAT ROTS TOO EASYY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I PRESENT TO YOU THE KEY TO ENDURING PEACE AND STABILITY  IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS TO COME, A CROP AS ADDICTIVE AS HEARTY, BEHOLD, CRACKTUS. YOU'RE WELCOME. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BRING THE BOYS HOME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
