MAY 3, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. A VERY SPECIAL SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST... WHAT? MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE ONE AND ONLY RACHEL MADDOW WILL BE JOINING US A  LITTLE BIT LATER. WE'RE EXCITED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST, BEFORE WE GET GOING, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE THIS RIGHT. THAT'S ONE CHICKEN BURRITO AND ONE NACHOS A PABLANO? SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE IS REMEMBERING ME FROM MY DAYS WHEN I USED TO [BLEEPED] UP THEIR  ORDER, THE GLORY DAY, IF YOU WILL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE USED TO WATCH YOU DO COMEDY ON TUESDAY NIGHTS AT THE BITTER  END AND ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS WE'D WATCH YOU BUS TABLES. [LAUGHTER] AND THEY SAID, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH ONE YOU WERE BETTER AT, QUITE FRANKLY. BUT FIRST WE TURN TO OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE, DAY TWO, THE DEMISE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. I'LL ADMIT, I'LL ADMIT, YESTERDAY'S SHOW, YESTERDAY'S SHOW WAS I.D. DRIVEN, AN MALLISTIC, ALMOST TRIBAL, CATHARSIS FUELED. BUT IN THIS SOBER DAWN, SELF-REFLECTION AND QUESTIONS BEGIN TO ENTER THE CONSCIOUSNESS, QUESTIONS LIKE:
WON'T THERE ALWAYS BE THAT LINGERING DOUBT AMONGST AMERICAN, WELL, WHERE IS THE BODY? HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S DEAD? WHY ISN'T THERE A PICTURE OF IT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO. THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION, BUT ALREADY? COME ON, MAN. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO AS A COUNTRY STOP PRETENDING THAT THERE'S A LEVEL OF EMPIRICAL  PROOF THAT WILL SATISFY THE CONSPIRACY SEEKERS AMONGST US? THESE THINGS ARE NEVER ABOUT EVIDENCE. WE COULD HAVE A VIDEOTAPE OF THE TERROR LEADER HIMSELF HOLDING UP  SUNDAY'S "NEW YORK POST" AND HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN HIS "I AM  BIN LADEN SERIOUSLY" T-SHIRT SAYING ON CAMERA, "I THINK THIS  DUDE'S ABOUT TO [BLEEPED] ME UP BIG TIME." WOULDN'T MATTER. HERE'S THE VIDEO. THIS IS BUZZ ALDRIN. BUZZ ALDRIN WAS ON THE MOON. WE SAW HIM LAND THERE ON TELEVISION. THIS IS THE CRAP HE HAD TO PUT UP WITH.
YOU'RE A COWARD AND A LIAR AND A THIEF.
Jon: APPARENTLY ONLY ONE OF THOSE MEN REENTERED THE EARTH'S AT MS FEAR.  -- ATMOSPHERE. COME ON. THE NAGGING QUESTION IN MY MIND CONCERNS PAKISTAN. THE COUNTRY WHOSE SUBURB OF ABBOTTABAD HAS BEEN HOME TO BIN LADEN FOR APPARENTLY THE LAST  SIX YEARS. AND, YOU KNOW, PAKISTAN WAS LAST YEAR'S HONORED RECIPIENT OF THE  UNITED STATES' $3.2 BILLION "BE OUR FRIEND PLEASE" SCHOLARSHIP  AWARDED EACH YEAR TO THE COUNTRY THAT IF WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM $3.2  BILLION WOULD IN NO WAY BE OUR FRIEND. [LAUGHTER] I WAS REMINDED OF AN INTERVIEW THAT PAKISTAN'S PRIME MINISTER DID LAST YEAR.
OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NOT IN PAKISTAN.
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE HE'S NOT IN PAKISTAN?
BECAUSE THERE ARE MILITARY ACTIONS THAT ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL. IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY CHANCE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.
Jon: REALLY, WOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. [LAUGHTER] YOUR MILITARY ACTIONS VERY SUCCESSFUL, WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HIM. YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY WAS THERE CHANCE THAT BIN LADEN HAD BEEN LIVING IN PAKISTAN FOR SIX  YEARS, HE WAS LIVING HALF A MILE FROM PAKISTAN'S VERSION OF WEST POINT IN A TOWN SURROUNDED BY  RETIRED EX-MILITARY OFFICERS. A HALF MILE. LOOK AT THAT IN NEW YORK CITY TERMS. BIN LADEN WAS ON 21st AND 7th AVENUE. THEY WERE ON 21st AND 9th AVENUE. [LAUGHTER] IF THE PAKISTANI MILITARY ACADEMY WERE DOMINO, THEY WOULD DELIVER TO BIN LADEN ON FOOT. THE PAKISTANI MILITARY, THE PAKISTANI MILITARY COULD HAVE CAUGHT BIN LADEN WITH A ROD AND REEL. OR A GIANT ACME MAGNET. YOU WERE NEIGHBORS. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY. MAYBE... TO BE FAIR, MAYBE OSAMA WAS KIND OF IN A STEALTH J.D. SALINGER MODE.
ONLY 35 MILES FROM ISLAMABAD, BIN LADEN'S COMPOUND BECAUSE McMAHON SHUN.
SURROUNDED BY WALLS TEN TO 18-FEET HIGH TOPPED WITH WASHED WIRE.
NO INTERNET, NO PHONE.
EIGHT TIMES THE SIZE OF NEARBY HOUSES.
THEY BURNED THEIR GARBAGE INSTEAD OF TAKING IT OUT LIKE THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: COULD IT HAVE BEEN ANY MORE OBVIOUS? LOOK AT THE MAN'S MAILBOX, FOR GOD'S SAKES. WHAT MORE DID YOU WANT? WHAT MORE EVIDENCE DID YOU NEED THAT SOMETHING WAS AWRY IN THAT ONE CUL-DE-SAC? WHAT DID YOU NEED, ABJECT CRUELTY TO SCHOOLCHILDREN?
WHEN CHILDREN, LOCAL CHILDREN PLAYING FOOTBALL NEARBY KICKED THEIR BALL OVER THE WALL, THE  PEOPLE IN THE COMPOUND JUST GAVE THEM MONEY AND TOLD THEM TO GO AND BUY ANOTHER BALL RATHER THAN  LET THEM COME IN AND SEARCH.
Jon: HE WOULD KEEP THE CHILDREN'S BALLS AND THE MONEY... THE MONEY... THE  MONEY... THE MONEY THAT THEY GAVE THE CHILDREN WAS IN THE FORM OF A PERSONAL CHECK FROM  THE DESK OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. THAT'S... THAT'S WHAT... I DID NOT KNOW... I DID NOT KNOW YOU  COULD GET THE TWEETY BIRD DEATH TO AMERICA CHECK. I SAW IT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PAKISTAN'S LEADERS, INCLUDING FORMER PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF, HAVE SOME  EXPLAINING TO DO.
MR. PRESIDENT, FOR YEARS U.S. OFFICIALS, INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, HAVE BEEN SAYING OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS, IN FACT, IN PAKISTAN. YOU HAVE BEEN DENYING THAT FOR YEARS NOW CATEGORICALLY SAYING, NO, HE'S IN AFGHANISTAN. DO YOU NOW ADMIT YOU WERE WRONG?
NEW YORK I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER DENYING. I WAS ASKED EVERYWHERE, AND MY FIRST RESPONSE INVARIABLY ALWAYS WAS THAT I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
Jon: OKAY. TWO THINGS, ONE, I THINK IT'S RUDE TO TALK ON THE PHONE WHEN YOU'RE BEING INTERVIEWED. [LAUGHTER] AND NUMBER TWO, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING, WE'RE SAYING, WHEN  YOU SAID "I DON'T KNOW," YOU KNEW! YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT THE I.S.I., THE PAKISTANI INTELLIGENCE, THE MILITARY, THE  GOVERNMENT, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA BIN LADEN WAS THERE OR HAVE  ANY INVOLVEMENT IN PUTTING BIN LADEN THERE?
I THINK I.S.I. MUST BE UTTERLY STUPID TO PUT THEM IN SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE, HIDING  THEM IN SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE THAT. THAT IS NOT WHAT I.S.I. WOUND HAVE DONE, CERTAINLY NOT.
Jon: SO YOUR DEFENSE IS BASICALLY THE I.S.I. IS WAY TOO SMART TO PUT BIN LADEN IN SUCH  AN OBVIOUS PLACE, BUT FAR TOO CLUELESS TO KNOW HE WAS THERE. [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE IN THAT MAGIC SWEET SPOT. [LAUGHTER] SMART ENOUGH NOT TO DO IT, DUMB ENOUGH NOT TO KNOW. AND BY THE WAY, HIDING BIN LADEN, HIDING? BIN LADEN WASN'T HIDING IN PAKISTAN. HE WAS CHILLIN' IN PAKISTAN, CRASHIN',  IF YOU WILL. IF WALDO HID THE WAY OSAMA BIN LADEN DID, I WOULDN'T FIND THOSE  BOOKS SO INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. LOOK, THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE! HE'S IN THE GIANT, HIGH-WALLED COMPOUND. HE'S RIGHT THERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW YOU'RE LIKE, OH, THAT WAS OSAMA'S HOUSE, THE TALL LANKY GUY? WE THOUGHT MAYBE JEFF GOLDBLUM HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A SUMMER RETREAT, HAD GROWN A BEARD AND  WAS BURNING ALL HIS TRASH. YOU KNOW HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE, ECCENTRIC. YOU KNOW WHAT HURTS THE MOST? YOU MAY RECALL PAKISTAN'S THEN-LEADER, PERVEZ MUSHARRAF, WAS ON THIS VERY PROGRAM TO PROMOTE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY A LITTLE LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AGO. I GAVE THIS MAN A TEA AND TWINKIE WELCOME. TO YOUR HEALTH, SIR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: MMM. IS IT GOOD? WHERE'S OSAMA BIN LADEN? [LAUGHTER]
I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: OH, DON'T YOU? DIDN'T YOU KNOW? WELL, GUESS WHAT... [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE LIED TO ME. HE LIED TO ME. WELL, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, PERVEZ MUSHARRAF. I SAID I READ YOUR BOOK. I DIDN'T READ YOUR BOOK. AND THOSE TWINKIES WERE OVER 40 YEARS OLD. I GOT THEM ON A CAMPING TRIP WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS. [CHEERS
