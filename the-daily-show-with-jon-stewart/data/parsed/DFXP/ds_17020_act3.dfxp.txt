Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL? ALL RIGHT. BY NOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE SITUATION UNFOLDING AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY. A LONG TIME ASSISTANT FOOTBALL COACH JERRY SANDUSKY WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEKEND FOR ALLEGED SEXUAL  ABUSE OF CHILDREN. TERRIBLE. BUT IT'S ALSO COME OUT THAT THOSE AROUND SANDUSKY KNEW OF HIS BEHAVIOR FOR YEARS  INCLUDING AN INCIDENT IN 2002 WHERE 6 FOOT 5 INCH ADULT EYE WITNESS WALKED IN  ON HIM RAPING A CHILD IN A PENN STATE SHOWER AND DIDN'T DO THE TWO THINGS MOST  PEOPLE WOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION. A, STOP IT AND CALL THE COPS, OR B CALL THE COPS TO COME STOP IT. BOTH SCENARIOS INVOLVE THE POLICE AND STOPPING IT. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: BUT APPARENTLY WHAT HAPPENED IS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS SOME OF THE  AUTHORITIES WERE NOTIFIED INCLUDING HEAD COACH JOE PATERNO AND SANDUSKY WAS PUNISHED BY NOT BEING  ALLOWED TO HAVE THE KEYS TO THE PENN STATE SHOWER AND MORE-- ANY MORE. THEY WERE RUN A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THE STUDENTS AT PENN STATE WERE OUTRAGED TO FIND OUT.
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS JAM DOWNTOWN STREETS, OVERTURNING A TV NEWS TRUCK, KNOCKING OVER LIGHT POLES AND THROWING ROCKS AT POLICE.
TEARS IN MY EYES, HE'S DONE SO MUCH FOR OUR UNIVERSITY.
WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF OUR SKOL AND JOE PA. WE THINK IS IS RIDICULOUS HE GOT FIRED OVER THIS SITUATION.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS HERE, BUT IT APPEARS THE STREET RYEOUT IS  IN RESPONSE TO JOE PATERNO'S FIRING. SEE I GUESS IS HARD TO BELIEVE THIS GUY YOU THINK IS INFALLIBLE AND THIS  PROGRAM YOU THINK IS SACRED COULD HIDE SUCH HEINOUS ACTIVITY BUT THERE IS SOME PRECEDENT FOR THAT. YEAH.
AND JUST LIKE WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH NO ONE IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR  RELIGION N THIS CASE TO THE BALL. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY TO A POPE AND SOME OF HIS CARDINALS WHO  [BLEEP] UP. SO DON'T WORRY, ON SATURDAY YOU'LL STILL GET TO GO TO SERVICES AGAINST NEBRASKA. NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE YOUNG AND THAT WOULD BE A  TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT MEMORY TO SCAR YOU FOR LIFE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
