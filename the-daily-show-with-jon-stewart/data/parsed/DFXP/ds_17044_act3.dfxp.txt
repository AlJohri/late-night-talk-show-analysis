(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A REPORTER FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES". HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE OBAMAS." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JODI KANTOR. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE OBAMAS." I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU. I HEARD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS BOOK. THE PORTRAYING THE FIRST LADY VERY POORLY, AS AN ANGRY WOMAN. SHE WAS OUT ON GAYLE KING SHOW TALKING ABOUT IT. I SAW YOU ON CNN WHERE THE WOMAN WAS YELLING AT YOU. SO I MADE THE MISTAKE OF LISTENING TO THAT BEFORE READING. SO I WAS VERY ANGRY AT YOU.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
Jon: I READ IT.
AND?
Jon: SHE SEEMS NICE.
(LAUGHING).
Jon: REALLY. I'M SURPRISED AT THE CONTROVERSY BECAUSE THE BOOK SEEMS TO PORTRAY MICHELLE  OBAMA AS A COMPLEX YET HUMAN INDIVIDUAL STRUGGLING WITH THIS UNBELIEVABLE SITUATION  YET REMAINING THE MORAL COMPASS AND CENTER OF AN ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO FIND ITS FOOTING. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY TO YOU IS, HOW DARE YOU?
IT IS REALLY WEIRD TO ME. I'VE BEEN COVERING THE OBAMAS FOR FIVE YEARS. BASICALLY I ASKED TWO QUESTIONS: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE THESE TWO PRETTY  REGULAR PEOPLE AND PUT THEM IN THE EXTREMELY ABNORMAL SITUATION AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THE REPORTING IS FILLED WITH DETAILS OF HOW LIFE THERE IS REALLY KIND OF WEIRD AND HARD. AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THERE ADJUSTMENT LIKE TO BEING PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY. THEIR RISE WAS SO FAST. SO THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY COOPERATED WITH THE BOOK.
Jon: WHO TALKS TO YOU ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP?
WELL, 33 CURRENT AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDES. A LOT OF THEIR BEST FRIENDS. ALSO I'VE INTERVIEWED THE OBAMAS A BUNCH OF TIMES.
Jon: NAMES. TELL ME THEIR NAMES.
THEY'RE IN THERE. SUCH FIGURES AT VALERIE GARRETT AND ROBERT GIBBS AND DAVID AXELROD. ALSO I FACT-CHECKED THE BOOK.
Jon: WHAT? WHAT KIND OF WRITER ARE YOU?
WELL, AND SO THE WHITE HOUSE PRETTY MUCH KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT BEFORE IT CAME OUT. SO ANYWAY, I HAVE BEEN REALLY SURPRISED BECAUSE....
Jon: WHO IS MAD AT YOU? BECAUSE THE LADY ON CNN WAS ANGRY THAT YOU HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE COUPLE SINCE 2009.
WELL BY HER LOGIC, WE WOULDN'T WRITE OBITUARIES BECAUSE WE CAN'T TALK TO THE  DEAD PEOPLE. SO I DON'T KNOW. BUT THE THING....
Jon: WHAT? SORRY. THAT WAS AN ODD PLACE TO TAKE IT. GO AHEAD. WHO IS PUSHING BACK? IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UPSET WITH YOU?
YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE THING THAT IS A LITTLE BIT DELICATE IS THAT THERE IS SOME BEHIND-THE  -SCENES IN THE BOOK. THAT SHOWS US A LITTLE BIT HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE OBAMA... YOU KNOW,.
Jon: THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A SAUSAGE FACTORY. SHE'S NOT BEING METAPHORICAL. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO RAISE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY THEY HAVE A SAUSAGE FACTORY, THEY HAVE AN ORGANIC FARM TOO.
WE SEE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL IMAGES OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY TOGETHER, VERY  POLISHED AND PERFECT. THERE'S AN OVAL OFFICE MEETING IN THE FALL OF 2010 WHERE THE OBAMAS ARE SPECIFICALLY TOLD  DEMOCRATS LOVE SEEING YOU TOGETHER. AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING LESS POPULAR AT THIS POINT. THE FIRST LADY IS TOLD SPECIFICALLY HOW BADLY SHE'S NEEDED. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN 2012. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE OBAMA SUPPORTERS WATCHING.
Jon: (LAUGHING) (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO YOU KNOW THAT LIKE YOU KNOW THE 9,000 EMAILS YOU GET FROM THEM SAYING COME TO  DINNER WITH ME AND BARACK. THE BOOK IN PART IS SHOWING YOU HOW SHE BECOMES THIS POLITICALLY VERY POWERFUL FIGURE. SHE DOES HAVE AN INITIAL HARD TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHY? BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE IS A REALLY WEIRD, HARD PLACE TO LIVE.
Jon: BUT IN TERMS OF CONTROVERSY IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY THERE'S A LITTLE FRICTION BETWEEN HER AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT. I MEAN, I WORK IN COMEDY. MY WIFE HATES EVERYONE I WORK WITH. AS WELL SHE SHOULD. BUT LIKE THE CONTROVERSY IS SO... IT FEELS LIKE WHAT'S CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THIS BOOK  IS WHERE WE'VE COME IN THIS COUNTRY POLITICALLY FOR A POLITICIAN HOW UNTENABLE IT IS  TO BE A POLITICIAN ANYMORE. I MEAN THERE WERE SLAVES. MRS. ROOSEVELT WAS SLEEPING WITH SOME OTHER LADY WHILE FRANKLIN COULD WALK. THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON.
NOT ONLY THAT BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME STORIES ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO HAVE A FAMILY AND TWO YOUNG KIDS.
Jon: IT MUST BE.
THE FIRST TIME THAT MALIA AND SASHA TRIED TO DO TRICK OR TREATING ON HALLOWEEN IN  WASHINGTON THEY JUST WANTED TO GO TO A NORMAL NEIGHBORHOOD. THEIR PARENTS CAN'T DO THAT STUFF WITH THEM SO FRIENDS AND FAMILY CAME. THEY WERE SWARMED A LITTLE BIT. NEIGHBORS WERE TEXTING NEIGHBORS. THEY KIND OF HAD TO GO BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN DEFEAT. ACTUALLY WHETHER IT'S REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS, AFTER REPORTING THIS BOOK, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF FEEL LIKE "FREE THE FIRST FAMILY."  THE WAY WE'RE ASKING THESE PEOPLE TO LIVE IS VERY HARD.
Jon: WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT. WE COULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE WAY THAT OUR CULTURE OPERATES.
(LAUGHING).
Jon: OR WE COULD JUST DRIVE THEM UNDERGROUND. I THINK I KNOW WHICH DIRECTION THIS IS GOING IN. DO YOU THINK AT THIS POINT ANY PRESIDENT WILL EVER ALLOW ACCESS AGAIN, GIVEN HOW ALL  THESE BOOKS ALWAYS COME OUT WITH SOMETHING WHERE THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKE-- REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. DO YOU THINK THE FINAL VERSION OF ALL THIS WILL BE PRESIDENTS NO LONGER ALLOW COOPERATION  FROM REPORTERS?
WELL EXCEPT THAT YOU READ THE BOOK AND YOU ENDED UP THINKING THAT MICHELLE OBAMA  WAS A STRONG PERSON WITH A FIRM MORAL COMPASS.
Jon: BUT I ONLY READ IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WAS CRAZY (BEEP) IN THERE.
(LAUGHING).
Jon: YOU REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME. MY WHOLE WEEKEND. EXCEPT FOR THE GIANTS WHICH WAS AWESOME. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  GET "THE OBAMAS."  ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. JODI KANTOR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
