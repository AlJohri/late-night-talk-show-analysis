(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, AS YOU KNOW, I AM THE PROUD NEW OWNER OF A SUPERPAC WHICH SOUNDED GREAT AT FIRST. PRACTICALLY UNLIMITED MONEY TO SPEND HOWEVER I WANTED. THEN I SAW SOMETHING ON MORNING JOE THAT, WELL, FRANKLY SCARED ME.
SUPERPACS HAVE TO BE ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM A CAMPAIGN AND A CANDIDATE. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE WITH A SUPERPAC IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.
SO YOU'RE NOT COORDINATING ANY WAY WHATSOEVER?
MY GOODNESS IF WE COORDINATE IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER WE GO TO THE BIG HOUSE.
Jon: (GASPS) WHICH ONE OF YOUR BIG HOUSES DO YOU GO TO? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE BEACH HOUSE OR THE SKI CHALET? OR THE BIG HOUSE... I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL. THIS IS SERIOUS. I NEED GUIDANCE. STEPHEN! STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I REALLY NEED HELP.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: NO, I NEED HELP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
JON, PLEASE. THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, MY FRIENDS. THANK YOU. JON, JON, PLEASE, CAN WE MAKE THIS QUICK?
Jon: MAKE IT QUICK?
I WANT TO MAKE SURE LIAM NEESON GETS ENOUGH TIME TO TALK ABOUT "THE GRAY." (LAUGHTER).
Jon: VERY SUSPENSEFUL. I'M CONCERNED. I DON'T WANT TO SEEM UNGRATEFUL FOR THE STAGGERING AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH ALMOST NO LIMITATIONS  YOU PUT AT MY DISPOSAL FROM THE SUPERPAC.
AS YOU KNOW, JON, FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS ME FROM COORDINATING WITH YOU.
Jon: DAMN IT! SO CLOSE YET STYMIED BY THE UNPOSSIBLY STRICT REGULATIONS CONCERNING FEDERAL ELECTIONS.
JON, IF I MAY, THERE IS ONE SMALL LOOP-CHASM.
I'M CALLING ON THE SUPERPAC. I CANNOT COORDINATE OR COMMUNICATE WITH THEM DIRECTLY BUT I CAN SPEAK OUT AS A CITIZEN  TALKING TO YOU. I'M CALLING ON THEM TO EDIT OUT EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE OR TO PULL THE ENTIRE FILM.
I CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT I CAN TELL EVERYONE THROUGH TELEVISION. AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE WATCHING, WELL, I CAN'T PREVENT THAT, JON. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: STEPHEN, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WATCH YOUR SHOW TONIGHT. WAIT A SECOND. OH, I HAVE AN IDEA. HOLD ON. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS THAT GOING TO WORK? THAT'S GOING TO WORK.
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. I GOT IT. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST SET IT TO "THE COLBERT REPORT."
TONIGHT I TALK TO JON STEWART ABOUT SUPERPACS WITHOUT COORDINATING WITH HIM! THIS IS "THE KOHL BARE REPORT!" THANK YOU, AUDIENCE, PLEASE, PLEASE SIT DOWN. (LAUGHTER) NATION, SO MUCH TO GET TO TONIGHT, BUT FIRST I AM CALLING ON THE SUPERPAC. I CANNOT COORDINATE WITH THEM, I CAN'T COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY, BUT I CAN SPEAK OUT AS A CITIZEN  TALKING TO YOU AND I'M CALLING ON THEM NOT TO RUN VICIOUS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION ADS ADS THAT  IMPUGN AND BORDERLINE SLANDER ANY CANDIDATE IF IN ANY WAY THOSE ADS COULD BE TRACED BACK TO ME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT DID HE SAY? IT'S SO OBTUSE. I JUST WISH WE COULD COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY AND CLEARLY. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. I WONDER, IS "AMERICAN IDOL" ON? ♪ I GOT THE MOVES LIKE JAGGER, I GOT THE MOVES LIKE JAGGER... ♪  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: I TELL YOU WHAT, DOG, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY CHRISTINA, YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IT. HEY, WHAT'S ON B.E.T.?
NOTHING'S ON B.E.T.!
Jon: FINE! NOT WORKING! GET RID OF THIS EVE AND EVERYTHING. I JUST... I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT TO CALL THE LAWYER FOR MY SUPERPAC.
NOT BEFORE I CALL THE LAWYER FOR THE EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE.
Jon: WELL, WHO SHOULD WE CALL FIRST?
WELL, SINCE THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON, WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL AT THE SAME TIME.
Jon: RIGHT. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S LEGAL. HERE WE GO. (PHONE RINGS)
HELLO?
Jon: HELLO? TREVOR. ARE YOU THERE?
HELLO, STEPHEN?
HI, IT'S TREVOR POTTER, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HI, I AM SITTING HERE... SUPERSTAR CAMPAIGN LAWYER. I AM SITTING HERE WITH JON STEWART.
Jon: BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'RE NOT COORDINATING. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
Jon: TREVOR, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING. CAN I TELL STEPHEN WHAT I'VE DONE WITH IT?
YES. BUT REMEMBER, STEPHEN CANNOT REQUEST, SUBJECT, OR ASSESS TO ANY OF THE SUPERPAC'S ACTIVITY.
GOT IT. SO JUST SPEAK UP IF WE CROSS THE LINE.
WILL DO.
Jon: LAST WEEKEND I BOUGHT FIVE 60-SECOND AD LOTS ON CHANNEL A WCSC.
CHARLES ON THE'S NEWS LEADER.
Jon: (GASPS) OKAY. THE AIRTIME COSTS $3600 AND IN IT I ACCUSE MITT ROMNEY OF BEING A SERIAL KILLER. (LAUGHTER) IS THAT OKAY, STEPHEN?
I CANNOT COORDINATE WITH YOU IN ANY WAY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: ALL RIGHT MOVING ON. LAST NIGHT THE SUPERPAC THAT SUPPORTS YOU BUT WHICH I CONTROL INDEPENDENTLY RAN ANOTHER AD IN  SOUTH CAROLINA AT A TOTAL PRODUCTION COST OF $15,000 EQUATING WITH A VOTE FOR HERMAN  CAIN WITH A VOTE FOR STEPHEN COLBERT. ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT, STEPHEN?
I CANNOT COORDINATE WITH YOU IN ANY WAY. (LAUGHTER) AND I HAVEN'T SEEN THE AD BUT WHEN I WATCHED IT, I THOUGHT THAT THE FINAL SHOT OF A  HANDSOME MAN SMILING COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT LONGER. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND WAS A LITTLE... WITH A LITTLE COLOR CORRECTION AND  MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT THE CROW'S FEET. BUT AS I SAY, I HAVE NOT SEEN IT, JON, AND I CANNOT COORDINATE WITH YOU IN ANY WAY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELL, I HAPPEN TO THINK IT LOOKED NICE AND IT WAS A VERY FLATTERING PICTURE OF YOU.
I WOULDN'T KNOW. TREVOR...
Jon: I THINK WE LOST HIM. ARE YOU STILL THERE?
YES, I AM.
Jon: HOLY (BLEEP). THIS IS STILL LEGAL?
IT SHOULD BE OKAY, SO FAR. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: ALL RIGHT, I HAVE SOME FUTURE PLANS.
I CAN'T COORDINATE.
Jon: THE NEXT SUPERPAC ATTACK AD ATTACK IT IS ATTACK ADS OF ROMNEY AND GINGRICH'S  UNCOORDINATED SUPERPAC ADS. THEY'LL BE RUNNING IN HEAD OF THE CHARLES ON THE.
I CANNOT COORDINATE IN ANY WAY.
Jon: AND WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D BUY TIME IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA.
UM, I CANNOT COORDINATE IN ANYWAY.
Jon: THEN I DECIDED NO, WE'RE JUST GOING DO IN THE CHARLESTON.
I CANNOT COORDINATE IN ANY WAY. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: ALL RIGHT. TREVOR?
STILL HERE.
Jon: YOU HEARD ALL THAT? NOBODY'S GOING TO THE BIG HOUSE.
WELL, IT DOESN'T SOUND AS THOUGH YOU VIOLATED THE COORDINATION RULE. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE CRIMINAL PENALTIES THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS, NOBODY I CAN THINK OF HAS GONE TO JAIL SOLELY FOR COORDINATING. SO THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. YOU MIGHT GET FINED.
Jon: FINED? HOW MUCH?
FOUR TO SIX FIGURES.
Jon: FOUR TO SIX FIGURES? WHERE AM I GOING TO GET THAT KIND OF... (LAUGHTER). TREVOR? I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE CRAZY AND... AS A MATTER OF FACT I FEEL WEIRDLY CRIMINAL  EVEN ASKING BUT IF I GET FINED COULD I PAY THAT WITH SUPERPAC MONEY?
YES, PROBABLY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, STEPHEN, IT HAS BEEN GREAT NOT COORDINATING WITH YOU.
AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT NOT COORDINATING WITH YOU, MY FRIEND!
Jon:LY SEE YOU TONIGHT ON THE RIDE HOME.
ON THE BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO?
Jon: STEPHEN COLBERT, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
