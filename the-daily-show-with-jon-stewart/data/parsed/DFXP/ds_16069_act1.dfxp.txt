MAY 31, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS SKWRAOUFRPLT WE'RE BACK, BABY! WE'VE GOT A NICE ONE TONIGHT. JIMMY FALLON IS GOING TO BE A GUEST ON THE PROGRAM. I'M SO EXCITED. STEPHEN COLBERT GOT HIS ICE CREAM FLAVOR. TONIGHT WITH JIM BY WE'RE GOING TO -- WITH JIMMY WE'RE GOING TOWN VAIL MY NEW FLAVOR. IT'S CALLED AWESOME HEATH BAR (bleep) ALL Y'ALL DHIP. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T HAVE ICE CREAM. [LAUGHTER] WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK BECAUSE WE PREFER NOT TO WORK. [LAUGHTER] WE DECIDED TO COME BACK LAST WEEK BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T PAY US. [LAUGHTER] IF WE DID NOT. KIDDING. WORK OF PASSION THIS WHOLE --  [LAUGHTER] UM -- SPEAKING OF PASSION WHAT IS THE FIRST STORY HEAR ABOUT WHEN YOU GET BACK? JOAN OF ANCHORAGE IS BACK JUST IN TIME TO KILL MY POST TRUMP SADNESS DISORDER.
SARAH PALIN IS RAISING NEW SPECULATIONS ABOUT HER INTENTIONS.
AFTER STEALING THE THUNDER AT THE ANNUAL ROLLING THUNDER BIKE RALLY SHE KICKED OFF HER ONE  NATION BUS TOUR WITH A STOP AT THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES TO SEE THE DECORATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND  ALL THE WAY REPORTERS WERE CHASING BEHIND HER WITH THE SAME QUESTION.
Jon: MISS PALIN, WHY ARE WE FOLLOWING YOUR BUS? WHAT IS WRONG WITH US? [LAUGHTER] OH, GOD SHE'S ACTING UP. RUN, EVERYBODY. [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUS THAT'S NOT THE ONE QUESTION. WHAT IS THE ONE QUESTION?
IS SHE GOING FOR IT IN 2012? LNCH SAR RAL PALIN RUN.
IS SHE R *EFG UP FOR 2012.
IS SHE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
Jon: HELLO LAME STREAM MEDIA? WHY BECAUSE SHE'S DRIVING HER FAMILY AROUND KEY PRIMARY STATES IN A BUS IN HER SIGNATURE IN  ROUGHLY SIZE OF PREAMBLE OF CONSTITUTION. HAS EVERYONE CONSIDERED THAT SARAH PALIN AND HER FAMILY ARE DRIVING FROM TOWN TO TOWN  SOLVING MYSTERIES AND UNMASKING MONSTERS? [LAUGHTER] HAS ANYBODY CONSIDERED THAT? NO, NO. WHY THE PALIN OBSESSION. TIM PAWLENTY AND HIS FAMILY HOPPED IN THE CUSTOM MADE LOSABAGO. THERE'S A PRETTY WAY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS SARAH PALIN  WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE RUN THING. SOMEBODY COULD ASK HER.
ALL THE DETAILS AS TO WHERE SHE'S GOING LATER TODAY AND  LATER THIS WEEK ARE KEPT CLOSE TO THE VEST.
PALIN REFUSED TO GIVE THE SCHEDULE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE PALIN IS SAYING. SHE JUST WON'T SAY.
Jon: SHE'S IN THE BUS WRAPPED IN THE CONSTITUTION SIGNED BY SARAH PALIN. HOW DO NOT KNOW WHERE SHE'S GOING. IT WAS A BUS BRETT MICHELS SAID -- MICHAELS WAS QUOTE "A BIT MUCH."  LET US LET HER TELL US WHAT IT IS.
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. IT'S NOT A HEAT-SEEKING TOUR.
Jon: I GET IT. YOU'RE IN STEALTH MODE. HOW DO YOU GET AROUND WHEN YOU ARE SEEKING PUBLICITY? [SCREAMING] THAT'S ODD. WHY ARE WE PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE GAME? CAN'T YOU TELL THE REPORTERS WHERE YOU ARE GOING SO WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR LIVES.
I DON'T THINK I OWE ANYTHING TO THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR ME TO BECOME SOME KIND OF CONVENTIONAL POLITICIAN. NO, I WANT THEM TO HAVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF WORK ON A TOUR LIKE THIS.
SO THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST A (bleep) YOU FOR ASKING WHICH NEWSPAPERS YOU READ? [LAUGHTER] YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT SARAH PALIN GAVE THOSE REMARKS ABOUT AVOIDING THE PRESS INTO WHAT  LOOKED LIKE A CAMERA WHICH WAS APPARENTLY ALLOWED ON TO THE BUS. THERE'S A SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR THAT. SHE WAS GIVING AN INTERVIEW TO GRETA VAN SUSTEREN WHO LATER EXPLAINED ON HER BLOG THAT PALIN  WORKS FOR FOX JUST AS ANY EMPLOYEE OR SOMEONE ON CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER NETWORK SHE'S  OBLIGED NOT TO SPEAK WITH OTHERS. HER ANSWER SHOULD BE I'M AN UNCONVENTIONAL MAVERICK WHO DOESN'T PLAY BY THE RULES AND  ROGER AISLES WILL NOT LET ME. WE'RE JOINED BY SAMANTHA BEE LIVE FROM DES MOINES, IOWA. THANKS FOR JOINING ME. I KNOW GOVERNOR PALIN SAYS IT'S A FAMILY VACATION. IT DOES SEEM LIKE A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. HOW CAN SHE DO THIS AND KEEP HER JOB AS A FOX NEWS ANALYST?
JON, FOR FOX TO FIRE SARAH PALIN FOR TAKING A MUCH NEEDED VACATION WITH THE FAMILY THAT  WOULD BE MONSTROUS. I THEY THAT'S HOW YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS BUT SOME FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY HAVE STANDARDS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ANYONE ELSE WHO HOPPED ON A BUS AND WENT TO IOWA AND ALL THESE OTHER SWING STATE AND  THINGS, HISTORICAL LANDMARKS WOULD BE FORCED TO DECLARE WHETHER THEY ARE RUNNING OR NOT. GINGRICH, SANTORUM LOST THEIR JOB FOR DOING JUST THAT. FOX HAS DIFFERENT RULES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
THEY HAVE THE SAME RULE FOR HE EVERYBODY. IF WE LIKE YOU, YOU CAN STAY. THEY FIRED RICK SANTORUM WHEN THEY GOOGLED HIM. [LAUGHTER] AS FOR NEWT GINGRICH, THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS REALLY JUST A GOOD EXCUSE TO LET HIM GO. WHAT NEWS NETWORK WANTS TO EMPLOY AN ANGRY OLD BABY? IT'S NOT 60 MINUTES, YOU KNOW? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: FAIR ENOUGH. HE DOES LOOK LIKE A GIANT ANGRY BABY. IT SEEMS UNFAIR THAT SARAH PALIN GETS TO PRETEND LIKE SHE'S BOTH RUNNING AND NOT RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT DEPENDING ON WHAT IS MOST HELPFUL.
SHE'S A MAVERICK. SHE MAKES HER OWN RULES. CAN'T A LONE WOLF MAMA GRIZZLY FORM A PAC, GO ON TOUR AND TALK TO VOTERS ABOUT HER VISION FOR  AMERICA WITHOUT HAVING TO GIVE UP HER SEVEN FIGURE TELEVISION JOB AT A PLACE THAT TREATS HER  AS SOME SORT OF CONSERVATIVE DEMI GOING. WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?
Jon: HOW LONG IS THIS FAMILY VACATION SCHEDULED FOR ANYWAY?
THEIR LAST STOP IS IN JANUARY 2013. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT COINCIDES WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION FOR PRESIDENT.
NO IT JUST SAYS PI D.C.
Jon: IT'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION, DC. SHE'S RUN.
SHE'S NOT RUNNING [MUSIC PLAYING]
SOUNDS LIKE THE SPWUS ABOUT TO LEAVEEL. I BETTER SCA DATEL.
Jon: HER BUS HORN PLAYS HAIL TO THE CHIEF.
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S WHEELS ON THE BUS. THE WHILES ON THE BUS THEY
