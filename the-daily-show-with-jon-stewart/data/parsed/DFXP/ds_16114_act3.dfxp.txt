Jon: WITH US TONIGHT HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF PLEASE WELCOME  BACK TO THE PROGRAM ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN. SIR. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.
Jon: YOUR TERM IS IS DONE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH.
RIGHT. END OF SEPTEMBER.
Jon: END OF SEPTEMBER. DO YOU HAVE PLANS FOR RELAXATION? WHAT DOES SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED AS HARD AS YOU HAVE FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE UNDER THIS  KIND OF PRESSURE, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR YOURSELF TO... DO YOU GO TO A SANDALS RESORT? WHAT DOES AN ADMIRAL DO?
MY PLAN IS TO TAKE A LONG WINTER'S NAP.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO IT.
ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO COME DOWN AND REST. WE'VE BEEN GOING AT A PRETTY QUICK PACE HERE FOR UPWARDS OF SIX STRAIGHT YEARS. IT'S TIME TO TAKE A BREAK. WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT.
Jon: WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU AND WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT DURING  A RECENT SPRING BREAK TRIP TOGETHER. YOU COME FROM SHOW BUSINESS FOLK. YOUR FATHER WAS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
RIGHT. HE WAS A PUBLICIST OUT IN HOLLYWOOD. THAT'S THE BUSINESS I GREW UP IN. ALTHOUGH AS I POINT OUT, I LEFT WHEN I WAS 17 WHICH WAS 1964. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME AGO.
Jon: YOU WERE A 17-YEAR-OLD KID LIVING IN LOS ANGELES MEETING ALL THESE FAMOUS  PEOPLE AND YOU REBEL AGAINST YOUR PARENTS....
(LAUGHING).
Jon:... AND SAY, "I'VE HAD IT. I'M JOINING THE NAVY."
ACTUALLY THE REALLY NICE THING ABOUT MY PARENTS IS THAT THEY WERE NOT JUDGMENTAL. THEY STRONGLY SUPPORTED IT.
Jon: THEY WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR SON NOT, LET'S SAY, MOVING INTO THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS AND BECOMING A WASTE CASE WITH JIM MORRISON?
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. ONE OF THE STRENGTHS IN THE FAMILY WAS MY DAD, WHO WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLICIST, NEVER REALLY BROUGHT IT HOME. WE HAD FUN WITH IT. GOT TO MEET THE PEOPLE. AS A KID SOME OF THOSE TV SHOWS, IT WAS PRETTY NEAT. BUT I THINK SOMEONE WOULD LOOK BACK ON IT AND SAY I GOT ABOUT AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS I  POSSIBLY COULD.
Jon: YES. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT'S THE CASE. YET THINGS WORKED OUT VERY NICELY. NOW, WHEN YOU STARTED TO RISE UP THROUGH THIS, WHEN YOU ENTERED INTO THAT POLITICAL  SPHERE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY YOU'RE WORKING WITH JUST THE NAVY AND YOUR COMMANDING SHIPS. WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE WHEN YOU JOINED THE MORE... GOT INVOLVED WITH MORE OF THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP? WAS THAT A STRUGGLE TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION?
I HAD BEEN IN AND OUT OF WASHINGTON IN JOBS IN THE NAVY SINCE THE MID '90s. I HAD ALWAYS SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON CAPITOL HILL BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE MY BANKERS. SO IF WE WANT TO GET EQUIPMENT FOR THE TROOPS OR SHIPS, AIRPLANES, ET CETERA, I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THEM. BUT WHAT I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND COME ING INTO THIS JOB WAS THAT THE POLITICAL... THAT THE POLITICAL LEVEL I WAS AT, EVERY TIME YOU WALK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT  DOMINATES ALL THE ISSUES. FOR A MILITARY GUY, THAT'S NOT A FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT. TO ADJUST TO THAT, I WORK HARD TO GIVE MY BEST MILITARY ADVICE AND TO STAY, WHICH IS  CRITICAL FOR OUR MILITARY AND IN OUR COUNTRY, TO STAY APOLITICAL GIVING THAT ADVICE. WHEN THE PRESIDENT MAKES DECISIONS, WE CARRY IT OUT. THAT WAS A BIT OF A SHOCK CERTAINLY IN THE FIRST YEAR THAT I WAS IN THIS JOB.
Jim: I....
Jon: I WAS SURPRISED IN MEETING THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE MET IN THE MILITARY HOW  APOLITICAL THEY TRULY ARE. HOW IT REALLY IS SO MUCH MORE MISSION BASED AND FRATERNAL. IT'S ABOUT THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND EXECUTING THE TASK THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN.
AS YOU SAW ON THE TRIP THAT WE WERE ON TOGETHER, THEY CARE  SO MUCH ABOUT WHO THEY'RE WITH, WHO THEY'RE FIGHTING WITH. IN MANY WAYS THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THERE. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR THEIR COUNTRY. THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR MISSION. THIS IS THE BEST MILITARY I'VE EVER SEEN. I MEAN I'VE BEEN DOING THIS 196. OVER 4...1968. OVER 43 YEARS. UNQUESTIONABLY THEY ARE SUPERB.
Jim: I WAS SURPRISED AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN WE LANDED IN KANDAHAR THAT YOU FORCED THEM TO CARRY YOU AROUND ON A LITTER. (LAUGHING) I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GOT ROSE PET ALS. (LAUGHING) IT'S A DRY AND ARID PLACE. BUT I'M GLAD YOU WERE COMFORTABLE.
ACTUALLY THAT USUALLY ONLY HAPPENS ONCE A TRIP.
Jon: (LAUGHING) (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHAT SO IMPRESSED ME, YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO INTERACT A LOT WITH THE GUYS. IT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL. BUT THE INTERACTION THAT THEY HAD WITH YOU, THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE DEPTH TO IT. THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GATHERED THEM AROUND THAT FIRST NIGHT AND YOU WERE SORT  OF GOING AROUND AND YOU WERE SAYING WHO IS ON THE FIRST TOUR AND SECOND TOUR AND YOU  STARTED TO SEE HANDS GO UP. SOME GUYS, 5th TOUR, 6th TOUR. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DIFFICULTY IT WAS ON THEIR FAMILIES. THE MOMENTS THAT YOU SPENT WITH THEM, THEY REALLY SEEMED TO APPRECIATE IN A VERY DEEP WAY.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I-- AND I'M HERE TONIGHT WITH DEBRA WHO IS IN THE AUDIENCE  TONIGHT AND MY WIFE OF OVER 40 YEARS, 41 YEARS, WE'VE TRIED TO REPRESENT THEIR NEEDS. WE'VE TRIED TO BE IN TOUCH ENOUGH WITH THEM SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING, WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO INCLUDING PAYING THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE. AND I TELL THEM THIS. THIS REALLY IS TRUE. THERE ISN'T A DECISION THAT I MAKE OR A RECOMMENDATION THAT  I MAKE THAT DOESN'T TAKE THEIR NEEDS AS BEST I CAN UNDERSTAND IT INTO ACCOUNT. AND SO THE STRENGTH OF OUR MILITARY ARE THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO ENGAGE THEM.
Jon: IT SURPRISED ME THOUGH THE FLEXIBILITY. I HAD A STEREOTYPICAL VIEW OF THE MILITARY AS BEING A MUCH MORE RIGID ORGANIZATION. YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CHALLENGE YOU AND TO CHALLENGE  YOUR THINKING. THAT BRINGS AN ETHOS INTO WHAT YOU DO, INTO YOUR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THAT  SEEMS MORE FLEXIBLE THAN WHAT WE HAVE.
WHAT I'VE FOUND OVER THE YEARS AS I'VE GOTTEN MORE SENIOR AND INTO THESE JOBS OF  GREATER RESPONSIBILITY IS THE DIVERSITY OF OPINION AND VIEWS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IT ALLOWS ME IN THE END TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION. IT DOESN'T MAKE MY STAFF COMFORTABLE. EVERY DAY, FOR SURE. ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T MAKE OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS VERY COMFORTABLE BECAUSE EVERYBODY  DOESN'T DO IT BUT I TRY TO DO THAT TO ARRIVE AT THE BEST DECISION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  IN TERMS OF THE ADVICE THAT I GIVE THE PRESIDENT. AND THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.
Jon: I WAS TRULY HONORED TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF THAT TRIP WITH YOU TO AFGHANISTAN. TRULY HONORED TO BE ABLE TO THANK THE MEN AND WOMEN IN PERSON. I JUST WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN YOUR TIME AND HOPE WE GET TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER  AND THAT I GET TO TRY ON THAT JACKET AT SOME POINT.
THIS IS NOT A SERGEANT'S JACKET. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN.
