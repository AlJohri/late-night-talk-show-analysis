APRIL 16, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WE WILL... WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT JANE GOODALL, THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERT ON CHIMPS. OUR TOPIC TONIGHT: THE COMING APE REBELLION. AND WILL BANANAS SAVE US ALL? BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, FOLKS. YOU KNOW I'M A SIMPLE MAN. ALL I NEED TO BE HAPPY IS A DECENT CHEESE BURGER, A TASTY BREW AND A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP  FROM ALL MY FAVORITE SPORTS TEAMS AND ON OCCASION WHERE A POWERFUL ORGANIZATION TRIPS ON (BEEP).
PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOLLOWING A TRIP TO COLOMBIA, A VISIT THAT WAS  OVERSHADOWED BY A PROSTITUTION SCANDAL INVOLVING MEMBERS OF THE SECRET SERVICE.
Jon: AH-AH. SOMEBODY LOVES ME. SOMEBODY LOVES ME. YEAH! OH, MY GOD. TO THE POINT-NATOR. THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!
11 SPECIAL AGENT ALLEGEDLY BROUGHT PROSTITUTES BACK TO THE HOTEL. THURSDAY MORNING HOTEL MANAGERS REALIZED ONE WOMAN HADN'T PICKED UP HER I.D.BY  CHECKOUT TIME AND FOUND HER IN A ROOM FIGHTING WITH AN AGENT AFTER HE FAILED TO PAY HER.
Jon: RED EAGLE, THIS IS VICTORY ONE. YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS A GROUP-ON DEAL. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. CURRENTLY NOT PACKING GREEN BACKS. NOW I HAVE A CODE. OH-OH. THIS STORY SHOULD BE DOMINATING CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS, COMEDY SHOWS, NEWS  NETWORKS BUT IT'S NOT DOMINATING. IT CAN'T BECAUSE LAST WEDNESDAY SOME LADY SAID A STUPID THING.
WHAT YOU HAVE IS MITT ROMNEY RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY SAYING, WELL, YOU KNOW, MY WIFE TELLS ME THAT WHAT WOMEN REALLY CARE ABOUT ARE ECONOMIC ISSUES. WHEN I LISTEN TO MY WIFE THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING. GUESS WHAT. HIS WIFE HAS ACTUALLY NEVER WORKED A DAY IN HER LIFE.
Jon: AND (BEEP) THE STORM IN THREE. YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST CUE IT. YES, THAT STUPID REMARK TRIGGERED A FAWN MEDIA (BEEP) CATASTROPHE. IT WAS ON EVERY NEWS NETWORK. MEET THE PRESS. FACE THE NATION. IT WAS EVERYWHERE.
TO RAISE CHILDREN IS THE MOST NOBLE JOB ON THE PLANET. IT IS THE HARDEST JOB ON THE PLANET.
Jon: GOD BLESS. RAISING FIVE KIDS VERY HARD. THE HARDEST JOB ON THE PLANET. TELL US TO THE DOCTOR. SPACE NEUROSURGEON. FOR ACCEPTS, NURSE. THERE THEY GO. HIS BRAIN IS GOING. OH, GRAVITY. ( APPLAUSE ) SPACE NEUROSURGEON IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST JOB. THE EASIEST JOB WAS FILLING UP FOX'S PROGRAMMING AFTER ROSEN'S COMMENTS. THERE WASN'T A SHOW, THERE WASN'T A SATELLITE INTERVIEW, THERE WASN'T A DAY THAT WENT BY THAT FOX DID NOT TURN THE FULL FORCE OF THEIR IRE ON TO  THE NEW POSTER CHILD FOR ELITE HOMEMAKER SNOB. ALL BLAZING WITH RIGHTEOUS YET SOMEWHAT NURTURING INDIGNATION.
I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE DEMEANING COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT MOTHERS. IT'S SUCH A DISCONNECT WITH SO MANY PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEIR MOTHERS AND THEIR GRANDMOTHERS.
SHE WAS PLAYING CLASS WARFARE WITH GENDER.
IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
THIS IS A GRENADE ESSENTIALLY.
I THINK IT'S MORE THAN JUST A WAR ON THE FAMILY. IT'S A WAR ON TRADITION.
CONTEMPT FOR ALL CONSERVATIVE MOMS.
THE COMMENTS THAT ROSEN MADE TODAY HAVE AWAKENED MANY MAMA GRIZZLIES ACROSS THE NATION.
Jon: TO BE FAIR, IT IS ALSO SPRING. QUICK SIDE NOTE PLAN'S PIN IS A BAROMETER THAT TELLS YOU WHAT SIDE OF THE CULTURE WARS  YOU'RE ON. PATRIOTIC REAL AMERICANS REAL IT LIKE THIS. BUT IF YOU'RE FROM NEW JERSEY AND AN EAST COAST LIBERAL ELITE YOU THINK IT'S A TONGUE  IN CHEEK HOMAGE TO THE SOPRANOS.
SHE WAS A WHO-A.
Jon: I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE'S AN OUTSIDE  CHANCE THAT SARAH PALIN'S PIN IS JUST PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE LATE RALPH CIFARETTO. THE DEMOCRATS SEEM STUNNED BY THE REACTION. HERE'S WHY. FOR MONTHS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TEARING EACH OTHER APART. AND THE NEWS MEDIA WAS FOCUSED ON THAT. ONE RIGHT WING GAFFE AFTER ANOTHER. MICHELLE BACKMAN THEN VACCINES CAUSE MENTAL RETARDATION. HERMAN CAIN'S UNORTHODOX LADY EMPLOYEE MEASURING TECHNIQUE. RICK PERRY'S SUMMER RETREAT AT NNNN-HEAD. NO MATTER WHAT DEMOCRATS DID OR SAID, NOBODY GAVE A (BEEP) BECAUSE ANY TIME THEY SAID IT, THE MEDIA WOULD GET DISTRACTED BY NEWT GINGRICH'S OPEN MARRIAGE WITH A MOON WIFE, LIKE NOBODY KNEW. BUT LAST WEEK RICK SANTORUM CONCEDED. PRIMARIES OVER. GENERAL ELECTION ON. ALL THE FIRE POWER, THE RIGHT IS WASTING ON EACH OTHER HAS NOW BEEN RETRAINED ON THEIR  ACTUAL OPPONENTS. LIKE THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T REALIZE THEY HAD GONE FROM ENGLAND TO AMERICA WHERE THE  TRAFFIC IS NOW COMING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION. DEMOCRATS GOT SO COMFORTABLE JUST GOING, OH, NOBODY IS COMING ON THE STREET. THEY DIDN'T KNOW (BEEP), BOOM. HERE'S HOW CRAZY IT IS AND POSSIBLY OVEREXCITED THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY GOT.
MY CAREER CHOICE WAS TO BE A MOTHER. I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RESPECT CHOICES THAT WOMEN MAKE.
Jon: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? HILLARY ROSEN JUST MADE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PRO-CHOICE. CATS AND DOGS, BLACK AND WHITE. MITT ROMNEY CAN NOW CAMPAIGN ON MOTHERHOOD BEING HARD. PROBABLY THE ONLY ISSUE HE HASN'T FLIP FLOPPED ON. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY IS GOING TO DIG UP AN OLD CLIP OF ROMNEY SAYING THE OPPOSITE OF  MOTHERHOOD BEING HARD WORK.
85% OF THE PEOPLE ON A FORM OF WELFARE ASSISTANCE IN MY STATE HAD NO WORK REQUIREMENT. AND I WANTED TO INCREASE THE WORK REQUIREMENT. I SAID, FOR INSTANCE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE A CHILD TWO YEARS OF AGE, YOU NEED TO GO TO WORK. IT WILL COST THE STATE MORE PROVIDING THAT DAY CARE BUT I WANT THE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE  THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. I THINK MITT ROMNEY SAID HIS OWN WIFE HAD NO DIGNITY. DOESN'T HE KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO HILLARY ROSEN. RUN, MITT. EVEN McCAIN
