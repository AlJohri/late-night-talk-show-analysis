(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "BOOMERANG: TRAVELS IN THE NEW  THIRD WORLD." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL LEWIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK. PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS.
Jon: THEY SHOULD. THE BOOK IS "BOOMERANG." MY FIRST QUESTION OBVIOUSLY WHO WILL PLAY BEN BERNANKE IN THE  MOVIE VERSION OF THIS? BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YET TO HAVE ONE OF THESE THAT ISN'T GOING TO GO TO A MOVIE. "MONEYBALL," CONGRATULATIONS, ALL THOSE GOOD THINGS. VERY NICE. VERY NICE.
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?
Jon: HAVE I SEEN "MONEYBALL?"
YES.
Jon: YES. LISTEN, I LOVE BASEBALL MOVIES "THE NATURAL" "BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY."  YOU CAN DO ANY BASEBALL MOVIE NOW SEE ONE AS SMART AS THAT ONE AND WELL DONE AS THAT ONE...
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO SUCK. (LAUGHTER) WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE MAKING IT I THOUGHT THEY WERE INSANE. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GO HIDE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: IS THAT HOW YOU PITCHED IN THE THE ROOM? (LAUGHTER)
THE GENIUS OF BENNETT MILLER, THE DIRECTOR, AND BRAD PITT'S PERFORMANCE IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THEY TOOK A BOOK THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A MOVIE AND THEY MADE IT INTO A GREAT MOVIE. NOW I'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM. I BACKED AWAY FROM IT AND HID FROM IT FOR SEVEN YEARS.
Jon: NO ONE CHECKS UP ON THAT (BLEEP). JUST SAY "I ALWAYS KNEW THAT'D BE GREAT." (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL, I REMEMBER YOU TELLING  ME IN 2009 HOW YOU THOUGHT THAT THE ADAPTATION OF THAT WOULD MAKE AN OSCAR-WINNING FILM. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S YOUR CLIP. THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DONE. NOW THIS, ON THE OTHER HAND. IF I MAY, THE PREMISE OF THIS BOOK... YOU TAKE US THROUGH ICELAND, GREECE, IRELAND, GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES AND EACH ONE DEVOTED TO TELLING US WHY THAT AREA IS-- AGAIN YOU  USE THE COLLOQUIAL TERM-- (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)
IT'S FINANCIAL DISASTER TOURISM.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S TOURING BANKRUPT COUNTRIES. AND THE THING THAT WAS SO INTERESTING TO ME THAT LED ME TO DO THIS THING IS YOU THINK OF  THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND YOU THINK OF IT AS ONE THING. LIKE THE SAME THING HAPPENED EVERYWHERE. AND THE SAME CAUSE HAPPENED EVERYWHERE. IT WAS A PILE OF MONEY WAS LEFT IN A DARK ROOM AND THE PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER THEY  WANTED WITH IT. TODAY... EVERYBODY FACES THE SAME TEMPTATION. THE BANKS WERE WILLING TO LEND TO ANYBODY. BUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND THE MONEY FOR ME BECAME A  PRISM THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE SOCIETY. IT WAS LIKE A WHEN DOE INTO THE SOCIETY. THEY EXPRESSED KIND OF DEEP CULTURAL TRAITS THROUGH HOW THEY BEHAVED. SO I WANDERED THE WORLD AND DESCRIBED IT. AND THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED DPS I MAY GO ON A BIT?
Jon: PLEASE.
SO THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WERE SO INTERESTING BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THE... EACH  WAS PECULIAR BUT EACH SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE. IN THE END THE BOOK WAS ALWAYS GOING TO COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: WHAT'S INTERESTING IS, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE... YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GREECE. GREECE WAS A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE REALLY DESTROYED THE BANKS AND ICELAND IS SORT OF THE OPPOSITE. THE BANKS DESTROYED THE STATES. THE BANKERS. AND IRELAND JUST SEEMED LIKE A SITUATION WHERE THEY EXPECTED IT AND THEY'RE JUST NOW... NOW  THEY'RE JUST GOING "YEAH, I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN." (LAUGHTER)  AND THEY'RE SUCKING IT UP.
THE IRISH HAVE A TALENT FOR SUFFERING. (LAUGHTER) THEY WERE WAITING FOR THIS. I MEAN, ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN A ROOM FULL OF IRISH PEOPLE, THE  STATUS GOES TO THE PERSON WHO'S HAD THE WORST THING HAPPEN TO THEM MOST RECENTLY. (LAUGHTER) AND SO THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO COMPETE WITH EACH  OTHER FOR HOW BAD THEY HAVE IT. AND... BUT THE STORIES ARE INCREDIBLE. ICELAND IS A NATION OF 300,000 PEOPLE. THE SIZE OF PEORIA. THEY TOOK THEIR THREE LITTLE BANKS AND TURNED THEM INTO THREE GLOBAL BANKS THAT HAD ALL  TOGETHER $140 BILLION WORTH OF ASSETS. ICELAND... THE WAY IT MADE ITS MONEY UP UNTIL SEVEN YEARS AGO WAS FISHING. THAT'S WHAT YOU COULD DO IN ICELAND TO MAKE MONEY. PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY WASHING OFF OF FISHING BOATS AND BECOMING CURRENCY TRADERS IN DAYS. A MATTER OF DAYS. AND THEY TOLD THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE GOOD AT THIS. THEIR PRESIDENT WAS WANDERING THE WORLD SAYING ICELANDERS WERE NATURALLY SUITED TO BECOME HEDGE  FUND PEOPLE AND THEY HAD THIS NATURAL GIFT THAT SOMEHOW HADN'T EXPRESSED ITSELF FOR A THOUSAND  YEARS BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN...
Jon: AND THEY WERE KILLING IT FOR THOSE FIRST COUPLE YEARS.
FOR FIVE YEARS THEY WERE GREAT. THEN THEY LOST $100 BILLION. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: IT HAPPENS!
IT HAPPENS, YES.
Jon: .
AND IT WAS THE MEN. IT WAS JUST THE MEN. THE MEN FISHED AND THE MEN MOVED OFF THE FISHING BOATS INTO THE BANKS. AND THE WOMEN... YOU COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED. THE MEN SAID TO THEIR WIVES "I MOW WHAT I'M DOING. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE." (LAUGHTER) "I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING THERE, YOU NEVER ASKED ME ABOUT THE FISH, DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THE MONEY."  AND THEY WENT AND DID THIS STUFF AND THE WOMEN WENT "ALL RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING ALL RIGHT." THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE LOST. WE'RE LOST. HOW COME YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR DIRECTIONS? AND WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE, IT CREATED... THE MEN HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE BANKS. WOMEN HAVE GONE IN TO RUN THE BANKS. THEY GOT RID OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE THE FIRST LESBIAN HEAD OF STATE MAKING... MAKING SOME KIND OF POINT THERE. THE WOMEN HAVE SAID "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING." (LAUGHTER)  AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S THIS NATION... THEY ALL KNEW EACH OTHER. THEY'VE HAD THIS... THIS REALIZATION OF HOW DANGEROUS MEN ARE WITH MONEY. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO PUT IT. BECAUSE IT WAS... IT ALMOST STRUCK ME... WHEN YOU READ THOSE STORIES OF A LOST TRIBE IN THE  AMAZON THAT IS DISCOVERED AND, YOU KNOW, THE WHITE MAN COMES IN AND HE'S GOING TO TELL THEM HOW  THINGS GO AND HE INADVERTENTLY SNEEZES AND EVERYBODY DIES. (LAUGHTER) THEY WERE NOT READY FOR THE CONTAGION AND THE CON THE AGE JOB DESTROYED THEM LIKE THAT.
Jon: THEY WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD  MAKE MONEY OUT OF MONEY WITHOUT ANY EFFORT. IF YOU FISHED AND SOMEONE OFFERED YOU THE CHANCE TO BE AN INVESTMENT BANKER, YOU'D TAKE IT. FISHING IS HARD. INVESTMENT BANKING IS NOT. (LAUGHTER) AND THE THING IS, YOU KNOW WHO THEY WERE IMITATING? US. THEY GOT THIS IDEA FROM US. YOU'RE WELCOME.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE TIME TO STICK AROUND?
YEAH.
Jon: SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. "BOOMERANG" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW." WE'LL THROW IT UP ON THE WEB, I  HAVE MORE COUNTRIES I WANT TO RUN THROUGH YOU W YOU REAL QUICK BEFORE YOU GO. MICHAEL LEWIS.
