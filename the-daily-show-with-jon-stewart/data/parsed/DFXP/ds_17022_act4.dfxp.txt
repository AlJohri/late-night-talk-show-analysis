(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, THAT'S OUR SHOW. JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00. OUR GUEST I BELIEVE WILL BE DIANE KEATON AND I GUESS ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS... GO TO BED, GABBY. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT, STAY UP AND WATCH COLBERT. I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT VERY ENTERTAINING. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
I MEAN, THEY ASKED ME A QUESTION ABOUT LIBYA AND I PAUSED SO I COULD GATHER MY THOUGHTS. IT WAS A PAUSE! TH   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  Captioned by    Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
