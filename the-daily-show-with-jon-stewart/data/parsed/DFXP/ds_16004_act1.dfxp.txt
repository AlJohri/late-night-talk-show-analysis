ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A FUNNY GUEST BECAUSE THAT MEANS, I CAN, DURING THE INTERVIEW, PHONE IT IN. [LAUGHTER] TODAY MARKED THE FIRST OFFICIAL DAY OF THE 112th CONGRESS. A LOT TO BE DONE.
WE'LL READ ALOUD THE FULL TEXT OF CONSTITUTION OF UNITED STATES.
Jon: OH, BUT FIRST AN ASSEMBLY N. A NOD TO THE FOUNDERS REPUBLICANS DECIDED TO  OPEN THE CONGRESSIONAL SESSION WITH THE READING OF THE CONSTITUTION SANS OF COURSE THE  NAUGHTY BITS AWOMEN CAN'T VOTE. I LOVE A GOOD READING OF AN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT. WHO ARE THEY GETTING HOLBROOK, MORGAN FREEMAN. SAM ELIOT, DUDE THAT GUY'S VOICE IS AWESOME.
ORDER TO ENSURE FAIRNESS FOR ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING WE ASKED MEMBERS  TO LINE UP ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. THE SPEAKER AND TWO MEMBERS OF THE LEADERSHIP OF EACH PARTY WILL BEGIN THE READING AND THEN  I'LL RECOGNIZE MEMBERS IN ORDER.
Jon: OH, SO IT'S GOING TO BE COMMUNITY THEATER? [LAUGHTER] LET'S SEE THE CONSTITUTION IS 7620 WORDS. THERE ARE 435 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. 432 OF WHICH CAN READ. [LAUGHTER] OKAY. THAT'S GOING TO BE 17.5 WORDS PER REP. [LAUGHTER] IT'S SHOWTIME.

I NOW YIELD TO THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM MARYLAND, MS. EDWARDS. [LAUGHTER]
EACH HOUSE SHALL BE ENTERED ON THE JOURNAL.
I KNEW YIELD SO THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM MICHIGAN, MS. MILLER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WELL, YOU'VE DONE IT, YOU MANAGED TO MAKE THE READING OF ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST TREASURE AND SACRED DOCUMENTS  AND COMBINED IT WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF DMV -- AT LEAST THERE WAS SOME STUNT CASTING. THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA, MR. LEWIS, WHO MANY REGARD AS THE FOREMOST ADVOCATE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE CONGRESS, HE WILL  READ THE 13th AMENDMENT.
Jon: OH NICE TOUCH. THE ONE THAT APOLL BISHS -- ABOLISHED SAVORY. TO READ THE AMENDMENT (bleep) SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN.
NO PERSON SEPTEMBER A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN OR THE CITIZEN OF  THE UNITED STATES AT THE TIME OF SOPGS OF THE CONSTITUTION SHALL BE HE WILL EDGEIBLE TO HOLD THE  OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.

REPRESENTATIVES SHALL TAKE EFFECT UNTIL AN ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES SHALL INTERVENE. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: WOOO! ENCORE. ENCORE. MUNROE DOCK TAIN, EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, HOUSE BILL 122 OM BUS. SOME DEEP CUTS MOTHER (bleep). [LAUGHTER] I HAVE NOT SMOKED IN A WHILE. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THE 112th CONGRESS COULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN  BOEHNER WAS SWORN IN. HERE HE IS WALKING INTO THE CEREMONY. COME ON, DUDE, FOR GOD SAKES. ARE YOU CRYING AGAIN? [LAUGHTER] WHAT SP WITH YOU, MAN? ELECTION NIGHT YOU WERE ALL WATERWORKS. YOUR 60 MINUTES INTERVIEW --
THAT THESE KIDS HAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM -- IT'S IMPORTANT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT IS IMPORTANT AND SO IS YOUR DIGNITY. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS BOEHNER JUST WITH FRIENDS AT A HOCKEY GAME RECENTLY. HERE HE IS LOSING HIS VIRGINITY.
THESE KIDS HAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM. [SOBBING]
Jon: BEEN THERE. WHAT A WEIRD THING TO SAY DURING SEX. I HOPE BOEHNER HAS A PLAN TO COMPENSATE FOR THE WEEPINESS. HE IS TAKING THE OVER SIZED GAVEL. IT'S ON THE NOSE BUT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOEHNER'S NEW  GAVEL AND THE ONE PELOSI USED. I GUESS THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS SMASHING WATERMELONS. [LAUGHTER] IS HE RUNNING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OR TRYING TO SAVE A PRINCESS FROM A MONKEY? [LAUGHTER] TO PLAY THAT OUT HE GETS ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. I WASN'T ALL POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE G.O.P. RUN ON RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND CUTTING THE DEFICIT. I GIVE THEM THEIR PLAN CUT GO.
UNDER CUT GO IF YOUR INTENTION IS TO CREATE A NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM YOU MUST  TERMINATE OR REREDUCE AN EXISTING PROGRAM OF EQUAL OR GREATER SIZE.
Jon: WITHOUT GOING OVER OR YOU LOSE A TURN AND BECOME HE WILL INNINGIBLE FOR A SHOWCASE  SHOW DOWN. THEY LIMIT SPENDING IN WHICH IF YOU WANT TO BRING A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM TO LIFE YOU CAN'T PAY  FOR IT WITH NEW TAXES. INSTEAD YOU MUST KILL, DISEM BOWL OR (bleep) A PROGRAM OF EQUAL VALUE. SEEMS TIGHT UNLESS THERE ARE HOLES THAT AIR CAN GET IN.
ANYTHING PASSED DOMESTICALLY HAS TO BE PAID FOR BUT THERE ARE  EXEMPTIONS INCLUDING TAX CUTS AND HEALTH CARE REPEAL.
Jon: TAX CUTS THE ONLY BUST BUDGETS NOT TO FALL UNDER THE RULES ARE THE ONES THAT CREATED  25% OF THE ACTUAL DEFICIT. THE BUSH TAX CUTS, THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX CUTS. THE ESTATE TAX CUTS. THE REUNARES OF THE SHOW TAXI. WHY DOES -- WHY DOES REPEALING OWE BALM WHY'S HEALTH CARE REFORM HAVE TO BE EXEMPTED FROM  THE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT CUT GO RULES. THAT WOULD INCREASE THE DEFICIT BY $143 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS. SO OTHER THAN THOSE EXCEPTIONS, AKK EVERYTHING THEY WANTED TO DO REPUBLICANS WILL BE PURE TO THE DEFICIT REDUCTION VOW. KIND OF LIKE A WAY A GROOM ON HIS WEDDING DAY MAY VOW TO BE FAITHFUL EXCEPT FOR CARVING OUT  A FEW EXCEPTIONS FOR PEOPLE HE WOULD STILL LIKE TO (bleep). FOR MORE ON THE NEW CONGRESS SAMANTHA BEE JOINS US FROM THE CAPITOL. SAM --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- SAM HOW DO THE REPUBLICANS THINK THEY ARE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH AN AGENDA THAT SEEMS  AT ODDS WITH ITSELF.
THE KEY, JON,IS THE LEADER JOHN BOEHNER. THAT MAN CAN GO FROM ZEER YES TO SNOT IN 6.4 SECONDS. THEY ARE THE CAPABLE HANDS OF CAPTAIN BALL CLUBBER PANTS.
Jon: HOW DOES THAT MEAN IF THEY EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM ALL THESE THINGS THEY INCREASE THE  DEFICIT, THE EXACT THING THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO.
JON, THIS VEALY IMPORTANT TO ME -- REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. I REALLY WANT THEM TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE WITHOUT RUINING THE DEFICIT.
Jon: THEY'LL FIND CUTS IN OTHER AREAS. MAYBE THE ESTIMATE IS WRONG.
YEAH, SEE IT'S THAT EASY. YOU ARE WINNING THE ARGUMENT, I START CRYING, BOOM YOU FOLD. WELCOME TO THE JOHN BOEHNER 11 23-7B8G CONGRESS. -- 112th CONGRESS.
Jon: WOW.
READ IT AND WEEP.
Jon: HOW DO DEMOCRATS COUNTER THIS CRYING STRATEGY?
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE EFFECTIVE COUNTER TO THE UNCONTROL WEEP THAT I HAVE FOUND  WHICH IS THE TEET OR AS I REFER TO THEM SLEEP CANNONS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M NOT SURE THAT NATURE'S HIGH NyQuil WILL HAVE  THE SAME EFFECT ON ADULTS IT HAS ON YOUR CHILDREN.
DON'T TELL THE DEMOCRATS THEY'VE INVESTED THOUSANDS IN THE PSEUDO NIP3,000. ONCE THE G.O.P. LATCHES ON THEY ARE ASLEEP AND DEMOCRATS CAN PASS ALL THE AMENDMENTS THEY  WANT AS LONG AS THE
