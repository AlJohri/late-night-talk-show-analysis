(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SECURITY ANALYST AS WELL AS A BEST SELLING AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE LONGEST WAR, THE ENDURING CONFLICT BETWEEN AMERICA AND AL QAEDA. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM PETER BERGEN.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THE LONGEST WAR. AMERICA'S ENDURING CONFLICT BETWEEN AMERICA AND AL QAEDA. IS THIS OUR LONGEST WAR?
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU COUNT THE VIETNAM WAR. WE'RE GOING TO BE IN AFGHANISTAN UNTIL 2014. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT IS THE LONGEST WAR THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN.
Jon: DO YOU THINK IT MAY GO FURTHER THAN 2014? DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT THAT 2014 IS A DRAWDOWN POINT?
I THINK WE'LL BE IN AFGHANISTAN FOR AS LONG AS WE ARE... WE'VE BEEN IN SOUTH KOREA.
Jon: WE'RE NEVER LEAVING? OOPS, DID I LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG FOR SOUTH KOREA? SORRY, SOUTH KOREA. NOW, REBUILDING SOUTH KOREA AND BEING THERE AS A STABILIZING FORCE IS VERY  DIFFERENT THAN DOING IT IN AFGHANISTAN. ANOTHER DOLLAR JUST FELL. MICHAEL STEELE MAKING IT RAIN AGAIN. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN, YOU KNOW,... SOUTH CAREER I CAN'T IS AT LEAST A STABLE COUNTRY. AFGHANISTAN, WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT TO THAT POINT.
TRUE BUT SOUTH KOREA HAS SUFFERED TREMENDOUS DAMAGE DURING THE KOREAN WAR, WORSE  SHAPE THAN AFGHANISTAN TODAY. I'VE BEEN VISITING AFGHANISTAN SINCE '93. THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FOR THE GOOD SINCE 9/11. MILLIONS OF GIRLS ARE IN SCHOOL. THERE IS A FUNCTIONING ECONOMY, KIND OF. A LOT OF OF COURSE IS A DRUG ECONOMY. BUT THERE IS, YOU KNOW, THERE IS PROGRESS.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THEIR VIEWPOINT... WHY DID RUSSIA... WHY WERE THEY NOT ABLE TO STAY THERE AND YET WE SOMEHOW HAVE MANAGED TO HOLD ON?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE SOVIETS FACED A COUNTRYWIDE INSURRECTION. EVERY CAST AND ETHNIC GROUP. THEY HAD ONE OF THE WORLD'S WORST ARMIES AND THEY WERE HATED. WE'RE NOT HATED. 62% OF AFGHANS TODAY HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF INTERNATIONAL FORCES. THEY WANT US TO PERFORM NOT TO LEAVE.
Jon: THEY WOULD... IF YOU'RE AL QAEDA, NOW, LET'S TAKE IT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. DID THESE WARS... WHAT WAS THE BEST RESULT THEY COULD HAVE HOPED FOR? IT'S AFTER 9/11. WHAT DID THEY THINK WAS GOING TO BE THE RESULT OF THAT?
WHAT THEY WANTED WAS THE UNITED STATES TO PULL OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND ALL THESE  AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WOULD THEN CRUMBLE AROUND THE REGION. NONE OF THAT HAPPENED. WE WENT INTO AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ. OUR RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT ARE STRONGER THAN EVER.
Jon: THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT NAIVE. THEY DIDN'T THINK WE'LL ATTACK THEM ON 9/11 AND THEY'LL GO AWAY.
THEY WERE THAT NAIVE. WE INTERVIEWED OSAMA BIN LADEN IN '97. WE TALKED ABOUT VIETNAM, AND THAT WAS HIS ANALYSIS. WE WERE AS WEAK AS THE SOVIET UNION.
Jon: ISN'T THEIR IDEA THAT WE INVOLVE OURSELVES IN ALL THESE CONFLICTS AND IT SLOWLY  BLEEDS US? OF MONEY, OF WILL.
THAT'S WHAT THEY HOPE. THEY'RE NOT ECONOMISTS EITHER. WE'RE SPENDING 1% OF G.D.P. IN AFGHANISTAN. WE SPENT 10% OF G.D.P. DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT WE'RE A VERY LARGE ECONOMY.
Jon: BUT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THOUGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOW AN ALL VOLUNTEER ARMY  WE'RE PUTTING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF STRESS ON OUR FIGHTING FORCE, ON THE MEN AND  WOMEN THAT HAVE NOW, YOU KNOW, CAN WE SUSTAIN THIS WITHOUT BREAKING THEIR SPIRIT?
BECAUSE WE'RE DRAWING DOWN VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IN IRAQ THERE IS SOME, YOU KNOW, FLEXIBILITY NOW IN THE SYSTEM. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. PEOPLE ARE BEING DEPLOYED. I WAS IN AFGHANISTAN IN DECEMBER. I MET SOMEBODY BEING DEPLOYED FOR THE 7th TIME IN AFGHANISTAN. THAT PUTS TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON THE FAMILY, THE PERSON, THE INSTITUTION.
Jon: HOW BIG IS AL QAEDA? DO THEY HAVE... YOU KNOW, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY WE SAW THEM AS DANGEROUS AS, LET'S  SAY, THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM OR NAZISM. IT SEEMS LIKE AN IDEOLOGY THAT CANNOT EVER REALLY TAKE A FOOTHOLD BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE DARK.
YOU KNOW, IT PROMISES A LOT AND DELIVERS ALMOST NOTHING, RIGHT? THERE'S NO AL QAEDA SOCIAL WELFARE OR SERVICES OR HOSPITALS OR SCHOOLS. I MEAN IT WOULD BE OXYMORONIC. THIS IS A GROUP THAT PRE-TENDS TO DEFEND TRUE MUSLIM. A LOT OF MUSLIMS HAVE TURNED AGAINST IT. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION I THINK AND I DEAL WITH THAT IN THE BOOK TO SOME DEGREE SAW  9/11 IN THE CONTEXT OF A THREAT LIKE NAZISM OR COMMUNISM WHICH WAS CRAZY  BECAUSE THE NAZIS INSTIGATED A GLOBAL CONFLICT THAT KILLED TENS OF IN ILL IONS OF PEOPLE. IF THE COLD WAR HAD ENDED WITH A BANG INSTEAD OF A WIMPER, WE WOULDN'T BE ON THIS PROGRAM  BECAUSE WE'D ALL BE DEAD.
Jon: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. BASIC CABLE, BABY. I HAVE NO IDEA. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE ALWAYS... YEAH, THEY HAVE THIS DARK IDEOLOGY, WHATEVER. AND THE DANGER THAT THEY'LL GET THEIR HANDS ON THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. IT WILL HAVE TO BE LIKE A ONE- SHOT DEAL FOR THEM. THEY'LL GET ONE SHOT AT IT. THEY'LL BE TURNED TO, I GUESS, GLASS. YOU KNOW, THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD PUT TOGETHER A SUSTAINED THREAT TO OUR SOCIETY SEEMS UNLIKELY.
IT'S SUSTAINED BUT IT'S NOT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. WE SAW ON CHRISTMAS DAY 2009 THEY ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN A FLIGHT OVER DETROIT WITH 300  AMERICANS ON BOARD.
Jon: THAT IS NOT TO MINIMIZE THAT TYPE OF CARNAGE WHICH IS TERRIBLE. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT BY INVADING COUNTRIES AND THEN HAVING TO STAY AND  THEN REBUILD THEM FOREVER SEEMS LIKE IT MAY BE A DIFFICULT STRATEGY TO SUSTAIN.
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE INVADING IN ANY OTHER MUSLIM  COUNTRIES IN THE SHORT TERM.
Jon: YEAH. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT? ISN'T THAT... IS THAT BECAUSE THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WILL NO LONGER PROVIDE SHELTER FOR  THESE AL QAEDA FORCES OR BECAUSE WE'RE JUST TAKING A DIFFERENT TACT?
I THINK WE'RE TAKING A DIFFERENT TACK. WE'RE INVOLVED HELPING THE YEMENI GOVERNMENT WITH DRONES AND SPECIAL FORCES AND SMALL  AMOUNTS OF MILITARY ADVICE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO INVADE YEMEN.
Jon: AS OF YET.
LET'S TAKE A BET ON IT. I VERY MUCH DOUBT IT. (LAUGHING).
Jon: I HOPE WE DON'T INVADE... I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF  INVADING A BUNCH OF COUNTRIES.
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS.
Jon: I'M A HOME BODY. I'D LIKE US TO STIFLE OUR OWN CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT. THE LONGEST WAR ON BOOK SHELVES NOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A GLIMMER OF OPTIMISM IN YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS. THERE'S A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
YEAH, AL QAEDA IS GOING TO FADE INTO IRRELEVANCE OVERTIME.
Jon: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS A BOOK TITLE. THAT IS A BOOK THAT I WOULD READ. PETER BERGEN. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THANK YOU SO MUCH.
