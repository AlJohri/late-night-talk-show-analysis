(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE CONTINUE DOMESTIC POLITICS. NOW WE ALL SARAH PALIN'S NADA PRESIDENT SHL BID, NOTHING TO SEE OTHER THAN THIS GUMBO RALLY. WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT THIS THING IS ROAD TRIP. PEOPLE WONDER WHAT IS IT ABOUT SARAH PALIN? WHY SO DIVISIVE. ON FRIDAY SHE WAS AT A BAKERY IN BOSTON AND OFFERED UP HER VERSION OF THE FAMOUS MIDNIGHT  RIDE OF PAUL REVERE A MAJOR LANDMARK OF WHICH SHE HAD JUST VISITED.
HE WHO WARNED US THE BRITISH, THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE TAKING AWAY OUR  ARMS BY RINGING THOSE BELLS AND MAKING SURE THAT HE'S RIDING HIS HORSE THROUGH TOWN  TO SEND THOSE WARNING SHOTS AND BELLS THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE SECURE AND WE WERE GOING TO BE FREE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE JUST SAID BUT SHE APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN A WELL KNOWN  HISTORICAL EVENT AND TURNED IT INTO A FOLKSY TALE. THERE WAS ENOUGH ADJACENT THINGS. WHO REALLY ACTUALLY CARES? THIS IS THE PART THAT DRIVES PEOPLE A LITTLE BONKERS.
YOU REALIZE YOU MESSED UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE, DON'T YOU?
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN'T MESS UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE.
Jon: RIGHT THERE. THAT'S THE THING. THAT'S THE PALIN... YOU DO A LITTLE OFF-THE-CUFF JUMBO AND THEN YOU GO ON TV TWO DAYS  LATER AND YOU'RE WEARING SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ROBBED A VATICAN OR  ABOUT TO MARRY JESUS IN LAS VEGAS. THEN YOU INSIST THAT YOU INSIST THAT YOU MEANT TO SAY YOU WERE RIGHT AND YOU WERE  THE VICTIM OF SOME AWARENESS.
IN A SHOUT-OUT GOTCHA TYPE OF QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF ME I ANSWERED CANDIDLY. I KNOW MY AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: IT WAS A GOTCHA QUESTION. WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?
I'M GOING TO REPEAT THE GOTCHA QUESTION. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR TODAY AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR VISIT?
Jon: HERE'S A TIP. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOTCHA QUESTION, IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A GOTCHA QUESTION JUST BECAUSE  IT GOT-YA. BY THE WAY I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. SO IT'S A GOTCHA QUESTION. MEANWHILE THE BUS TOUR ROLLS ON. JOHN OLIVER HAS THIS REPORT.
Reporter: LAST WEEK SARAH PALIN'S NON-SEEKING AMERICANA VACATION TOUR HIT THE MOST  HISTORIC SIGHTS ON THE EAST COAST. BUT THE MEDIA MISSED THE BIGGEST STORY OF ALL. THE BUS ITSELF. THIS 46-FEET FLAG DIPPED LIBERTY COACH TOOK OUR GREATEST TREASURES AND PUT THEM IN A SPACE NORMALLY  RESERVED FOR OUR FIGHTERS. THOSE WHO SAW IT WERE HUMBLED BY ITS POWER.
I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. THE BUS WAS JUST GORGEOUS. BEAUTIFUL.
HAS THE CONSTITUTION EVER LOOKED BETTER THAN SPLASHED ON THE SIDE OF A BUS?
IF IT HAS, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
BECAUSE THE BUS DRIVES INTO YOUR MEMORY AND PARKS AND THEN NEVER LEAVES.
RIGHT. I'LL SEE THAT BUS FOREVER.
SARAH PALIN'S BUS WAS A FEAST FOR THE SENSES. YOU JUST WANT TO GET ON HER AND RIDE HER FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS.
STAY ON HER FOREVER.
RIGHT.
YEP. ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NOW?
THE BUS.
THAT'S RIGHT. THE BUS. THE BUS.
YEAH.
SHE'S SPACIOUS ONCE YOU GET INSIDE HER.
JUST LOOKING AT HER, I'D SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
JUST TO BE SAFE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BUS.
THE BUS.
OF COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIDN'T APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.
IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING FOLLOWING HER. NO ADDRESSES, NO EYE TIN RE, NO INFORMATION.
SHE'S THROWING US TINY CRUMBS.
WE PROBABLY DESERVE A SCHEDULE AT THE VERY LEAST.
THEY COULDN'T EVEN CATCH A STORY IF IT FELL RIGHT INTO THEIR LAPS.
AT THE VERY LEAST YOU'VE INTERVIEWED THIS BUS'S BIGGEST SUPER FAN.
WHO IS THAT?
SO YOU HAVEN'T INTERVIEWED HIM EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM RIGHT NOW. INTERVIEW HIM ABOUT THE BUS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE BUS?
I (BEEP) LOVE THE BUS. QUESTION TWO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. WAS THAT IT? OKAY.
HOW MANY PSIs ARE IN THE TIRES OF THIS BUS.
THAT'S JUST EXACTLY THE KIND OF GOTCHA JOURNALISM THAT YOU MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAVE  BECOME FAMOUS FOR. BUT IF THIS BUS TOUR WAS ABOUT ANYTHING IT WAS ABOUT EDUCATING AMERICA. HAVE YOU EVER READ THE CONSTITUTION?
YES.
HAVE YOU EVERY READ THE CONSTITUTION ON THE SIDE OF A BUS?
NO.
EXACTLY. THE ANSWER IS NO. NO, YOU HAVEN'T. IT WAS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.
I READ "WE THE PEOPLE" BUT THE REST OF THE WORDS WERE  KIND OF BLURRY AND TOO SMALL TO READ.
THE BUS TRULY REPRESENTS EVERYTHING GREAT ABOUT AMERICA. IT'S BIG. IT'S BRASH. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SMCHLT... (BEEP) ON IT. NO MATTER HOW FAR IT ROAMS IT WILL ALWAYS BE CLOSE TO US.
WHERE IS THE BUS?
THE BUS IS A COUPLE MILES AWAY I BELIEVE.
SURE. IT WAS JUST A COUPLE MILES AWAY IN OUR HEARTS.
