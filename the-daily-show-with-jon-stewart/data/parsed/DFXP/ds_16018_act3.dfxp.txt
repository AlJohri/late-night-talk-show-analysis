WE TRIED SO DESPERATELY WHEN YOU FIRSTï¿½"BECAMExD RNC. THEN ALLr THOUGH THEï¿½i STEELfï¿½ CURTAIN CAME DOWN AND WE COULD NOT GET AHOLD OF YOU.
I'VE NOT BEEN KNOWN FOR STAYING ON THE TALKING POINTS. I KIND OF GET INTO THE FLOWï¿½i OF THINGS AND I'M A VERYfï¿½ STRAIGHTFORWARD SHOOTER. I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT I THINK. I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY IN THIS9! JOB THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WELCOM
Jon: WHO WOULD TELL YOU THAT? WHO WOULD COME TOw3 YOU AND SAY.
MYw+|ï¿½ COMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE. I'D GET A PHONE CALL FROM LEADERSHIP ON THE HILLï¿½ï¿½xD OR, YOU KNOW, STAFF.lp  THOSE ANONYMOUS NAMES AND PLACES AND FACES THATe1 YOU HEAR.
Jon: THEY WOULD SAY,ï¿½r MICHAEL, PLEASE, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GO OUTSIDE?
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: STAY WITH US.
STAY WITH US.
Jon: THIS RECENTxD ELECTION YOU OBVIOUSLY HAD AN ENORMOUS VICTORY IN THEok MIDTERMS. DO YOU FEEL LIKE A COACH THAT TOOK YOUR TEAM TO THE PLAY-OFFS AND YET WAS CANNED AFTERWARDS?
A LITTLE BIT. ABSOLUTELY.xD WE WORKED VERY HARD. REMEMBER WHERE WE WERExD IN THE BEGINNING OFxD 2009. TWO YEARS AGO AT THIS TIMEï¿½i WHEN I BECAME CHAIRMAN, WE WEREM6| PARTY THAT WAS OUT OF POWER. WE HAD BEEN BASICALLY WHIPSAWED AND TO USE THE PRESIDENT'S TERM SHELLACKED INï¿½i  '06 AND '08. WE COULDN'T FIND PEOPLE TO RUN ASU THEY WERE REPUBLICANS SO ITPj( WAS A REAL MESS. WE CAME IN.e1 WE PUT OUR HEADS DOWN TO FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY THAT BEGAN WITH REIGNITING OUR BASE  TALKING OUR BASE,MY| RECONNECTING WITH THEM.
Jon: WHY IS IT SO EASY.V:5" THEM. IGNITE YOUR BASE? THEY ARE SO FLAMMABLE, YOUR BASE.
A CREDITORt( INCITEABLE BUNCH. THAT'Sï¿½$ BUT THAT'S Aï¿½ï¿½ VERY GOOD POINT AND A VERY FAIR POINT. YOU SEE IT ON BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AMONG THEk DEMOCRA DURING THExD BUSH YEARS YOU SAW  A-9| VERY WELL ORGANIZED AND IP,| THOUGHT WELL COMMUNICATED STRATEGY BY THENB| FOLKS ON THE  LEFT ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ. NOW YOU HAVE INï¿½r THE AGE OF OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TIME, YOU'VE GOT THE ECONOMY.i] WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICANS FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUTt( ANDtY
Jon: SELLING THEMSELVES AS THE PARTY OF FISCAL RESPONC[%1%Qe9ï¿½  THE PARTY IS AND CERTAINLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE GOTTEN INTO BIG&lt; |  REPUBLICANISM WHICH A LOT OFYm| PEOPLE THE BASE, TURNED AWAY A L/ï¿½ INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHO SUPPORTED BACKr WEREN'T TRUE TOï¿½ï¿½ WHAT WE WERE  SAYING WHAT WEfï¿½ WOULD DO.
Jon:ï¿½r EVEN WITH REAGANï¿½i,ï¿½iq REAGAN RAN BIGw3 DEFICITS. HE RAISED TAXES.r
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF WHAT PRESIDENTï¿½r REAGAN DID AS  GOVERNOR AND AS PRESIDENT. I MEAN ADMITTEDLY SO.U
Jon: DOESN'T TH%ï¿½JUt THOUGH?
I THINK ,1DPS ALSOq STRONG SENSE OF, YOU KNOW, IDEAL. THE PARTYA5|... A LOT OF TH%|D ACTIVISTS IN THE PARTY DOHt| STRIVE TOWARDS THE IDEAL. IT'S TRUE FOR BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANSt(t( NOT JUST SEND IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE  POLITICAL SPEC STRUM.
Jon: WITHï¿½ixD DEMOCRATS THEY CANNOT ARTICULATE THE IDEAL.t( IF THERE WAS A DEMORBQ9rrrï¿½
IxD THINK THEYe1 DO.
Jon: WOULDq GOVERNMENT.
THEY WOULDN'T PUT IT INjF TERMS OF BIG GOVERNMENT. THAT'S AN EASYr SAY. WHATï¿½ï¿½ THExD PRESIDENT TALKSï¿½r ABOUT IN THE STATE OF THE UNION TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENT. WE SPENDING. IT'S HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO AND THEN COMMUNICATE THATt( BEYOND.
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT THEORY ANDï¿½r PRACTICE. THE RNC IS NOW 21 OR 23 MILLIONfT"u THE PARTY OF FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. IS THAT....
BUT TpA (LAUGHING)t(w3 (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I WANT TO HEAR HIM.ï¿½ï¿½
THAT'S A FAIR POINT.ï¿½[| THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING, MEETING, SHOWED I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY. I WAS VERY HESITANTok ABOUT COMMITTING OURSELVES TO ADDITIONAL LINES OF CREDIT. BUT IT IS PART OF....
Jon: YOU RAISED YOUR DEBT LIMIT.xD
EXACTLY. AND, LOOK, IT WILL GET PAID OFF.ï¿½r THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. CERTAINLY THE NEW CHAIRMANï¿½r WASTED NO TIME DOINGï¿½i HISD TENURE WORKING WITHxD ME ASKING  FORxDlp MONEY.
Jon: EXACTLY.ok I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE REPMa FORECLOSED ON. I'M SAYINGï¿½r A PARTY TO SAY WE PARTY OF FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY  BUT WE'RE RUNNING Afï¿½ HUGE DEBT.
THAT'S EVERYï¿½r PARTY, BOTH PARTIES HAVE DEBT RIGHT NOW. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLIIa SO YOU'RE SAYING THE DEMOCRATS ARE SHOWINGï¿½i THEIR TRU  BY SPENDING WILDLY ABANDON.
Jon: YES.
OKAY.t(
Jon: NOBODY WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEt( DEMOCRATS....
THE DIFFERENCE IS WE WON.
Jon: THAT'S FOR SURE.
THE VALUE ADDED TO THE DOLLAR SPENT IS-9| MUCH GREATER FOR US BECAUSE WEï¿½ï¿½ HAVE 63  MEMBERS IN THE CONGRESS, 21 STATE LEGISLATORSï¿½r CHANGED FROM DEMOCRAT TO REPUBLICAN. IT'S A DIFFERENTlp
Jon: YOU HAVE A STIMULUS PROGRAM THROUGH DEFICIT SPENDING.r THAT CREATED A POSITIVE RESULT. THAT IGNITED YOUR BASE.ï¿½ie1ï¿½r (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DO YOUe1 THINKï¿½i YOU WANT TO TRY THAT AT THE NATIONAL&lt; | LEVEL? MAYBE IT WILL WORK AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL.
Jon: IT'S INTERESTING. DO YOUï¿½r FEEL LIKE THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVERï¿½rï¿½r ON... IS IT  DISINGENUOUS TO SOME EXTENT TO BE CALLING FOR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AN ADMINISTRATIONt( THAT RAISED  DOUBLED IT, THAT HAD UNACCOUNTED FOR EXPENSESt(, THExD AFGHAN WAR.
THAT'S A FAIR POINT. I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PRICE THAT WE PAID IN THE PREVIOUS ELECTIONS WHERE WEï¿½i  DID GO ON THE SPENDING RUN, WHERE WE DID GROW THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, WHERE WE DIDq CREATE ADDITIONAL DEBT AND  BURDENED THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. WE PAIDS7| DEARLY FOR THAT AT THE BALLOT BOX INt( '06 AND '08. PARTN LAST YEAR WAS THE PARTY REORGANIZING ITSELF, RETHINKING ITS POSITIONS AND REALLY STANDING TRUE. NOW THE TEST-- AND WE KNOW THIS. THEY'RE ON PROBATION. WHAT THE HOUSE DOES WHEN ITA WHAT THE SENATE DOES WHEN IT COMES TO SPENDING BILLS, WHETHER ORt( NOT....
Jon: WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM NOT RAISE THE DEBT CEILING? WILL IT BE ALMOST AN IDEOLOGICAL TEST TO SAY NO RAISING OF THE2MQ DEBT CEILING?
I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT. I THINK WE'VE GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE AREr TOO MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW. I THINK THERE HAS GOT TO BE SERIOUS BRAKES PUT ON THE SPENDING. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE THE LIMIT PUT A LOT OF STRINGS ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING  TO DO WITH ADDITIONAL SPENDINGq GOING FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO INCREASE THATw3 AMOUNT. ANDXT WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY OR ANY RECOURSE WITH THE(Aï¿½ERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon: NOT NOW WITH THEï¿½ï¿½ DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE.
NOfï¿½lp BECAUSE AS YOU'VE ALREADY ADMITTED THEn@| SPENDING HAS GONE CRAZY.
Jon: NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE DON'Tï¿½ï¿½ WANT!U| YOU TO  APPEAR ON SHOWS WILL YOU COME BACK AGAIN.
Jon: BECAUSE WYATT'S ARM HURTS TERRIBLY WHEN HE DOES THAT. ï¿½8 I THINK I'M A BETTER STAND- IN.
Jon: MUCH BETTER. WE TRULY APPRECIATE YOU C
