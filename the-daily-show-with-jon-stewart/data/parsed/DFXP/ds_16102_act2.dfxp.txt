Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. YOU KNOW, WE COVER A LOT OF MEDICAL ISSUES ON THE PROGRAM. RECENTLY ONE OF THESE STORIES, WELL, IT HIT A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO HOME. OUR OWN JASON JONES HAD A HEALTH SCARE THAT TORE HIS LIFE APART. HE'S HERE NOW DISCUSS IT WITH US.
THANK YOU, JON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I DECIDED TO SHARE MY STORY SO PEOPLE OUT THERE KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING  LIKE I WENT THROUGH ALONE. TAKE A LOOK.   ♪♪ FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS I NOTICED MY HEALTH DETERIORATING. I FOUND MYSELF FATIGUED. I WAS GAINING WEIGHT EXPONENTIALLY. EVERY DAY WAS A STRUGGLE. SO I DECIDED TO TALK TO A TELEVISION DOCTOR. I TOLD HIM ABOUT MY INSOMNIA, THE VOMIT I WOULD MYSTERIOUSLY FIND ON MY CHEST AND THE VOICES THAT HOUNDED ME EVERY NIGHT AND WEEKEND. I WASN'T PREPARED FOR WHAT HE WAS GOING TO TELL ME.
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE CHILDREN. [LAUGHTER]
YOU'RE SAYING I HAVE CHILDREN? AND TRAGICALLY, THROUGH UNPROTECTED INTERCOURSE, I HAD TRANSMITTEDDED CHILDREN TO MY WIFE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T EVEN USE BAR SOAP AROUND HERE WITHOUT GETTING PREGNANT.
YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT IT HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE, BUT YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN TO YOU. IT'S JUST SO SAD. HEY, PUT THOSE DOWN!
THOSE ARE DADDY'S "STAR WARS" TOYS.
YOU'RE RUINING IT! IT'S SO SAD. I HAD TO FIGHT THIS DISEASE. IN MY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS OF RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED CHILDREN ARE A DEGENERATIVE CONDITION  WHICH AFFECT EVERY RACE ACROSS THE GLOBE. AND SIMILAR TO HER PEASE, YOU ARE STUCK WITH CHILDREN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BUT RIGHT WHEN ALL HOPE WAS LOST, TV DOCTOR, DR. LAMB, INFORMED ME OF AN EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE THAT COULD PREVENT FUTURE OUTBREAKS.
THE UROLOGIST WILL JUST MAKE A LITTLE PUNCTURE RIGHT INTO THE  SCROTUM, INTO THE SAC, AND WILL ISOLATE WHAT WE CALL THE VAS DEFERENS, AND MAKE A LITTLE  INCISION INTO THEM IS. THERE ANY OTHER WAY?
WELL, IT'S CALLED A CONDOM.
WELL, THAT'S A NO-BRAINER THERE. CULT -- CUT ME OPEN.
NO, NO, NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE PROCEDURE NOW.
MY MIND WAS MADE UP. I WAS GOING TO GET A FA SECTMY. IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO REGAIN MY LIFE. THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS FIND SOMEONE TO PERFORM THE SURGERY. AN I WENT WITH THE OBVIOUS CHOICE. THE DOCTOR HELD MY LIFE IN HIS HANDS. WOULD YOU SAY I HAVE A LARGER THAN AVERAGE VAS DEFERENS.
YOU HAVE A GREAT SIZE VAS DEFERENS.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
AS HE WENT TO WORK, I THOUGHT OF ALL THE GOOD TIMES THE THREE OF US HAD TOGETHER. ♪LY REMEMBER YOU ♪♪
AT WORK. ♪ WILL YOU REMEMBER ME ♪♪ AT PLAY. WE WENT THROUGH HARD TIME, AS WELL. GUYS, YOU OKAY? ALL RIGHT. BUT I WAS THERE FOR THEM, AND THEY WERE THERE FOR ME. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT, JASON, YOU DID GREAT. WE'RE DONE.
REALLY? I WASN'T EVEN DONE WITH MY MONTAGE YET. AND JUST LIKE THAT I HAD MY LIFE BACK YET. BUT I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HOW ACHY MY NUTS WOULD BE FOR NEXT THREE WEEKS. HOWEVER, I'M ADJUSTING AND GETTING USED TO IT. MY CHILDREN WILL NEVER BE CURED, BUT AT LEAST I KNOW IT WON'T GET WORSE. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, GET THE HELP YOU NEED. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
DADDY?
YES?
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER BROTHER OR SISTER?
NOBODY. CUT MY BALLS OFF. SUCKER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
