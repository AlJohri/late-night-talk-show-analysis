(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. JUST HOW BAD IS THE ONGOING BUDGET SHOWDOWN IN WISCONSIN? PART OF OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE WE SENT JOHN OLIVER TO FIND OUT.
I'VE BEEN HEARING ALL WEEKEND ABOUT WHAT THE SITUATION IN WISCONSIN WAS LIKE.
IT'S LIKE CAIRO HAS MOVED TO MADISON THESE DAYS.
AND NOW MADISON, WISCONSIN, ALMOST LOOKS LIKE CAIRO.
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE YOU ARE EGYPT.
BUT ONLY ONCE I TRAVELED TO MADISON DID I REALIZE HOW TRUE THAT ANALOGY WAS.
THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HERE AND EGYPT IN BOTH PLACES PEOPLE ARE STANDING UP  FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN, THEY'RE STANDING UP AND SAYING WE NEED TO BE HEARD.
I THINK BOTH PLACES AMERICA HAS BEEN FUNDING THE MAN IN POWER.
ABSOLUTELY. THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE.
WE'VE BEEN HEARING THE RAGE COMING OUT OF CAIRO FOR WEEKS.
WE NEED TO TELL PRESIDENT MUBARAK YOU HAVE UGLY FACE!
Jon:
AND THESE MIDDLE WESTERNERS WERE NO LESS PASSIONATE.
OH, GOSH, I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A RIOT. WE'RE ALL PEACEFUL
WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. WE'RE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER.
AS IN EGYPT, HERE THERE WAS ALSO A SINISTER FORCE THREATENING TO TAKE OVER THE MOVEMENT.
I'M WITH THE FREEDOM FIGHTERS ABSOLUTELY. SUPPORT UNIONS, SUPPORT WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS STATE AND THIS COUNTRY.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A MEMBER OF THE BROTHERHOOD?
30 YEARS.
YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S QUITE A FRIGHTENING GROUP FOR SOME PEOPLE.
IT'S ONLY FRIGHTENING WHEN YOU SEE THE NUMBERS.
PEOPLE GET A LITTLE FREAKED OUT BY THIS MANY MUSLIMS IN ONE PLACE.
MUSLIMS? WE'RE NOT... WE'RE NOT... THERE MAY BE MUSLIMS HERE, BUT I DON'T  THINK EVERYBODY HERE IS A MUSLIM
ONE THING WAS FOR CERTAIN, THINGS WERE GUARANTEED TO TURN UGLY. AT WHAT POINT IS THIS GOING TO GET OUT OF HAND.
I DON'T THINK IT WILL.
SOON?
NO.
RIGHT?
NO.
IT'S GOT TO BE SOON.
THE ATMOSPHERE HERE IS STARTING TO TURN AND THIS MOB IS GRADUALLY DETERIORATING. STOP SMILING. STOP SMILING. THE FLASH POINT WAS A GOVERNOR MERELY SUGGESTING HE WAS GOING TO COMPLETELY ABOLISH THE  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT TO HELP PAY FOR HIS ABSOLUTELY VITAL 67 MILLION DOLLARS IN  CORPORATE TAX CUTS. BUT IS IT NOT IMPORTANT IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE TO TAX THE TOP 2% OF PEOPLE EARNING $35 TO  $45,000 A YEAR?
WELL, COME ON, I MEAN, GEE, YOU KNOW...
BUT IF YOU TAX THE TOP 2% OF PEOPLE EARNING $35,000 TO $45,000 THAT WILL  TRICKLE UP TO THE PEOPLE EARNING OVER $200,000 AND THEN IT MIGHT TRICKLE BACK DOWN.
THAT'S BULL (BEEP).
THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. OBVIOUSLY THESE PROTESTORS HAD SERIOUS GRIEVANCES BUT NOTHING LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN  LIVING UNDER OPPRESSIVE DICTATORSHIPS, AND THEY KNEW THAT, RIGHT? IS WHAT HE'S DOING TYRANNICAL?
TYRANNICAL, NO.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
TYRANNICAL NO.
EXACTLY.
NO IS THE ANSWER.
TYRANNICAL, NO.
A DICTATORSHIP, YES.
OH, FOR...
HE'S ABSOLUTELY BEHAVING IN A DICTATORIAL WAY. HE'S NOT ACTING LIKE HE LIVES IN A DEMOCRACY.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS LET'S UNDO THE DEMOCRATIC  PROCESS AND DO IT AGAIN UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.
OKAY. MAYBE IN THEIR PASSION FOR PROTECTING TEACHERS SOME PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT NO ONE WAS GOING TO BRING OUT A SIGN WITH A SWASTIKA... OH BOY. WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT THESE PEOPLE?
WE WOULD BE SUNK. THE POPULATION WOULD BE ILLITERATE, BACKWARD.
WE'D LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE COULDN'T EVEN DRAW  SWASTIKAS THE RIGHT WAY AROUND.
YOU HAD TO DRAW IT MA WAY TO MAKE THE L COME OUT.
RIGHT. WOW. IS IT POSSIBLE TO LOSE SYMPATHY FOR SUCH AN OBJECTIVELY SYMPATHETIC CAUSE?
NO.
NO? EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TRYING SO HARD? AFTER ALL THE INSPIRATIONAL SITES I SAW HERE TODAY, ONE THING IN PARTICULAR WILL REALLY  STICK WITH ME. ONE OF THE THINGS I'D NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE HERE, 10,000 PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE IN  FEBRUARY IN WISCONSIN WHERE IT IS... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (BEEP) COLD. IT'S COLD AS (BEEP).
