Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT DAMBISA MOYO. SHE'S AN ECONOMIST PROMOTING HER NEW BOOK WINNER TALK ALL. IT'S ABOUT -- WINNER TAKE ALL. IT'S ABOUT HOW CHINA WILL BE THE OVERLORDS BE ABOUT ABOUT A NEF NENTLY SO. WE JUST GASSED UP FOR THE TRIP TO LONDON OR AS THEY CALL GAS IN LONDON FLOGGY QUEAFFERS. TRUE. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITED THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN MUST BE TO ESCAPE FROM OUR GREATEST ALLEY  AND -- ALLY AND HEAD TO POLELAND TO RESET ROMNEY'S -- POLAND TO RESET ROMNEY'S --
THE TRYING PRESS SECRETARY FOR ROMNEY LOST HIS COOL AND CURSED AT REPORTERS NEAR THE  TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER IN WARSAW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO HOW DID THE PRESS SECRETARY END UP CURSING AT REPORTERS NEAR THE TOMB? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT SET HIM OFF?
GOVERNOR ROMNEY, DO YOU HAVE A STATEMENT FOR THE PALESTINIANS?
WHAT ABOUT YOUR GAS? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT ABOUT YOUR GAS? SIR, THEY ARE CALLED FLOGGY-QUEAFERS? DO YOU HAVE ANY NEW GAS IN THE WORKS? WHY CAN KRISTEN STEWART CHEAT ON R-PAT? ANSWER THE -- WOW. SO APPARENTLY THEY WERE -- THE FRUSTRATING REPORTS WERE TESTING THE LINE BETWEEN QUESTIONS AND HECKLES.
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANOTHER CHANCE TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS.
THIS -- (bleep) THIS IS SAY HOLY SITE FOR THE POLISH PEOPLE. SHOW SOME RESPECT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HAVE A LITTLE DECORUM YOU (bleep) PIECE OF (bleep). THIS IS SACRED MOTHER (bleep) GROUND. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS GO EAT A (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] THIS GUY IS CURSING LIKE A FILIPINO DIPLOMAT I MEAN --  [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SORRY. I STAND CORRECTED A DIPLOMAT TO THE PHILIPPINES, NOT A PHIL PINOT DIPLOMAT. MY GAFFE. [ LAUGHTER ] TROUBLE IN ENGLAND FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS. TROUBLE IN POLAND FOR IGNORING QUESTIONS. I BELIEVE THERE WAS A THIRD COUNTRY ROMNEY VISITED IN BETWEEN THE TWO. HOPEFULLY THAT IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T SO OVERLY SENSITIVE OR PRONE TO  COMPLAINING OR HECKLING. WHY WAS IT?
MITT ROMNEY VISITED ISRAEL THIS WEEKEND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT COULD BE WORSE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW HE SCREWS THE POOCH ON THIS ONE. CAN HE OPEN A SPEECH WITH "GREETINGS FUTURE MORMONS? [ LAUGHTER ] OR KEPT ASKING EVERYONE IN ISRAEL WHERE THE BEST OF THE BASEBALL CAP WAS.
ISRAEL'S ACHIEVEMENTS ARE A WONDER OF THE MODERN WORLD. THESE ARE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE A TRIBUTE TO THE RESILIENCE OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE.
Jon: HUH. NO INSULTS TO ANYBODY THERE. NO INDELL BEGAN THE BEHAVIOR NEAR SACRED GROUND. ROMNEY SPUING IT OFF.
YOUR INNOVATORS AND ENTER ENTREPRENEURS HAVE MADE THE DESERT BLOOM AND MADE FOR A  BETTER WORLD.
Jon: OKAY NOW YOU ARE JUST KISSING ASS. AND NOW DELICIOUS IS THE BOULI. -- TEBOULI. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE A SALAD WITH BULLAR WHEAT.
I'M IMPRESSED WITH THE THRIVING ECONOMY.
Jon: THE LANGUAGE SO BEAUTIFUL IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ANGEL WITH THROAT CANCER. DID HE. HE SCREWED UP IN ENGLAND AND POLAND BUT HE MANAGED TO GO THERE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING  OFFENSIVE OR HORRIBLE.
SPEAKING AT A FUND RAISER HE COMMENTED ON THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE  SURROUNDING PALESTINIAN AREA SAYING QUOTE DO YOU NOTICE SUCH A DRAMATICALLY STARK DIFFERENCE  IN ECONOMIC VITALITY, CULTURE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENT.
Jon: MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] SO CLOSE! SO ROMNEY APPEARS TO BE SAYING THAT THE PALESTINIANS ARE PURELY THE ARCHITECT OF THEIR OWN  POVERTY, OR IF YOU PREFER TO LOOK AT THE CONVERSE THAT JEWS ARE JUST CULTURALLY MONEY-MAKING  MOTHER (bleep). EITHER WAY MWAH! MR. ROMNEY DOUBLED DOWN.
THIS MORNING HE SAID ISRAEL WAS MORE PROFITABLE BECAUSE IT HAD THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE.
Jon: HE APPEARS TO BE SAYING THAT WHILE PALESTINIAN ECONOMY HAS ROOTS IN THE CULTURE  GOD IS ALSO HOLDING THEM DOWN OR ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC PROGRESS IS  THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE AND I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT ALL THE HORRIBLE (bleep) THAT HAPPENED  TO THE JEWS PRIOR TO THAT WAS THE HAN OF PROVIDENCES MIDDLE FINGER. [ LAUGHTER ] IN CASE YOU BELIEVE ROMNEY SIJELLING OUT ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS, HE IS NOT.
YOU NOTICE A STARK DINS IN ECONOMIC VITALITY, HE SAID AND THAT IS ALSO BETWEEN OTHER  COUNTRIES NEAR OR NEXT EACH OTHER, CHILE AND ECUADOR, MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES. CULTURE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
Jon: YOU KNOW LIKE MISSISSIPPI AND NEW YORK ROMNEY 012. WE TURN TO AL MAGICAL. HE'S IN THE WEST BANK. AL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S COMMENTS ABOUT THESE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES?
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, JON. I MEAN IT'S GOT TO BET CULTURE. LOOK AT THE WAY THESE PALESTINIANS LIVE. I MEAN, THE HOUSE BEHIND ME LOOKS LIKE IT WAS HIT BY A BULLDOZER, RUBBLE EVERYWHERE. STRAIGHTEN UP PEOPLE, ALL RIGHT?
Jon: I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE CRAZY ABOUT THE RUBBLE SITUATION EITHER.
RIGHT BUT A SUPERIOR CULTURE LIKE AMERICA OR ISRAEL WOULD SEE  THIS RUBBLE AND MAKE RUBBLE-ADE. [ LAUGHTER ] SOME TYPE OF RUBBLE-RELATED BUSINESSES, SURPLUS RUBBLE OUTLET STORE. PRODUCE RUBBLE-RELATED TV SHOWS. THIS OLD RUBBLE, FLIP THIS RUBBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] RUBBLE-HUNTER INTERNATIONAL. THESE GUYS ARE LEAVING SCHEKLES. I'D DO IT MYSELF BUT I'M MEXICAN. AS GOVERNOR ROMNEY SAID I JUST DON'T HAVE THE CULTURE TO PULL IT OFF.
Jon: HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE WHILE YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE, HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY OTHER FACTORS OTHER THAN CULTURE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO  LESS THAN HEALTHY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE. STARTS WITH AN O?
OH, YEAH THE ROADS. IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE FOR. ROADS ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU GET TO PLACES BUT PALESTINIANS THROW WALLS UP. IT'S LIKE LIVING IN A MAZE. NO WONDER TRAFFIC IS BACKED UP FOR MONTHS.
Jon: THOSE ARE CHECKPOINTS.
WHATEVER THEY ARE CALLED THE ADVANCED CULTURES HAVE SOMETHING CALLED EZ-PASS, ALL RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S --  [  APPLAUSE  ]
I DON'T REMEMBER STOPPING EVERY 20 FEET ON THE JERSEY  TURNPIKE AND HAVING A GUY WITH A GUN PROBING ME DOO-DADS, ALL RIGHT? THEY NEED BETTER CULTURE FRONTO.
Jon: THEY ARE NOT A CULTURAL PREFERENCE OF THE PALESTINIANS. THE (bleep) THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ON A DAILY BASE.
JON, KISS MY ASS. THIS SAY HOLY SITE, ALL RIGHT? SHOW SOME RESPECT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHOW SOME RESPECT AND SHUT THE (bleep) UP.
Jon: YOU SHUT THE (bleep) UP.
YOU ARE NOT A HOLY SITE.
Jon: EVERYTHING IS SAY HOLY SITE OVER THERE. SHUT (bleep) (bleep).
JON, ALL I'M SAYING IS THIS -- CULTURE IS THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE  PALESTINIANS ARE LESS PROSPEROUS. HOW LONG HAVE YOU PALESTINIANS LIVED AROUND HERE?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW THOUSANDS OF YEARS.
RIGHT, AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN COUNTRY. ALL RIGHT, ISRAEL HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 60 YEARS AND COUNTING FLORIDA THEY HAVE TWO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THANK YOU AL. AL MAGICAL,
