JANUARY 5th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, CRAIG SHIRLEY. AUTHOR CRAIG SHIRLEY, AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK DECEMBER 1941, BEST-SELLER, NOVEMBER 1941. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THIS UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. IN RECENT WEEKS, MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN EXPANSIONS OF EXECUTIVE POWER THAT MANY  HAVE FOUND TROUBLING. BUT PERHAPS LACKED THE HYPERBOLIC VOCABULARY TO PROPERLY CONDEMN, YOUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.
REPUBLICANS CALL IT AN UNPRECEDENTED POWER GRAB.
IT WHAT INTEMPORATE, ARROGANCE AND IRRESPONSIBLE.
ARROGANCE OF POWER, ABUSE OF POWER.
WHO CARES WHAT THE LAW SAYS WHO CARES WHAT THE RULES ARE, I'M THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: FINALLY, ELECTED OFFICIALS IN OUR PUNDITOCTOBER CRASSEE STANDING UP AGAINST I'M  ASSUMING THE RECENT KODD FIING OF INDEFINITE DETENSION OF AMERICANS OR PERHAPS THE UNRESTRICTED AND  SECRET USE OF DRONES THAT RAIN DEATH FROM THE SKY OR MAYBE THE PRESIDENT'S MOST  RECENT OUTRAGE, THE INSTITUTION OF MANDATORY SHARIA SCHOOL LUNCH WHERE EVEN THE MOST AMERICAN OF  SANDWICHES, PB & J MUST WEAR THE HIJAB SO WHICH ONE OF THESE ALL TRUE THINGS ARE  THEY OBJECTING TO?
THE PRESIDENT IS NAMING RICHARD CORDRAYS AHEAD OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL  PROTECTION BUREAU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HUH? SO CONGRESS CREATED A BUREAU TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN 20150. NOW THE PRESIDENT IS NOT TWO YEARS LATER, HIRING SOMEONE TO RUN IT. WHAT KIND OF MONSTER DOTH COME HE IS. HOW IS FILLING A POSITION THAT CONGRESS CREATED AN ARROGANT, LAWLESS AND BANANA  REPUBLIC ABUSE OF POWER. THAT'S USE OF POWER. WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT DO THAT WAS SO WRONG?
THE PRESIDENT ACTED UNDER HIS AUTHORITY TO MAKE RECESS APPOINTMENTS WHEN CONGRESS  IS NOT IN SESSION.
MY GOD. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S HOW HITLER TOOK POLAND. LOOK, GEORGE W BUS, DID PLENTY OF RECESS APPOINT OTMENTS. HOW BOLLTON BECAME U.N. AM WAS DO CHUCK NORRIS BECAME 6thsDmï¿½ WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT OBAMA JUST DID.
THE REPUBLICANS SAY THE SENATE IS ACTUALLY IN SESSION, AND THE PRESIDENT  HAD NO RIGHT TO MAKE THE SO-CALLED RECESS APPOINTMENT.
Jon: WAIT, THE SENATE IS IN SESSION? I WATCHED C-SPAN FOR LIVING AND I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN SESSION. WHAT'S THAT? I MISSED IT. WHAT DOW MEAN I MISSED IT, A CONGRESSIONAL SESSION, IT'S NOT LIKE A SHOOTING STAR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM AND MISS-- TURN ON C-SPAN. SHOW ME THEIR SESSION AND WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT I'M GOING TO JUST TRY AND OPEN  THIS CHILDPROOF BOTTLE OF ASPIRIN. LET ME SEE IF I CAN --
THE SENATE WILL COME TO ORDER. PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION, THE HOUR OF 12:00 NOON JANUARY 3rd-- SENATE NOW STANDS ADJOURNED UNTIL 11  A.M. ON FRIDAY JANUARY 6TH, 2012.
Jon: PUSH DOWN AND-- HOLY  [BLEEP] DID I MISS IT AGAIN! THAT WAS THE WHOLE CONGRESSIONAL SESSION? THAT COUNTS FOR TO THE BEING IN RECESS? SO THE PRESIDENT BID THE ARCANE RECESS APPOINTMENT AND THE SENATE RAISES HIM A  TECHNICAL BYLAW ADHERENCE, THE PRO FORMA SENATE SESSION. WELL PLAYED GAME OF [BLEEP] POKER. FOR MORE ON THIS APPOINTMENT, WE GO NOW LIVE TO SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST JOHN OLIVER STAND ON THE HALLOWED  FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. JOHN OLIVER, NICE TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, WHAT IS THIS?
JON T COULDN'T BE SIMPLER. IN 2010 IN THE THROES OF ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC RECESSIONS IN U.S. HISTORY  CONGRESS CAME TOGETHER AND PASSED A LAW CREATING A BADLY NEEDED CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAU. A WATCHDOG AGAINST THE KINDS OF PREDATORY FINANCIAL PRACTICES THAT HAVE SO DESTROYED THE ECONOMIC  FOUNDATION OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY. AND SINCE THEN, CONGRESS HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO PREVENT THIS UNACCOUNTABLE, UNELECTED AND DOWN RIGHT DANGEROUS BUREAU FROM EVER FULLY COMING TO EXISTENCE. THAT'S THE ANSWER, JON, YOU ARE WELCOME. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CAN I GET OUT OF HERE.
Jon: YES, NO, YES, I HAVE QUESTION. IF CONGRESS NOW FEARS THE BUREAU THAT THEY THEMSELVES CREATED, WHY NOT THEN JUST  PASS A LAW UNCREATING IT?
WELL, WHAT? GO ON RECORD AS OPPOSING A VITAL AND NECESSARY AGENCY THAT WILL PROTECT THE MOST  VULNERABLE, HARDWORKING FAMILIES IN THIS I:. OH, YEAH THAT WILL PLAY GREAT IN AN ELECTION YEAR. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: BUT YOU JUST SAID THEY'RE KILLING IT BUREAUCRATLY.
EXACTLY BUT WHY SHOOT SOMETHING IN PUBLIC WHEN YOU CAN JUST QUIETLY SQUEEZE ITS  FEEDING TUBE IN THE PRIV SEE OF A HOSPITAL SHIFT CHANGE.
Jon: SO THE CONGRESS WON'T GET RID OF THE AGENCY LEGISLATIVELY.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Jon: THEY'LL JUST STAY IN A SORT OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION PERPETUAL FAKE  SESSION TO PREVENT THE PRESIDENT FROM A RECESS APPOINTMENT. BUT IF THEY ARE IN SESSION.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHY CAN'T THE DEMOCRATS JUST BRING THE GUY'S NAME UP FOR AN UP OR  DOWN CONFIRMATION VOTE. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.
WHOA, JON, ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS? (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU REALLY STOOPING SO LOW TO ASK ME A BRITISHER, TO EXPLAIN YOUR OWN COUNTRY'S SYSTEM TO YOU? (LAUGHTER) IS THAT HAPPENING? I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.
Jon: JOHN, NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS. WE ALREADY HAVE GREEN CARDS.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. POINT TAKEN. POINT TAKEN. THE DEMOCRAT, LET ME EXPLAIN V A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A SUPERMAJORITY SO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE VOWED TO FILIBUSTER ANYBODY THE  PRESIDENT DARE APPOINT.
Jon: THOSE BASTARD REPUBLICANS.
QUITE, QUITE. EXACTLY, JON. HOW DARE THEY USE THE EXACT SAME PRO FORMA SESSION TECHNIQUE THAT HARRY REID  USED IN 2007 TO KEEP GEORGE W. BUSH FROM APPOINTING STEPHEN BRADBURY TO HEAD THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL. HOW DARE THEY. HOW DARE THEY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WAIT, YOU-- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION.
WHAT?
Jon: YOU HAD TO KNOW ALL THAT FOR A GREEN CARD.
NO, NOT FOR A GREEN CARD, JON, I'VE GOT THE PLATINUM CARD.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW.
I WANTED TO CARRY A CONCEALED WEAPON AND COMPLAIN ABOUT MEXICANS.
Jon: I SEE, ALL RIGHT. BUT I HAVE T IF THE DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE SENATE --
I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.
Jon: WHY CAN'T THE DEMOCRATS MOVE TO ADJOURN TO ALLOW THE RECESS APPOINTMENT? SEE THE REPUBLICANS CAN'T FILIBUSTER AN ADJOURNMENT.
WELL DONE, LITTLE GIRL. WELL DONE. WELL DONE. YOU CAN FINALLY TAKE OFF THAT TRAINING BRA BECAUSE YOU HAVE REALLY SOLVE THIS  PROBLEM, HAVEN'T YOU. QUICK, CALL THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK YOU'VE CRACKED IT.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY KIND.
YOU HAVE EARNED IT. EXCEPT, JOHN JON, FOR ONE THING. ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 1, SECTION 5 OF THE CONSTITUTION, IF THE HOUSE CONTROLLED BY THE REPUBLICANS REFUSES TO PASS  A MATCHING RESOLUTION TO ADJOURN THEY CAN FORCE THE SENATE TO STAY OPEN IN THE  SAME PRO FORMA SESSION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I THINK I JUST THREW UP A LITTLE BIT IN MY MOUTH, I'M SORRY.
AND YET THIS IS WHAT YOU REJECTED CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY FOR SO WHY DON'T  YOU SUCK IT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, OLIVER, THIS CONGRESS MAKES ME SO ANGRY, THIS CONGRESS, THIS DO NOTHING BUNCH OF MOTHER  [BLEEP].
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. JON, YOU TAKE THAT BACK! THEY DO NOT DO NOTHING. THEY ARE MOTHER [BLEEP] BUT DO YOU KNOW, JON, DO YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT  TAKES TO PERFORM THIS LEVEL OF MOTHER WLOOEP BLOOEP --  [BLEEP]ERY. SURE ARE, YOU AREN'T SEEING IN ON C-SPAN BUT LOOK BEHIND THE FLAPS TO THE ACTUAL  OFFICE OF OUR CAPITOL BUILDING. THESE GOOD PEOPLE, JON.
Jon: OH MY GOD.
WHO DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS WORK TIRELESSLY, JON, NIGHT AND DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING GETS DONE. THIS, JON, THEY-- DO NOT LOOK AWAY, STEWART, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS LOOK AT IT! LOOK, DIRECTLY AT IT! THIS, JON, THIS, THIS RIGHT HERE, THIS IS HOW THE SAUSAGE DOESN'T GET MADE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, LOOK T TAKES ALOT OF EFFORT.
YEAH T DOES TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT, JON. YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON THIS FOR 1 SECOND AND WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAPPEN. A PROGRAM THAT WORKS TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE EMERGES. OR A BRIDGE GETS BUILT TO SOMEWHERE. AND YOU SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T WORK, SHAME ON YOU, STEWART. SHAME ON THEM AND SHAME ON YOU.
Jon: BUT WHAT IF WE USED THAT SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT TO HELP FIX OR AMELIORATE THE  PROBLEMS OUR COUNTRY FACES.
YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD DO THAT TOO BUT THIS IS THE DIRECT NO SHOW FROM THE GO-IN. SO EITHER WAY, EITHER WAY.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOHN, JOHN
