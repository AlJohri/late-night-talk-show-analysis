(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUED OUR NATION A CHALLENGE.
HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN THE SOVIETS BEAT US INTO SPACE WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE  SATELLITE CALLED SPUTNIK,....
Jon: NO. KATHY PROCTOR, YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST SATELLITE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE BY THE SOVIETS IN 1957. YOU'RE JUST NOT.
WE UNLEASHED A WAVE OF INNOVATION THAT CREATED NEW INDUSTRIES AND MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS. THIS IS OUR GENERATION'S SPUTNIK MOMENT.
Jon: TO THE MOON! I GUESS YOU'RE SAYING IF THE NATION'S CURRENT PREDICAMENT COULD ACT AS A WAKE-UP CALL. OF COURSE THAT'S NOT HOW FOX NEWS ALASKAN BUREAU CHIEF HEARD THAT.
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE W.T.F.MOMENTS WHEN HE SO OFTEN REPEATED THE SPUTNIK  MOMENT THAT HE WOULD ASPIRE AMERICANS TO CELEBRATE. HE NEEDS TO REMEMBER THAT WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN WITH THE FORMER COMMUNIST U.S.S.R.AND  THEIR VICTORY IN THAT RACE TO SPACE, YEAH, THEY WON BUT THEY ALSO INCURRED SO MUCH DEBT AT  THE TIME THAT IT RESULTED IN A INEVITABLE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION.
Jon: I GUESS THAT'S ONE OF THOSE W.T.F.MOMENTS, WHERE TO START. LET'S START. FUTURE SPEECHWRITING NOTE, THE F STANDS FOR (BEEP). SECOND, WHEN OBAMA SAID SPUTNIK MOMENT, HE WASN'T RALLYING US TO REPEAT RUSSIA'S  SPACE RACE RECORD OF SHORT STERM WIN AND LONG TERM LOSS. ALSO IT WASN'T THE SPACE RACE THAT BANKRUPTED THE SOVIETS. IT WAS THE ARMS RACE. WE SHOULD BE GLAD YOU DIDN'T BLAME IT ON THE AMAZING RACE. I'M ARGUING FACTS WITH YOU. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS, WHO WOULD PURPOSEFULLY TWIST AROUND HISTORIC FACTS AND PUT OUT SUCH A WILLFUL  MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS? YOU'D ALMOST ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE A SOVIET AGENT. OH, MY GOD. SARAH PALIN MAY BE A RUSSIAN SPY. WHAT? NO, THAT'S CRAZY. THAT'S CRAZY. I KNOW BUT WHAT IF IT'S TRUE. COME ON. IF SARAH PALWERE A SOVIET AGENT SHE WOULD HAVE SLIPPED UP BY NOW AND MADE A REFERENCE  TO FAVORING A TOTALITARIAN STATE.
YOU HAVE TO STAND WITH YOUR NORTH KOREAN ALLIES. WE'RE BOUND BY TREATY.
SOUTH KOREAN. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WE'VE BEEN WORRYING ABOUT ISLAM-O-SOCIALISM THIS WHOLE TIME. WE FORGOT ABOUT A GOOD OLD RUSSIAN COMMUNIST SLEEPER AGENT. OF COURSE THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE OTHER TELLS. HER ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO BE UNNATURALLY CAGEY.
WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE FOUNDER?
YOU KNOW, WELL ALL OF THEM.
Jon: SO HARD TO PICK ONE. WHEN YOU DIDN'T LEARN ANY OF THEM GROWING UP IN MOSCOW.
WHAT OTHER SUPREME COURT DECISIONS DO YOU DISAGREE WITH? WELL, LET'S SEE. OF COURSE IN THE GREAT HISTORY OF AMERICA THERE HAVE BEEN RULINGS THAT THERE'S NEVER  GOING TO BE ABSOLUTE CONSENSUS.
Jon: GOOD ANSWER. OH, MY GOD. IT ALL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE NOW.
YOU KNOW, ALL OF THEM. ANY OF THEM.
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT THE VP DOES EVERYDAY?
Jon: SLOW MOTION. SO YOU SEE, SHE'S A RUSSIAN AGENT. MOST COMFORTABLE IN LONG NORTHERN WINTERS. HER FAVORITE COLOR IS RED. WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THE MASCOT OF RUSSIA? A BEAR.
MAMA GRIZZLY IS ALL ABOUT PROTECTING THE YOUNG.
Jon: YOU ARE TOTALLY A SUPER HOT RUSSIAN SPY LIKE ANNA CHAPMAN OR NATASHA FROM BULLWINKLE. OF COURSE, SARAH PAL IN WERE REALLY NATASHA FROM BULLWINKLE SHE'D HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM  WITH MOOSE.
THIS IS DELICIOUS, THE MOOSE.
IT'S SWEETER.
Jon: HEY, SQUIRREL.
