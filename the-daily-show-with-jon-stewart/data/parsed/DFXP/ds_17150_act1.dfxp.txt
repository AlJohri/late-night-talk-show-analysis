FOUR YEARS AGO, HE MADE US HOPE AGAIN.
YES, WE CAN!
NOW HE WANTS TO MAKE US HOPE AGAIN. AGAIN. FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, HOPE AND CHANGE 2.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. IT IS OUR FINAL NIGHT. IT IS A FRIDAY NIGHT IN CHARLOTTE, THE END OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTION SEASON. THE DEMOCRATS SPENT THE FIRST TWO NIGHTS OF THEIR CONVENTION HIGHLIGHTING THEIR VERY DISTINCT  VISION OF AMERICA, WHERE CITIZENS OF ALL RACES AND CREED WORK TOGETHER TO DEFRAUD REAL  AMERICANS WILL OF THEIR HARD-EARNED--   ( LAUGHTER )   SORRY ABOUT THAT. UH, HELP EACH OTHER SUCCEED TOGETHER. BUT AFTER LAYING OUT THEIR VISION A RENEWED AMERICAN SPIRIT, THERE WAS ONE OTHER  THING THAT THEY WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE OF.
HE PROMISED TO BRING OSAMA BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE. DONE.
Jon:  BIN LADEN, DEAD. NIEDERMAYER. DEAD. YES, THE DEMOCRATS ACCENTUATED THE NON-LIVINGNESS OF BIN LADEN IN FILM. IN WORDS, AND I GUESS ONCE THEY GOT BORED OF THAT, IN SLOGAN.
BIN LADEN SURE ISN'T IT HEAVIN.
ASK OSAMA BIN LADEN IF HE IS BETTER OFF NOW THAN HE WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.
OSAMA BIN LADEN IS DEAD, AND GENERAL MOTORS IS ALIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  I ASK YOU TONIGHT, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WHAT IS BLACK AND WHITE AND KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN?   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )   PRESIDENT OBAMA. REQUEST   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   BUT BEFORE THE MAN-- BEFORE THE MAN WHO, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, HAD A ROLE IN THE DEMISE OF TERRORIST MASTERMIND OSAMA BIN LADEN--
DONE!   ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  GOT IT. BEFORE THE PRESIDENT WOULD SPEAK, WE WERE TREATED TO MORE DEMOCRATIC ALL-STARS, THE  DAUGHTER OF THE PRESIDENT. A DIDN'T BECOME PRESIDENT. AND THE WINNER OF THE PRESTIGIOUS 2012 GESTICULATORS INVITATIONAL, FORMER MICHIGAN  GOVERNOR, JENNIFER GRANHOLM.
WE NEED TO REF UP OUR ENGINES IN YOUR CAR AND ON YOUR BALLOTS. THE "D." IS FOR DRIVE FORWARD. THE "R." IS FOR REVERSE. IN THIS ELECTION, WE ARE DRIVING FORWARD, NOT BACK. LET'S RE-ELECT OUR GREAT PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA!
Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP )! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. IN MY ESTIMATION, THAT WOMAN SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING AT ALL!   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )   SHE APPEARS TO BE A DRUNK FLIGHT ATTENDANT.   (  LAUGHTER  )     ( APPLAUSE )  YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMEONE I MET  LAST WEEK IN TAMPA I WOULD LOVE TO SET THE GOVERNOR UP WITH FOR A LOST WEEKEND OF POLITICAL  INFIGHTING AND HATE ( BLEEP ).
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NEVER RUN A COMPANY. HE HASN'T EVEN RUN A GARAGE SALE OR SEEN THE INSIDE OF A LEMONADE STAND.
Jon:  THAT WOULD BE A HELL OF A CONVERSATION. "WHY WON'T YOU EXTEND THE BUB TAX CUTS?" "WHY DO YOU WANT A VOUCHER  SYSTEM ISSYSTEM?" ( BLEEP ) FRIDAY NIGHT. AND THEN,, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN GAVE A POWERFUL SPEECH, EMPHASIZING HIS BLUE COLLAR ROOTS, HIS STRONG FAMILY TIES AND OF COURSE HIS PHYSICAL  PROXIMITY TO THE PRESIDENT.
DAY AFTER DAY, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT TI SAT BESIDE HIM AS HE MADE ONE GUTSY DECISION AFTER  THE OTHER. I WALKED 30 PACES DOWN THE HALL INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, AND I SEE HIM. I WATCH HIM IN ACTION. I GOT TO SEE FIRSTHAND WHAT DROVE THIS MAN. FOLKS, I'VE WATCHED HIM. I WATCH IT UP CLOSE.   (  LAUGHTER  )     ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  FOLKS, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, SOMETIMES  WHEN PRESIDENT IS OVERSEAS, I GO INTO HIS CLOSET AND I PUT ON HIS JACKET. I TAKE A BREATH OF THAT JACKET, JUST A DEEP... THE HEADY MEX OF CIGARETTES, INTELLECT, AND UNCHECKED DRONE FIREPOWER. IT IS--   ( LAUGHTER )  BUT OF COURSE THE MANY  ATTRACTION, THE MAN HIMSELF. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-- NO, NOT THAT ONE. NO. YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT! THERE HE IS, THE POTUS WITH THE MOSTEST BARACK "WE DON'T USUALLY  USE HIS MIDDLE NAME" OBAMA, THE WORLD WATCHED WITH BATED BREATH.
I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH, MY GOD, THANK GOD, I WAS SO SURE HE WAS GOING TO BREAK UP WITH US. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD! HE STILL THINKS WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK. SO AMERICA SAT DOWN, LEANED FORWARD AND WAITED TO SEE IF HE WOULD DELIVER THAT OLD OBAMA MAGIC.
WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A C.E.O. PAYS HIS AUTO WORKERS ENOUGH TO BUY THE CARS THAT THEY BUILT, THE WHOLE COMPANY DOES BETTER. WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN A FAMILY CAN NO LONGER BE TRICKED INTO SIGNING A MORTGAGE THEY CAN'T  AFFORD, THAT FAMILY'S PROTECTED, BUT SO IS THE VALUE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES. WE BELIEVE THE LITTLE GIRL WHO IS OFFERED AN ESCAPE FROM POVERTY BY A GREAT TEACHER ON A  GRANT FOR COLLEGE COULD BECOME NEXT STEVE JOBS.
Jon: ♪♪ WE BELIEVE WE CAN FLY  ♪ ♪ HE HAD IT AGAIN. BUT EVERY MOMENT OF SOARING RHETORIC WAS TEMPERED WITH A MORE SOBER REALITY.
I WON'T PRETEND THE PATH I AM OFFERING IS QUICK OR EASY. I NEVER HAVE.
Jon: ♪♪ WE BELIEVE WE CAN FLY.  . BUT OBVIOUSLY FLYING CARRIES WITH IT SOME INHERENT RISK. IN 2008, CANDIDATE OBAMA PAINTED A BEAUTIFUL AND VIVID PICTURE THAT NO ARTIST COULD HAVE  BROUGHT TO LIFE. MUCH IN THE WAY WHEN YOU GO TO A GOLDEN CORAL, THE BEAUTIFUL CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.   (  LAUGHTER  )  OF TELEVISION FAME IS REALLY  JUST AN OPEN SEWER PIPE OF SUBPAR FUDGE.   (  LAUGHTER  )  BUT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE. THIS WAS THE CHALLENGE 2012 OBAMA FACED.
OURS IS A FIGHT TO RESTORE THE VALUES THAT BUILT THE LARGEST MIDDLE CLASS AND THE  STRONGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: ♪♪ I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY.
THE TRUTH IS, IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A FEW YEARS FOR US TO  SOLVE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BUILT UP IN DECADES.
Jon: DID I SAY SKY? I MEANT THE SHELF WHERE I KEEP THE JUICE BOXES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YES, THE CHALLENGE FOR THE PRESIDENT WAS TO REPLACE THE AUDACITY OF HOPE WITH THE MORE  REASONABLE CALIBRATION OF EXPECTATION. AND THEN, ULTIMATELY, LEST WE STILL BELIEVE TOO FERVENTLY IN THE POWER OF ONE MAN.
SO, YOU SEE, THE ELECTION FOUR YEARS AGO WASN'T ABOUT ME. IT WAS ABOUT YOU.   ( APPLAUSE )  MY FELLOW CITIZENS, YOU WERE THE CHANGE.   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )     ( CHEERING )
Jon:  THIS IS LIKE AN M KNIGHT SHAMADDAN MOVIE. I BET IF WE GO BACK AND WATCH THE ELECTION AGAIN, WE'LL PICK UP ALL THE CLUES.
YOU'RE THE RELATIONSHIP THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL WITH A  HEART DISORDER IN PHOENIX WHO WILL GET THE SURGERY SHE NEEDS BECAUSE AN INSURANCE COMPANY  CAN'T LIMIT HER COVERAGE. YOU DID THAT.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME?   ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE THE REASON A YOUNG MAN IN COLORADO WHO NEVER THOUGHT  HE'D BE ABLE TO AFFORD HIS DREAM OF EARNING A MEDICAL DEGREE IS ABOUT TO GET THAT CHANCE. YOU MADE THAT POSSIBLE.
Jon:  I'M AWESOME.   .  LAUGH   ( APPLAUSE )   WAIT A MINUTE. I KNOW THIS DRIFT. YOU DID THE GOOD THING. YOU DID THE GOOD THING. NOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO THROW US UNDER THE BUS FOR ALL THE ( BLEEP ) STUFF THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE. HOW ABOUT THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS? YOU DID THAT! I'M LOOKING AT YOU, AUDIENCE! DOESN'T FEEL SO GOOD WHEN YOU GET BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING, DOES IT!   ( LAUGHTER )  MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
WE, THE PEOPLE, RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS RIGHTS. THAT AMERICA IS NOT ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR US. IT'S ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE BY US TOGETHER. THROUGH THE HARD AND FRUADMINISTRATING, BUT NECESSARY WORK OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.
Jon: HARD, NECESSARY, FRUSTRATING, RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE IT WAS TIME FOR US TO BE BROUGHT DOWN TO EARTH A LITTLE BIT ANYWAY. AND MAYBE THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD HAVE DONE IT WAS THE ONE WHO PUT ALL THAT AIR UNDER OUR  FEET IN THE FIRST PLACE.   (  LAUGHTER  )
