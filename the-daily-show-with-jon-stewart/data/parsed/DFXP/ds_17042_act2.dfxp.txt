SO IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE FIRST PETS OF OUR PRIMARY SEASON. CANDIDATES SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND MONEY THERE TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES, AND BY ALL  MEASURES, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.
IOWA'S REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD.
A REAL THROWBACK TO A BYGONE ERA.
REAL VOTERS IN A REAL STATE.
I WANT TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IOWA.
I HAVE BEEN TO ALL 99 COUNTIES, YOUR TOWN SQUARES AN YOUR DINERS AND, OF COURSE, YOUR  PIZZA RANCHES.
Jon: IT'S LIKE IF YOU TOOK A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING AND  COVERED IT IN CHEESE AND PUT IT IN A FRIAR. NOW THE CANDIDATES KNOW THEIR PLACE IN THE HIERARCHY. DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME TO CHANGE THEIR FORTUNES. THAT SOMEWHAT CHANGES THE TENOR OF THE PRIMARYs IT MOVES INTO SOUTH CAROLINA.
WHEN WE GET TO SOUTH CAROLINA, THIS IS GOING TO BE A BLOOD-LETTING UNLIKE ANYTHING  WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.
THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET REALLY UGLY.
STRAP YOURSELF IN.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BLOODBATH THERE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT'S OKAY, MR. TICKLES. THAT LADY LOOKED LEGITIMATELY SCARED. ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN SOUTH CAROLINA. HOW DIFFERENT CAN IT REALLY BE? WELL, WE'LL SHOW YOU. HERE'S THE ADVERTISEMENTS NEWT GINGRICH WAS RUNNING IN IOWA.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE AMERICA WE KNOW AND LOVE IS A THING OF THE PAST. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. WORKING TOGETHER, WE CAN AND WILL REBUILD THE AMERICA WE LOVE. I'M NEWT GINGRICH, AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
Jon: WHY WOULDN'T YOU? THAT'S A FICTIONAL COUNTRY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN. AND HERE'S THE ADVERTISEMENT NEWT GINGRICH IS RUNNING IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
ROMNEY APPOINTED A PRO-ABORTION JUDGE, EXPANDED ACCESS TO ABORTION PILLS. ROMNEY SIGNED GOVERNMENT-MANDATED HEALTH CARE WITH TAX-PAIR FUNDED BORINGS.ï¿½i  HE CAN'T BE TRUSTEDFUL
I'M NEWT GINGRICH AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE.
Jon: WEARING THE SAME TIE. MY GOD NEW YORK TWO WEEKS WE'VE GONE FROM THIS TO THIS. [LAUGHTER] WELL, WE'VE GOT FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF THE SUDDEN SHIFT IN ELECTORAL TONE AS THE CAMPAIGN  MOVES INTO SOUTH CAROLINA. AASIF MANDVI, YOU'RE FIRST UP. WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
WELL, I'M IN COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, ABOUT 100 MILES INLAND. SO THE PRIMARY HASN'T REALLY HIT HERE YET, BUT RESIDENTS ARE PEEPING FOR THE WORST. THEY'RE CHECKING CANNED FOOD. THED FROM OF NEGATIVITY IS PREDICTED TO REACH AT LEAST CHEST HIGH. THE
Jon: AASIF, WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE IN THE DIRECT PATH OF THE CAMPAIGN DO?
THEY SHOULD HEAD FOR THE HIGH MORAL GROUND AND HUG YOUR LOVED ONES CLOSE AND FOR GOODNESS  SAKE, STAY AWAY FROM TVS AND RADIOS. [HURRICANE SIREN SOUNDS]
IT'S A WARNING SIREN. IT COULD BE AN INCOMING CAMPAIGN BUS. IT COULD BE A DRILL.
Jon: DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES, AASIF.
I WON'T. WE'RE HEADING IN.
Jon: JASON JONES, MYRTLE BEACH, JASON, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING DOWN THERE?
JON, THIS COSTAL AREA IS BEING HIT PRETTY HARD. THE OUTER EDGE OF THE CAMPAIGN STRUCK AROUND 6:00 A.M., AND WE'VE BEEN SLAMMED WITH ROBO  CALLS AND CHARACTER ATTACK ADS.
Jon: WASN'T SOUTH CAROLINA PREPARED FOR THIS? THEY'VE WEATHERED CAMPAIGNS BEFORE. THIS IS THE STATE WHERE JOHN McCAIN WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING AN ILLEGITIMATE BLACK BABY.
THAT'S A CATEGORY 3 SMEAR. THIS COULD BE A CATEGORY 4 OR 5. JUST THIS MORNING I WITNESSED ABUSIVE SKYWRITING AT A ROMNEY EVENT. ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT BE IMPRESSED AT THAT ARROW PLACEMENT. IT IS REALLY WINDY OUT HERE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, JASON JONES, THANK YOU. NOW WE HAVE A NEW MEMBER OF OUR NEWS TEAM. WE'RE VERY EXCITED. JESSICA WILLIAMS, SHE HAS JOINED US FOR HER FIRST CAMPAIGN ASSIGNMENT. JESSICA, WELCOME ABOARD. ARE YOU THERE?
[SCREAMING] ROBO CALLS. I DISTRIBUTED SMEARS. , OH, WHITE PEOPLE. SUPER PAC. JON, IT'S HORRIBLE. DAMN, WHY, WHY?
Jon: JESSICA, WHAT HAPPENED?
IT WAS THE FLIP-FLOPPING. VENTURE CAPITALISTS EVERYWHERE, WHITE COLLAR T-SHIRT, ABORTION JOB CREATORS MAN WAS STABBED IN THE HEART WITH A CHAMPAGNE FLUTE.
Jon: JESSICA, WHO DID THIS? WAS IT GINGRICH? [WHALING] I'M SORRY. I KNOW. OTHER THAN WHAT'S HAPPENED, HOW DO YOU LIKE BEING PART OF THE TEAM SO FAR?
I HATE IT. JON, THIS IS THE WORST. IT'S BAD. IT'S VERY BAD. I FEEL DEAD INSIDE. [LAUGHTER] I NEVER WANTED THIS. [SOBBING]
