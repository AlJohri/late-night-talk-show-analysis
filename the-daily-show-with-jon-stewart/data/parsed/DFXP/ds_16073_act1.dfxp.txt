HERE COMES JON STEWART NOW. LET'S LISTEN IN. (LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I WANTED TO TAKE SOME TIME TO CLEAR UP SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT MY  BEHAVIOR OVER THE PAST TEN DAYS OR SO AND... (LAUGHTER) TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS. I... I HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES AND I HAVE HURT THOSE CLOSEST TO ME. (LAUGHTER) LAST FRIDAY NIGHT A CONGRESSMAN WHOSE NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH A SEXUAL ORGAN... (LAUGHTER). SENT A PHOTO OF-- IT-- TO A YOUNG WOMAN ON TWITTER. IT WAS BY ANY STANDARDS A GIFT FROM THE COMEDY... WHATEVER IT IS COMEDIANS HAVE THAT TAKES THE  PLACE OF A GOD. (LAUGHTER) LAST WEEK, WE SPENT THREE DAYS ON THIS STORY. WE DID OVER 59 JOKES. (LAUGHTER) NINE PENIS PUNS. WE USED AN R. KELLY IMPERSONATOR TO PROVIDE "TRAPPED IN THE CLOSET" STYLE COMMENTARY. AND I... (LAUGHTER). AND I PERSONALLY SAID THE WORD (BLEEP) TEN TIMES. (LAUGHTER) I ACKNOWLEDGE... (APPLAUSE). I ACKNOWLEDGE A PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP WITH THE CONGRESSMAN AND YET EXPRESS MY BELIEF THAT  HE WAS NOT BEING HONEST AND THAT IF THE WORST OF HIS ALLEGATIONS WERE, IN FACT, TRUE, HE SHOULD  RESIGN AND THEN I SAID THE WORD (BLEEP) AGAIN. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, THAT'S NICE. I RECOGNIZE NOW THAT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. YESTERDAY, CONGRESSMAN WEINER CONFESSED THAT THE PENIS IN QUESTION WAS, IN FACT, HIS OWN. (LAUGHTER) HE DID SO AT A PRESS CONFERENCE... (LAUGHTER). HE DID SO AT A PRESS CONFERENCE AT 4:30 IN THE AFTERNOON. WE TAPE OUR PROGRAM AT 6:00 P.M. I MADE THE DECISION TO DO A COUPLE OF WEANER JOKES, MENTION THE PRESS CONFERENCE BUT TO  MOSTLY STICK TO THE SCRIPT THAT WE'D ALREADY WRITTEN ABOUT JOHN EDWARDS AND SARAH PALIN. THIS WAS MY DECISION. (LAUGHTER) MY DECISION ALONE. I RECOGNIZE HOW WRONG I WAS. (LAUGHTER) DELICIOUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) THAT'S NOT GOOD. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I'M PROBABLY GOING TO NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. (LAUGHTER) (BLEEP) I BROUGHT PAIN TO PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT-- MY STAFF, MY AUDIENCE, MY BEAUTIFUL AND  EXOTIC FAMILY. (LAUGHTER) I DO NOT EXPLICITLY STATE THAT I THOUGHT MR. WEINER HAD BEEN  DECEITFUL LAST NIGHT, THAT HE WAS A LIAR AND THAT I BELIEVED HIS PANTS TO BE ON FIRE. (LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH, LUCKILY FOR THE CONGRESSMAN, IT APPEARS HE HAS A FIRE SAFETY SYSTEM ON BOARD. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, FOR THESE REASONS, UNLIKE THE CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE DECIDED TO STEP DOWN (AUDIENCE REACTS) NO, EVERYONE, PLEASE. NO, NO! I WILL TURN THE PROGRAM OVER NOW TO SOMEONE WHOSE ACCENT MAKES YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN TRUST HIM, JOHN OLIVER. JOHN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, JON, AND PLEASE, PLEASE, BEFORE I CONTINUE, LET ME ASSURE MY VIEWERS THAT FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE NO  PUSSSYING OUT. NO OFFENSE. I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO RIP ANTHONY WEINER A NEW ASS (BLEEP)  (BLEEP). AN (BLEEP) THAT EVEN HE WOULD NOT TEXT A PICTURE OF. WHY? BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO BIG IT WON'T FIT WITHIN TWITTER'S 140-CHARACTER LIMIT. THAT SLEAZY McJEWFRO WILL GET NO QUARTER FROM ME. (LAUGHTER)
WE'RE... WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONGRESSMAN, RIGHT?
OH, YES, YES. OKAY, NO PROBLEM, YEAH. JON, I WILL HOUND HIM, I WILL MOCK HIM UNTIL HIS SHAME IS VISIBLE. A BULGE STRAINING AGAINST A FABRIC OF HIS BEING, BEGGING TO BE RELEASED. BUT THIS TIME, WEINER, THERE WILL BE NO HAPPY ENDING. (LAUGHTER) AND AS FOR YOU, STEWART, AND YOUR VIVIDLY, VIVIDLY INJURED  HAND, THAT'S A GENUINE PROBLEM, THAT'S A GENUINE PROBLEM. THAT'S... (APPLAUSE). (BLEEP).
Jon: YUP. WE BETTER HURRY UP AND (BLEEP) BECAUSE I AM BLEEDING OUT MOTHER (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER).
JON, TALK TO THIS, HE CAN SWAB HIMSELF DOWN. YOU'RE FINE, YOU'RE FINE. (LAUGHTER) DON'T BE SO JEWISH ABOUT IT, YOU'RE FINE. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY FINE. IT'S A NICK. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I SHOULD BE CATHOLIC. I SHOULD TURN IT INTO A DRINK? (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. THE POINT IS, JOHN, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO GROW A PAIR, TAKE A PICTURE OF THAT PAIR, AND TEXT IT TO YOURSELF TO REMIND YOURSELF WHAT BALLS LOOK LIKE. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO DRY YOUR EYES, TURN OFF YOUR SOUL, AND GIVE THIS AUDIENCE THE PREPUBESCENT (BLEEP) JOKES THEY WAITED OUTSIDE IN 90-DEGREE  TEMPERATURES FOR AND YOU FAILED, JON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, NO MORE! NO MORE, JON! NO LONGER! SCRUB YOURSELF DOWN! CLEAR EYES, DEAD HEARTS, CAN'T LOSE! JUNE 7, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
