FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." Captioning sponsored by COMEDY CENTRAL  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS... MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE'RE EXCITED, RAPPER, WHITE HOUSE POETRY NIGHT GUST, ACTOR, DESTROYER OF CIVILIZATIONS. COMMON WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, AS YOU'LL RECALL, DURING HIS TIME AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ACCOUNTABLE TO THE NATION'S VOTERS, OUR VICE  PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY KEPT SOMETHING OF A LOW PROFILE. [LAUGHTER] STAYING IN UNDISCLOSED LOCATIONS, ERASING THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE FROM  GOOGLE MAPS, TRAVELING ONLY A NIGHT ON THE NEW MOON AT LOW TIDE. BUT WITH THE RELEASE LAST MONTH OF HIS NEW TELL-SOME BOOK, CHENEY IS NOW SAYING, HELLO, WORLD, IT'S ME, DICK. HE'S ON "DATELINE," THE "TODAY SHOW," MORNING SHOW, EVERY SHOW  FOLK NEWS HAS EVER PRODUCED, INCLUDING A DOUBLE SHOT OF HANNITY, "THE SITUATION ROOM," ABC NEWS, C-SPAN AND EVEN THE  THE UNSHOW, WHERE THINGS GOT SOMEWHAT SURREAL.
It's "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno." Tonight Jay welcomes former vice  president Dick Cheney. Carrot top. OH, MMM, OH, OH, HOLD ON. SIX LEGS, TWO HEARTS AND A PENDING INDICTMENT FOR WAR CRIMES AT THE HAGUE. MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM. NAME THREE THINGS THAT THE TONIGHT SHOW PANEL POSSESSIONS. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY CARSON WAS THE GREATEST. THAT'S GOING TO BE A HARD ONE TO EXPLAIN TO THE ALIENS WHO VISIT THIS EARTH. BUT, OF COURSE, FOR ME THE HIGHLIGHT OF CHENEY'S TOUR BEGAN YESTERDAY WHEN HE, ALONG WITH  HIS WIFE LYNN, DROPPED IN ON THE LADIES OF THE VIEW.
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS LITTLE BULGE HERE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M GUESSING THAT LINE WAS ESPECIALLY UNSETTLING ON  "THE VIEW'S" RADIOBROADCAST.
LAST YEAR AGO JUNE, I WENT INTO END-STAGE HEART FAILURE. IN EFFECT MY HEART WASN'T PUMPING ENOUGH BLOOD TO SURFACE MY ORGAN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: GO ON.
THIS IS THE CONTROL ELEMENT THAT RUNS IT. THE ACTUAL PUMP ITSELF IS INSIDE MY CHEST. YOU NEED POWER ALL THE TIME, 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. [BEEPING]
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
PUT THE BATTERY BACK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: CHENEY'S FRAILTY SAPPING MY ABILITY TO POKE FUN AT HIS VILE PUBLIC SERVICE RECORD. I... BUT WHY?
HE'S MORE MACHINE NOW THAN MAN.
YES, YES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY. THAT'S WHAT IS SAPPING MY ABILITY TO POKE FUN AT HIM, GHOST OF ALEC GUINNESS, IT'S THAT THE DARTH VADER METAPHOR IS NOW MORE TRUE THAN FUNNY. I... THIS IS REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. IT TOOK A PIECE OF BIONIC MACHINERY TO HUMANIZE DICK CHENEY. [LAUGHTER] BUT WE TURN NOW TO A LOCAL STORY, A SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION. IT WAS HELD YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK'S NINTH DISTRICT, A PREDOMINANTLY JEWISH AND ASIAN  AREA OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS. I'M SORRY. I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S FOOTAGE FROM THE MOVIE "DISTRICT NINE."  [LAUGHTER] I APOLOGIZE. DO WE HAVE ANY IMAGES FROM THE ACTUAL NINTH DISTRICT OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS? THANK YOU. THAT'S MUCH BETTER. ANY HOW -- LUCKY. MMM, MMM. ASK YOUR PARENTS. ANY WHO, IF YOU REMEMBER, THE FORMER HOLDER OF THAT CONGRESSIONAL SEAT WAS DEMOCRAT  ANTHONY WEINER, WHO FOR SOME REASON WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE HIS TERM. WHAT WAS THAT?
CONGRESSMAN WEINER, A CONTRACT, IS NOW INFAMOUS FOR SOME REVEALING SELF-PORTRAITS  SENT TO WOMEN ONLINE. JON JON OH, YES, THE SELF-PORTRAITS HE SENT TO WOMEN ONLINE. YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LITTLE GRANDIOSE TO CALL THIS A SELF-PORTRAIT. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, THESE SELF-PORTRAITS SHOW NONE OF THE MONOCHROMATIC GRAND -- GRANDEUR  OF PI -- PICASSO'S WORK OR SEURAT'S WORKS. IF YOU ENJOY THESE, THERE'S PLENTY MORE IN OUR BOOK, "JOKES FOR HISTORY MAJORS."  [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, THAT'S... IT'S PRONOUNCED [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] SORRY. I JUST DO IMAGINE AN ART HISTORY MAJOR WATCHING THE SHOW RIGHT NOW GOING, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY  GOD, OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT US. ANYWAY, SPECIAL ELECTIONS, BUT STILL IT'S A FAIT ACCOMPLI. WHOEVER THE DEMOCRATS RAN ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT SEAT.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BLUEST DISTRICTS IN THE NATION. THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS OUTNUMBER REPUBLICANS THREE TO ONE, HASN'T SENT A REPUBLICAN TO  WASHINGTON IN 1923.
1923. 88 YEARS. THE LAST TIME THAT NINTH DISTRICT HAD A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, HARLEM CONGRESSMAN  CHARLIE RANGEL HADN'T EVEN STARTED HIS 15th CONGRESSIONAL TERM YET. HE'S BEEN THERE A WHILE. SO HOW BAD DID THE D'S SHELLAC THE R'S.
REPUBLICAN BOB TURNER ON TUESDAY WON THE HOUSE SEAT THAT WAS VACATED BY DEMOCRAT ANTHONY WEINER.
Jon: WHAT! HOW DID THE DEMOCRATS SQUANDER A GIMME? THEY HAVE A POWERFUL MACHINE IN NEW YORK. SURELY DAVID WEPRIN MUST HAVE PICKED UP SOME BIG-NAME, PARTY ENDORSEMENTS.
THIS IS ED KOCH. REMEMBER ME? I WAS ONCE YOUR MAYOR. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU WERE, WEREN'T YOU? I REMEMBER. WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME?
YOU KNOW WHY I'M CALLING YOU? I WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR BOB TURNER FOR CONGRESS ON TUESDAY.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEPED] BALL. ED KOCH BACKED THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. DID WEPRIN GET ANY ENDORSEMENTS? ♪ BOB, BA, BOB ♪♪
Jon: THAT'S BOWSER FROM SHA-NA-NA. ASK YOUR PARENTS TO ASK THEIR PARENTS. WANT TO KNOW HOW WEAK A CANDIDATE DAVID WEPRIN WAS?
NEXT TUESDAY MORNING I'M GOING TO VOTE. THERE WILL PROBABLY BE CAMERAS AROUND. I LIVE IN THE DISTRICT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
FIRST OF ALL, MY MOTHER LIVES IN THE DISTRICT. I'LL BE HAPPY TO GO WITH HER TO VOTE.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE DISTRICT YOU RAN TO REPRESENT, AND TWO, YOU'RE HAPPY TO GO WITH YOUR MOM TO VOTE? SURE. DAVID, WHY ARE YOU WALKING SO FAST? WE'RE GOING TO VOTE, NOT PUT OUT A FIRE. BY THE WAY, YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHO CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY, ED KOCH. HE HATES YOU. ARE YOU STILL RUNNING WITH THAT GREASER FROM THE ACT PELL LA GANG? SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE DEMOCRATS LOSE A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT THEY HELD FOR 88 YEARS. THE GREAT DEPRESSION COULDN'T WREST THE SEAT FROM THEIR HAND, WORLD WAR II, THE RED SCARE, EVEN THE REAGAN REVOLUTION. THE ONLY THING POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS WAS  ♪ BA BA BA BANG-A-BANG-BANG, ANTHONY WEINER'S
