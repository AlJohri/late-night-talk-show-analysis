[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, AS WE'VE SEEN, THE PRESIDENT'S USE OF EXECUTIVE POWER TO PERMIT CERTAIN YOUNG  IMFRANTS TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S UPSET MANY REPUBLICANS, NOT BECAUSE COULD LOSE THEM THE HISPANIC VOTE FOR GENERATIONS  BUT BECAUSE THEY FEEL BADLY IT TOOK SEW BALMA SO LONG TO DO IT.
HE PROMISED IMMIGRATION REFORM IN THE FIRST YEAR AND DID HE NOTHING.
HE HAD OVERWHELMING MAJORITIES IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. NOTHING WAS DONE.
HE HAD THE FULL RUN OF THE TABLE AND HE FAILED TO GET IT DONE.
Jon: WE WERE BEGGING HIM. TO FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM AMERICA'S APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION. LOOK HOW WE RALLIED AROUND HIM WITH THE WHOLE HEALTH CARE THING. WE LOVE THE GUY. APPARENTLY OBAMA MISS THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE TWO, THREE YEARS AGO. NO USE NOW ON WONDERING WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF ONLY HE TRIED. IT WAS DECEMBER 2010. YES, I REMEMBER IT WELL. ♪ YOU BETTER WATCH OUT, YOU BETTER NOT CRY YOU BETTER NOT  POUT I'M TELLING YOU WHY SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN ♪  [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY SURE THAT WAS THE WRONG DECEMBER 2010 MEMORY. [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY SURE THAT WAS --  [ LAUGHTER ] SPANX WILL MAKE ANYONE LOOK SKINNY. I WAS LOOKING FOR THE MEMORY ABOUT OBAMA TRYING TO GET THE DREAM ACT THROUGH CONGRESS.
THE PRESIDENT WAS, WE SHOULD SAY, DEALT ONE SIGNIFICANT DEFEAT THIS WEEKEND WHEN  REPUBLICANS BLOCKED THE SO CALLED DREAM ACT.
THE SENATE VOTED IN FAVOR OF BILL 55-41 BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TO STOP A REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I COULD HAVE ACTUALLY GROWN A BEARD IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME BUT AT LEAST OBAMA FAILED  THE RIGHT WAY, LEGISLATIVELY BUT THIS UNILATERAL ACTION.
IS SIMPLY CONSTITUTIONAL DECENCY.
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS GIVEN TO ITSELF SOMETHING THAT  THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS REJECTED TWO YEARS AGO.
WE'VE GOT A PRESIDENT, WE DON'T HAVE A KING.
Jon: BUT YOU ADMIT HE'S PRESIDENT. PROGRESS! YOU'VE DONE IT. HE'S PRESIDENT. [  APPLAUSE  ] FREEDOM! [ LAUGHTER ] APPARENTLY WHAT OBAMA HAS DONE IS COMPLETELY WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN OUR DEMOCRACY. [ LAUGHTER ] TO FIND EXAMPLES OF A PRESIDENT ACTING UNILATERALLY ON DEPORTATION POLICY WOULD -- TO FIND EXAM. S OF THAT -- EXAMPLES OF THAT YOU WOULD HAVE GO BACK AS FAR AS --
GEORGE W. BUSH HAS ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO GRANT REPRIEVE TO LIE LEERANS FACING  DEPORTATION TO THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: ALL HAIL KING GEORGE THE BUSH. OTHER THAN GEORGE BUSH, CAPITOL HILL CLINTON, GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND RONALD REAGAN NO PRESIDENT  IN MODERN HISTORY HAS CHANGED DEPORTATION THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION EXCEPT ALL OF THEM. THEY MAY BE WHAT YOU CALL SITUATIONAL OR UNTIL I SAW THIS ON FOX NEWS.
LET ME PLAY THIS FOR THE AUDIENCE SO THEY UNDERSTAND AND FULLY GRASP HERE THE MAGNITUDE  OF WHAT HE DID ON FRIDAY. LET'S PLAY THIS.
Jon: THERE'S A GOTCHA COMING! I BET IT'S A BIG ONE.
THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW I CAN JUST CHANGES THE LAWS UNILATERALLY IS NOT TRUE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THERE ARE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT I HAVE TO ENFORCE. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A GRIT DISSERVICE DONE -- GREAT DISSERVICE DONE TO THE CAUSE OF  GETTING THE DREAM ACT PASSED AND GETTING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION PASSED BY  PERPETRATING THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW BY MYSELF I CAN GO AND DO THESE THINGS. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.
Jon: OH, (bleep). UM, WOW THAT WAS JUST NINE MONTHS AGO. THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY ADMITTING HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO DO THE THING HE JUST DID. THAT'S -- GAME OVER FOX. KUDOS. I'M SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT HARD ON THE FOLK THERE'S, PERHAPS  SOMEWHAT JUDGMENTAL, QUICK TO POUNCE. I'M A DICK. OF KIND OF A DICK BUT THEY GOT IT RIGHT. I COMMEND THEM. I ACKNOWLEDGE THEY ARE DILIGENCE AND ACCURACY AND I APOLOGIZE. BEFORE I GO, ONE MORE THING, MAYBE IT'S JUST ME THAT BUT VIDEO --  [ LAUGHTER ] IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE THE PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DONE SPEAKING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE TRUTH OR NOT. I'M PROBABLY WRONG BUT I WON'T SLEEP TONIGHT UNLESS WE GIVE IT A QUICK CHECK AND ROLE THE  UNEDITED TAPE.
THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW BY MYSELF I CAN GO AND DO THESE THINGS IS JUST NOT TRUE. WHAT WE COULD DO IS PRIORITIZE ENFORCEMENT SINCE THERE ARE LIMITED ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES  AND SAY, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO CHASING AFTER THIS YOUNG MAN OR  ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS BEEN ACTING RESPONSIBLY AND WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR LEGAL STATUS IF THE  DREAM ACT PASSED.
Jon: (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] THEY JUST CUT OBAMA OFF JUST BEFORE -- THEY CUT HIM OFF BEFORE HE CLEARLY SAYS THAT HE  CAN DO THE EXACT THING HE JUST DID BUT WHICH YOU SAID HE SAID HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO --  [ LAUGHTER ] MOTHER (bleep). YOU ALMOST HAD ME, FOX NEWS. ALMOST HAD ME BUT REVERSE, GOT YOU! THE WHOLE INNING IN IS LIKE I DREAM I WITNESS HAD. -- I ONCE HAD. [ LAUGHTER ] ♪ SILENT NIGHT, HOLY NIGHT ♪ ♪ ALL IS CALM ♪  ♪ ALL IS BRIGHT ♪  [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WE'LL WE'LL BE RIGHT
