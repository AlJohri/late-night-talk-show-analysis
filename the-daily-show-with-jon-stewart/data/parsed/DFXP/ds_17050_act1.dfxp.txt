JANUARY 25, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART, WE HAVE  A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST IS PAULA BROADWELL, A NEW BOOK ON DAVID PETRAEUS AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND PAULA CAN  AND MAY CRUSH ME LIKE A WALNUT. IN HER BARE HANDS. NOW, LATELY OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HEARD AND THE CANDIDATES RUNNING TO BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR  PRESIDENT, BUT DID YOU KNEE... WERE YOU AWARE? WE ALREADY HAVE A PRESIDENT.
MR. SPEAKER, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: LAST NIGHT, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT STRODE TO THE PODIUM TO DELIVER A MESSAGE TO  THE CITIZENS OF THIS GREAT NATION. AND OBVIOUSLY FOR A SPEECH LIKE THIS, JOINT SESSION, YOU WANT TO EASE IN. YOU WANT TO WARM UP THE CROWD GRADUALLY.
♪ I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU... ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: (HUMMING) KIDDING AROUND. HE DIDN'T OPEN THE STATE OF THE STATE OF UNION WITH AN AL GREENE SONG. HE SHOULD HAVE, THOUGH.
FOR THE FIRST TIME TWO DECADES, OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NOT A THREAT TO THIS COUNTRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU OPEN WITH "I KILLED BIN LADEN"? YOU OPEN WITH THAT? "HEY, EVERYBODY, HOW YOU DOING? YOU HAVING A NICE NIGHT? I (BLEEP)ING KILLED BIN LADEN EXPWRNCHTS I KILLED HIM!" WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DOES RICK SPRINGFIELD OPEN WITH JESSE'S GIRL? NO! HE OPENS WITH "I'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU" AND  TRANSITIONS TO "DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS" SLOWS IT DOWN WITH  "AFFAIR OF THE HEART" AND THEN WHEN YOU THINK IT CAN'T GET ANY  MORE (BLEEP)ING BEAUTIFUL "JESSE'S GIRL"! AND THE PLACE GOES NUTS! IT GOES NUTS! (APPLAUSE) SORRY. SORRY. IT WAS THE GREATEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, WHERE WAS I? STATE OF THE UNION. ALL RIGHT, YOU KILLED BIN LADEN, WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
WASHINGTON IS BROKEN. SEEMS TO GET WORSE EVERY YEAR. SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE CORROSIVE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS. THE WAY CONGRESS DOES ITS BUSINESS THESE DAYS. WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT FIASCO? LOWER THE TEMPERATURE IN THIS TOWN. NO SIDE ISSUES, NO DRAMA. THE OPPONENTS OF ACTION ARE OUT OF EXCUSES. SO FAR YOU VICE PRESIDENT ACTED.
Jon: WELL, I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING, PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM  COULDN'T GET LAID IN A WHORE HOUSE. (LAUGHTER) IN A BAG FILLED WITH (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) HOPE AND CHANGE 2012. CUE THE "ROCKY" THEME. "I KILLED BIN LADEN!" WAIT, IF EVERYBODY THERE SUCKS, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE VOTERS ON YOUR SIDE? PERHAPS YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING IN YOUR GOODY BAG, SANTA?
WE'RE PROVIDING NEW TAX CREDITS TO COMPANIES THAT HIRE VETS. IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN MANUFACTURER YOU SHOULD GET A BIGGER TAX CUT. IF YOU'RE A HIGH-TECH MEFERRER WE SHOULD DOUBLE THE TAX DEDUCTION YOU GET. EXTEND THE TUITION TAX CREDIT WE STARTED. EXPAND TAX RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES. PASS CLEAN ENERGY TAX CREDITS. CREATE THESE JOBS. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: MY GOD, HE'S TAX CREDIT OPRAH! (LAUGHTER) "YOU GET A TAX CREDIT! YOU GET A TAX CREDIT! EVERYBODY GETS A TAX CREDIT! AND THEN JOHN TRAVOLTA'S COMING!" WOW, OBAMA WAS KILLING IT! I MEAN, NOTHING COULD STOP HIS MOMENTUM.
WE GOT RID OF ONE RULE FROM 40 YEARS AGO THAT COULD HAVE FORCED SOME DAIRY FARMERS  130-TO-SPEND $10,000 A YEAR PROVING THAT THEY COULD CONTAIN A SPILL BECAUSE MILK WAS SOMEHOW  CLASSIFIED AS AN OIL. AND WITH A RULE LIKE THAT, I GUESS IT WAS WORTH CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK.
Jon: BY THE WAY, AS INTHOB DOES COMEDY FOR A LIVING, BEEN THERE. AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE, THE WORST PART ISN'T  THE CROWD'S REACTION-- IT'S THE WIFE'S.
WITH A RULE LIKE THAT, I GUESS IT WAS WORTH CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW, WHAT THAT FACE SAYS? THAT FACE SAYS "(BLEEP)ING TOLD YOU THAT WASN'T FUNNY. I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T FUNNY." (LAUGHTER) SPILLED MILK IS NOT FUNNY. NOT FUNNY TO ME, NOT FUNNY TO CHILDREN, IT'S NOT A JOKE. FOR ME, CUT ATRY THE AUDIENCE REACTIONS IS HALF THE FUN OF THE STATE OF THE UNION. CLEARLY THE DIRECTOR HAS GOTTEN AN ADVANCE COPY OF THE SPEECH SO HE CAN TIME EACH SHOT. WHEN OBAMA MENTIONED STEVE JOBS, BOOM, CUT AWAY TO MRS. JOBS. MENTIONS TRANSPORTATION CUTS? SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE MENTIONS ISRAEL.
OUR IRONCLAD COMMITMENT-- AND I MEAN IRONCLAD-- TO ISRAEL'S  SECURITY HAS MEANT THE CLOSEST CORPORATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IN HISTORY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU MENTION ISRAEL AND THEY CUT TO ME, CHUCK SCHUMER? I MEAN, THERE'S LIEBERMAN, THERE'S LAUTENBERG, THERE'S LEVIN, THAT'S JUST THE "L" JEWS. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN... I MEAN, I'M A JEW, I'M NOT "THE" JEW. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE THE GOLDEN GLOBES WHERE ANY TIME ANYONE MENTIONED BLACK PEOPLE...
OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS BRITISH LIKE ME. WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM IS HE'S VERY RACIST. VERY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WAIT, WAIT, WHERE'S THE CAST OF "THE HELP"? ANYWAY, I DON'T ENVY THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE OF THE STATE OF THE UNION. THERE'S VERY IT WILL THAT WILL CAN UNITE THIS VERY DIVIDED CONGRESS. GREEN TAX CUTS GET APPLAUSE FROM DEMOCRATS. EXPANDED OIL DRILLING GETS IT FROM REPUBLICANS. VERY LITTLE TO BRING THEM TO... WELL, ONE THING, ACTUALLY.
AMERICA IS DETERMINED TO PREVENT IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND I WILL TAKE  NO OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WOW. WHEN DID A NEW WAR IN A MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY BECOME THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT OF... I  DON'T KNOW, THIS.
HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE ALL GONNA GET LAID! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH... (APPLAUSE). ... A LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS HE'S DONE AND GONNA DO. HE MENTIONED THE STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG AND GETTING STRONGER. TO THE REBUTTAL.
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CLAIMS THAT THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS ANYTHING BUT GRAVE HE MUST KNOW  IN HIS HEART THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE.
Jon: WHAT'S WITH MR. CRANKY PANTS. I GUESS SOMEBODY DIDN'T KILL BIN LADEN. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, IT'S INDIANA GOVERN MITCH DANIELS CHANNELING  REAGAN'S FAMED MORNING IN AMERICA OPTIMISM BUT INSTEAD OF  MORNING IT'S EVENING AND INSTEAD OF OPTIMISM IT'S DESPAIR. HERE'S SOME OF THE JUMP OFF THE CLIFF NOTES.
WE'RE ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE BEHIND GREECE, SPAIN, AND OTHER  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW FACING ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT US ON A COURSE TO MAKE IT RADICALLY WORSE IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THE FIRST GENERATION IN MEMORY TO FACE A FUTURE LESS PROMISING THAN THEIR PARENTS. NO NATION, NO ENTITY, CAN THRIVE OR SURVIVE INTACT WITH DEBT SO HUGE AS OURS. WE HAVE A SHORT GRACE PERIOD TO DEAL WITH OUR DANGERS. THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT. IF WE DRIFT PARALYZED OVER A NIAGRA OF DEBT WE WILL ALL SUFFER. THANKS FOR LISTENING. GOOD NIGHT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER MR. PUDDLES NOTHING MATTERS. EITHER THAT DUDE IS LIVING IN A HEALTH SCAPE DEVOID OF ALL OPRAH BEAUTY OR HE'S FROM INDIANA. BOOM! BOOM! (APPLAUSE) NOW I REALLY AM GOING TO GET MY ASS KICKED BY PAULA BROADWELL  BECAUSE I JUST PULL MID-BACK OUT. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF MITCH DANIELS DELIVERED THE WARNING MITT ROMNEY EMBODY  IT HAD TOLL OUR TROUBLES ARE TAKING. THE NORMALLY IN CONTROL AND STAID ROMNEY DISPLAYED THAT DANCING HAIR COW LICK AND SWEATY  VISAGE OF A HANDSOME SEEMINGLY NORMAL STEP DAD IN A MOVIE WHO LOSES HIS TEMPER AND  ACCIDENTALLY BEATS SOMEONE TO DEATH WITH A GOLF CLUB. "NO SON OF MINE LOSES THE SOAP BOX DERBY!" BLOOD, BLOOD! (PHONE RINGS)S) HELL   1234R0E ALL RIGHT, MITT, I GUESS IT'S GOOD THOUGH, HE'S FINALLY GOT FIRE IN HIS BELLY.
NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE NEW IDEAS AND WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO? WELL, WHERE WAS HE DURING HIS FIRST TWO YEARS? WHY DIDN'T HE GET THESE THINGS DONE DURING HIS FIRST TWO YEARS? SERIOUSLY.
Jon: YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN THERE'S A FIRE INSIDE MITT  ROMNEY IT'S STILL JUST A WEIRD ELECTRICAL
