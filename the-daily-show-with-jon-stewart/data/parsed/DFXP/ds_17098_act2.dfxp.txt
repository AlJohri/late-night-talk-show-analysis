Jon:  SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MITT ROMNEY THERE WHO WILL  BE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, OR AS I NOW CALL IT, THE ROMMENY. THAT'S A TRADE MARK. BY THE WAY, I'LL HAVE A WHOLE LINE OF ROMMENY PRODUCTS, FOR INSTANCE, MY LATEST IS FLOP-FLIPS. IT'S FOR PEOPLE WHO CHANGE THEIR MIND ABOUT FLIP-FLOPS. IT'S AT THE OFFICIAL ROMMENNIES STORES. NOW THAT ROMNEY HAS WEATHERED THE PRIMARIES IT'S TIME FOR THE GREAT PIVOT TO THE CENTER! ( LAUGHTER ). I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS LOUD OR NOT.
WANT TO SEE WHAT THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN DID TODAY? THEY HIRED A NEW SPOKESMAN, A MAN NAMED RICHARD GRENLE. HE A VETERAN OF THE SECOND BUSH ADMINISTRATION. HE WORKED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH,.
Jon:  HE SAY VETERAN OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND THE GUY WHO PRETTED MUCH WANTED TO  DISMANTLE THE UNITED NATIONS. I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING THIS IS A PIVOT TO THE CENTER HOW?
RICHARD GRENLE IS OPENLY GAY.
Jon:  OH! THAT'S QUITE A PIVOT. HIRING A GUY WHO BELIEVES IN EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE AND LIKES EVERYTHING YOU LIKE EXCEPT BOOBS. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, SO, THE GUYS-- THE GUY'S DAY. WHO CARES?
GOVERNOR ROMNEY PICKS AS THE FACE OF HIS CAMPAIGN ON NATIONAL  SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY A MAN WHO IS NOT JUST A HOMOSEXUAL BUT A HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVIST. OUR CONCERN IS FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND WE RECOGNIZE THE THREAT THAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVISM, THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA IMPOSES OR-- IMPOSES ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
BRIAN.
Jon:  YOU CAN'T APPOINT A GAY GUY. HE THREATENS OUR VERY RIGHT TO HATE PEOPLE FOR BEING GAY. ( LAUGHTER ). THAT WAS BRIAN FISHER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION. AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDER YG HE LOOKS SO BLURRY IT'S BECAUSE HIS  OPINIONS ARE BEING BROADCAST FROM 50 YEARS AGO ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WHAT ELSE DON'T YOU-- WHAT ELSE DON'T YOU LIKE-- WHAT ELSE DON'T  YOU LIKE ABOUT GRENLE?
HOMOSEXUALS ARE ABOUT SHORT-LIVED RELATIONSHIPS AND FREQUENT ANONYMOUS SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS. THIS IS VERY COMMON IN THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY.
Jon:  I'VE-- I'VE HEARD. ( LAUGHTER )
HOMOSEXUALS THEMSELVES ADMIT IN SURSTLAIZ THEY HAVE HAD 500 TO AS MANY AS 1,000 SEXUAL  PARTNERS OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME.
Jon:  AND THAT'S AN AVERAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) HIS NUMBER COULD BE AS LOW AS 200 OR AS HIGH AS A MILLION.
THERE'S CONSTANT STORIES ABOUT RAIDING GAY BATH HOUSES  AND SO-- AND GAYS HAVING SEX IN PUBLIC PARKS AND PUBLIC RESTROOMS.
Jon:  IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR PROBLEM WITH GRENLE ISN'T THAT HE'S GAY. IT'S THAT HE'LL BE TOO BUSY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT, THE THEY'RE VERY ANGRY ABOUT THIS GUY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? TOUGH. THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IS OVER, MY FRIEND. ROMNEY IS THE GUY YOU'RE STUCK WITH, AND NOW HE GETS TO STAND ON PRINCIPLE. PEOPLE ON HIS CAMPAIGN DON'T HAVE TO DANCE TO YOUR BIGOTED TUNE ANYMORE.
AN OPENLY GAY SPOKESPERSON FOR THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN SAID  HE'S STEPPING DOWN THIS MORNING. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I'M SURE HE'S JUST LEAVING TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH  THE FAMILY THAT THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T SURE HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE. WHILE THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN HASN'T ADDRESSED THE RESIGNATION BUT  THERE'S ONE PERSON OUT THERE ALL TOO HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE THAT A HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVIST IN A VERY  PROMINENT PLACE IN MITT ROMNEY'S CAMPAIGN HAS STEPPED DOWN. AND IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE "WASHINGTON POST" THAT HE  RESIGNED BECAUSE OF PRESSURE PUT ON THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN BY THE PRO-FAMILY COMMUNITY.
Jon:  WHAT A PROUD DAY! ( LAUGHTER ) IT MUST BE-- I MEAN, IN YEARS TO COME, YOU CAN ALL SIT AROUND AND  TELL THE GRANDKIDS ABOUT THE DAY YOU GOT THAT GAY GUY FIRED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
