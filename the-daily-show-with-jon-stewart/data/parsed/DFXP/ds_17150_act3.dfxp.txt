( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. BEEN HERE ALL WEEK COVERING THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. I THINK WE MINED SOME INTERESTING HUMOR DURING THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. OBVIOUSLY, SOMEPLACE OUR MORE DOGGED VIEWERS AT HOME MIGHT BE GOING, "COME ON! YOU KNOW WHAT WE W."T!"  DON'T WORRY, WHILE WE WERE HERE WE WATCHED FOX NEWS, TOO  COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE CERTAIN DISCREPANCIES ON THEIR TAKE ON THIS CONVENTION AND ONE LAST WEEK. FOX WAS CHASTISING THE MEDIA FROM LETTING SILLY SOCIAL ISSUES DISTRACT THEM FROM JOBS AND THE ECONOMY.
I KNOW THE MEDIA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT ABORTION, THE PHONY WAR ON WOMEN.
THE MEDIA WILL TRY TO MAKE IT ABOUT ABORTION, ABOUT AKIN.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS FOCUSED, ECONOMY, ECONOMY, ECONOMY. NO DECIDE ISSUE. NO ABORTION.
MITT ROMNEY DOESN'T WRITE THE PLATFORM. AND HE ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE PLATFORM.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TODAY.
Jon:  YEAH, I MEAN THE PLATFORM IS JUST A SEGMENT OF THE PARTY'S CORE PRINCIPLES AND  EFS.BELI I MEAN, WHATEVER. MITT ROMNEY CAN WIPE HIS ASS WITH IT FOR ALL WE CARE. I WONDER HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THE PARTY PLATFORM THIS WEEK.
ZERO TIMES, THAT'S HOW MANY TIMES THE DAMAGE PLATFORM MENTIONED GOD.
IT WAS DOWN FROM SEVEN MENTIONS IN 2004, ONE MENTION IN 2008.
HOW CAN THERE BE AN ENTIRE SECTION ON FAITH WHEN YOU DON'T MENTION FOX?
THANK GOD FOX NEWS IS ON IT, PUSHING THE BUTTONS, SAYING WHERE IS GOD IN THE PLATFORM.
Jon:  YEAH, YEAH, THANK GOD. FOX IS TRULY DOING GOD'S WORK. GOD'S BUSY WORK. THE KIND OF WORK HE DOESN'T NEED DONE BECAUSE HE'S GOD. NOW YOU TOOK IT UPON YOURSELF ANYWAY, LIKE THE HOUSE SITTER, THAT REARRANGES ALL YOUR ( BLEEP ) WITHOUT TELL YOU.   ( LAUGHTER )  WHICH BRINGS TO US OUR NEW  SEGMENT, "LAST WEEK, THIS WEEK." THIS WEEK, SOME MEMBERS OF THE  HOLLYWOOD ELITE SHOWED UP TO ENDORSE PRESIDENT OBAMA. FOX NEWS NO LIKEY.
DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN MORE TO HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES THAN WHO THEY ENDORSE? SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE DETAILS OF POLICIES. OR DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY LIVED IT?
Jon:  YEAH, EXACTLY. BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT HOLLYWOOD SELECT LAST WEEK AT THE RNC?
I LOVED CLINT FROM BEGINNING TO END.
MANY THOUGHT HE WAS FANTASTIC DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A POLITICIAN.
HE WAS SO CLINT EASTWOOD.
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  YUP, SPOKEN BIKE A WOMAN WHO SPENDS MOST OF HER MORNINGS SITTING NEXT TO TWO  EMPTY CHAIRS. I TRIED TO GAUGE THE LEVEL OF FOX NEWS' AMNESIA-- LOOK, WE ALREADY KNOW FOX COMPLETELY  FORGOT THE BUSH PRESIDENCY EVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS, LIKE, FOUR YEARS AGO. NOW I REALIZE THEY CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED A WEEK AGO. LIKE ERIC BOLLING, WHO HEARD TOUCHING PERSONAL STORIES AT BOTH CONVENTIONS.
THE STORY ABOUT MITT'S FATHER LEAVING A ROSE ON HIS WIFE'S  STAND EVERY SINGLE DAY.
WASN'T THAT SWEET?
AND THAT'S HOW SHE FOUND OUT HE WAS DEAD BECAUSE ONE DAY THE ROSE WASN'T THERE.
SHE KEPT TALKING ABOUT WHAT A TOUGH TIME SHE AND BARACK HAD GROWING UP. THEY COME FROM VERY, VERY NICE SCHOOLING BACKGROUNDS, HIGH SCHOOL, INTO HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, BOTH OF THEM. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW HE HAD TO-- HIS CASTRO RUSTED OUT ON THE BOTTOM. COME ON, BOB. YOU CAN'T SAY HE COMES FROM THE LOWER MIDDLE-- LOWER THAN MIDDLE CLASS. >>CLASS.
Jon:  LOOK I KNOW YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE OBAMAS BUT COULD YOU AT LEAST GIVE A  ( BLEEP ) ABOUT THE CAR?   ( LAUGHTER )  APPARENTLY BETWEEN THE WEEKEND  OF TAMP AND CHARLOTTE, ERIC ERIC BOLLING'S HEART SHRANK THREE SIZES.   (  LAUGHTER  )  MUCH LIKE BRIT HUME'S CRANIUM. LAST WEEK HUME COULDN'T GET ENOUGH DETAILS AND POLICY FIGURES.
A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF WHAT COULD BE CALLED THE RYAN EFFECT, DETAILS OF THE TAX PLAN, DETAILS ABOUT MEDICARE, DETAILS OF ALL THESE ISSUES POINT BY POINT  REBUTTALS TO OBAMA ATTACKS. YOU SENSE HIS KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS WHAT PAUL RYAN HAS BROUGHT TO THIS RACE.
Jon:  YEAH, HOW 'd YOU LIKE POLICY DETAILS AFTER CLINTON'S SPEECH?
IT WAS WORCHGY. HE GOT OFF INTO POLICY DETAILS AT GREAT LENGTH. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW ALONG YOU GET A LITTLE BIT LOST IN ALL THE DETAILS AND IT SEEMS  TO ME ALL THE ARGUMENTS ARE GOING TO FALL AWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T REMEMBER THEM.   ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  BRIT, YOU'D BE AMAZED, YOU'D BE AMAZED-- YOU'D  BE AMAZED AT WHAT PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER.   ( LAUGHTER )  LIKE A WEEK AGO, YOU LOVED POLICY DETAILS.   ( LAUGHTER )  EVEN FOX'S HEAD NEWS GUYS THINKS  WE'RE ALL GOLD FISH. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID LAST NIGHT AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
WE HEARD A LOT OF GOALS TONIGHT, BUT NO SPECIFIC PLANS, NO SPECIFIC PLANS ABOUT HOW HE WOULD GROW THE ECONOMY. NO SPECIFIC PLANS ABOUT HOW HE WOULD PUT 23 MILLION AMERICANS BACK TO WORK. NO SPECIFIC PLANS ABOUT HOW HE WOULD DEAL WITH THE ENTITLEMENTS GLO COGENT ANALYSIS IMMEDIATELY  FOLLOWING OBAMA'S SPEECH. LAST WEEK, AFTER ROMNEY'S SPEECH?
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I WAS GOING THROUGH A LONG CHECKLIST OF WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE SPEECH AND  DIDN'T LIKE BUT IT'S SILLY. TONIGHT PEOPLE ARE ONLY LOOKING AT THE EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES OF THESE BEAUTIFUL FAMILIES AND--  YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY IS GOING TO MATCH ANY OF THIS. SO I'M JUST GOING TO SHUT UP AND WATCH   ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. I THINK FOX NEWS JUST FOUND A GREAT NEW SLOGAN "SHUT UP AND WATCH."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
