JANUARY 31, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE ""DAILY SHOW"." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST-- IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE-- MY GUEST, JONATHAN MACEY, A PROFESSOR AT YALE LAW  SCHOOL, YALE BUSINESS SCHOOL, AND YALE'S PRESCHOOL. VERY BUSY. LAW   ( LAUGHTER )  FIRST I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO  TALK TO YOU ABOUT PANDERING. I MEAN, SURE, IT MAY LOOK EASY, AS EASY AS THE GIANTS WINNING THE SUPER BOWL THIS SUNDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). PANDER, AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. I GOT BOOED IN MY OWN STUDIO. IT CAN BE SURPRISINGLY TRICKY. FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT NOW, NEWT GINGRICH IN FLORIDA IS TRYING TO WIN OVER HISPANIC VOTERES, A  TASK MADE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BY THE FACT BEFORE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT, NEWT GINGRICH SAID  THINGS LIKE THIS.
WE SHOULD REPLACE BILINGUAL EDUCATION WITH IMMERSION IN ENGLISH SO THEY LEARN THE  LANGUAGE OF PROSPERITY, NOT THE LANGUAGE OF LIVING IN A GHETTO. ( BOOING )   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT AT "WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY?"    ( LAUGHTER )  TO BE FAIR, NEWT GINGRICH DIDN'T  KNOW WHEN HE SAID THAT, THAT HE WAS GOING TO NEED HISPANIC PEOPLE TO LIKE HIM.   ( LAUGHTER )  THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOW THAT  GINGRICH IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HE HAS TO GET HELPING VOTERS ON HIS SIDE.
THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THE INTERVIEW IN SPANISH, BUT TODAY  I THINK WE'LL STICK TO ENGLISH.
I CAN LISTEN TO SOME OF YOUR SPANISH IF YOU GO SLOW, BUT I'M TOO TIMID TO RESPOND. I SPEAK PIGEON SPANISH.
Jon:  OH! THAT NOW THANKS A SENSE. NEWT LEARNED SPANISH FROM PIGEONS. NO WONDER HE'S SAYING IT'S THE LANGUAGE OF THE GHETTO. THOSE BIRDSES ARE FILTHY ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
NO, NOT ( SPEAKING SPANISH.
UH, NO, I DIDN'T FOLLOW YOU.   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T FOLLOW YOU. ALL MY SPANISH IS LONG-CARE RELATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT EL HEDGEOS, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? OF COURSE, NEWT'S OUTREACH TO HISPANIC VOTERS HAS COINEDDED WITH THE FLORIDA PRIMARY. YOU HAVE TO GO FOR THE GRAY HAIRS, THE OLD STORIES, THE WRINKLE FACTORIES, THE DEATH ADJACENT.   ( LAUGHTER )  AND MITT ROMNEY IS ALL OVER THEM  LIKE WHILE THE ON MITT ROMNEY.   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )   HE MADE AN APPEARANCE YESTERDAY AT THE VILLAGES, A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY THAT IS SO LARGE, HAS  SO MANY OLD PEOPLE, EVEN FLORIDIANS REFER TO THE VILLAGES AS "THAT PLACE WITH ALL THE OLD  PEOPLE."   ( LAUGHTER )  TRY GETTING A HANDICAPPED PARK  SPACE AT THE VILLAGES.   ( LAUGHTER )  SO WHAT APPROACH DID MITT TAKE  TO PANDER TO THE OLDIES. BINGO? MAHJONG, A PROMISE TO BRING BACK "CAGNEY AND LACY."
WHEN I WAS A BOY, MY MOM AND DAD PUT US IN HIS CAR AND TOOK  US AROUND TO THE NATIONAL PARKS. WE CAME HERE AND SAW CYPRESS GARDENS AND THE OCEANS, WENT WEST AND SAW THE CANYON--  CANYONES, ACTUALLY, RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE LAND IN AMERICA. THERE WAS A-- THERE WAS A SONG THAT CAPTURES THAT FOR ME.
Jon:  IT GOES LIKE THIS--   ( LAUGHTER )   "I LIKE BIG BUTTS YOU'RE THE BROTHER  ♪ THAT'S WHEN A GIRL WALKS IN  WITH AN ITTY-BITTY WAIST  ♪ ♪   ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE )  I'VE BROKEN MY COSSIC BONE. TELL ME, TELL ME, MITT ROMNEY IS NOT ABOUT TO WOO ELDERLY VOTERS WITH THE POWER OF SONG.
YOU CAN SING THAT SONG? I LOVE THAT SONG. DO YOU KNOW THAT SONG  ♪ OH, BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES  FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN  ♪ ♪.
Jon:  OKAY, NOW, JUST FOR WIDOWS! OKAY!   ( APPLAUSE )  THE DIABETICS!   ( APPLAUSE )  ANYBODY ON A JAZZY.   ( APPLAUSE )  ALL RIGHT. YOU SANG A VERSE OF "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL." VERY NICE. NOW IF WE CAN MOVE ON.
THERE'S ANOTHER VERSE. I WON'T MAKE YOU SING IT BECAUSE YOU WON'T ALL KNOW THE WORDS    ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP NO ONE KNOWS THE WORDS IS THAT NO ONE EVER  CERTIFICATES THEIR AUDIENCES TO TWO VERSES OF THAT SONG.   (  LAUGHTER  )  WAS HE STALLING FOR TIME SO A  PICK POCKET COULD WORK THE CROWD? WRAP IT UP, MAN.
WOW, THANK YOU. GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. WOW. IMPRESSIVE. AND ONE MORE VERSE THAT'S NOT AS FAMILIAR TO SOME.   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  IT WAS THEN THAT EVERYONE IN THE CROWD AT THE VILLAGES PRESSED THEIR LIFE  ALERT BUTTON AT THE SAME TIME. AND FAKED A STROKE.   (  LAUGHTER  )     ( APPLAUSE )  HE'S SINGING AND I CAN'T GET OUT! BUT HERE'S THE WORST PART. HERE'S THE WORST PART ABOUT ALL THIS PANDERING FOR BOTH-- THE SPEAKING SPANISH, THE SINGING. ONCE YOU BECOME PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT. EXHIBIT A., WHILE NEWT AND MITT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BARACK OBAMA WAS CONDUCTING A VIRTUAL  TOWN HALL ON GOOGLE PLUS-- YES, GOOGLE PLUS. OR AS ALL GMAIL USERS KNOW IT, WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) IS THAT THING UP THERE? IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN TURN THAT OFF? ACTUALLY, I GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT FOR DOING A WEBCAST. A RISKY MOVE GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ONE OF THOSE WINDOWS WILL POP UP WITH A  SHIRTINGLY JOE BIDEN. "HEY, WHO'S READY TO PARTY, HUH, HUH?"   ( LAUGHTER )  DURING THE CHAT, THE PRESIDENT  WAS IN FULL-ON CAMPAIGN MODE WITH A WARM GREETING FOR EVERY QUESTIONER.
I'M FROM FORT WORTH TEXAS AND I HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU CAN'T BEAT DAUGHTERS.   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN'T-- THAT THEY CAN'T BEAT DAUGHTERS? THAT SEEMS ODD THAT YOU FEEL COMPELLED-- I HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS. "WELL, YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM. YOU JUST CAN'T." THE CHAT MOSTLY BOILED DOWN TO, "SO, MR. PRESIDENT, HELP ME." SOMETIMES ON A SURPRISINGLY MICROLEVEL.
MY HUSBAND HAS AN ENGINEERING DEGREE WITH OVER 10 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, AND HE WAS LAID OFF  THREE YEARS AGO AND HAS YET TO FIND A PERMANENT JOB IN HIS FIELD.
IF YOU SEND ME YOUR HUSBAND'S RESUME, I'D BE INTERESTED IN  FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT THERE.   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU'RE TAKING RESUMES? DON'T YOU HAVE ( BLEEP ) TO DO. AREN'T THERE OTHER THINGS TO YOUR PLATE. MR. PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIANS ARE ABOUT TO LAUNCHIMISMS. "DID YOU KNOW CARL WAS PROFICIENT IN XCEL.
IT SUMMED UP WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT FROM THEIR PRESIDENT, HOW MUCH. IT WAS WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THAT.
YOU JUST SPOKE OF LAWS. I I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD STAND UP AND GIVE US A LITTLE JIG REAL QUICK.
NO DANCING.
Jon:  THE PRESIDENT JUST OFFERED TO FIND YOUR HUSBAND A JOB.   ( LAUGHTER )  HE SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU SEND ME  THE RESUME." HE'S SERVING AS THE MONSTER.COM-IN-CHIEF.   (  LAUGHTER  )  AND I BELIEVE YOUR RESPONSE  SHOULD BE, "THAT IS ( BLEEP ) AWESOME, THANK YOU."  NOT, "OH, WHILE WE'RE HERE..." ( BLEEP )    ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )  UNBELIEVABLE. SINCE YOU WON'T DO IT, I KNOW A GOLDEN-VOICED MORMON WHO WILL. WE'LL B
