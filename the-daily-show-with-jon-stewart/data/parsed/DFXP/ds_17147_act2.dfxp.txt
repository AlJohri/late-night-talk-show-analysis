[LAUGHTER]
WE'RE HEAR AT NORTH CAROLINA I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT'S ONE OF  THE COUNTRY -- SOUTH CAROLINA. I SEE WHY JAMES TAYLOR SPENT SO MUCH TIME HERE. MORE FROM THE DNC CITY [BLEEP] TO BE AT THE CONVENTION CENTER MAGICAL ON THE SCENE AND JOHN OLIVER DOWNTOWN WHICH FOR SOME  REASON HE SHOWED UP NOW WHICH I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE -- EXCUSE ME. [LAUGHTER]
JESSICA. YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED INTO THE HALL OF FAME. IS THAT WHY THE DEMOCRATS CHOSE CHARLOTTE GIVES THEM A NOD TO THE WHITE MALE VOTER. HEY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU TOO, IS THAT SYMBOLISM, IS THAT FAIR TO SAY.
NO, NOT REALLY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT'S MORE THAT NASCAR IS A METAPHOR FOR THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, OKAY. JUST RIDING AROUND AND AROUND IN CIRCLES COVERED WITH THE LOGOS OF COMPANIES THAT OWN THEM. AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE THINKING OF THEM SAYS, WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE, RIGHT. WE'VE BEEN IN THIS CAR FOR THREE HOURS. NEVER QUITE REALIZING EVERYONE ELSE IS HERE WAITING FOR THEM TO FLAME OUT IN A GIANT WRECK. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT --
NO.
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE AT THE CONVENTION CENTER.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. CHARLOTTE, FUN FACTS, SOME OF THE NAMES HERE AT THE CONVENTION CENTER.
THAT'S A GREAT CHOICE. CHARLOTTE IS A VIBRANT CITY, IT'S GREAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
YES, THAT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND THE HUNGER GAMES. NOT AT ALL THAT THOSE ARE GLEAMING FACADES MASK BRIDGE -- GRIM POST APOCALYPTIC IN A LAND  VOID OF HOPE.DEE JON.
Jon:  AL, YOU'RE AT A LOCAL BARBECUE JOINT. I'M ASSUMING THAT SYMBOLIZES THE SMOKING RUINS OF AMERICA'S ECONOMY.
NO, I WAS PASSING BY AND IT SMELLED SO GOOD. I HAD TO STOP BECAUSE NOBODY DOES BARBECUE LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon:  REALLY THAT GOOD.
IT'S AMAZING. I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW THAT NORTH CAROLINA HAS SERVED A [BLEEP] I ORDERED A BISCUIT AND IT CAME  INSIDE --  [LAUGHTER] IT'S A PRODUCTIVE BISCUIT.
Jon:  THANK JOHN OLIVER. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN NORTH CAROLINA.
A FEW OF THEM [BLEEP] YES, THAT'S A FACT. YES THAT'S A FACT. BARBECUE, NO BARBECUE.
Jon:  WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO CALM THE CROWD. YOU'RE OUTSIDE.
IT'S JUST WEIRD, THAT'S ALL.
I CAN HEAR THESE THROUGH THE WALL. THE POINT IS JON, WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR I NEED TO SAY IT'S A  MODERN PROGRESSIVE WHERE NONE OF THE STEREOTYPES OF THE OLD SOUTH APPLY. A STREET IN THE SOUTH -- THAT STARTED OF COURSE --
Jon:  I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT GOT IT MOVING.
I'M PRETTY IT IS JON. IT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY GAY STREET TO ME.
Jon:  I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THAT STREET IS NAMED AFTER  STONEWALL JACKSON, THE CIVIL WAR GENERAL.
YES, GENERAL ON THE UNION SIDE.
Jon:  NO.
OH JESUS, I'LL GO GET MY  [BLEEP]
WHICH IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO THE AIRPORT.
Jon:  OH, THAT WOULD BE BILLY GRAHAM PARKWAY [BLEEP]
OF COURSE. [APPLAUSE]
