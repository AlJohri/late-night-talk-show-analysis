[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS RICK PERRY V MITT ROMNEY AS YOU KNOW WHEN  THERE IS CONFLICT, THERE IS A WINNER AND A LOSER.
THE REAL HEADLINE TONIGHT IS ROMNEY LIVES BECAUSE -- BECAUSE PERRY FAILED.
INTELLECTUALLY MITT ROMNEY GOT THE BETTER OF HIM.
ROMNEY WAS MORE STATESMAN LIKE.
RICK PERRY IS ASKING FOR TROUBLE WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY THE WAY HE DID.
BY EMBRACING THE PONZI IDEA HE DESTROYED HIS CANDIDACY.
CALLING SOCIAL SECURITY A PONZI SCHEME USING OTHER WORDS. I THINK THAT'S THE LEAD IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TOMORROW, I WOULD BET.
Jon: OH, "THE NEW YORK TIMES". MY GUEST IS RICK PERRY WILL BE SERIOUS WILL THEIR -- FURIOUS WITH THEIR EDITORIAL BOARD AS HE  PER RUSES IT OVER --  [ LAUGHTER ] HE DESTROYED HIS CANDIDACY IN THE PONZI SCHEME COMMENT AND THE PART WHERE HE SAYS SOCIAL  SECURITY IS BROKEN AND MUST BE FIXED EVEN THOUGH MOST PEOPLE VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY  AGREE WITH HIM. THIS IS NOT A RACE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF PUBDITYTOWN. MEDIA YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS WITH THE WRONG PART OF YOUR BRAIN, THE BRAIN PART. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WERE SURE THAT PERRY MADE A DEVASTATING CONCEPTUAL ERROR AND THE AUDIENCE WOULD REBUKE HIM  FOR HIS GAFFE. REAGAN LIBRARY AIN'T A READING LIBRARY.
A QUESTION ABOUT TEXAS, YOUR STATE HAS EXECUTED 234 DEATH ROW INMATES MORE THAN ANY OTHER  GOVERNOR IN MODERN TIMES. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: THE BIGGEST APPLAUSE LINE OF THE NIGHT WAS THE MERE MENTION THAT RICK PERRY HAD  EXECUTED 234 PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] HOLY (bleep) BALL! BY THE WAY, LIKE SOME OF THEM MAY BE INNOCENT BUT LOOK AT THE CROWD. THEY ARE NOT YAHOOS. THIS IS NOT YOUR TORTURED PITCH FORK ANGRY -- THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH FIRM OPINIONS ON WHICH IS  THE BEST BRAND OF RIDING MOWER. THE AUDIENCE OF THIS DEBATE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE OUT RAISINS ON HALLOWEEN. THEY OWN THE BLIND SIDE ON DVD AND YET -- WILLIAMS DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO OF THIS?
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS DYNAMIC THAT JUST HAPPENED HERE? THE MENTION OF EXECUTIONS OF 234 PEOPLE DRAW APPLAUSE.
IN TEXAS OUR PEOPLE MADE IT CLEAR. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO COMMIT THOSE CRIMES AGAINST OUR CITIZENS AND IF YOU DO, YOU WILL  FACE THE ULTIMATE JUSTICE.
Jon: I'M FROM JERSEY, WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE KILLING US EITHER. WE DON'T KILL EVERYBODY WHO MIGHT. I HAVE THE WORDS ULTIMATE AND JUSTICE TATTOOED ACROSS MY KNUCKLES. SURE I HAD TO DOUBLE UP ON SOME OF THE LETTERS BECAUSE THE NUMBER TOLL LETTER RATIO IT  DOESN'T -- BECAUSE THE KNUCKLE TO LETTER RATIO DOESN'T WORK OUT PERFECT. I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THAT JUSTICE IS SPELLED 100% CORRECT BUT I STAND BY THE SENTIMENT. RAV LAUGH A SOPHISTICATED AND PRESIDENTIAL ROMNEY HAS NO IDEA HOW TO CONNECT WITH THESE PEOPLE. IN THE TEA PARTY. I BELIEVE IN A LOT OF WHAT THE TEA PARTY BELIEVES IN. I PUT TOGETHER A PLAN OF HOW TO GET THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN. TEA PARTY PEOPLE LIKE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NOW, HERE IS PERRY.
I HATE CANCER.
Jon: OH, (bleep). I HATE CANCER, ROMNEY YOU JUST GOT RICK ROLLED (bleep). THERE YOU HAVE IT. THIS IS WHY THIS MAN IS FORMIDABLE. REPUBLICANS HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN A GUY WITH A MULTIPOINT FACT BASED PLAN THAT HE THINKS  CAN GET THE ECONOMY GOING OR A GUY THAT CAN PUNCH (bleep) IN THE FACE. YOU ARE UP AGAINST SOMETHING YOU ARE TOO SMART TO UNDERSTAND. LET ME BREAK IT DOWN SO YOU CAN GUT IT. HE ACTIVATES A NEURO IND CRIN REACTION AS A HOT WAVE OF IMPULSES STIMULATING THE LIMB  LIMBLYMBIC SYSTEM. YOU DON'T GET RICK PERRY HERE. YOU GET HIM HERE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MITT ROMNEY --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO DO THAT MORE OFTEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S QUITE PLEASANT. [ LAUGHTER ] MITT ROMNEY IS RALPH LAUREN, RICK PERRY IS THE PHEROMONE OF THE SRI LANKAN TIGER SEEM YEN. GET READY DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THAT IS THE HOMBRE YOU ARE UP AGAINST.
I THINK THE DNC SHOULD TAKE THE SOCIAL SECURITY LINE OF MR. PERRY AND ATTACK ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE PONZI SCHEME AND PUT OUT BUMPER STICKERS  SAYING IT'S NOT OBAMA IT'S ABOUT YOUR MAMA AND WE'LL WIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT? WE CONCLUDE OUR SECOND INST
