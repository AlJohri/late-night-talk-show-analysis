JANUARY 11, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWARTMENT WE  HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, UNITED STATES SENATOR JIM DeMINT, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK "NOW OR NEVER."  I'M GOING TO GET HE FALLS ON THE NOW SIDE. TOMORROW NIGHT OUR GUEST WILL BE THE INTERNET. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE ALL, WHAT? THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY ABOUT THAT. I HAVE SOME READING TO CATCH UP ON. BUT WILL BEGIN TONIGHT WITH YOUR RESULTS OF LAST NIGHT'S VOTING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN INDECISION 2012. WITH 100% OF THE VOTES COUNTED, THE MAN OF THE NIGHT ONE MILLARD MITTINGTON ROMNEY, WHO CAPTURED NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH 39% OF THE VOTE. IT WAS AN HISTORIC WIN FOR ROMNEY. HE BECAME THE FIRST REPUBLICAN NON-INCUMBENT TO WIN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WHILE STILL HAVING  NO ONE LIKE HIM. [LAUGHTER] ROMNEY WAS INTRODUCED BY HIS WIFE ANN, WHO STILL HAS YET TO ENDORSE A CANDIDATE. AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WHAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME IS SOME TYPE OF OSMOND TRIBUTE BAND. [LAUGHTER] I GOT TWO WORDS FOR THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN: BACHELOR AUCTION. MEOW. I'M SORRY. TO THE VICTORY SPEECH.
WE DO REMEMBER WHEN BARACK OBAMA CAME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE FOUR YEARS AGO. HE PROMISED TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. HE PROMISED TO CHANGE THE BROKEN SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON. HE PROMISED TO IMPROVE OUR NATION. THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF LOFTY PROMISES MADE BY A HOPEFUL CANDIDATE.
Jon: YEAH, WHAT A JERK THAT OBAMA WAS. [LAUGHTER] I'M GOING TO DO THIS AND I'M GOING TO DO THAT. [BLEEPED] EMPTY SUIT STANDING ON A PLATFORM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE MAKING LOFTY PROMISES HE KNEW HE  COULDN'T POSSIBLY FULFILL I'M SORRY, MITT. I INTERRUNNINGED YOU. CONTINUE.
I WILL CUT, CAP AND BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET. LY MAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIMPLER, SMALLER AND SMARTER. I WILL INSIST ON A MILITARY SO POWERFUL NO ONE WOULD EVER THINK OF CHALLENGING IT.
Jon: SEE, PEOPLE, MY PROMISES ARE REALISTIC. A TINY GOVERNMENT, A BALANCED BUDGET AND A GIANT INVINCIBLE ARMY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU NEW SPARTA. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] IT'S LIKE OLD SPARTA, VERY SIMILAR. IT'S LIKE OLD SMART THAT BUT WITH LESS CAPITAL GAINS TAXES AND NOT AS GAY. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. WITH MITT ROMNEY'S VICTORY IN THE BAG, THE ONLY QUESTION THAT REMAINED LAST NIGHT, WHO WOULD  BE FIRST PUNDIT TO DISMISS RON PAUL'S SECOND-PLACE FINISH.
NBC NEWS CAN NOW PROJECT THAT RON PAUL WILL FINISH SECOND.
IF YOU TAKE RON PAUL OUT OF THIS, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HUNTSMAN?
HUNTSMAN IS THE REAL SECOND HERE. JON JON NO. YOU CAN'T... YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO JUST TAKE RON PAUL OUT OF IT. THAT'S JUST PHYSICS. YOU'RE NOT... AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU ADD TWO ZEROS TO THE END OF  HUNTSMAN'S TOTAL, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN FIRST BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTES, AN  UNPRECEDENTED VERY TRY. WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! [LAUGHTER] SINCE WE BROUGHT UP JON HUNTSMAN , SEEING AS I BELIEVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO IS A  LIMITED-TIME OFFER. NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS HUNTSMAN'S BIG GAMBLE. HE SKIPPED IOWA TO CONCENTRATE ALL HIS EFFORTS ON WINNING THERE. HE PROVED THERE FOR A YEAR. AND FINISHED A DISTANT THIRD.
WE GOT IT DONE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I SAY THIRD PLACE IS A TICKET TO RIDE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: A TICKET TO RIDE... HOME. IN COACH. LOOK HOW HUNTSMAN ENDS HIS SPEECH.
THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH.
Jon: THERE'S NO CONFETTI FOR THIRD PLACE. THIRD PLACE DOESN'T GET CONFETTI. THE ONLY CONFETTI IS THIRD PLACE CAN GET IS, "I CAN'T BELIEVE I  MOVED HERE FOR A YEAR AND I LOST." I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THAT INTO  SMALLER PIECES AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED MORE LIKE CONFETTI, BUT OBVIOUSLY MY HAND SPEED IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. ARTHRITIS AND MAYBE GOOD... HOW'S A GUY SPEND A YEAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NOT CONNECT WITH  THE GONE ET STATE'S SALT OF THE EARTH, BEDROCK, AMERICAN LOVING YANKEE, JUST ROLL THE TAPE.
AS THEY WOULD SAY IN CHINA, MITT... [SPEAKING MANDARIN] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OH, RIGHT, HE SPEAKS MANDARIN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S NOT IMPRESSIVE TO A REPUBLICAN  PRIMARY AUDIENCE WHO WON'T EVEN EAT MANDARIN ON, BECAUSE THEY  DON'T WANT TO TAKE JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICAN FRUIT. YOU KNOW WHAT, HUNTSMAN, MEET ME AT CAMERA YOU CAME IN THIRD. LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU, BUT IT'S OVER. YOU'RE SMART MAN. YOU HAD A GOOD RUN AS A GUY PUNDITS COULDN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE  DON'T LIKE ME, BUT THEY DON'T. YOU HAVE A GREAT LIFE, A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, BUT IT'S TIME TO PUT THE CONFETTI INTO STORAGE. YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS ISN'T GETTING THROUGH. LET ME PUT THIS IN TERMS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. GNAW PUO. LOON ZIE HWAH. TYE LOO SURE DEE ARE TSI. [LAUGHTER] WOAH GAY NEE.
