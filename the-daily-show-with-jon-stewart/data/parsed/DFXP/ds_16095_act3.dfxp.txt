(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR WHOSE NEW FILM IS THE SMUFERS.
OKAY, TO REVIEW. YOU GUYS COME FROM A MAGIC FOURs WHERE YOU LIVE IN OVERSIZED MUSHROOMS, YOU'RE  BEING CHASED BY AN EVIL WIZARD AND TRAPPED IN NEW YORK UNTIL THERE IS A BLUE  MOON AND YOU LIKE TO USE THE EXTREMELY IMPRECISE TERM SMURF FOR ABOUT EVERYTHING.
SMURF-ACTLY AND.
AND YOU'RE ALL NAMED AFTER YOUR PERSONALITIES, DOW NAME THEN WHEN YOU ARE BORN OR AFTER YOU EXHIBIT CERTAIN TRAITS.
YEAH.
JUST WHAT IS THIS MAGIC SEARCHING DEVICE.
I'M USING GOOGLE.
OOOH.
WHAT THE SMURF. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME. NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS NICE!
Jon: THEY'RE VERY EXCITED. NICE GROUP OF PEOPLE.
NICE GROUP OF PEOPLE. LOVELY.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
YES, SIR.
Jon: I LOOK AT THE TRAILER T SAYS THIS FILL SOME CURRENTLY UNRATED.
YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
YES, IT IS. IT'S THE BLUE VERSION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DON'T EVEN TRY.
I'M SO SORRY.
Jon: WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO TAKE OUT. CAN'T THEY JUST SLAP THE G ON IT OR PG OR ARE THERE CERTAIN THINGS IN IT WHERE  THEY ARE LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THE-- MY CHARACTER [BLEEP] SMURF.
Jon: NOT YOU, THE TWO SMURFS, THE TWO SMURFS. THE TWO SMURFS.
YOU THOUGHT HIS NAME WAS GROUCHY BEFORE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU TOOK IT TO A PLACE OF DEGRADATION I DIDN'T EVEN DREAM OF. LITERALLY THINKING OF SMURFETTES AND-- FOR GOD'S SAKES. FIRST OF ALL-- HOW ARE YOU? YOU'RE A BUSY, BUSY MAN. YOU'VE GOT 8 MILLION THINGS GOING ON, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU JUGGLE IT. I SAW YOU IN COMPANY.
COMPANY, YES, I DID COMPANY. YOU PERFORMED AT LINCOLN CENTER WITH STEPHEN COLBERT.
INDEED. HE WAS IN IT AS WELL. HE SANG A SONG. HE HAD A SCENE WORK. HE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD AT THE MUSICAL THEATRE.
Jon: YOU KNOW HE IS A MULTITALENTED INDIVIDUAL.
AND HE'S ALSO KNOWS CIRCUS TRICKS.
Jon: HE KNOWS ONE CIRCUS TRICK. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE SPIN MOVE.
THE SPIN MOVE.
Jon: AND HE IS AT THE PARAMETERS OF HIS ABILITY TO DO THE ONE SPIN MOVE CIRCUS TRICK. TWO MORE YEARS HE THROWS OUT A HIP. THERE'S NO WAY.
I DON'T KNOW. HE PRIDES HIMSELF. HE SAID COY CARRY A LOT OF WEIGHT. AND SO TWO OF US JUMPED ON AND JUMPED ON AND HOLDING US BOTH HE SPINS IN A CIRCLE. RIGHT THERE.
Jon: I TRIED THAT ONCE. WITH HIM?
WITH HIM.
Jon: JUMPED ON. WITH ANOTHER FRIEND, VOMITED ABOUT 30 SECONDS. FOR ME, THAT'S LIKE RIDING WITH THE BLUE ANGELS. THAT'S LIKE I'M NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN. YOU GOT TO DO IT ONCE.
I HAVE TO SAY SINCERELY I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY HIM. I MEANS THAT'S A PRETTY BOLD MOVE TO GO AND PERFORM AT LINCOLN CENTER SINGING, YOU  KNOW, SONDHEIM IN FRONT OF 3,000 PEOPLE. AND THAT'S SORT OF OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE AND HE WAS JUST REALLY GREAT AT IT.
Jon: I ACTUALLY WENT AND SAW IT LIVE. IT WAS TREMENDOUS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED ALL OF YOU GUYS BUT I WAS STUNNED THAT YOU  HAD-- I HEARD YOU HAD LIKE TWO WEEKENDS TO WORK ON IT. THEY PUT ON A FULL PRODUCTION OF COMPANY, LIKE AN 18 HOUR PLAY --
IT'S NOT.
Jon: AND YOU LEARNED THE SINGING AND THE DANCING WAS EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU EVEN  HAD THE TIME TO PUT IT TOGETHER.
ONCE A YEAR THEY LIKE TO DO A SEMI STAGED CONCERT VERSION OF A SHOW AS A GALA. AND THIS WAS FRAR FROM SEMI STAGED. I THINK THEY SAID THAT JUST TO GET US ALL TO SIGN UP. AND THEN WE DID IT AND IT WAS JUST A LOT OF WORK. KIND OF A-- A LOT OF WORK BECAUSE WE ALL WERE PROMISED WE COULD REHEARSE INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN WE  WOULD ALL COME TOGETHER AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH JUST SORT OF MAGICALLY COME  TOGETHER WHICH IT SORT OF IT.
Jon: THEY WOULD PHOTO SHOP YOU TOGETHER ON TO THE PAGE.
IT WAS PRACTICALLY THAT. THE FIRST TIME WE DID A FULL RUN THROUGH FROM START TO FINISH WITH EVERYONE  TOGETHER WAS THE OPENING NIGHT ON THURSDAY. WE DID THE DRESS REHEARSAL BEFORE AND HAD TO STOP LIKE 15 MINUTES TO THE END OF THE  SHOW BECAUSE THE ORCHESTRA WAS DONE AND HAD TO SPLIT.
Jon: WAIT S THAT ALLOWED. THEY CAN JUST BE LIKE --
THEY HAVE ONE TOUGH UNION, THE UNION GUY THEY COME OUT. THE GUY GOES TAP, TAP, TAP, THAT'S IT AND THEY'RE OUT. THEY'RE DONE.
Jon: THE UNION GUY WITH AN ORCHESTRA WALKS OUT AND IS LIKE BASSOONS DOWN, EVERYBODY. DROP YOUR BOWS, DROP YOUR BOWS, YOU'RE DONE.
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
Jon: THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT I COULD GIVE SOMEONE WHO PERFORMS MUSICAL  THEATRE FROM LINCOLN CENTER, THIS IS FROM MY MOTHER WHO HAS SEEN EVERY PRODUCTION SINCE GEORGE KAUFMAN WHO  SAID, THEY WERE MARVELOUS. SHE EVEN SMOKED FOR YEARS JUST TO BE ABLE TO SOUND LIKE THAT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TELL THEM, MARVELOUS.
THAN AS IF PARTICULAR THAT YOUR MOTHER IS A DRAG QUEEN. I'M SO HAPPY FOR THAT. YOUR MOTHER IS HARVEY FIRESTEIN, THAT'S AMAZING.
Jon: THERE REALLY IS VERY LITTLE ROOM BETWEEN OLD JEWISH GRANDMOTHER AND HARVEY  FIRESTEIN, AT A CERTAIN POINT THEY ALL MELD TOGETHER.
YES.
Jon: EVERYTHING ELSE GOOD WITH YOU. THE KIDS ARE GOOD WHAT IS THE AGE.
KIDS ARE 9 MONTHS OLD. THEY'RE SLEEPING LIKE THEY ARE STARTING TO CRAWL BUT SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT, THEY SLEEP 13 HOURS A NIGHT. HERE'S THE TRICK. A STAPLE GUN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING ONCE THEY REALIZE THERE IS NO MOBILITY THEY GIVE UP AND GO  TO SLEEP.
THAT'S IT THEY TRY, THEY REALIZE THEY'RE PINNED AT THE EARS, FINGERS AND TOES  AND THEY SLEEP.
Jon: YOU'RE CERTAINLY A ROLE MODEL FOR ALL OF US. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PARENTING ADVICE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND IT REALLY IS, IT'S MARVELOUS. SMURFS IS IN THE THEATRE ON FRIDAY. NEIL PATRICK HARRIS! (CHEER
