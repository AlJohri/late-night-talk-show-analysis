Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO FOLLOW THEIR DAILY HOROSCOPE, I'VE GOT SOME  BAD NEWS. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN GETTING BOGUS ADVICE. THE ZODIAC CALENDAR HAS CHANGED. THAT MEANS ONE THING. IT'S TIME FOR EVERY MORNING SHOW TO USE THE EXACT SAME INTRO SONG.
THOUGHT YOU WERE A LIBRA ♪ THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE... ♪♪
IS YOUR SIGN CHANGING ♪ THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF ♪♪
AQUARIUS.
Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WAS TOTAL... I'M SORRY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THESE SHOWS COULD COME UP WITH ANOTHER SONG ABOUT HOROSCOPES  TO USE LIKE... LET'S BE A LIBRA TONIGHT. I'M TOO VIRGO FOR THIS SHOW. ALL RIGHT. I'M REALIZING WHY THEY ALL WENT WITH IT. THIS LATEST NEAR OWE COMES COURTESY OF AN ASTRONOMER FROM THE MINNESOTA PLANETARIUM  SOCIETY SEEN HERE HOLDING A TINY UNIVERSE THAT HE IS THE GOD OF. YES, I AM YOUR LORD. WHAT DID HIS RESEARCH FIND?
ASTRONOMERS RECALCULATED THE DATES TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EARTH'S POSITION IN  RELATION TO THE SUN. THERE ARE NOW 13 SIGNS. SCIENTISTS HAVE RESTORED THE SIGN FROM THE ANCIENTS. THEY HAD IT BEFORE BECAUSE THEY DROP BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER WANTED 13 SIGNS. THEY DECIDED TWICE WAS BEST.
Jon: (BEEP) ANCIENTS TO DECIDE TO DROP THE NUMBER 13. I GUESS THAT IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE THAT OTIS USES IN NUMBERING FLOORS IN ELEVATORS. GUESS WHAT THOUGH. IT'S STILL THERE. FOR MORE ON THIS WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR ZODIAC ANALYST MR. JASON JONES. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  JASON, SO THEY'VE DECIDED NOW  THERE WAS 13 SIGNS INSTEAD OF 12. DOES THIS MATTER? A CHANGE IN THE ZODIAC?
YES. NO. I DON'T KNOW, JON. I HONESTLY, CAN I BE HONEST? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE.
Jon: COME ON. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
Jon: JASON, YOUR LIFE IS GREAT. YOU'RE ON TELEVISION. YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. A LOVING WIFE.
YES, YES, THE WRONG LOVING WIFE. I THOUGHT I WAS MARRYING A PICES. NOW WHO KNOWS WHAT (BEEP) SHE IS.
Jon: I'M ASSUMING YOU MARRIED HER OUT OF LOVE.
NO! NO, I MARRIED HER BECAUSE SHE AND I WERE COMPATIBLE. OH, GOD. OH, MY GOD. WHAT IF SHE TURNS OUT TO BE A SAGITTARIUS. THEY'RE WHORES, JON. ALL OF THEM.
Jon: I'M A SAGITTARIUS. I DON'T THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS WHOLE AS TROLL GEE THING IS FAKE.
Jon: NO. YES.
FOR SOME OF US IT IS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF OUR IDENTITY. NOW IT'S RUINED. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS. WHERE... WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS? LOOK AT THIS, JON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S NOT COMING OFF.
Jon: I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET THAT IMAGERY MOVED BY LASER FROM MY BRAIN. WHAT IS THAT THING?
IT IS A ROARING LION. IT USED TO BE AWESOME AND SEXY WHEN I WAS A LEO. BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M A CANCER. NOW JUST WHAT'S WEIRD. BUT SYMBOLISM.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. HOW, HOW, HOW?
I'LL TELL YOU. I'M NOT GETTING THE WORST OF IT HERE, OKAY. IT COULD BE WORSE. IBSD BE THE ZODIAC KILLER. I MEAN, HE KILLED ALL THE WRONG PEOPLE. I MEAN, THAT GUY HAS EGG ALL OVER HIS FACE.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JASON JONES, EVERYBODY.
