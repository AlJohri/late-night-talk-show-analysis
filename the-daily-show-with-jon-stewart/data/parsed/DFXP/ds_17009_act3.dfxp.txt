WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE MAN BEHIND SESAME STREET'S ELMOW. HIS EARLY LIFE AND HIS CAREER IN A CHRONICLE IN A NEW DOCUMENTARY BEING ELMO, A PUPPETEERS JOURNEY.
MY MOM HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF KIDS SHE WAS BABY-SITTING. I WOULD SET UP A PUPPET STAGE IN THE BACKYARD AND THE KIDS AND MY MOM WOULD WATCH AND THE  KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD COME AND WATCH THE SHOW. THIS IS WHERE WE KEPT... MY MOM WOULD PUT THE CLOTHES LINE AT. THAT WAS WHERE I HAD MY FIRST PUPPET SHOW. I WOULD THROW A BLANKET OVER THIS AND THE KIDS WOULD COME OUT HERE AND WATCH ME DO THE SHOW. I STARTED DOING LIVE SHOWS AROUND THE BALTIMORE AREA.
Jon: I PLAYED THAT GIG. THAT'S A GOOD GIG. PLEASE WELCOME KEVIN CLASH. ( APPLAUSE ) HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
GOOD TO SEE YOU AFTER SO MANY YEARS.
Jon: AFTER MANY MANY YEARS. YOU AND I, OF COURSE, OLD PALS FROM ELMOPALOOZA FROM....
HANGING OUT WITH DAVID ALLEN GREER.
Jon: CHRIS ROCK.
A LOT OF MODELS WORKING ON THAT TOO.
Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT....
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.
Jon: THAT WAS A JOKE? MOSTLY HAND MODELS. MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT WHOLE SHOOT WAS IN BETWEEN TAKES THE PUPPETEERS OF SESAME STREET, VERY TALENTED PEOPLE BUT THEY DON'T TAKE THE PUPPET OFF.
THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH EACH OTHER.
Jon: ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE THIS. OH, MY GOD. WHAT JUST HAPPENED? IT STAYS ON YOUR HAND.
YEAH. THAT'S HOW YOU CREATE, MAKE A THREE KMENGSAL, YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF ONE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS WE PLAY AROUND WITH EACH OTHER. THAT GETS US MORE....
Jon: IS IT THAT EASY.
TO MAKE THEM LAUGH IS IT THAT EASY.
Jon: IT REALLY IS THAT EASY. YOU KNEW ALL ALONG YOU WANTED TO GET....
YEAH TEN YEARS OLD, YEAH I WENT BACK AND FORTH DRAWING AND THEN, YOU KNOW, DOING THE  PUPPETS AND EVERYTHING.
Jon: BUT GETTING TO MEET JIM HENSON AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
WELL I HAD GREAT MENTORS STARTING WITH STU KERR IN BALTIMORE. HE WAS A WEATHERMAN AND SAW ME AT A SHOW. HE ASKED MY MOM AND DAD COULD I AUDITION FOR HIM. THROUGH HIM I MET BOB BECAUSE HE WAS A PAGE WITH BOB UP HERE IN NEW YORK. AND THEN BOB ASKED HIM TO WORK ON "CAPTAIN KANGAROO" A LITTLE BIT. SO HE TOLD BOB ABOUT ME. THEN AT THE SAME TIME I WAS WATCHING SESAME STREET. THERE WAS ACTUALLY A SHOW ON PBS CALLED CARL A MACARONI. THAT'S WHERE I SAW KERMIT LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
Jon: AND KERMIT LOVE.
HE DESIGNED BIG BIRD AND OTHERS.
Jon: THESE GUYS JUST RECOGNIZED IN YOU AN ABILITY RIGHT AWAY.
TALENT.
Jon: (LAUGHING).
BIG TALENT.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: TALENT. THEY RECOGNIZED YOUR TALENT. THEY ALL LIKE AT EACH TURN THEY'RE LIKE THEY MEET YOU AND GO, OKAY, SURE, COME WORK FOR ME. EVERY SICKLE GUY.
KERMIT HAD THE CONVERSATION ABOUT COLLEGE. SHOULD I GO IN AND EVERYTHING AND HE LEFT IT UP TO ME AND MY MOM AND DAD. WE DECIDED, YOU KNOW, I WOULD JUST GO RIGHT INTO IT. MY DAUGHTER IS IN COLLEGE NOW.
Jon: SO WHEN SHE WAS DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO PURSUE HER DREAM AND NOT GO TO  COLLEGE AND YOU SAID....
YOU BETTER GO.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED. WHAT IS IT NOW? YOU HAVE ELMO AND YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER. WAS IT HARD NOT TO USE ELMO AT HOME ON HER?
OH, WHAT? YES,. YES, NO, YES. WHAT WAS REALLY COOL IS, NO, SHE REALLY LOVED THE CHARACTER. THERE WAS NO ANIMOSITY OR ANYTHING. BUT AT THREE-AND-A-HALF... WHAT IS GOING ON?
Jon: TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY SHE WOULD HAVE ANIMOSITY.
BUT AT THREE-AND-A-HALF SHE SAID, ELMO, DADDY. WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND THEN SHE WENT OUT OF THAT PHASE. THEN IT WAS LIKE DADDY, HEY, CAN YOU PUT ON ELMO ON THE PHONE? ELMO WOULD SAY HI, SHANNON. AND THEN SHANNON WOULD SAY, ELMO THERE'S A BARBIE DOLL THAT I SAW IN A COMMERCIAL. COULD YOU TELL DADDY ABOUT IT? ELMO WOULD SAY YEAH SURE. PUT DADDY BACK ON AND SHANNON WOULD SAY DADDY ELMO HAS SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.
Jon: (LAUGHING) AND THEN WOULD ELMO GET ON THE PHONE AND JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW.
YOU MUST DO THIS. YOU MUST DO THIS. THE COMMERCIAL SAYS IT WAS MADE IN CHINA. SHE MADE ME TRY TO FLAG DOWN A CAB WITH THAT VOICE. TAXI. ANOTHER THING THAT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL IS I WAS ON A PLANE ONCE. I WAS, YOU KNOW, HIGHLIGHTING MY SCRIPT AND EVERYTHING AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT CAME PAST  AND SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU DO ELMO? WE WERE CLOSE TO GETTING TO TAXI. SO SHE TOOK ME UP TO THE MIKE AND SHE SAID THERE'S A LOT OF KIDS UP THERE. THIS IS ELMO PLEASE BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS AND PUT YOUR TOYS AWAY BECAUSE WE'RE  GETTING READY TO LAND.
Jon: WOW.
BUT WHAT WAS WONDERFUL ABOUT IT IS, YOU KNOW, THEN ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE AISLE  SEATS WERE LOOKING. I CAME OUT AND THEY SAID.
Jon: ARE YOU EVER TEMPTED IN THAT, TO GO THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE IT'S SUFFICIENT SUCH A  CHEERFUL... WERE YOU TEMPTED TO GO ON AND GO, OH, MY GOD, WE'RE (BEEP) DOWN. HEY, KIDS, DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD? YOU'RE GOING TO MEET HIM?
NOW, JON, YOU KNOW I WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB REAL QUICK. JUST AS SOON AS THE PLANE LANDED. GIVE ME THAT PUPPET.
Jon: YOU DON'T REALIZE ELMO WAS A CHARACTER FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. YOU CAME ON AND TURNED IT INTO THIS PHENOMENON.
TALENT, TALENT, TALENT. YES, THE WONDER PUPPETERS, BRIAN NEAL WHO ACTUALLY PUPPET EERS THE CHARACTER FIRST HE WENT ON AND PURSUED HIS ACTING  AND WRITING AND MR. RICHARD HUNT HE WAS ONE OF THE MAIN GUYS WITH JIM HENSON. HE STARTED DOING IT AND DOING THIS CAVE MAN VOICE. AND THE HEAD WRITER OF SESAME STREET SAID WHAT IS HE DOING? AND RICHARD... I WAS IN THE ROOM BY MYSELF THE RICHARD THREW THE PUPPET AT ME. AND SAID COME UP WITH A VOICE. I SAID, HELLO, THIS IS ELMO. HE SAID, OKAY FINE. HE TOOK ME INTO THE PRODUCER OF THE SHOW, LISA SIMON. SHE SAID I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT. HE CAN DO IT. THAT'S HOW I GOT IT. BY DEFAULT.
Jon: AN INSPIRING STORY OF GENIUS AND TALENT. I KNEW IMMEDIATELY.
THE REST IS HISTORY.
Jon: HISTORY. BEING ELMO CURRENTLY PLAYING IN NEW YORK. IT OPENS IN OTHER SELECT CITIES NATIONWIDE. KEVIN, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
