(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HE IS A 17-YEAR VETERAN OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OF NEW YORK. IN 2005 HE WAS HIT BY A BUS AND SUFFERED LIFE THREATENING INJURIES. HE CHRONICLES IN HIS EXPERIENCE IN HIS BOOK AVAILABLE IN PAPER BACK "THE LONG RUN, A NEW YORK  CITY FIREFIGHTER'S COMEBACK FROM CRASH VICTIM TO ELITE ATHLETE."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MATT LONG. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: WHAT A GREAT STORY. NOW, I KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT AN ACCOMPLISHED AUTHOR NECESSARILY. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, CLEARLY SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET DRESSED FOR THE... (LAUGHTER) DID THEY JUST SHOW UP AND SAY "MATT, GET UP!"
I KIND OF FIGURES IF I WAS RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IT'S ALREADY OUT THERE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HERE'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE. I REMEMBER YOUR STORY. YOU WERE... AND I HATE TO SAY THIS, YOU WERE JUST ANOTHER TERRIBLE THING ON THE NEWS. IN 2005, TELL US VERY QUICKLY, THERE WAS A TRANSIT STRIKE, YOU WILL HAVE TO BIKE TO WORK.
THERE WAS TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS IN THE CITY SO VICTIM DRIVEN MY  CAR OUT TO RANDALL'S ISLAND WHERE I WAS INSTRUCTOR AT THE  ACADEMY BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO GET BACK SO I TOOK MY BICYCLE. ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS FROM MY APARTMENT AND A PRIVATE BUS CHARTERED TO GET WORKERS BELOW  THE RESTRICTION ON 96th STREET MADE A WRONG TURN AND RAN ME OVER. PEOPLE SAY I WAS HIT BY A BUS. I WAS ACTUALLY SUCKED UNDER THE WHEELS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE SOUND THAT YOU WOULD MAKE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND THE THING THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS YOU DIDN'T... YOU SUFFERED NOT ONLY THE INJURIES OF THAT, BUT YOU AND THE BIKE SORT OF... MELDED TOGETHER. I MINE, YOU REALLY WERE... I MEAN, NOT TO RELIVE BUT I THINK THE DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT TO SEE  HOW FAR YOU'VE HAD TO COME BACK.
YEAH. I MEAN, THE BIKE BASICALLY DID THE DAMAGE. YOU'RE A RIDER WITH A PIECE OF ALUMINUM OR STEEL IN BETWEEN YOUR LEGS SO THE BIKE BASICALLY  SLICED ME OPEN LIKE A CAN. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: HOW MUCH BLOOD DID THEY GIVE YOU IN THE FIRST TWO DAYS?
IN THE FIRST 10, 11 HOURS I RECEIVED 68 UNITS OF BLOOD. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: CRAZY. AND THEY GAVE YOU... TO HAVE BEEN SURVIVE JUST THIS NIGHT 5%.
LESS THAN 5% CHANCE TO LIVE. ONE.
Jon: ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES IN THE BOOK, YOU RUN INTO LANCE ARMSTRONG AT A... NOW  YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, YOU'RE NOT COMPETING AT THE MARATHON BUT YOU'RE AT THE NEW YORK MARATHON.
THE FIREMEN TOOK ME OUT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD LIFT MY SPIRITS. I WAS A YEAR OUT OF THE ACCIDENT AND THEY TOOK ME TO THE START OF  THE MARATHON AND IT WAS LANCE'S DEBUT.
Jon: AND YOU HAPPENED TO CATCH HIS EAR FOR JUST A MOMENT. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?
WELL, HIS PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT HIM TALKING TO ANYONE. SO I SAID LANCE, COME ON, THEY GAVE YOU A 50% CHANCE, YOU LOST A TESTICLE, I SAID THEY GAVE ME  A 1% CHANCE. GOT A SECOND? HE TOOK HIS HEAD PHONE OUT AND SOMEONE TOOK A PICTURE SO I HAVE A PICTURE WITH LANCE'S FACE LIKE....
Jon: (LAUGHS) "I GOT NOTHING." (LAUGHTER) YOU WERE AN ATHLETE AND AN ELITE  ATHLETE BEFORE THIS AS WELL AS BEING A FIREFIGHTER. BUT THE STORY IS ABOUT YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE GOING THROUGH THIS. YOU'RE A FIREFIGHTER, IT'S ABOUT GUYS HANGING OUT. TALK ABOUT DIFFICULTY YOU HAVE AFTER THIS ACCIDENT FIGURING OUT WHO YOU WERE.
MY LIFE WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. HERE I AM PART TIME A WHEELCHAIR NOT KNOWING WHAT THE OUTCOME OF FUTURE SURGERIES WAS GOING TO BE. I WAS SLICED OPEN SO FOR TWO YEARS I HAD A COLOSTOMY BAG. IF THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENED TO ME, IT MAY NOT BE THE END OF THE WORLD, BUT FOR A  SINGLE GUY IN THE CITY, FIREFIGHTER GUY IN THE CITY, ATHLETE, IT WAS HUGE. AND I TELL EVERYONE THE PHYSICAL INJURIES WEREN'T AS BAD AS THE MENTAL INJURIES AND THE MENTAL  DAMAGE THAT I HAD TO REALLY OVERCOME.
Jon: SO WHAT SNAPPED YOU OUT OF THAT? WHAT WAS IT... THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF GETTING YOU TO GET BACK ON AND SHOW THE TENACITY  THAT YOU HAD SHOWED FOR SO MANY YEARS BEFORE THAT.
MY MOTHER. I TOLD MY MOM AND DAD ONE DAY THAT I GOT BAD NEWS FROM A DOCTOR, AND I SAID I'M GLAD YOU  PRAYED AND I LIVED AND YOU SHOULD HAVE PRAYED TO LET ME DIE. THAT'S NOTHING YOU SHOULD EVER SAY TO YOUR MOM. (LAUGHTER) TRUST ME, DON'T DO IT. (LAUGHTER) AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND I GUESS I EXPECTED HER TO REACH OUT AND  HUG ME AND SHE DID AND SHE SAID "ENOUGH'S ENOUGH. WE SUFFERED, TOO. WE DIDN'T GET HIT BY THIS BUS BUT WE SUFFERED LIKE YOU DID, TWLERP EVERY NIGHT IN THE HOSPITAL, FIVE MONTHS, WE WERE THERE FOR EVERY SURGERY. AND YOU HAVE TO PICK UP YOUR LIFE AND DO THE BEST YOU CAN." IT TOOK ABOUT TWO WEEKS TO  SETTLE IN BUT SHE WAS RIGHT.
Jon: THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENTS OF THE BOOK. YOUR MOTHER WHO... YOU KNOW, FAMILY, NINE KIDS, RAISED IN BROOKLYN, YOUR DAD RAN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR AND A REAL TIGHT  FAMILY, IDYLLIC BACKGROUND. THE MOM, CAN QUIET HERO OF THE WHOLE THING, WHEN SHE STANDS UP  AT THE END TO SAY IT YOU'RE LIKE READING IT AND YOU STAND UP AND  YOU'RE LIKE "MOM!" YOU DID IT! IT'S AWESOME! AS A PARENT YOU HOPE... AS A PARENT YOU TRY TO IMPART WISDOM IN YOUR KIDS. BUT TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAVE SUCH IMPACT ON A GROWN MAN, REALLY WAS A VERY MOVING PART OF IT. NOW MOVING AHEAD YOU'RE COMPETING AGAIN.
I AM.
Jon: AND YOU'RE GOING TO COMPETE AT THE END OF AUGUST. WHAT'S GOING ON.
THE WORLD POLICE FIRE GAMES ARE COMING TO NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN I THINK THE 15th  TO 16th GAME. THEY HAPPEN EVERY TWO YEARS. THERE WILL BE 18,000 FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WILL  COME TO NEW YORK CITY TO COMPETE FROM BILLIARDS TO BASKETBALL HOCKEY AND I'M GOING TO RIDE MY BIKE.
Jon: THAT'S AWESOME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE POLICE AND FIRE GAMES, I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WILL BE A VERY  HEATED RIVALLY BETWEEN THOSE TWO, THE POLICE AND THE FIRE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOT AT ALL. I'VE BEEN TO 9/11 TRIBUTE DINNERS WHERE THE FIREMEN AND POLICEMEN ARE SEGREGATED ON  EITHER SIDE AND THEY SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE THIS. "WHY DIDN'T WE GET AN EXTRA PIECE OF FISH." SO WHAT ARE THE ODDS? YOU LIKE YOUR CHANCES THIS YEAR?
I'VE COMPETED IN A LOT OF GAMES PLAYING BASKETBALL. NOW IT'S ABOUT GOING AGAINST THE CLOCK BECAUSE I'M ALSO... I WANT TO TRY OUT FOR THE U.S. PARAOLYMPIC CYCLING TEAM. SO I'M GOING AGAINST CLOCK.
Jon: IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, IT CAN BE YOU. NEVER SEEN A GUY WITH SUCH STEEL WILL. "THE LONG RUN" IS ON THE BUS NOW. MATT LONG. GET IT.
