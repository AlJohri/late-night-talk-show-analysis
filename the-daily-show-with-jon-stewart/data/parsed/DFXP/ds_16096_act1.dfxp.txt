JULY 26, 2011! FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT! WE GOT A NICE ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, NPR'S JUAN WILLIAMS WILL BE JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REALLY? HE'S NOT THERE ANYMORE? (LAUGHTER) WELL, I'LL DEFINITELY ASK HIM ABOUT THAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE BEGIN, OF COURSE, WITH OUR ONGOING NATIONAL CRISIS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) ONE WEEK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOR OUR TWO PARTIES TO AGREE TO RAISE THE COUNTRY'S ARBITRARY DEBT LIMIT FOR THE 102nd  TIME FOR THE DROP-DEAD AUGUST 2 CATASTROPHIC ULTIMATUM WE'VE ALREADY MOVED TWICE. (LAUGHTER) AND SO IT WAS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THAT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA INTERRUPTED A  BACHELORETTE'S SEARCH FOR LOVE... (LAUGHTER). ... TO TAKE THAT LONG WALK DOWN "WE KILLED BIN LADEN" LANE.
TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DEBATE WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN  WASHINGTON OVER THE NATIONAL DEBT.
Jon: THE DEBATE WE'VE BEEN HAVING? (LAUGHTER) IS THAT WHAT THAT NOISE OUT OF WASHINGTON'S BEEN? IT SOUNDED LIKE AN A ELEPHANT SEAL TRYING TO (BLEEP) A TRUCK! (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THAT FOOTAGE IS FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. THE TWO OF THEM ARE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER, THOUGH. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S AN ABOMINATION. FUN TO RIDE. THE PRESIDENT WAS IN FULL EDUCATOR-IN-CHIEF MODE.
FOR THE LAST DECADE, WE'VE SPENT MORE MONEY THAN WE'VE TAKEN IN. IF WE STAY ON THE CURRENT PATH, OUR GROWING DEBT COULD COST US JOBS AND DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY.
Jon: HUH? (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I THINK YOUR FINANCIAL AUSTERITY PATH MESSAGE MAY BE SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT BY THE  GOLDEN-CHAIRED RED CARPET PATH YOU WALKED DOWN TO TELL US ABOUT IT. ISN'T THERE ANY WAY TO DO THE TIGHTEN THE BELT SPEECH FROM A  ROOM THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE FOYER OF THE VATICAN? (LAUGHTER) JUST SAYING IF WILLY WONKA HAD TO ADDRESS AMERICA'S CHOCOLATE  SHORTAGE, HE MIGHT NOT DO IT FROM THE WATERFALL ROOM. (LAUGHTER) AUGUSTUS GLOOP! BUT ENOUGH ON THE THEATRICS, LET'S GET DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY.
BASICALLY, THE DEBATE HAS CENTERED AROUND TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES. THE FIRST APPROACH SAYS "LET'S LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS BY MAKING SERIOUS, HISTORIC CUTS IN  GOVERNMENT SPENDING. LET'S CUT DOMESTIC SPENDING TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IT'S BEEN SINCE  DWIGHT EISENHOWER WAS PRESIDENT PRESIDENT."
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SO MASSIVE CUTS TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING. NO SURPRISE COMING FROM THE REPUBLICANS. WHAT'S THAT? OH, THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS' PLAN. (LAUGHTER) WHAT THE (BLEEP)'S BEEN GOING ON DOWN THERE? (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT EXACTLY DO THE REPUBLICANS WANT?
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE INSISTING ON A DIFFERENT APPROACH, A "CUTS-ONLY" APPROACH. AN APPROACH THAT DOESN'T ASK THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS OR BIGGEST CORPORATIONS TO CONTRIBUTE  ANYTHING AT ALL. HOW CAN WE ASK A STUDENT TO PAY MORE FOR COLLEGE BEFORE WE ASK HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO STOP  PAYING TAXES AT A LOWER RATE THAN THEIR SECRETARIES.
Jon: DEATH TO THE OLIGARCHS! DEATH TO THE OLIGARCHS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE... POWER TO THE PEOPLE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOW! WOW! COMMUNISM IS HEAVY! (LAUGHTER) I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH STRENGTH IT TOOK TO BE A COMMUNIST. (LAUGHTER) AT LONG LAST, MR. PRESIDENT, WE BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE GROTESQUE  INCOME AND WEALTH DISPARITY THAT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO METASTASIZE TO FEALTY TO CORPORATE OVERLORDS. GIVE US OUR ASSIGNMENTS, COMRADE. WHAT IS OUR MISSION?
SO I'M ASKING YOU ALL TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD. IF YOU WANT A BALANCED APPROACH TO REDUCING THE DEFICIT, LET YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS KNOW. IF YOU BELIEVE WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THROUGH COMPROMISE, SEND THAT MESSAGE. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S YOUR IDEA? CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN? DID THE PRESIDENT JUST QUIT? (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT! YOU'RE ASKING US TO CALL CONGRESS? OH, YEAH, SURE, I'LL CALL THE CONGRESS. WHY DON'T YOU COME HERE AND MOW MY (BLEEP)ING LAWN BECAUSE I'VE GOT (BLEEP) TO DO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GIVEN UP! IT FEELS LIKE THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND YOUR FAMILY'S LATE FOR AN EVENT AND YOUR DAD  WON'T COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM AND YOU MOM LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS "WILL YOU TALK TO HIM? HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU." HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME, I'M SEVEN. AND HE'S AN IDEOLOGUE. I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR THE PRESIDENT NOW! HE INTERRUPTED "THE BACHELORETTE" TO BE LIKE (WHISPERING)  "CAN YOU CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN? I CAN'T TALK TO THEM!" IT'S LIKE GOING TO THAT RESTAURANT WHERE THEY'RE LIKE  "YOU GET TO MAKE YOUR OWN PIZZA" AND YOU'RE LIKE, YOU MAKE YOUR  OWN (BLEEP)ING PIZZA. (LAUGHTER) HE'S IN A TIGHT SPOT WITH THE ECONOMY WHICH BECAME VERY APPARENT BY THE END OF HIS SPEECH.
SO LET'S SEIZE THIS MOMENT TO SHOW WHY THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA IS STILL THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH. NOT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN STILL KEEP OUR WORD AND MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS BUT BECAUSE WE CAN  STILL COME TOGETHER AS ONE NATION. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU.    GOD BLESS T AND M STATES OF AMERICA.
Jon: OH, NOT THE GOLDEN CHAIRS! OH, DON'T WORRY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'LL GET THEM BACK WHEN THINGS TURN AROUND. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT WAS ONLY HALF OF THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT. THE OPENING ACT, IF YOU WILL, FOR THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE WHICH CAME FROM THE WORLD'S SADDEST TANGERINE. (LAUGHTER) WHEN JOHN BOEHNER SPOKE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WHILE WE MAY  BE SCRAPING THE DEBT CEILING, WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE TO RUNNING OUT OF CLICHES.
IN WASHINGTON MORE SPENDING AND MORE DEBT IS BUSINESS AS USUAL. WELL, I'VE GOT NEWS FOR WASHINGTON: THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. THE PRESIDENT HAS OFTEN SAID WE NEED A BALANCED APPROACH WHICH IN WASHINGTON MEANS WE SPEND  MORE AND YOU PAY MORE. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THE BIGGER THE GOVERNMENT THE SMALLER THE PEOPLE.
Jon: WAIT, BIGGER THE GOVERNMENT, THE SMALLER THE PEOPLE. THAT MEANS THE SMALLER THE GOVERNMENT THE BIGGER THE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) WHICH MEANS IF WE GET RID OF GOVERNMENT WE'LL HAVE GIANT PEOPLE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE REPUBLICAN PLAN IS TO DESTROY GOVERNMENT AND CREATE A  SUPERRACE OF RIGHT-WING TITANS. OR RIGHTANS. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THERE WAS ONE LINE IN JOHN BOEHNER'S SPEECH THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME.
HERE IS A PRESIDENT ASKING FOR THE LARGEST DEBT INCREASE IN  AMERICAN HISTORY ON THE HEELS OF THE LARGEST SPENDING BINGE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: WHICH CAME ON THE HEELS OF AN ALMOST ABSURDLY RECKLESS DECADE WITH UNFUNDED  WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND UNFUNDED TRILLION-DOLLAR MEDICAL PRESCRIPTION BILL AND TAX CUTS  FOR THE WELL THEY ARE THE LARGEST SINGLE POLICY CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR DEFICIT. IN FACT, I MYSELF VOTED FOR ALL OF THESE... BACK TO MY ORIGINAL POINT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OBAMA! NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST, BUT I DO HAVE ONE AREA OF EXPERTISE THAT I BELIEVE I CAN REFUTE SPEAKER BOEHNER ON.
HERE'S WHAT WE GOT FOR THAT MASSIVE SPENDING BINGE. A NEW HEALTH CARE BILL THAT MOST AMERICANS NEVER ASKED FOR. A STIMULUS BILL THAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING MATERIAL FOR LATE-NIGHT COMEDIANS THAN IT  WAS IN PRODUCING JOBS. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: NO, THAT IS SO TRUE! THAT IS SO TRUE! 125 THAT STIMULUS BILL GAVE US SO MUCH MATERIAL. HERE'S ANOTHER STIMULUS HUMDINGER I CAME UP WITH THIS MORNING WHILE I WAS LISTENING TO  BLOOMBERG RADIO. "HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS MANUFACTURING SECTOR WITH UNDERUTILIZED CAPACITY, HUH? AM I RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE STIMULATING DEMAND THROUGH INCREASED CREDIT AVAILABILITY OR  JUST CUTTING LOSSES DUE TO INVENTORY DRAWDOWNS" BOOM! BOOM! (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU KIDDING ME, BOEHNER? YOU THINK COMEDIANS ENJOY FISCAL INCOMPETENCE AND BUREAUCRATIC PARALYSIS? LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. SEE THIS RIGHT HERE? (LAUGHTER) THE GUY IN THE TIGER COSTUME IS CONGRESSMAN DAVID WU OF OREGON. APPARENTLY HE RESIGNED TODAY BECAUSE OF INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONTACT TOWARDS AN 18-YEAR-OLD. DID I MENTION THAT'S A REAL PICTURE OF HIM DRESSED LIKE TIGGER? (LAUGHTER) SO LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. YOU REALLY THINK I'M GOING TO STIMULUS STUFF. (BLEEP)ING WITH THIS GUY WOULD BE... HOW DO I PUT THIS? GRRREAT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
