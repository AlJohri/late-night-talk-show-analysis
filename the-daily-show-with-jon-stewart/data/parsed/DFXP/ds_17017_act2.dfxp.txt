Jon: WELCOME BACK. SOME THINGS EVERYONE KNOWS. PIZZA TASTES GOOD NO MATTER WHERE IT'S FROM. LEPRECHAUNS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CATCH. AND THIS.
THE TRUTH IS THAT NPR IS A LIBERAL ORGANIZATION. IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN. NPR HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE LIBERAL FOR DECADES NOW.
Jon: DECADES. AT LEAST TWO ACCORDING TO THAT GUY. PRETTY YOUNG. BUT WE ALL REMEMBER SITTING AROUND IN THE 1960s LISTEN TO THE WAIT, WAIT, DON'T DRAFT ME. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED NPR WOULD BE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT WORLD OF OPERA HOST LISA  SIMEONE AND CAITLYN CURRAN WERE SUPPORTING THE OCCUPY ORGANIZATION. IT'S WRONG TO CREATE A MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITY FILLED WITH LOANS YOU KNOW ARE  GOING TO SALE SO YOU CAN SELL IT TO A CLIENT BY PICKING THE LOAN MOST LIKELY TO BE DEFAULTED UPON. THAT WAS WHAT THE SIGN SAID. BY THE WAY, THAT IS A MUCH BETTER BUMPER STICKER THAN A SIGN. I FOLLOWED THAT GUY. NPR WASN'T PLEASED. THEY GOT RID OF BOTH INDIVIDUALS SO THEY'LL NEVER HAVE TO HERE CRITICISM LIKE THIS AGAIN.
WHY DON'T WE HAVE TAX PAYER DOLLARS FUNDING FOX NEWS?
WHY SHOULD WE PAY ONE TAX PAYER DOLLAR FOR NPR?
Jon: WHY NOT FUND SEAN HANNITY'S SHOW BECAUSE HIS SHOW AND NPR ARE REALLY THE  SAME THING. JUST FROM DIFFERENT SIDES. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT COMPARISON, THEY'RE NOTHING LIKE THE SAME THING. HERE'S CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO.
THE SOCIALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HE'S DESTROYED OUR  NATION'S FINANCES AND HE HAS NOW SMOTHERED THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO DEFEAT OBAMA AND THE AMERICAN LEFT BEFORE THEY ROB  ALL OF US OF EVERYTHING THAT OUR ANCESTORS, OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HAVE  FOUGHT AND BLED AND DIED TO PRESERVE.
WE NEED TO DEFEAT THESE BASTARDS. WE NEED TO WIPE THEM OUT. WE NEED TO CHASE THEM OUT OF TOWN.
Jon: THE MONSTER IS LOOSE IN THE VILLAGE. GRAB YOUR PITCH FORK AND YOUR TORCHES AND WE SHALL ATTACK! SO IF NPR IS TALK RADIO'S EQUAL AND OPPOSITE, THAT MUST MEAN THAT THEIR SHOWS URGE  LISTENERS TO GET A ROPE AND GO REPUBLICAN-HUNTING.
MICHELLE BERNARD YOUR REACTION TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH.
MY REACTION IS I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING AND I'VE HEARD OTHERS SAY IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TONIGHT IT WAS A VERY, VERY STARK CONTRAST TO ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SPEECH YOU HEARD BY PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH WHEN  HE TALKED ABOUT IRAQ.
E.J., JUST BACK TO YOU, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN IRAQ?
I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MICHELLE HERE.
Jon: ((BEEP) OH, MAN. I HOPE THEY WERE AT LEAST NAKED IN THE STUDIO. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. SEE THAT? THE REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE RADIO, THEY GET PEOPLE TO GO CHASE FRANKENSTEIN. NPR, THEY DESCRIBE THE HAMLET, WHERE THERE IS A MONSTER THAT'S LIVING. THEY INCITE THE LISTENERS TO BRING THEIR TORCHES AND MEET UP AT THE WINDMILL. MAYBE A TRAVELOGUE, A CHARMING RESTAURANT WHERE THEY SERVE ARTISANAL CHEESES. MAYBE A ROUND TABLE ABOUT THE ETHICS OF REANIMATING MONSTERS. BUT I WASN'T SURE ABOUT ANY OF THIS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NPR AND CONSERVATIVE RADIO  UNTIL LAST SUMMER. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. ON A FRIDAY EVENING I WAS DRIVING HOME IN MY PRIVATE JET-- I LIKE TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE  WEST SIDE HIGHWAY-- IT WAS THE DAY JOHN BOEHNER WALKED OUT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DEBT CEILING TALKS. TENSIONS ARE HIGH. NERVES ARE TRAYED. YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO MEDIA MIRROR IMAGES AND HOW THEY WOULD HANDLE THIS EXPLOSIVE MOMENT. I WEAR TO GOT, I'M IN THE CAR AND THIS IS WHAT I HEAR FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH ON MY DIAL.
LOOK AROUND YOU. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES ADVICE FROM MARXIST PROFESSORS.
Jon: OOWWW. I WONDER HOW NPR WILL COUNTER.
WELL, MARK, WELCOME TO FRESH AIR. YOUR BOOK TELLS US ABOUT SO MANY DIVERSE AND FASCINATING SPECIES OF ANTS ACROSS THE WORLD. LET'S TELL THE LISTENERS ABOUT THE BULLDOG ANT OF AUSTRALIA.
Jon: (BEEP). THAT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING. MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO BREAK INTO IT YET. BACK TO CONSERVATIVE RADIO.
WE LITERALLY HAVE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, WHICH IS THE PARTY OF CERTAIN DOOM.
Jon: SWITCH TO POLITICAL COVERAGE.
WHEN YOU SEE A SWARM OF ANTS, I MEAN, HOW MANY OF THEM?
THEY'RE ALL FEMALE. THAT'S THE THING.
Jon: NOW I WANT TO TAKE BACK MY GOVERNMENT AND (BEEP) ANT. I PUT BACK AND FORTH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO CAPE MAY. I COULDN'T DECIDE IF THE PRESIDENT WAS A SECRET MUSLIM OR AN ANT. THAT REALLY HAPPENED. I'M NOT SAYING NPR ISN'T IS A RELENTLESS ACTIVIST ORGANIZATION. THAT DRILLS ITS MESSAGE INTO YOUR HEAD 24/7. IT'S JUST THAT THEIR MESSAGE IS NOT POLITICAL.
WE'RE HAVING OUR MEMBERSHIP DRIVE NOW. YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS CRUCIAL TO KEEPING US GOING.
Jon: IT'S NOT A CALL TO ARMS. IT'S A CALL TO CALL. THE CONSERVATIVES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF FEAR BUT NPR IS IN THE BUSINESS OF GUILT. EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT ON, IT JUST ASKS, "YOU NEVER CALL."
