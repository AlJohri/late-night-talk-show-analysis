WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, I WATCH A LOT OF FOX NEWS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BECAUSE I HATE MY OWN HEAD. (LAUGHTER) BUT MY FAVORITE FOX NEWS PERSONALITY AND THIS IS TRUE, HANDS DOWN, MEGYN KELLY, HOST OF AMERICA LIVE RUNS IN THE AFTERNOON, SHE WENT ON MATERNITY LEAVE AND FOLK  TRIED FOUL A TOSS ONE REPLACING HER WITH THIS LADY FOR A LITTLE BIT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND IN SOME CASES, THIS OTHER LADY. COME ON FOX, YOU THINK YOU CAN STICK ANY PRETTY BLOND LADY INTO MEGYN KELLY'S  CHAIR AND WE WON'T NOTICE. OCTOBER CONTINUATION DID TAKE ME A COUPLE DAYS TO NOTICE BUT BY THE WAY I  HAPPEN TO KNOW IT IS ANCHOR LADY HARVEST SEASON UNTIL OCTOBER. GOOD NEWS MEGYN KELLY BACK IN THE STUDIO. THIS WEEK. NEW HAIR-DO BUT THE SAME TAKE NO PRISONERS ATTITUDE. WATCH HER TAKE ON THIS TALK RADIO HOST WHO HAD A NERVE TO MAKE A CRACK ABOUT LETTER  WHILE SHE WAS ON LEAVE.
HERE IS WHAT YOU SAID.
MEGYN IS STILL ON MATERNITY LEAVENESS.
RIGHT.
ARE YOU COMPLAINING. SHE'S BONDING WITH HER BABY.
WHAT A RACKET THAT IS MEN DON'T GET TO BOND.
RACKET.
HOW MUCH TIME DOES SHE GET OFF.
PROBABLY THREE MONTHS.
WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN THOSE REMARKS, MR. GALLAGHER, MATERNITY LEAVE, IT'S A RACKET.
WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO DISAGREE THAT THERE IS-- AGAIN I'M ON --
ARE YOU DOUBLING DOWN. NO, NO, NO,. ARE YOU NOT TAKING THOSE REMARKS THAT MATERNITY LEAVE ACCORDING TO YOU A RACKET.
Jon: HOW IS IT A RACKET? DOES IT MAKE YOU LAUGH? IS MY SPECIAL BOND WITH PIE BABY HERE TO AMUSE YOU? YOU TELL ME HOW IT IS LIKE A  [BLEEP] RACKET. YOU SON OF A BITCH! HOW IS MY MATERNITY LEAVE A RACKET? (APPLAUSE)
Jon: [BLEEP] NOW WHAT? DIFFERENT MOVIE. MEGYN KELLY IS A BAD-ASS. THAT GUY-- THAT GUY WAS CALLING MATERNITY LEAVE A RACKET. HE WAS SAYING THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T GET PAID FOR AND MEGYN KELLY WAS JUST  LIKE-- NEVER GET BETWEEN A MAMA GRIZZLY AND HER MATERNITY LEAVE. SHE'S MAKING CATE A SPIRITED ARGUMENT THAT, WITHOUTERS ARE ENTITLED TO CERTAIN  BENEFITS AND SOCIETY HAS AN INTEREST IN PROTECTING THESE BENEFITS WHICH IS GREAT. AND REALLY WEIRD. WAIT, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE-- FOX MEGYN KELLY THAT I THOUGHT I KNEW.
DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ANY GETTING THE TEN TACKLES THAT GOVERNMENT HAS  PLACED INTO OUR LIVES OUT? ARE WE JUST STUCK WITH THESE MASSIVE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE NOW.
Jon: SHE USED TO HATE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM, MANDATED BENEFITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEGYN KELLY COMING OFF MATERNITY LEAVE AND SOME OF HER  EARLIER WORK.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT AND CARRYING A BABY NINE MONTHS THAT YOU DON'T  THINK DESERVES A FEW MONTHS OFF SO BONDING AND RECOVERY CAN TAKE PLACE, HUH?
THE ENTITLEMENT, THAT SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT IS EVEN BUILT INTO THE CAKE THIS  REIN THE SYSTEM. SO TO TRY TO TAKE THEM WAY NOW IS LIKE TRYING TO TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY AWAY.
VERY TOUGH.
ONCE IT IN HOW DO YOU GET RID OF IT.
THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE PAID LEAVE.
THE FREE MARKET SHOULD DICTATE THAT IS HOW IT WORKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. IF ANYTHING, THE UNITED STATES IS IN THE DARK AGES WHEN IT COMES TO MATERNITY LEAVE. A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS DON'T SEE IT. THEY SEE IT AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SOCIALISM, THE CREATION OF A WELL FARE STATE.
WELL, DO MEN GET MATERNITY LEAVE.
YES.
I BELIEVE I'M ASKING NEW DWNS GUESS WHAT, HONEY, THEY DO. IT'S CALLED FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. IF MEN WOULD LIKE TO TAKE-- THREE MONTHS OFF TO GO TAKE CARE OF THEIR NEWBORN BABY THEY CAN. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT DON'T THEY CALL IT MATERNITY LEAVE FOR A REASON. HOW IS THIS DISCRIMINATORY TO GIVE LESS TIME TO THE MAN WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE BABY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. YOU CUT YOUR HAIR, IT SAPPED YOUR CONSERVATIVE STRENGTH. LIKE A RIGHT WING SAMPSON. THAT MEANS RACHEL MADDOW IS X SCISSORLESS WEEKS FROM A FOX CONTRACT. SEE THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH ENTITLEMENTS. THEY ARE REALLY ONLY ENTITLEMENTS WHEN THEY ARE SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE WANT. WHEN IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT, THEY'RE A HALLMARK OF A CIVILIZED SOCIETY. THE FOUNDATION OF A GREAT PEOPLE. I JUST HAD A BABY AND FOUND OUT MATERNITY LEAVE STRENGTHENS SOCIETY. BUT SINCE I STILL HAVE A JOB, UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE CLEARLY SOCIALISM. (LAUGHTER) TO PUT IT MORE SIMPLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT THEY HAVE [BLEEP] AND YOUR  [BLEEP] STUFF?
Jon: ONCE AGAIN GEORGE CARLIN SAYS IN A SEN TINS WHAT TOOK US THREE AND A  HALF MINUTES SO EITHER MEGYN KELLY EXPOSED THE HYPOCRISY OF THE DEUPONIZATION OF  WORKERS AND WORKING CLASS OR-- OH MY GOD IT'S WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT, MEGYN KELLY  IS SUFFERING FROM POST PARTUM COMPASSION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT WILL PASS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
