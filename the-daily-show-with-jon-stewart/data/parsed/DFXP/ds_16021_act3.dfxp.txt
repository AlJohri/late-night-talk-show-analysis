(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. TONIGHT MY GUEST AN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED TRIUMPH OF THE CITY. HOW OUR GREATEST INVENTION MAKES US RICHER, SMARTER, GREENER, HEALTHIER AND HAPPIER. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, EDWARD GRAZEEN. ( APPLAUSE ) WELCOME.
THANK YOU, SIR.
Jon: THE BOOK IS TRIUMPH OF THE CITY. I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN OF CITIES. I ENJOY THE FOOD, THE CAMARADERIE, BUT HOW IS IT HEALTHIER IN THE CITY? HEALTHIER, GREENER, ECONOMICALLY BETTER. HOW DO ALL THESE THINGS COME TO PASS?
WELL IT'S HEALTHIER AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE LESS MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS  BECAUSE TAKING A SUBWAY IS JUST A LOT LESS DANGEROUS THAN DRIVING DRUNK. THERE ARE A LOT FEWER SUICIDES IN NEW YORK. THE ABSENCE OF GUNS AND PROBABLY THE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS THAT WORK IN CITY.
Jon: DID YOU SAY THE ABSENCE OF GUNS.
YEAH.
Jon: IN NEW YORK CITY?
AMONG KEY SUICIDE PRONE POPULATIONS.
Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
NOT AMONG EVERYONE.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
BUT CITIES ARE JUST AMAZING THINGS BECAUSE THEY PLAY TO  MANKIND'S GREATEST ASSET WHICH IS OUR ABILITY TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER FACE TO FACE. WE COME OUT OF THE WOMB WITH THIS GREAT TALENT OF BEING ABLE TO SOP UP STUFF. THAT'S WHAT MAKES CITIES SO SPECIAL AND SO POWERFUL.
Jon: LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. I RECENTLY HAD TWO PEOPLE COME OUT OF A WOMB IN MY HOUSE. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS THE ONE DOING THE SOPPING. THEY SEEMED, IF I MAY, SOPLESS.
INDEED.
Jon: BUT IS THE IDEA THAT THE PROXIMITY IS WHAT FEEDS THE ENERGY AND DOES IT ONLY  WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE?
NO IT DOESN'T ONLY WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT CITIES HAVE PARTICULAR ASSETS LIKE THE  ABILITY TO MEET OTHER SINGLE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY VALUE. IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. IT'S JUST A SUPER CHARGING OF THIS BASIC HUMAN ABILITY. IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FACEBOOK ARE REMARKABLY MAKING CITIES MORE NOT LESS IMPORTANT. LOOK AT EGYPT AND CAIRO, RIGHT? IT'S CALLED A FACEBOOK REVOLUTION BUT IT'S ONLY HAPPENING IN CITIES. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN BLOCK MUBARAK FROM YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE AND THAT CAUSES A  TOPPLING OF THE GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE TO BE THERE IN THE CITY MAKING SOMETHING HAPPEN.
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE UPSET AT ME. I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
Jon: THE THING ABOUT CITIES IS THAT THOUGH WHAT ABOUT DISEASE? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THE CLOSER THE PROXIMITY, BED BUGS, BUBONIC PLAGUE, THESE ARE... THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO MAKE CITIES... YOU WRITE THAT THE  PEOPLE DIE LATER IN CITIES, THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE LONGER IN CITIES. THAT SEEMS STUNNING TO ME.
IT'S AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT. A BOY BEING BORN IN NEW YORK 110 YEARS AGO COULD EXPECT TO LIVE SEVEN YEARS LESS THAN A  BOY BORN SOMEWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA. NOW LIFE EXPECT TAES IS TWO YEARS LONGER IN NEW YORK.
Jon: WHAT HAS CAUSED THAT? JUST PROXIMITY TO HOSPITALS?
NO, NO. LIFESTYLE, WALKING AND GETTING CLEAN WATER. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING CITY GOVERNMENTS DO IS THEY ACTUALLY MAKE SURE YOU CAN  DRINK THE WATER AND NOT DIE. THAT'S A CRITICAL THING THAT CITIES NEED TO DO. THIS REQUIRES HUGE INVESTMENT. A AQUADUCT. THE START OF THE 20th CENTURY CITY GOVERNMENTS WERE SPENDING MORE ON WATER THAN THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT SPENT ON ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE ARMY AND THE POST OFFICE. MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN THIS STUFF TO MAKE CITIES HEALTHY.
Jon: YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT CITIES. FOR SUBURBS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN, YOU KNOW, EMBEDDED IN I THINK THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY THAT THE IDEA IS YOU COME TO A CITY  AS AN IMPOVERISHED IMMIGRANT. YOU WORK VERY HARD SO THAT YOUR CHILDREN CAN MOVE TO NEW JERSEY. AND LIVE A SUB URBAN LIFESTYLE WHERE PEOPLE DON'T TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE AND THE TV  REPLACES THESE FACE-TO-FACE ENCOUNTERS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ISN'T THAT THE DREAM?
THAT'S THE MAJOR REASON I WROTE THIS BOOK IS I REALLY HOPED WE COULD MOVE BEYOND  THINKING THAT THE ONLY AMERICAN DREAM IS A WHITE PICKET FENCE IN THE SUBURBS. IF THE REST WAS AMERICA WAS AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA OUR G.D.P. PER CAPITA WOULD GO UP 43%. THESE ARE THE PLACES FOR COMPETITION, INNOVATION, CHANGE HAPPENS. THESE ARE GREAT PLACES FOR AMERICA. WE DON'T NEED ANTI-URBAN POLICY.
Jon: DO WE HAVE ANTI-URBAN POLICY.
SURE WE DO.
Jon: LIKE WHAT?
THE HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST. WE MAKE A NETISH OUT OF HOME OWNERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE IN NEW YORK TEND TO RENT FOR GOOD REASONS. HAVING A LOT OF OWNERS UNDER ONE ROOF IS A NIGHTMARE.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
YOU SUBSIDIZE HOME OWNERSHIP. YOU PUSH GUYS OUT INTO SUBURBS. WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION POLICY, RIGHT? WE INVESTED HEAVILY IN HIGHWAYS. WE'RE STILL THROWING MONEY AT SUBURBS... AT HIGHWAYS IN LOW DENSITY AREAS. THE STIMULUS BILL GAVE TRANSPORTATION MONEY IN A 2 FOR 1 RATIO IN THE LEAST....
Jon: SUBURBS ARE DRAGGING US DOWN. THE CITIES MIGHT BE THE REAL AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE... IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AND YOU'RE SUGGESTING IN YOUR  BOOK THAT WE ARM OURSELVES AND ATTACK THESE SUBURBS, RIGHT? CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? IF YOU LIVE IN A CITY OR PLANNING ON LIVING IN A CITY, IF YOU'VE EVER LIVED IN A CITY THIS IS A GREAT BOOK TO READ TO GIVE YOURSELF A NICE  FEELING OF WHAT YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHING. A TREMENDOUS BOOK. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE.
