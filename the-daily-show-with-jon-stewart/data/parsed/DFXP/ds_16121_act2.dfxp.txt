(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A CONGRESSMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS WHO IS ALSO A  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: HOW ARE THINGS GOING? ARE YOU FEELING THE LOVE FROM THE PEOPLE?
OH, ALL THE TIME. ESPECIALLY THE MEDIA. THEY REALLY LOVE ME.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS? YOU KNOW, YOU RAN IN 2008. YOU HAD A NICE, STRONG SHOWING. YOU'VE IMPROVED UPON THAT. YOU CAME IN A VERY CLOSE SECOND IN THE AIMS STRAW POLL... (ONE PERSON CHEERING)... AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE STRAWS ARE HERE TONIGHT. AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR CANDIDACY THAT THEY SO EASILY DISMISS AND ARE THEY RIGHT  WHEN THEY SAY RON PAUL IS NOT AN ELECTABLE FIGURE?
THEY'RE WRONG ON THAT. I'VE BEEN ELECTEDED QUITE A FEW TIMES ALREADY. I PROVED I CAN BE ELECTED. I THINK IT'S TWO THINGS. I THINK ONE IS SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE MESSAGE BECAUSE IT'S A THREAT TO HIM  BECAUSE I'M A THREAT TO THE ESTABLISHMENT. SOME THOUGH JUST FLAT OUT DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT FREEDOM IS ALL ABOUT. THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE MARKET WORKS. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MONETARY POLICY. THEY THINK THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT WARS. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE. I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY THEY'RE INTIMIDATED BY ME HAVING A PRESENCE ON THE STAGE.
Jon:, YOU KNOW, YOU GO FROM 8% TO 15% BUT IT'S A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC GROUP. (ONE PERSON CHEERING) (A FEW MORE PEOPLE CHEERING).
Jon: THE ENTHUSIASM FOR YOUR CANDIDACY IS VERY STRONG. CAN YOU BROADEN THAT OUT. YOUR 15% OR 12% OR 10% WILL YELL HARDER THAN ROMNEY'S 30%. (A FEW PEOPLE YELLING.)
Jon: HIS 30% DON'T REALLY SEEM TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. BUT HOW CAN YOU EXPAND PAST THAT?
WELL, KEEP DELIVERING THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS NECESSARY. IT'S VERY POPULAR. THE COUNTRY'S IN BIG TROUBLE ECONOMICALLY. I HAVE AN ECONOMIC MESSAGE. THE FOREIGN POLICY IS IN SHAMBLES. PERPETUAL WAR. AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF IT. THAT MESSAGE IS TRULY VED SPREADING. I ALSO WORK ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO CONVINCE IMMEDIATELY 51%. YOU DO NEED A HARD CORE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL VOLUNTEER, WORK HARD, DONATE THE MONEY. IT'S THEN THAT THE PERSUASION COMES. I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I THINK ONCE YOU GET TO 10%, YOU HAVE THE NUMBER. WE'RE 10, 14, 15 PERCENT SO I THINK WE'RE VERY WELL COULD BE  AND MOST LIKE ON THE VERGE OF AN EXPLOSION OF INTEREST IN THIS COUNTRY. (A FEW PEOPLE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING).
Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION IS SAYING ONE THING A FEW YEARS  AGO AND THEN CHANGING YOUR POSITION. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT FLIP- FLOPPING BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WHEN I WATCH THE DEBATES A  GREAT DEAL OF IT IS EACH CANDIDATE YELLING AT THE OTHER FOR THINGS THEY USED TO SAY  THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVE IN. AND DURING THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION, THEY REALLY DON'T LOOK AT YOU. IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD RIGHT NOW PERHAPS REPUDIATE SOME OF YOUR PAST POSITIONS?
IF YOU WERE MY POLITICAL ADVISOR YOU WOULD SAY MAYBE I SHOULD TRY THAT AND GET MORE ATTENTION.
Jon: I WOULD SUGGEST PERHAPS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW IS COME OUT FOR A WAR ON IRAN. I FEEL LIKE IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT, IT WOULD GENERATE A GREAT DEAL....
AND WHERE WOULD MY SUPPORTERS BE? THEY WOULD BE GONE.
Jon: YOUR CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE MEDIA IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
THAT THE TRUE.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO FOR YOU. I'VE WORKED IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME, CONGRESSMAN. I THINK I KNOW WHAT I COULD DO FOR YOU. I COULD BRING SOME ATTENTION. YOUR LOOK, THE CONSISTENCY OF YOUR POSITIONS, HAVE YOU TRIED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. THERE YOU GO. YOU KNOW, THEY ALL SEEM TO LOVE CHRIS CHRISTIE. SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IF YOU DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAYBE THIS MORE THAN ANY OTHER LOOK I THINK MIGHT BE THE WAY TO GO. THERE YOU GO. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, YOU'VE SERVED 12 STRAIGHT TERMS IN CONGRESS. SHE LEFT BEING GOVERNOR EARLY BUT SHE'S GOT THAT BUS. HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANYTHING ALONG THE LINES OF THAT?
I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU'LL GENERATE GOOD  IDEAS AND I'M NOT SURE I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE YOU JUST GAVE ME.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THOSE POLICIES WHEN WE COME BACK. WE'LL GET INTO IT A LITTLE DEEPER AND FIGURE SOME OF THAT STUFF OU
