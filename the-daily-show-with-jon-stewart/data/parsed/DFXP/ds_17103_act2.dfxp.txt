Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY WE TALK A LIT ABOUT HORRIBLY POOR OUR CULTURE HAS BECOME POLICICALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO WILL MIND EVERYBODY TEN SHORT MONTHS AGO POLITICAL PARTY CAME  TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. THEY MADE A DEAL IN ORDER TO RAISE OUR DEBT CEILING.
THE DEAL IS SHAPING UP LIKE THIS. RAISE THE DEBT CEILING BY UP TO $2.8 TRILLION IN TWO INSTALLMENTS. STAGE ONE, CUT ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING. LAUNCH A NEW KIND OF SUPERCOMMITTEE EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN PARTIES TO FIND UP  TO $1.8 TRILLION IN EXTRA SAVINGS BY NOVEMBER.
Jon: SUPERCOMMITTEE THIS IS THE SUPERCOMMITTEE, RIGHT NEXT, THESE GUISE, LIKE THE  AVENGERS OF CONGRESSMAN ONLY WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING COOL OR HAVING SUPERPOWER. IT IS LIKE EIGHT HAWKEYES IS REALLY WHAT IT IS LIKE. IT'S JUST LIKE A GUY LIKE OH, I CAN SHOOT A BOW AND ARROW. OH, WHATTER, KATNISS. TRULY IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT OF BIPARTISAN COOPERATION IN WASHINGTON CAPPED OFF BY  THAT "TIME" MAGAZINE COVER THAT JOHN BOEHNER AND HARRY REID POSED FOR. DWRA, TRY AND SLEEP TONIGHT.
ORANGE FANTA.
ANYWAY, HERE IS THE BEST PART TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPERCOMMITTEE SUCCEEDED IN BEING ABLE TO CUT, THEY PUT  A POISON PILL IN THE DEBT CEILING DEAL.
THERE IS A PROVISION IN THIS BILL, A TRIGGER, IF YOU WILL, THAT IF THIS NEWLY  FORMED SUPERCOMMITTEE CAN'T COME UP WITH 1.5 TRILLION IN CUTS, IT TRIGGERS VERY, VERY  DEEP CUTS IN DEFENSE AND MEDICARE.
Jon: THE ULTIMATE INCENTIVE, EACH SIDE TAKING DEEP CUTS TO SOMETHING IT  DOES NOT WANT TO CUT. ESSENTIALLY JOINING A JOINT SUICIDE PACT. WELL, THAT'S GOT TO WORK.
SO THE CALLED SUPERCOMMITTEE FAILED TO REACH A DEAL TO REDUCE THE COUNTRY'S DEFICIT.
Jon: EXTRAORDINARY.
Jon: SO A DEAL IS A DEAL, RULES ARE YOU WILL ROOSE, AND NOW THOSE MANDATORY CUTS HAVE TO TAKE EFFECT, RIGHT JOHN BOEHNER?
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE SEQUESTER.
YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE UNDONE.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE BE TO REPLASD. YOU ARE JUST CAN'T UNDO IT, IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.
Jon: REPLACED WITH WHAT. YOU AGREED TO TAKE CUTS IN THE MILITARY IF YOU COULDN'T GET THE-- THE DEM AS CREED  TO DEEP CUTS IN SOCIAL SPENDING IF THEY COULDN'T GET THE SUPERCOMMITTEE TO WORK. WHAT ARE GOING TO REPLACE.
THEY ARE WORK ON DEFENSE SEQUESTERED. MEMBERS ALREADY VOTED TODAY 21-9 ON A PLAN TO CUT SPENDING ON FOOD STAMP, MEDICAID, A CHILD TAX CREDIT, MEALS AND WHEELS AND OTHER SOCIAL PROGRAMS.
Jon: THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION. HEY, DEMOCRATS, I KNOW WE MADE A SUICIDE PACT IF WE COULDN'T COME TO AN AGREEMENT WE WOULD CUT  MILITARY AND YOU SOCIAL SPENDING BUT WE DECIDED TO JUST GO BACK AND JUST MAKE  IT A MURDER PACT WHERE WE CUT SOCIAL SPENDING TWICE. WHAT? I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO SPIN THAT AS A POSITIVE. HEY, MAN, YEAH, WE'RE CUTTING MEALS ON WHEELS BUT ONLY CUTTING THE WHEELS. MEALS ARE STILL IN THE VAN. HOUSEBOUND SENIORS JUST HAVE TO COME TO US NOW.
Jon: OR TO PUT THE REPUBLICAN POSITION ANOTHER WAY.
