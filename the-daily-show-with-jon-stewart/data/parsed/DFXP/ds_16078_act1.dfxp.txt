JUNE 15, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD'S NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BIG ONE TONIGHT. OH, YEAH, BABY. THAT'S RIGHT, JON STEWART, HOST OF "THE DAILY SHOW" IN 2011. AND YET I'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR OVER 20 YEARS, SO THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT I'VE  DONE THAT YOU COULD MENTION. [LAUGHTER] WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I FEEL LIKE THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT JUST LOOKED ME UP ON WIKIPEDIA. WHEN THEY'RE ASKING ME QUESTIONS. YOU WERE IN ELMO PALOOZA 2002. ON THE SHOW TONIGHT, TREY PARKER AND MATT STONE. NO, NO! YOU KNOW WHAT, MATT STONE AND TREY PARKER ARE ON THE SHOW. THAT'S RIGHT. IT ENDS TONIGHT. EARLIER THIS WEEK, EARLIER THIS WEEK WHILST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SPARRED OVER WHO BEST  COULD EVEN SLIGHTLY DELAY THE INEVITABLE DECAY OF AMERICA INTO A GAY, ISLAMIC CALIFANT, PRESIDENT OBAMA FULFILLED A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO RETURN TO THE ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO, THOUGH LIKE MOST NEW YORKERS, I ASSUMED IT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S WAY OF TRYING TO AVOID THE  TRAFFIC FROM SUNDAY'S PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE. WORST DRIVING KAY OF THE YEAR, ASIDE FROM OBVIOUSLY ST. PATRICK'S DAY AND THE GAY PRIDE PARADE, AND, OF COURSE, THE TRAFFIC DAY PARADE THAT. IS THE WORST OF THE... WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A PARADE CELEBRATING... OKAY. [LAUGHTER] OBAMA'S TRIP MARKED FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT TO PUERTO RICO BY A SITTING PRESIDENT SINCE JOHN  F. KENNEDY, AND HIS FAMOUS SPEECH 50 YEARS AGO, "ESTOY EIN PUERTO RICAN, UH, OR SAN JUANA, UH." CLEARLY THIS WOULD BE AN HISTORIC OCCASION.
THE PRESIDENT IS SPENDING ABOUT FIVE HOURS IN THE U.S. TERRITORY.
Jon: OH, FIVE HOURS. WELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY A PRESIDENTIAL  VISIT, MORE OF A LAYOVER ON HIS WAY TO ST. BART'S, BUT NO HISTORIC FIVE-HOUR STATE VISIT  WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A STIRRING ADDRESS AND N A FLAG-DRAPED AIRPORT HANGAR JUST  FEET FROM THE STILL-IDLING PLANE THE PRESIDENT JUST LANDED IN.
IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN PUERTO RICO.
Jon: QUE BUENO. BARACK OBAMA, QUE BUENO, PUERTO RICO. ADDED SOME SPICY PRONUNCIATION. I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THAT UP.
OUR HEALTH CARE REFORM INCLUDED HELP FROM PUERTO RICO. THESE PROBLEMS DIDN'T DEVELOP OVER NIGHT HERE IN PUERTO RICO, HERE IN PUERTO RICO. HERE IN PUERTO RICO AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA.
Jon: THERE YOU GO, FOLKS. "PUERTO" TO "PORTO" IN JUST UNDER EIGHT MINUTES. IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP UP THE "PUERTO," YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE  HABIT OF SAYING PARROTS PATIENT ALL THE TIME. "PUERTO POTTY." I WILL PICK YOU UP AT THE "PUERT AUTHORITY."  OF COURSE, THE ACT SENGTD PRONUNCIATION ON THEIR HOME ISLAND IS NOT THE ONLY TRICK  ROLLED UP THE PRESIDENT'S SLEEVE.
EVERY BORIQUAS IS HERE. MARC ANTHONY SHOWED UP TODAY. EVEN IN THE NBA FINALS JJ BAREA IS DOING GOOD ON THE HOOPS. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE IS AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE, OR AS ARROZ CON GANDULES. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HE NAILED THAT ONE, HUH? HE HAD TO CHECK HIS PAPER THREE TIMES ON THAT ONE. ARROZ... CON... [LAUGHTER] [BLEEPED] GANDULES. ALL RIGHT. SO HE NAILED IT. WHAT'S NEXT?
NOW THE PRESIDENT LEFT ABOUT AN HOUR EARLIER THAN EXPECTED SO  HE SPENT A TOTAL OF FOUR HOURS HERE.
Jon: FOUR HOURS. SEE, THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU DON'T BRING BIDEN ALONG. YOU CAN JUST GET IN AND OUT AND SALE TEAM SIX THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND TIME SITTING ON THE TARMAC WHILE OLD J.P. GOES BO DEREK. SEVEN HOURS ON A PLANE TO SPEND FOUR HOURS IN PUERTO RICO. THE PRESIDENT MUST BE REALLY DRIVEN TO FULFILL ALL OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN PROMISES. OR...
THE 11 STATES WITH THE HIGHEST PUERTO RICAN POPULATION ALSO HAVE MOST OF THE ELECTORAL  VOTES HE WOULD NEED TO BE REELECTED.
I MEAN, FLORIDA WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BIGGEST PRIZE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS EYES ON. OF COURSE, ALWAYS A BATTLEGROUND. 847,000 PUERTO RICANS. YOU LOOK AT STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, OTHER KEY BATTLEGROUNDS, 366,000 PUERTO RICANS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ANYONE ELSE WEIRDED OUT ABOUT JUST HOW "RAIN MAN"  SPECIFIC ED HENRY'S NUMBER OF PUERTO RICANS IN AMERICA KNOWLEDGE IS? [AS ED HENRY]: "THEN THE PRESIDENT LANDED AT DULLES AIRPORT, EMPLOYER OF 78 PUERTO RICANS. [LAUGHTER] HEADED BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE, PASSING 3,700 PUERTO RICANS. IN HIS 22-MINUTE DRIVE. I HAVE THEIR NAMES."  [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE ON THE PRESIDENT'S PUERTO RICAN TRIP, WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR LATION CORRESPONDENT  AL MADRIGAL. AL, THANKS FOR JOINING US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AL, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL DOWN THERE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO PUERTO RICO? WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?
JON, TOTAL HOME RUN. AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE LIKE BASEBALL. I MEAN, BOTTOM LINE... [LAUGHTER] HE MADE A PROMISE TO VISIT THEM, AND HE DID IT. DEAL DONE. BUT, AND THIS IS A BIG PUERTO RICAN "BUTT"... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AL, ARE YOU SUGGESTING PUERTO RICANS HAVE LARGER BACK  SIDES, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT...
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. I DID NOT SAY THAT.
Jon: OKAY. WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?
THE PRESIDENT HAS NO IDEA THE CAN OF WORMS HE JUST OPENED. I MEAN, SURE, HE'S WINNING OVER PUERTO RICANS, BUT HE'S DOING  NOTHING FOR THE OTHER 147 LATINO NATIONALITIES. I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO HIS EFFIGY IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW?
JUST BECAUSE HE WENT TO PUERTO RICO, I GUESS BURNING IT?
BURNING? WHAT ARE WE, ARABS? THEY'RE HITTING IT WITH STICKS UNTIL THE CANDY FALLS OUT, JON. [LAUGHTER] MAN, THAT IS A GOOD TIME.
Jon: YEAH, AL, THERE ARE DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES, BUT AREN'T THERE ISSUES THAT UNIFY  THE LATINO VOTE?
YES, BUT EVEN WHEN WE AGREE ON AN ISSUE, IT'S FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. MEXICANS WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM SO THEY CAN STAY IN THE COUNTRY. PUERTO RICANS WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM TO KEEP THE MEXICANS OUT.
Jon: SO THERE ARE INTERHERITAGE RIVALRIES?
YES. I MEAN, IN THE PAST YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH TREATING LATINOS AS ONE GROUP. JUST THROW A CAMPAIGN AD UP ON TELEMUNDO AND YOU'RE IN. NOW YOU SHOW UP AT A RALLY IN THE WRONG COLOR GUAY ABARA, TOTAL [BLEEPED].
Jon: THE PUERTO RICAN VOTE IS IMPORTANT.
SURE, I GUESS. [LAUGHTER] LET ME SHOW YOU A MAP. ALL RIGHT. BY GOING TO PUERTO RICO, THE PRESIDENT HAS SECURED AMERICA'S PUERTO RICAN VOTE. [LAUGHTER] BUT THERE APPEARS TO BE A SOMEWHAT LARGER BLOCK OF LATINO VOTERS THAT ARE FEELING A LITTLE  LEFT OUT.
Jon: WOW. THAT'S AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENTIAL. HOW DOES HE GO AFTER THOSE VOTERS?
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAND IN FRONT OF THEM  AND USE THE PHRASE "ARROZ CON GANDULES." HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT  WHAT GOES INTO OTHER LATINOS' RICE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: REALLY? THAT REALLY WORKS? IT REALLY IS ABOUT WHAT GOES INTO THE RICE?
WE TAKE THAT PRETTY SERIOUSLY. YOU WANT MEXICAN SUPPORT, ARROZ CON FRIJOL
