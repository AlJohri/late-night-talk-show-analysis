(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO WAY BACK IN 2003 ON THIS PROGRAM WE INTRODUCED A SEGMENT DEVOUTED TO ROUNDING UP VARIOUS  NEWS ITEMS ABOUT THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA WHICH WE CALLED "GAY WATCH."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: THE TITLE... (LAUGHTER) FORGOT I STARTED THIS SHOW 43 YEARS AGO. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, THE TITLE, OF COURSE, A PLAY ON "BY A WATCH" AND THE  TITLE WORKED ON A LOT OF LEVELS BUT THAT SHOW'S BEEN OFF THE AIR  FOR LIKE 20 YEARS NOW SO WE NEED A MORE CONTEMPORARY CULTURAL REFERENCE FOR THE SEGMENT SO... NO. NO. I THINK... ACTUALLY, THAT'S BEEN OFF THE AIR FOR FIVE YEARS. MAYBE SOMETHING A BIT MORE HIP. (LAUGHTER) MEH. I NEED SOMETHING NEWSY THAT CAN CAN... HMM. OKAY. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. CLOSER. NO. NO. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S... (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST GO WITH THE ONE WE AGREED ON EARLIER. THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S IN THE SWEET SPOT. IN ANY CASE, OUR TITLE ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT'S CHANGED SINCE 2003. THE RIGHTS OF GAY PEOPLE HAVE PROGRESSED SIGNIFICANTLY. THEY'VE MADE GAINS IN OBTAINING ACCESS TO MARRIAGE, MILITARY SERVICE AND (BLEEP)ING BETWEEN  ANGST MELODRAMAS. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF MORE EQUALITY FOR GAY PEOPLE BUT SOME PEOPLE  ARE TRYING TO HOLD BACK THE FLOOD, STEM THE TIDE, TO PUT A FINGER IN... (LAUGHTER). UM... TO STEM THE TIDE. (LAUGHTER) CASE IN POINT: LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA'S PROP 8 BANNING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WAS RULED  UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY FEDERAL JUDGE VAUGHN WALKER. SOME OPPONENTS OF GAY MARRIAGE THINK THEY'VE FOUND A LOOPHOLE TO UNDO THAT.
PEOPLE ALWAYS SORT OF SPECULATED ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY AND IN APRIL HE CAME OUT AND HE  SAID "YES, I AM GAY AND I HAVE HAD THIS LONG TERM SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIP."  NOW SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITION 8 ARE TRYING TO OVERTURN HIS DECISION.
Jon: HE CAN'T BE GAY AND IMPARTIAL. (WHISPERING) YOU KNOW HOW DRAMATIC THOSE PEOPLE ARE. (LAUGHTER) WALKER RULING ON PROP 8 WOULD BE LIKE THURGOOD MARSHALL RULING A  CASE ABOUT RACE OR SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR RULING A CASE INVOLVING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OR JUDGE  JUDY TRYING TO BE IMPARTIAL IN A CASE INVOLVING SASS AND MOXIE. (LAUGHTER) OR A DOG JUDGE RULING ON A CASE CONCERNING PUBLIC BALL-LICKING. (LAUGHTER) IDEA FOR A SHOW. (LAUGHTER) DOG JUDGE. WE'LL CALL IT "JUSTICE OF THE PAW." (LAUGHTER) I'LL WORK ON THE TITLE. MEANWHILE AIR, CROSS THE COUNTRY IN TENNESSEE, GAY RIGHTS OPPONENTS ARE TAKING A DIFFERENT TACT.
NOW TO TENNESSEE WHERE A PROPOSED BILL WOULD PREVENT ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL  TEACHERS FROM TALKING ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY TO KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM. NO PUBLIC ELEMENTARY OR MIDDLE SCHOOL SHALL PROVIDE ANY INSTRUCTION OR MATERIAL THAT  DISCUSSES SEXUAL ORIENTATION OTHER THAN HETEROSEXUALITY.
Jon: YOU KNOW, KEEPING PEOPLE FROM SAYING THE WORD "GAY" IS NOT REALLY GOING TO  KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING GAY, YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER) BEING GAY ISN'T LIKE BEETLEJUICE. IF YOU SAY IT OUTLOUD SO MANY TIMES, YOU'RE GAY. (LAUGHTER) THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED BY STATE SENATOR STACEY CAMPFIELD WHO  MAINTAINS HIS "DON'T SAY GAY BILL" ISN'T ANTIGAY AT ALL.
IS THERE ANY DAMAGE DONE IN TERMS OF HEARING THE WORD  "HOMOSEXUALITY" TO CHILDREN IN A CONTROLLED SETTING LIKE A CLASSROOM?
WELL ACTUALLY, MY BILL IS NEUTRAL. IT DOESN'T SAY ANYBODY CAN SPEAK FOR IT OR AGAINST IT.
Jon: HERE'S A FUN FACT: AT THE SAME TIME THIS GUY'S BILL IS  MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH TENNESSEE SENATE, A BILL IS ALSO MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE TENNESSEE  STATEHOUSE THAT MANDATES SCIENCE TEACHERS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TEACH ALTERNATIVE THEORIES TO EVOLUTION. SO IN TENNESSEE THE DEFINITION OF NEUTRALITY IS GAY PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE BROUGHT UP BUT  WHETHER ADAM AND EVE HAD PET DINOSAURS WHEN THE EARTH WAS CREATED 6,000 YEARS AGO WE  SHOULD REALLY TEACH THAT CONTROVERSY. (LAUGHTER) NOW, WHILE SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HOLD GAY PEOPLE BACK, THEY DO HAVE SOME DEFENDERS. FORTUNATELY, ONE OF THEM IS ATTORNEY GLORIA ALLRED WHO SUED ATLANTA BRAVES PITCHING COACH  ROGER McDOWEL FOR MAKING HOMOPHOBIC COMMENTS TRAUMATIZE AGO FAN TBHOFS THE STANDS WITH  HIS TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS.
MR. QUINN HEARD COACH McDOWEL SAY TO THESE MEN "ARE YOU GUYS A HOMO COUPLE OR A  THREESOME?" THEN THE COACH ALLEGEDLY GRABBED A BASEBALL BAT AND STARTED  SHOVING THE SMALL END THROUGH A CIRCLE FORMED BY HIS FINGER AND THUMB SIMULATING SEX. THE COACH THEN ALLEGEDLY SAID "ARE YOU THREE GIVING IT TO EACH  OTHER UP THE..." AND USED THE WORD FOR... CRUDE WORD FOR REAR END. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE KIDS ARE STILL IN THE ROOM! (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE SITTING IN THE PINK SWEATERS. (LAUGHTER) YES, I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE WAS CHILDREN THAT HAD TO HEAR THAT  VULGAR LANGUAGE AT THE BALLPARK. (LAUGHTER) CLEARLY IT'S SUITABLE TALK ONLY FOR LAW OFFICE. AT LEAST THE KID DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THOSE OBSCENE GESTURES AGAIN BECAUSE... REALLY? (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER) GIRLS, YOU YOU GETTING THIS? ARE YOU SEEING THIS? BECAUSE I, GLORIA ALLRED, WANT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNGER GIRLS BROUGHT HERE TODAY WANT TO  SEE ME (BLEEP)ING DADDY'S HAND WITH A BASEBALL BAT. IF THERE WERE ANY TENNESSEE SEX ED TEACHERS THAT WANT TO GET  AROUND THE WHOLE "DON'T SAY GAY" THING. YOU CAN GET AROUND IT NICELY BY SAYING "SOMETIMES WHEN TWO MEN LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH
