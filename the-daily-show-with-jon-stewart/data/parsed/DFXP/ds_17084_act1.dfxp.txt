APRIL 9, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  READY TO GO
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. TIM WEINER, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ON THE F.B.I.. HE'LL BE HERE. APPARENTLY EVEN WATCHING IT WILL GET YOU AN F.B.I. FILE SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE WEEKEND'S FESTIVITIES. A BIG WEEKEND FOR WHAT WE CALL JUDEO CHRISTIANS. TWO MAJOR RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS AT THE SAME TIME. PRESIDENT OBAMA CELEBRATED BOTH OF THEM IN WHAT I BELIEVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE  PEOPLE HE ISN'T MUSLIM. NICE TRY. NICE TRY. YESTERDAY, OF COURSE, WAS EASTER. WHICH ALONG GOOD FRIDAY COMMEMORATES THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. WHEN MORNING THE WHITE HOUSE CELEBRATED IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED BY SCRIPTURE.
IN JUST ABOUT A HALF HOUR THEY'RE GOING TO START THE 134th ANNUAL WHITE HOUSE  EASTER EGG ROLL. THESE ARE SOME OF OUR FRIENDS HERE. THE POWER RANGERS OUT AND THE CHIPMUNKS. THE PENGUINS WUBS WUBS.
THE CAT IN THE HAT HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET ON CAMERA.
HERE ARE THE EGGS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: GREAT HOLIDAY FOR PEOPLE WHO GAVE UP LSD FOR LENT. YOU SEE ALL THEM, TOO, RIGHT? ACTUALLY THIS SCENE IS TRUE TO BIBLICAL SCHOLARSHIP. I REMEMBER THESE CHARACTERS FROM THE LAST SUPPER. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THAT WAS... ONE OF YOU WILL BETRAY ME. ALVIN! SO, THE WHITE HOUSE PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS FOR EASTER. PASSOVER IS THE SAME WEEKEND.
I'D LIKE TO WISH A HAPPY HOLIDAY TO ALL THOSE CELEBRATING PASSOVER LED BY  JEWISH MEMBERS OF MY STAFF WE'LL RETELL THE STORY OF THE EXODUS, LISTEN TO OUR YOUNGEST  GUESTS ASK THE FOUR QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE LOOK FORWARD TO A GOOD BOWL. MATS OWE BALL SOUP.
Jon: THAT'S IT? THAT'S WHAT JEWS GET? YOU GET A HUGE SHIN DIG ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN WITH EASTER FOR EVERY CHILDREN'S CHARACTER  THAT HAS EVER BEEN INVENTED INCLUDING THIS GUY? WHO THE (BEEP) IS THIS GUY? CAPTAIN PLANET? OH, WHAT'S HIS SUPER... HE'S CAPTAIN PLANET. HEY, KIDS. MY SELLING POINT FOR MY PEOPLE IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOUP. IT'S THE AVENGERS VERSUS THE JEWISH MEMBERS OF MY STAFF. HEY, KIDS, WHO WANTS TO MEET DEBER WASSERMAN SHULTZ? WHERE IS EVERYBODY GOING? LOOK, AND I GUESS IT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY SEDERS ARE BORING. BUT THIS ISN'T A PHOTO WE'RE SHOWING. IT'S VIDEO. ALLOW ME TO GET PERSONAL FOR JUST A MOMENT. AS A FATHER OF MIXED-FAITH CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CHRISTIAN AND JEWISH  HOLIDAYS, I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL THAT WE JEWS ARE GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED OUT HERE. IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT, JEWS? CAMERA 3. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE'VE ALREADY CONCEDED DEFEAT IN THE CHRISTMAS VERSUS HANUKKAH KURFUFFLE, SEEING  THAT THE RISIANS ARE CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF THEIR SAVIOR AND HANUKKAH IS  ACKNOWLEDGING OIL LASTING LONGER THAN IT WOULD NORMALLY LAST. AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, TRUTH BE TOLD, THERE IS REALLY NO GAUGE. HOW MUCH OIL WAS IN THERE? IT COULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT DAYS WORTH OF OIL. IT COULD HAVE A VERY REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OIL. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS THIS. THERE'S NO CONTEST THERE. HANUKKAH, CHRISTMAS. NO CONTEST. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THIS ONE TOO. THE KEY IS THE CHILDREN, PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT CRISTIANS HAVE FIGURED OUT. YOU GET THE CHILDREN, YOU WIN. LET'S CHECK OUT BOTH SIDES' HOLIDAY PITCH. KIDS, EASTER WEEKEND IS AN OBSERVATION OF CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION. SO, BOOM! A BASKET WITH CANDY. WE HAVE CHOCOLATE BUNNIES. WE GOT CANDY EGGS. WE GOT CHOCOLATE BUNNIES AND CANDY EGGS. HOW ARE CHRISTIANS THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH PLASTIC GRASS BY THE WAY? WE'RE THE ONES WITH HAY FEVER. ALL RIGHT. IT'S COOL. IT'S COOL. JEWS, WHAT HAVE WE GOT? WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR FREEDOM FROM SLAVERY. SO, BOOM! LET MY PEOPLE NOD. WE COULD HAVE GONE WITH A FREEDOM THEME FESTIVAL. INSTEAD WE CHOSE TO FOCUS ON THE SLAVERY PART OF THE DINNER. HEY, FIVE-YEAR-OLDS, BASKET FILLED WITH CANDY AND JELLY BEANS OR HORSE RADISH STILL IN ROOT FORM? WOULD YOU LIKE THE TREATS OF MAGICAL BUNNY BROUGHT YOU OR A BONE FROM A DEAD BABY LAMB? DON'T WORRY. WE USED ITS BLOOD TO MARK THE DOOR. WHICH EGG AM I GOING TO GO FOR, THE ONE FILLED WITH CHOCOLATE OR THE ONE FILLED WITH EGG? BECAUSE IT'S AN ACTUAL (BEEP) EGG. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SLAVES ATE. TASTE IT. OH, WAIT. BEFORE YOU EAT IT, MAKE SURE YOU DIP IT IN SALT WATER. IT REPRESENTS THE TEARS OF YOUR ANCESTORS. OH, GOOD. I SEE YOU'RE MAKING MORE. WE GOT TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH. THEY'RE CRUSHING US. I'M NOT SAYING WE LOSE OUR TRADITIONS. WE HAVE TO ADAPT IT WITH A SLIGHT NOD TOWARDS RECRUITMENT. I'M NOT SAYING WE HAVE TO GO JEHOVAH'S WITNESS ON THIS THING. WHAT'S WRONG WITH BRINGING A LITTLE JAZZ? WE HAVE A GREAT STORY HERE. MOSES PARTING THE RED SEA. HOW HAVE WE NOT TURNED THAT INTO A WATER PARK? WAIT. I'LL SEE YOU OVER AT THE RED SEA RIDE WHEN I'M DONE BUILDING ICE CREAM PYRAMIDS. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. DID YOU SEE IN THE CRISTIANS BOOK THIS YEAR WHO THEIR SPECIAL GUESTS ARE.
ON THIS EASTER SUNDAY A FAMILIAR FACE HELPING TO DELIVER THE SUNDAY SERMON. QUARTERBACK TIM TEBOW.
Jon: THEY'VE GOT TEBOW. TIM TEBOW, SUPER STAR NFL QUARTERBACK HELPING THEM CELEBRATE EASTER. HE'S DRAWING LIKE 20,000 PEOPLE. WHO DO WE HAVE? THE SAME GUEST EVERY YEAR, ELIJAH. HE CAN'T EVEN BE FOUND. OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE ALSO COULD GET A SUPER STAR JEWISH QUARTERBACK TO DELIVER  THE PASSOVER STORY BUT MY GUESS IS A SUPER STAR JEWISH QUARTERBACK IS AROUND THE SAME  LIKELIHOOD AS ELIJAH SHOWING UP. LET'S AT LEAST COMPETE WITH THE MAKE BELIEVE EASTER BUNNY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU PASSOVER PETE, THE GUITAR- PLAYING PIZZA EATING LION. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WHAT'S UP, PETE? HEY, KIDS, HEY, KIDS, HAVE YOUR PASSOVER PIZZA. NOW I KNOW TECHNICALLY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT PIZZA DURING PASSOVER. TECHNICALLY LIONS DON'T PLAY GUITARS AND QUITE FRANKLY BUNNIES DON'T DELIVER EGGS. LET'S JUST SAY THAT WHEN THE KIDS TURN 13 WE'LL TELL THEM THE REAL STORY. SO, JEWS, WE'VE GOT TO STEP IT UP A BIT. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'LL BE PLAYING THE LATEST TITLE IN MY HOT NEW JEWISH VIDEO GAME  PASSOVER LINE, RED SEA REDEMPTION, THE WANDERING. IT'S A FIRST-PERSON EXODUSER, WHERE KIDS CAN EXPERIENCE ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING LOST IN THE DESERT FOR 40 YEARS.
ASK FOR DIRECTIONS. DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING AGAIN?
Jon: ONLY 38 MORE YEARS TO GO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
