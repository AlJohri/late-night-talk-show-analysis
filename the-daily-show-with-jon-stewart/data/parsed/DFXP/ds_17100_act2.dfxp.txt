(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THANK YOU. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. ON SATURDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA OFFICIALLY KICKED OFF HIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN WITH A  RALLY AT VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY. WITH THE YOUTH AS EXCITED FOR OBAMA 2012 AS THEY WERE FOR OBAMA '08. WE SENT AL MADRIGAL TO INVESTIGATE.
Reporter: THE YOUTH VOTE. IT HELPED BUSH OBAMA OVER THE TOP IN 2008. THOUGH IT'S NO SURPRISE HE OFFICIALLY KICKED OFF HIS 2012 CAMPAIGN AT VIRGINIA  COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY. BUT WILL THE YOUTH VOTE BE A PROBLEM THIS TIME AROUND?
THE VULNERABILITY FOR THE PRESIDENT IN FIRING UP YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS ECONOMY.
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE PRESIDENT.
Reporter: FROM WHAT WE SAW AT THIS PRE-SPEECH CAMPAIGN RALLY JUST DOWN THE STREET  FROM V.C.U., AS OF MAY 5, 2012, YOUNG OBAMA SUPPORTERS ARE FIRED UP AND READY TO GO.
I'M FIRED UP AND PAST READY TO GO.
ARE YOU REALLY COMMITTED TO THIS EFFORT?
YEAH, MAN. I'M COMMITTED.
(SCREAMING).
Reporter: DO YOU THINK YOU CAN KEEP THIS ENTHUSIASM UP UNTIL NOVEMBER.
I THINK I CAN BECAUSE I DRINK BUD LIGHT LIKE IT'S WATER. DRINK VODKA LIKE IT'S WATER. AT THE KIEHL A LIKE IT'S WATER.
Reporter: CAN YOU KEEP IT UP UNTIL NOVEMBER.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I COME IN HERE ALL THE TIME.
I'M (BEEP) FIRED UP.
Reporter: DO YOU THINK BARACK OBAMA WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE  COMBATIVE CONGRESS AND HE CAN ACTUALLY BE PROGRESS I HAVE BEEN IN HIS THEORETICAL SECOND TERM?
I SMELL WEED.
Reporter: SURPRISINGLY DESPITE A DARK AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE, THESE STUDENTS HAVE  MANAGED TO STAY HOPEFUL WITH SIMPLE REMEDIES. ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TOMORROW?
NO. TYLENOL AND WATER.
MY FUTURE STARTS MONDAY. MY WEEKEND STARTS ON FRIDAY.
I GET UP. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HANGOVERS BECAUSE I DON'T GET DRUNK.
Reporter: RIDING THIS WAVE OF ENTHUSIASM... WHO WANTS TO GO HEAR THE SPEECH? ... I LEFT THE UNOFFICIAL RALLY AND ARRIVED AT THE MAIN EVENT EXPECTING TO SEE THE  SAME PALGS AND ENERGY. INSTEAD, I FOUND THIS. AND THIS. AND THIS. PARTY SHIRTS BUT NO PARTY.
THIS PLACE HAS NO ENTHUSIASM. I MEAN I WAS AT THIS OTHER OBAMA RALLY. THAT HAD DANCING, AT THE KIEHL A SHOTS, KARAOKE.
WAS IT A CINCO DE MAYO PARTY?
NO IT WASN'T. (BEEP) WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, MAN?
Reporter: I WAS SICK OF THE CYNICS. I WENT BACK DOWN TO THE STREETS WHERE VOTERS ARE ENERGIZED AND ENGAGED WITH  ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER. WHAT ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU?
MAKE MARIJUANA LEGAL.
IF MARIJUANA WAS LEGAL, I WOULDN'T BE GOING TO JAIL ON TUESDAY.
Reporter: HOPE IS STILL IN THE AIR, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE UNTIL TUESDAY.
Jon: AL
