JUNE 30, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A BIG SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR OF "THE WEEKLY STANDARD," WILL BE JOINING US. HE'S A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. YET, YET, I HOPE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT A LESS CONTENTIOUS ISSUE THAN THAT, LIKE AFGHANISTAN. ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT A SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH SOMETHING THAT I FOUND ON THE TV BOX THIS MORNING THAT WAS MAYBE  ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
MARK HALPERIN. WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY?
ARE WE IN THE SEVEN-SECOND DELAY TODAY?
OH, LORDY.
I WANT TO CHARACTERIZE HOW I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT BEHAVED.
WE HAVE IT. WE CAN USE IT, RIGHT, ALEX?
YEAH, SURE, COME ON.
GO FOR IT.
I THOUGHT HE WAS KIND OF A DICK YESTERDAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: MARK HALPERIN, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST, EDITOR AT  LARGE OF "TIME" MAGAZINE JUST CALLED THE PRESIDENT A DICK. AND THAT WASN'T LIKE A SPONTANEOUS, LIKE, CAN'T CONTAIN MYSELF, YOU LIE! LIKE THIS ONE, YOU GUYS HAVE A DELAY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO CALL THE PRESIDENT A DICK. NOW, PEOPLE CAN ARGUE WHETHER THAT'S APPROPRIATE, WHETHER HALPERIN CROSSED SOME SORT OF  LINE, WHETHER OR NOT JOURNALISM HAS LOST ITS PROFESSIONALISM. PERSONALLY I COULD GIVE A ( BLEEP ). THAT HORSE LEFT THE BARN YEARS AND YEARS AGO. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT WHAT HE DID IS NOT WHAT HE DID. IT'S WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THEY CAME BACK FROM THE COMMERCIAL.
JOKING ASIDE, THIS IS A PRO FORMA APOLOGY. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE APOLOGY. HEARTFELT TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE VIEWERS. I BECAME PART OF THE JOKE BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE. I MADE A MISTAKE AND I'M SORRY AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT AND  I APOLOGIZE TO THE PRESIDENT AND TO THE VIEWERS WHO HEARD ME SAY THAT.
Jon: NOW, NOW, YOU KNEW HE WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE. BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS HIS APOLOGY WOULD BE CHAPERONED. ( LAUGHTER ) BY SHOW REGULAR WILLY GEIST' DISAPPROVING GLARE. LOOK AT THIS GUY. LOOK AT HIS FACE DURING THIS APOLOGY. LOOK AT IT! IT IS A PERFECT MIX OF DISAPPOINTMENT. IT HAS A DASH OF SADNESS. A SMIDGEN OF DISBELIEF. ALL WITH JUST A HINT OF "WHY THE ( BLEEP ) AM I IN SOME SHOT?" ( LAUGHTER ) SERIOUSLY. WHY IS HE IN THAT SHOT? YOU CAN'T GRAB A ONE-SHOT? NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING BECAUSE FOR MY MONEY, HAVING HIM THERE WORKS. IT HAS THAT LOOK OF, "NO, MISTER! YOU ARE GOING TO SIT HERE AND YOU ARE GOING TO TELL MR. FERGUSON WHY YOU BROKE HIS  ( BLEEP ) WINDOW. NOW WE'RE GOING OVER THERE RIGHT NOW." I ACTUALLY THINK FROM NOW OFROM  NOW ON, THIS GUY WILLY GEIST SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ALL OF OUR APOLOGIES.
I HAVE MADE TERRIBLE MISTAKES AND HURT THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT THE MOST.
I'M DEEPLY SORRY FOR MY IRRESPONSIBLE AND SELFISH BEHAVIOR.
I APOLOGIZE TO THE PUBLIC,.
MY HURT CAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ELSE'S HURT.
I AM PROFOUNDLY SORRY FOR ALL I HAVE DONE WRONG.
I REGRET DEEPLY ANY INJURY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE.
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT? WHAT?! FINE, I'LL SAY IT. I'M SORRY. IT'S LIKE MAGIC. THE ONGOING RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, AND ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, THINGS ARE TRENDING IN ONE  DIRECTION, MY FRIENDS--
POLLS SHOW THAT MITT ROMNEY IS LEADING THE G.O.P. FIELD FOR 2012.
HE'S AHEAD IN THE POLLS. HE'S WAY AHEAD IN THE MONEY. HE'S KNOT A MUCH STRONGER ORGANIZATION. HE'S GOT THE NAME RECOGNITION.
Jon: WOW. MITT ROMNEY IS THE ONE THE REPUBLICANS ARE TAKING TO THE BIG DANCE. ARE THERE ANY DRAWEXPWROOKZ WELL IT'S HARD TO GET EXCITED ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.
IF THE ELECTION WERE TOMORROW IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MITT ROMNEY. BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CHOICE.
Jon: WOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THE REPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT NOMINATING THE MORMON EX-GOVERNOR WITH PERCEIVED  SOFTNESS ON SOCIAL ISSUES. THEY'LL DO IT BUT WITH THE SAME ENTHUSIASM AS, SAY, SOMEONE TAKING THEIR COUSIN TO THE PROM. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. YOU MIGHT STILL GET LAID, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL THAT GREAT ABOUT IT. WHAT?! NO, I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! ( APPLAUSE ) I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT! I'M SORRY! SO JUDGMENTAL. ALL RIGHT, CLEARLY, REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING FOR AN OPTION. WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT?
JON HUNTSMAN MAKES HIS ENTRANCE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
IS HE LIKELY TO BECOME THE SORT OF ANTI-ROMNEY CANDIDATE FOR THE REPUBLICANS?
Jon: THE ANTI-ROMNEY. HE'S A HANDSOME MORMON EX-GOVERNOR WITH PERCEIVED SOFTNESS ON SOCIAL ISSUES. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S NOT THE ANTI-ROMNEY. HE'S THE CANDIDATE FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD VOTE FOR ROMNEY BUT ARE CONCERNED ROMNEY HAS TOO  MUCH NAME RECOGNITION. ( LAUGHTER ) COME ON, PEOPLE! GIVE ME SOMEBODY TRULY DIFFERENT.
I PERSONALLY THINK MICHELE BACHMAN, YOUR COLLEAGUE, IS GOING TO BE A REAL CHALLENGER TO  MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: THERE YOU GO, MICHELE BACHMAN. SHE COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT. HE'S A MAN. SHE'S A LADY. HE'S TALL. SHE'S SHORT. HE LOOKS DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA. SHE LOOKS JUST TO THE RIGHT OF IT. ( LAUGHTER ) HER CAMPAIGN GOT OFF TO A RUNNING START WHEN SHE DECLARED  HER CANDIDACY IN HER BIRTH PLACE OF WATERLOO, IOWA.
WHAT I WANT THEM TO KNOW IS JUST LIKE JOHN WAYNE WAS FROM  WOORTLY, IOWA, THAT'S THE SPIRIT I HAVE, TOO.
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE GOT HER JOHN WAYNES CONFUSED. JOHN WAYNE LIVED ABOUT 150 MILES AWAY FROM WATERLOO. JOHN WAYNE GACY, WHO RAPED AND KILLED 33 MEN AND BOYS DID LIVE IN WATERLOO BEFORE HIS KILLING  SPREE BEGAN. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE GOT HER JOHN WAYNES CONFUSED? MAYBE SHE WAS LIKE, YO! I'M FROM WATERLOO, SERIAL KILLER STRAIGHT UP. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST GOT IMPLANTS. NICE GOING, MICHELE BACHMAN. I'M SURE SHE ENDEARED HERSELF TO HER HOME TOWN. I BELIEVE THE WATERLOO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SENT HER A THANK YOU CARD. ( LAUGHTER ) SHE MIXED UP SOME NAMES. SHE'S NOT SCREWING UP THE IMPORTANT STUFF LIKE THE ERA OF HISTORY ON WHICH SHE BASES HER  ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT.
YOU SAID THE FOUNDING FATHERS WHO WROTE THE CONSTITUTION AND  THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ENDS SLAVELY. WITH RESPECT, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, THAT WAS TRUE. HE WAS A VERY YOUNG BOY WHEN WITH HIS FATHER SERVING AS HIS SECRETARY. HE TIRELESSLY WORKED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE TO MAKE SURE WE DID, IN FACT, ONE DAY, ERADICATE SLAVERY.
HE WASN'T ONE OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS MOST CERTAINLY WAS A PART OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR ERA. HE WAS A YOUNG BOY BUT HE WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVED.
Jon: RIGHT, BUT HE WASN'T A FOUND FATHER. HE WAS NINE AT THE TIME. IF HE HAD SIGNED THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE. HE WAS A KID. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL GIVE MICHELE BACHMAN CREDIT. SHE ACTUALLY MADE A NON-FOX APPEARANCE UNLIKE OTHER NONE-ROMNEY REPUBLICAN OPTIONS. SPEAKING OF WHOM, WHY WAS PALIN IN IOWA.
SARAH PALIN IS IN IOWA TONIGHT TO ATTEND A MOVIE PREMIERE. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ANY MOVIE. THE FILM IS CALLED "THE UNDEFEATED" AND OFFERS A POSITIVE PORTRAIT OF HER LIFE  AND CAREER.
Jon: ANOTHER TWO THINGS. FIRST, THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE LOSING VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE 2008 ELECTION  IS CALLED "THE UNDEFEATED." ( LAUGHTER ) SECOND, YOU'RE CLEARLY RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT.
WHAT WE SAY ON THE FISHING BOAT STAYS ON THE FISHING BOAT. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ANNOUNCING ANYTHING.
Jon: YES, WHY ANNOUNCE. IT WOULD RUIN THIS SLIIOUS WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE TENSION. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT'S WHAT KILLED "MOONLIGHTING." GOVERNOR PALIN, I CERTAINLY HOPE  YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT, IF YOU'RE JUST RIDING AROUND IN A GIANT  BUS WITH YOUR NAME ON IT TO CATCH CAUCUS STATE PREMIERES OF A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT YOURSELF? THAT'S FREAKY. ( LAUGHTER ) DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE LIKE A CHIMP IN A FERRIS WHEEL FROM  MICHAEL JACKSON TERRITORY? I'M NOT APOLOGIZING! NO, I'M NOT APOLOGIZING FOR THAT! I THINK IF SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IT'S A WEIRD THING TO DO. ( LAUGHTER ) FINE. ( BLEEP ) IT! I'M SORRY! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, I THINK I MAY HAVE ISOLATED THE REPUBLICANS' PROBLEM. IT'S NOT THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE TOO FEW CANDIDATES. IT'S THAT THE CANDIDATES THEY DO HAVE ARE DOPER-GANGERS. THEY HAVE THE HANDSOME MIDDLE AGED MORMON TWINS. THEY HAVE THE AMERICAN HISTORY-CHALLENGED HOTNESS. THEY HAVE CONSERVATIVE FIRE BRANDS FROM GEORGIA, AND OF COURSE A PAIR OF OAK TREES. ( LAUGHTER ) ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN BE THE
