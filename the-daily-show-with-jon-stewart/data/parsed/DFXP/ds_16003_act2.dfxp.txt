Jon: WELCOME BACK. BIG NEWS. BIG NEWS. BIG NEWS OUT OF THE PENTAGON THIS WEEK. THE COMMANDER OF THE N.F.L. AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAS BEEN RELIEVED OF HIS COMMAND. OBVIOUSLY THIS ONLY HAPPEN UNDER EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS, DERELICTION OF DUTY, TREASON, OR IN THIS CASE...
THE NAVY HAS PERMANENTLY RELEASED CAPTAIN OWEN HONORS FOR POOR JUDGMENT OVER A SERIES OF  RAUNCHY VIDEOS.
Jon: REALLY RAUNCHY VIDEOS. YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT IN THE MILITARY SINCE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. WHO CAN FORGET GEORGE WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE WITH PRETENDING TO HAVE A BUTTERNUT  SQUASH PAINTED... TROOPS LAUGHED SO HARD THEY NEARLY GAVE AWAY THEIR POSITIONS. ALL RIGHT. SO CAPTAIN HONORS OF THE NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIER "THE USS ENTERPRISE," A TROOP  COMMISSIONED BY ADMIRAL H.T. NERDLINGTON, HAS LOST HIS JOB FOR MAKING VIDEOS TO POST HIS MORALE. THEY MUST BE VILE.
GAY SLUR, MIMICKED MASTURBATION AND SIMULATED SEX ACTS.

WELL, THE SOMEHOWERING THING ACTUALLY SEEMS NICE. YOU MIGHT EVEN WANT THE USE THAT IN THE AD TO HELP WITH THE RECRUITMENT. ♪ WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU ANYWAY ♪♪
Jon: OKAY. NOW I'M OFFENDED. (  LAUGHTER  ). BUT NOT AS A CITIZEN, AS A COMEDIAN. THE OLD EATING FAKE POOP GAG? YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT DEFENDING OUR BOARDERS, BUT I DO KNOW AS A PRODUCER, YOU TRY NOT TO STEAL YOUR BITS FROM "CADDYSHACK."  WHAT ELSE YOU GOT? ♪♪ (  LAUGHTER  ) PRETENDING TO MASTER BAIT THEN  YOU REVEAL THAT YOU'RE ONLY PUMPING GAS. THE ONLY YANK AND PRANK. WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT BEFORE? "CADDYSHACK"! IT'S AMATEUR HOUR OVER THERE.
ALL OF YOU BLEEDING HEARTS AND YOU FAG BOY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND HUG YOURSELVES.
Jon: THAT'S JUST WEIRD. IT IS IMPRESSIVE, COMP CAITSD SPLIT SCREEN SHOT WHERE ALL THREE CHARACTERS ARE THE SAME  PERSON HAVING TO PERFECTLY TIME THEIR PERFORMANCES THAT. IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION TIME AND EFFORT ALL FOR ONE LAME GAY JOKE. DOES KIND OF BEG THE QUESTION, SIR, DO YOU EVER PILOT THIS  [BLEEPED] SHIP? CAPTAIN, WE GOT A BOEINGY COMING IN HOT.
