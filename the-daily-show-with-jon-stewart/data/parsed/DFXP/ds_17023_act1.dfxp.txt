NOVEMBER 16, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE REQUESTED DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, ACTRESS, AUGUST OALL-AROUND WONDERFUL PERSON, DIANE KEATON WILL BE JOINING US A LITTLE BIT LATER. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. ( APPLAUSE ) DEAREST OPRAH... ( LAUGHTER ) WHY IS CHOCOLATE SO SINFUL? LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE TO DO TONIGHT. I'M NOT HERE TO LIE TO YOU. THE COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS IN TROUBLE. WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS DEFICIT, AND WE ONLY HAVE UNTIL NOVEMBER 23, ONE WE'LL FROM THIS VERY NIGHT TO SLASH $1.2 TRILLION FROM THAT DEFICIT OR WE WILL NOT GET OUR INHERITANCE. ( LAUGHTER ) ACTUALLY, I THINK THAT'S A PLOT FOR "BREWSTER'S MILLIONS."  MY POINT IS, IF WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT DEFICIT REDUCTION, WE ARE GOING TO NEED A HERO.
MOST OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION WILL BE PROPOSED BY A SO-CALLED SUPER COMMITTEE.
Jon:  AH, YES, THE SUPER COMMITTEE. A GROUP OF 12 LAWMAKERS WHO GAINED THEIR POWERS AFTER HAVING BEEN BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE  ACCOUNTANT AND ARE NOW CALLED UPON TO SLASH OUR DEFICITS. GO FORWARD, SUPER COMMITTEE. THE FATE OF THE NATION IS IN YOUR HANDS.
THE SUPER COMMITTEE CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON ANYTHING.
THEY CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT THEIR MEETs.
SOME COMPLAIN SENATOR JOHN KERRY IS TALKING TOO MUCH IN THE CLOSED DOOR MEETINGS?
Jon:  REAL ESTATE!
Jon:  REALLY! JOHN KERRY TALKING TOO MUCH. OF COURSE HE'S TALKING TOO MUCH. THAT'S HIS SUPER POWER. IT'S ALL HE'S GOT. IT WOULD BE LIKE TELL THE FLASH TO SLOW DOWN OR THE HULK NOT TO GET SO ANGRY OR MR. FANTASTIC TO  STOP BLOWING HIMSELF. ( LAUGHTER ). HE'S VERY LIMBER. TREMENDOUSLY LIMBER. ( LAUGHTER ) BLOWS HIMSELF OFF. I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S FOUND THE TIME TO STOP A SINGLE CRIME, QUITE FRANKLY. LAW ENFORCEMENTFRANK ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW. I HEAR YEAH. I WOULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ALL THINKING, PLEASE STOP  TALKING ABOUT SUPER HERO AUTO FELLATION, POINT TAKEN. SECOND, THE DEFICIT REDUCTION SUPER COMMITTEE IS GOING TO END UP LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. THERE WAS LAST YEAR'S BOWLES-SIMPSON COMMISSION, PROPOSALSED $4 TRILLION. THE DOMENICI-RIVAN TASK FORCE, $6 TRILLION PROPOSED OVER NINE YEARS, DIDN'T GET VOTED ON. THE GANG OF SIX PROPOSED A $3.7 TRILLION CUT. THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN, $2.4 TRILLION IN CUTS. THE THREE 10 ORGANIZE DEPUTY 6.9 TRILLION.
THIS TIME IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. THIS TIME FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION.
IF THIS SUPER COMMITTEE FAILS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT CONGRESS PASSES INTO LAW, THAT  SET OFF A TRIGGER, AUTOMATICALLY CUTTING $1.2 TRILLION FROM THE PENTAGON, MEDICARE PROVIDERS AND  OTHER PROGRAMS.
THIS PLAN CALLS FOR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN.
IT'S REALLY THE NEW DOOMSDAY SCENARIO.
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE TRAIN WRECK COMING ON THIS.
Jon:  I WISH THERE WAS A WORD THAT REFLECTED THIS TERRIBLE OUTCOME, JUST ONE WORD. I KNOW THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE. YOU KNOW, THEY'D BE LIKE FRANKEN STICANNEN LAGER, BUT THE TRAIN COMING TO DESTROY US IF THE  SUPER COMMITTEE DOESN'T COME TO AN AGREEMENT.
SEQUESTRATION.
SEQUESTRATION.
SEQUESTRATION.
Jon:  AH. ( LAUGHTER ) FAILURE WOULD TRIGGER SEQUESTRATION, A PROCESS THAT COMBINES CONGRESS'  LEAST-FAVORITE THINGS -- SEQUESTERING AND CASTRATION. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS PROCESS-- REALLY, WHEN YOU HEAR  THAT WORD, YOU ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY COVER YOUR GENITALS. I DON'T KNOW WHY. AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS DEFICIT REDUCTION PROCESS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER PROCESSES. CONGRESS ITSELF HAS CREATED A MECHANISM BY WHICH FAILURE TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL WOULD  TRIGGER CATASTROPHIC, AUTOMATIC CUT. IT IS IRONCLAD, A DECREE SENT DOWN FROM SINAI THEMSELVES. I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM WIGGLE THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE.
THE SEQUESTRATION IS NOT ENGRAVED ON GOLDEN TABLETS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  I'M SORRY, SAY WHAT NOW, THERE'S A TRIGGER. TRIGGERS CAN'T BE UNTRIGGERRED.
TRININGERS CAN BE UNTRIGGERRED.
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID HE'LL INTRODUCE A BILL TO REPEAL THE TRIGGER.
SENATOR TOOMEY IS SUGGESTING MAYBE THERE WILL NOT BE THOSE AUTOMATIC CUTS.
Jon:  YOU KNOW, CONGRESS, THIS IS WHY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT SOCIETY TO KNOW YOU CANNOT GIVE PEOPLE THE  POWER TO BOTH PENALIZE AND ABSOLVE THEMSELVES. WE WOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE ABSOLUTION. HERE'S A MOVIE NOBODY WOULD WATCH. THIS BUS WILL BLOW UP IF IT GOES UNDER 55 MILES PER HOUR! WELL, WE'RE ALREADY UNDER 55. ANOTHER HOW ABOUT 50 MILES AN HOUR? ( LAUGHTER ) CAN YOU MAKE IT 45? SURE, WHATEVER, THERE'S NO ( BLEEP ) BOMB, IS WHAT I'M SAYING. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, IT'S STUFF LIKE THIS THAT MAKES ME REALLY BEGIN TO  DOUBT-- IT REALLY MAKES ME BEGIN TO DOUBT CONGRESS' ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THESE FOLKS CAN ACTUALLY GET DONE?
CONGRESS RELEASED A NEW SPENDING BILL LAST NIGHT THAT CHANGES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLANS  TO MAKE SCHOOL LUNCHES HEALTHIER. THE NEW BILL KEEPS FRENCH FRIES ON THE MENU AT SCHOOL. IT ERIS RACES THE REQUIREMENT TO BOOST WHOLE GRAINS AND CALLS THE TOMATO PASTE ON PIZZAS A VEGETABLE.
Jon:  SO THE ONE THING THAT YOU'VE ALL BEEN ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND AGREE UPON IS THAT  PIZZA IS A VEGETABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) CLEARLY, ARE YOU IN THE POCKET OF BIG HOT POCKET. ( LAUGHTER ) BY THE WAY, WHO EVEN ASKED YOU TO DO THAT?
THE CHANGES WERE REQUESTED BY FOOD COMPANIES THAT MAKE FROZEN  PIZZAS AND BY POTATO GROWERS.
Jon:  AH. IT'S NOT DEMOCRACY. IT'S DID
