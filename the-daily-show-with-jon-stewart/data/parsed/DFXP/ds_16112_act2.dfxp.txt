SHOW. AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS A HOT NEW TREND THAT HAS FAKEN AMERICA BY STORM. IT'S CALLED BANKRUPTCY. AND IT'S NOW AS CLOSE AS YOUR CORNER MAILBOX.
SOME POTENTIALLY BAD NEWS TODAY FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO RELEASE UPON THE POSTAL SERVICE.
WITHOUT MAJOR AND FAST CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, SOME SUGGEST THE POSTAL SERVICE COULD  SHUT DOWN ALTOGETHER BY WINTER.
Jon: ALL IT TAKES IS MAJOR AND FAST CONGRESSIONAL ACTION? WELL, LET'S JUST SHUT THAT  [BLEEPED] DOWN NOW AND NOT MAKE THIS A LAST-MINUTE THING. HOW ABOUT THAT? THE POST OFFICE IS ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY. YESTERDAY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL WENT BEFORE CONGRESS TO ASK FOR THEIR HELP. I'M BEING TOLD THAT IS NOT THE POST MASTER GENERAL. DO WE HAVE A PICTURE OF THE REAL GUY? REALLY? THAT GUY? THAT GUY'S A GENERAL? HE LOOKS LIKE HE MANAGES A STAPLE. I'M BEING TOLD HE BASICALLY RANS A VERY POORLY RUN STAPLES. ANYWAY, HE WENT BEFORE CONGRESS YESTERDAY, AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S COMING. HE'S GOING TO ASK FOR A BIG OLD GOVERNMENT BAILOUT, A SHORT-TERM, STOPGAP MEASURE.
SHORT-TERM, STOPGAP MEASURES WILL NOT HELP. THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS MADE A NUMBER OF POLICY PROPOSALS ALLOWING THE POSTAL SERVICE TO  RESTRUCTURE ITS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND MAKE IT INDEPENDENT OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS. WE NEED TO ACCELERATE WORKFORCE REDUCTION BY AS MANY AS 220,000 EMPLOYEES.
Jon: OH, THAT'S HOW, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LAY OFF 220,000 POSTAL WORKERS. WHAT WOULD GO WRONG WITH THAT? [LAUGHTER] AFTER ALL, THE PHRASE "GOING POSTAL" IS VIRTUALLY SYNONYMOUS  WITH REACTING WELL TO BAD NEWS. [LAUGHTER] IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE POST OFFICE IS STRUGGLING, IT'S AN INSANE BUSINESS MODEL. SOMEONE COMES TO YOUR HOUSE, TAKES SOMETHING YOU'VE WRITTEN, AND BRINGS IT TO A PERSON THAT YOU WANT THEM TO GIVE IT TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD FOR LIKE 50 CENTS. OH, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS. ITES AMAZING. I'M SURPRISED THE POST OFFICE HAS LASTED THIS LONG. THERE WAS A COMPANY IN NEW YORK CALLED URBAN FETCH.COM, A DOOR-TO-DOOR DELIVERY SERVICE  FOR YOUR WHIMS, LIKE AMAZON MEETS DOMINO, A SERVICE PEOPLE TOO HIGH TO GO OUT AND GET  THINGS BUT NOT TOO HIGH TO WANT THINGS. SO YOU WOULD GO ONLINE AND YOU WOULD ORDER IT. THIS IS TRUE. YOU WOULD GO ONLINE AND ORDER, I DON'T KNOW, "SCARFACE" AND TWO  PINTSES OF COOKIE DOUGH ICE CREAM. AND SOME SCHMUCK ON A BIKE WOULD BRING IT TO YOUR HOUSE WITHIN LIKE 30 MINUTES AND NO  [BLEEPED], COMPLIMENTARY FREE COOKIE, A T-SHIRT AND YOU WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TIP THIS PERSON. MEANWHILE, UNBEKNOWNST TO YOU, YOUR EQUALLY HIGH ROOMMATE HAD NOT TEN MINUTES EARLIER PLACED  AN ORDER FOR "GOOD FELLAS" AND TWO PINTS OF CHERRY GARCIA AND A  DILDO THAT GLOWS IN THE DARK. SO WHILE ONE WAS HEADING BACK TO THE DVD ICE CREAM WAREHOUSE, ANOTHER WAS BEING DISPATCHED TO COME TO THE SAME ADDRESS FROM THE DVD ICE CREAM DILDO HOUSE. MY POINT IS THIS: I MISS THESE  [BLEEPED] GUYS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT... WE ALL KNEW THIS THING WAS NOT GOING TO LAST. THE POST OFFICE IS ONLY INCREMENTALLY LESS CRAZY THAN THAT. SO I DON'T SEE HOW THEY SAVE IT. ALTHOUGH THE POSTMASTER GENERAL IS SPEAKING BEFORE CONGRESS. PERHAPS ONE OF OUR FINE ELECTED OFFICIALS HAS A PLAN TO SAVE THE DAY, SENATOR CLAIRE McCASKILL.
I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND CORNY AND NAIVE AND POLLYANNAISH AND ALL OF, THAT BUT I HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY NOT TOO LONG AGO TO GO THROUGH A BOX OF LETTERS THAT MY MOTHER HAD FROM MY  GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE THAT WERE MY LETTERS I SENT TO HER IN COLLEGE.
Jon: GO ON.
MY KIDS ARE IN COLLEGE NOW. I DON'T HAVE A BECOMES LIKE THAT. IN FACT, I HAD TO IMPOSE A RULE, YOU CANNOT GET MONEY BY TEXT MESSAGE. I WAS GETTING LIKE THIS JIBBERISH SPELLING, "NEED MONEY, NUMBER 2, D-A-Y." IT'S RIDICULOUS.
Jon: THAT, THAT IS... THE MOST MASTERFUL JEDI NIGHT MOTHER GUILTING I HAVE EVER... CLAIRE  MS CASKILL JUST ENTERED THE FACT THAT HER CHILDREN DON'T WRITE HER ENOUGH INTO THE  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. RIGHT NOW MILLIONS OF JEWISH MOTHERS ACROSS THIS NATION ARE GIVING HER A STANDING OVATION. TOUCHE. WELL DONE, IRISH MOTHER. ANYWAY, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE HAS BEEN MARKETING CAMPAIGN ABOUT  THE VALUE OF A WRITTEN LETTER. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF SOMEBODY WOULD BEGIN TO MARKET THE VALUE OF SENDING A WRITTEN  LETTER TO SOMEONE YOU LOVE, YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED ON HOW YOU COULD STABILIZE SOME FIRST-CLASS MAIL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, THE COUNTRY, NAY, THE WORLD, IS MOVING INEXORABLELY  TOWARDS ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. THE POST OFFICE IS TO SPEND PUBLIC MONEY URGING US TO REVERSE THE TIDE. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. WHY DON'T WE JUST USE STAMPS AS ADHESIVE TAPE. HOW ABOUT THAT? THERE. LOOK AT THIS. HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS? I JUST FIXED THIS RIP, AND IT ONLY COST ME $5. MARKETING CAMPAIGN ABOUT LETTER WRITING? YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S GOOD. I KNOW JUST THE CELEBRITY TO GIVE US THE TIP CACHET IT NEEDS TO APPEAL TO TEXT-HAPPY GENYs.
I WOULD HAVE A MAIL MAN OR WOMAN DELIVER MAIL TO ME THAN GET AN E-MAIL.
THE KIDS LOVE THAT GUY, MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S THE DRAGON FROM "THE NEVER ENDING STORY."  BUT STILL, CLAIRE McCASKILL, WE HERE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I... I MAY HAVE SOLIDIFIED A FIRST-CLASS TICKET TO HELL WITH THAT JOKE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
