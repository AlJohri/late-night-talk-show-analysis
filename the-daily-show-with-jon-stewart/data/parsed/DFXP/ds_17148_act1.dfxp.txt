Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) MY NAME IS JON STEWART. CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. MY GUEST TONIGHT NEW YORK SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. IT   150ES 1:00 ON THE EAST COAST.

JOHN.
AL MADRIGAL, TELL ME YOU'VE GOTTEN INSIDE THE PERIMETER.
I'M VERY CLOSE TO THE CONVENTION CENTER. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT MY CAMERA GUY DIDN'T GET IN. (LAUGHTER) I ASKED ONE OF THE COPS HOW TO GET A CAMERA THROUGH THE  CHECKPOINT HE SAID "THEY BROUGHT ME IN FROM ATLANTA, HOW THE (BLEEP) SHOULD I KNOW? STPHAOUPL JASON JONES, ARE YOU THERE?
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THEY'VE ASKED ME TO DO. I'VE GOT 40 POUNDS OF YES CREDENTIALS AROUND MY NECK. LOCAL COPS, MALL COPS, I BORROW ADD (BLEEP)ING SEGWAY AND STILL I RAN INTO A BARRICADE AND WHEN  THEY TOLD KNOW GO BACK THE OTHER WAY I RAN INTO ANOTHER (BLEEP)ING BARRICADE!
Jon: THERE'S A LOT OF SECURITY, I GUESS, SAMANTHA.
JON, THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA HAS A LOT OF SECURITY. THIS (BLEEP) IS INSANE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELL, THANK YOU, GUYS, WE'LL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU LATER. LISTEN, LAST NIGHT. .. (APPLAUSE) THE AUDIENCE APPEARS TO HAVE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE. LAST NIGHT WAS THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, OF COURSE, THE MEMORY OF LAST WEEK'S REPUBLICAN PLATITUDETHON IS STILL FRESH IN EVERYONE'S MIND. THE CONVENTION THAT TAUGHT US THAT AMERICA IS THE GREATEST SELF-RELIANT MOM AND DAD EAGLE  CREATOR THAT HAS EVER EXISTED IN THE HISTORY OF JESUS! LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.
GOD BLESS OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN HARM'S WAY TODAY.
RESPECT THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY CONCERNED ABOUT DECAYING MORAL VALUES.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE GREATEST JOB GENERATING OPPORTUNITY-EXPANDING COUNTRY  EVER CREATED!
Jon: YES, REPUBLICANS WE KNOW GOD, FAITH, FAMILY, JOBS, IT'S... SORRY? OH, THOSE WERE THE DEMOCRATS? (LAUGHTER) (BLEEP) REALLY? YES, IF YOU TUNED IN LAST NIGHT, NOT ONLY WOULD YOU HAVE GOTTEN A STRONG DOSE OF SUPPOSEDLY REPUBLICAN-OWNED THEMES OF  FAMILY VALUES, SELF-RELIANCE AND FAITH, THE DEMOCRATS EVEN THREW IN SOME BONUS PATRIOTISM, INCLUDING TALK OF MILITARY FAMILIES, SACRIFICE, AND ACTUAL WAR HEROES! IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT LAST WEEK THE REPUBLICANS LOADED UP THEIR STAGE WITH DIVERSITY TO  FIGHT THE NOTION THEY'RE A PARTY OF WHITE GUYS. LAST NIGHT, THE DEMOCRATS PUSHED BACK ON THEIR STEREOTYPE WITH SO MANY SOLDIERS AND CLERGYMEN YOU  COULD ALMOST FORGET YOU WERE WATCHING THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
I'M JEWISH, I'M GAY, I'M A FATHER.
Jon: ALMOST. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, DEMOCRATS HAD THE DIVERSITY ANGLE WELL COVERED BY  FILLING THE CONVENTION HALL WITH DEMOCRATS. (LAUGHTER) YET, BLACK PEOPLE, ASIANS, SIKHS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, HIPPIES! VETERANS! BABIES! 1940s BOXING REPORTERS! 1840s SHERIFFS! NA'VI AMERICANS! GAY SERVICE DROIDS! MUPPET AMERICANS AND, OF COURSE, NEWMAN! HELLO, NEWMAN! BY THE WAY, THAT WAS REAL. NEWMAN WAS ACTUALLY THERE. (LAUGHTER) HOW EFFORTLESSLY DIVERSE IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? REMEMBER THE FOLKS AT THE R.N.C. OVERRISING LATINO STAR MARCO RUBIO? THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT ONLY A RISING LATINO STAR IN SANTONIO MAYOR JULIAN CASTRO, THEY HAVE  AN EXTRA ONE OF HIM IN CASE HE BREAKS! IT'S UNBELIEVABLE! DEMOCRATS HAVE SO MANY LATINOS THEY'VE GOT DOUBLES! (LAUGHTER) COLLECT THEM ALL, TRADE WITH YOUR FRIENDS. (LAUGHTER) BUT ALL OF THAT WAS TANGENTIAL TO D.N.C. NIGHT ONE'S PRIME  DIRECTIVE: BEATING BACK THE REPUBLICAN NARRATIVE THAT OBAMA WAS A FAILED PRESIDENT WHO HAD  ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING. AND BEAT IT BACK THEY DID.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY.
SAVED A MILLION JOBS.
THANKS TO BARACK OBAMA, JAMES IS WORKING 60 HOURS A WEEK ON THE JEEP LIBERTY LINE.
YES! TODAY JAMES' LIFE IS ENDLESS TOIL AND MISERY THANKS TO BARACK... OH. ANYWAY, THE POINT IS... I'M SORRY, YOU'RE NOT DONE?
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS KEPT THOUSANDS OF FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE JOB.
HE'S SAVED THE JOBS OF TEACHERS.
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COURAGE...
HE INVESTED IN CLEAN ENERGY, MADE HEALTH CARE A RIGHT.
Jon: MADE AMERICAN BABIES 15% CUTER! HE INVENTED A CAR THAT RUNS ON HUGS! PRESIDENT OBAMA SET UP THE JOLLY GREEN GIANT WITH THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. OH, YES, IT SEEMS OBVIOUS NOW! (LAUGHTER) ANYTHING ELSE?
WHEN A VIOLENT EGYPTIAN MOB STORMED THE ISRAELI EMBASSY IN  CAIRO IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO INTERVENED TO ENSURING THE SAFETY OF THE ISRAELIS.
Jon: WHAT IS HE (BLEEP)ING IRON MAN NOW? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK, WE GET IT. OBAMA'S BEEN BUSY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WORKED WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WALKED WITH SENIORS. WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. WITH AMERICA'S WOMEN. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WALKED WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY.
Jon: BUT WHEN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY LOOKED BACK, THERE WAS ONLY ONE SET OF FOOTPRINTS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THOUGH, WITH THAT COMMITMENT TO ALL THAT WORK  MY GUESS IS IT'S THE FAMILY LIFE THAT'S SUFFERED.
THAT'S THE MAN WHO SITS DOWN WITH ME AND OUR GIRLS FOR DINNER NEARLY EVERY NIGHT.
Jon: AND EATS LIKE A (BLEEP)ING HORSE. (LAUGHTER) YOU HEARD HOW MUCH HE WALKS, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) SAVING JOBS IN THE DAY, HISPANIC SPEED WALKING IN THE AFTERNOON, SITTING DOWN WITH THE KIDS AT DINNER. BEDTIME?
EVERY NIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA READS TEN LETTERS FROM EVERYDAY AMERICANS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I... I AM A LAZY AS (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE, OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT A NIGHT. A LOT OF STORY TELLING BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY OBAMA'S ACTIONS.
Jon:ACTIONS..
AND THEY'RE NOT ALONE, JON, I, TOO, HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THIS PRESIDENT IN A PERSONAL WAY.
Jon: JON, IS THAT AN IMMIGRATION RELATED ISSUE?
NO, IT ISN'T, BAD GUESS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) JON, LAST YEAR WHILE COVERING A WHITE HOUSE PERES BRIEFING I CHOKED ON A HOT DOG. (LAUGHTER) AS I FELT MY LIFE SLIPPING FROM ME SUDDENLY THERE WAS PRESIDENT  BARACK OBAMA LEAPING OVER THE ROSE BUSHES TO CATCH ME BEFORE I HIT THE GROUND! CRADLING MY HEAD GENTLY UPON HIS LAP JUST LIKE THAT HE THRUST HIS OWN FINGERS DOWN MY THROAT JUST  SO, YANKED THE OBSTRUCTION CLEAR AND THEN AS SWEET OXYGEN FILLED MY LUNGS ONCE AGAIN HE SAID THE  WORDS THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. "CAN WE GET THIS MAN ANOTHER HOT DOG?" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: REALLY.
YES. YES.
Jon: HE SAID YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER HOT DOG?
YES, HE DID.
Jon: YOU HAD JUST CHOKED ON A HOT DOG!
EXACTLY, JON, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULDN'T LET ME GIVE UP! (LAUGHTER) AND THAT IS WHY HE PERSONALLY CHEWED THAT HOT DOG FOR ME, TENDERLY RETURPBLG TATING THE WARM MEAT PASTE INTO MY MOUTH LIKE A MOTHER BIRD. JON, CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? IT WAS THE GREATEST HOT DOG I'VE EVER TASTED. (AUDIENCE REACTS) EVER. AND IT GETS BETTER. IT DIDN'T STOP THERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA THEN HELPED ME OPEN UP MY OWN SMALL BUSINESS. SELLING HIGH-QUALITY PREDIGESTED HOT DOGS AT REASONABLE PRICES, JON. I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TRY SOME IF YOU HAVE TIME.
Jon: YOU... YOU BROUGHT SOME SAMPLES HERE.
KIND OF, RIGHT THERE... (GAGGING).
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S OKAY. BUT THE STORE I HAVE IS A LITTLE MUCH, DON'T YOU THINK? IT'S ALL BEEN A LITTLE MUCH.
OF COURSE. THEY ALL ARE. BUT LOOK AT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE UP AGAINST, JON. LAST WEEK REPUBLICANS SPENT THEIR ENTIRE CONVENTION CONSTRUCTING A FICTIONAL OBAMA  AND ININVISIBLE CHAIR-BOUND TYRANT HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING AMERICA. IT'S FRANKLY ONLY NATURAL THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD COUNTER WITH THEIR OWN MYTHICAL OBAMA-- STILL  INVISIBLE, BUT THIS TIME SITTING ON A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT CHAIR. (LAUGHTER) OH, WHAT'S THAT, CHAIR? WHAT'S THAT? WELL, I CAN'T TELL JON TO GO DO THAT TO HIMSELF. OKAY, CHAIR, IF YOU INN CYST. JON, THE CHAIR SAYS GO (BLEEP) YOURSELF. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE CHAIR? THANK YOU, JOHN OLIVER,
