MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE HIT SHOW "MR. SUNSHINE."
I CAN'T PRETEND TO LISTEN TO YOUR PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ME.
WHAT'S WRONG?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING TO ME. ROMAN IS VERY SAD ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND THAT MAKES ME SAD. CRYSTAL IS VERY, VERY UPSET ABOUT A LITTLE BLUE PERSON. THAT MAKES ME UPSET. WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO ME?
YOU'RE BECOMING AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING.
WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT.
Jon:  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, MATTHEW PERRY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S UP?
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?
Jon:  NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jon:  YOU EXECUTIVE PRODUCE, YOU CREATED, YOU STARRED IN, YOU WROTE THE SHOW. YOU BRED THE SUPPORTING CAST. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU HAVEN'T DONE ON THE SHOW? THIS IS YOUR BABY.
THE THING THAT'S EASIEST IS THAT THE SHOW IS THAT ACTUAL  LENGTH OF THE CLIP DISPL REALLY?
YES, SO IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO.
Jon:  20-25 SECONDS.
25 SECONDSES, AND I HOPE YOU LIKE IT ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  "MR. SUNSHINE--"
MR. SUNSHINE --
FROM THE CLIP DOESN'T SEEM TO REALLY BE LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S DISINGENUOUS LABELING BUT--
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD GET IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK YOU  NECESSARILY GET IRONY.
Jon:  I'M SORRY? ARE YOU-- HOW DID YOU-- IS THIS YOU? IS THIS SOMEBODY YOU KNOW? IS THIS-- TALK TO ME. GIVE ME THE CHARACTER.
THE CHARACTER'S SORT OF A SOB  SOB-CYSTIC, SELF-CENTERED PERSON. WHAT?
Jon:  NOTHING! I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS.
SO I DID, I GUESS, THE MOST SELF-SERVING THING A MAN CAN DO-- I CREATED A TELEVISION SHOW  FOR MYSELF ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ONE OF THE FUNNY-- ONE OF THE FUN THINGS ABOUT IT IS YOU  GET TO COME UP WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERES. I DIDN'T REALLY DO IT ALONE. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THE SHOW. SO ONE OF THE CHARACTERS, THIS ACTOR NAMED JAMES LEJURE PLAYS THIS GUY WHO IS IMPOSSIBLY HAPPY. HE PLAYS A GUY WHO IS UNFLAPPABLY HAPPY AND THAT'S BASED ON MY BEST FRIEND IN THE  WORLD, THIS GUY NAMED MARK HOLDER WHO JUST LOVES BEING MARK HOLDER AND HE'S JUST THE THE  HAPPIEST GUY IN THE WORLD TO THE POINT IT'S REALLY AFFECTED OUR  FRIENDSHIP BECAUSE I'M NOT EXACTLY THAT WAY. AND I'LL SAY, LIKE, "HOW ARE YOU?" AND HE'LL GO, "OH, MAN, I CAN'T  BELIEVE HOW GREAT I AM. IF I WAS ANY BETTER, I'D BE TWO PEOPLE." AND HIS FACEBOOK STATUS REPORTS  SAY THINGS, YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE, "WHAT A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL DAY." I ACTUALLY STOPPED ASKING HIM "HOW ARE YOU?"  BECAUSE IT ANNOYED ME SO MUCH WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE. ONE DAY I FORGOT THIS RULE AND I SAID, "HOW ARE YOU?"  AND HE SAID, "I JUST DROPPED MY KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY." I SAID, "TERRIFIC, I'M GOING TO  GO MASTURBATE INTO SOME MONEY." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  LET MY SAY THIS.
SURE.
Jon:  DOESD NOT SEE THAT LAST LINE COME. THAT IS THE MARK OF A FINE STORY.
THANK YOU. I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU.
Jon:  YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW UP MASTURBATING INTO MONEY WITH I HAVE A FAVOR.
YEAH.
Jon:  IS IT CAN I HAVE A 20? WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I WAS HOPING WE COULD JUST GENTLY KISS ( LAUGHTER ) NO, BUT YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES  ON THE SHOW YOU HAVE VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE AND THEN YOU SAY, HEY, CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
Jon:  AND THROW IT UP ON THE WEB.
AND THROW THE REST OF IT UP ON THE WEB.
Jon:  SURE, SURE, SURE, SURE.
IT MAKES THEMSELVES SEEM REALLY IMPORTANT. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD DO THAT WITH ME JUST A LITTLE BIT LATER.
Jon:  NO, I THINK WE'RE GOOD. I THINK WE'RE GOOD. IT'S HOWEVER-- WE'LL DO THAT.
NO, NO, NO --
WE'LL THROW IT UP ON THE WEB. ESSENTIALLY, THE PART OF YOU THAT... MASTURBATING INTO MONEY. DOES THAT WORK WITH CHANGE, BY THE WAY? OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE PAPER MONEY?
I ACTUALLY HAVE A CHARCOAL SKETCH OF IT THAT I WILL SHOW YOU AFTER THE SHOW.
Jon, YOU KNOW, WHAT? WE ALL KNOW THE MARK HOLDER-TYPE CHARACTER AND IT IS. YOU DO SOMETIMES THINK THEY'RE BEING SO FRIENDLY, THEY'RE BEING  SARCASK LIKE YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE SOMETIMES WHERE THE LINE IS.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. I LOVE THE GUY. HE'S I'M THE GODFATHER TO HIS KIDS BUT STOP SAYING HOW HAPPY YOU ARE ALL THE TIME. IT'S DRIVING US NUTS.
Jon:  WERE YOU ON THE SHOW I DID AT PARAMOUNT ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO.
YEAH, AND I DON'T WANT TO EXWARPS YOU, BUT WHEN WE FIRST MET, I WAS ON YOUR ORIGINAL SHOW.
Jon:  THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU WERE A GUY WHO-- YOU WERE JUST STARTING OUT, YOUR SHOW DIDN'T HAVE --
IT WASN'T GOOD.
NO, IT WAS A GREAT SHOW BUT IT WAS LIKE, "REALLY, I GOTTA GO DO THAT?
Jon:  I KNOW. WE WERE THE CABOOSE.
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW YOU REFERRED TO YOURSELF AND NOW  YOU'RE THE PREEMINENT SOURCE OF NEWS IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon:  WE'RE PREEMINENT. WE'VE BEEN YEARS-- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STICKING BY FOR ALL THAT TIME. IT WAS VERY NICE.
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW AND I REMEMBER IT WAY BACK WHEN YOU ASKED ME IF I COULD  POTENTIALLY SET YOU UP WITH JENNIFER ANISTON, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE I  COULDN'T EVEN GET A DATE WITH JENNIFER ANISTON.
Jon:  HERE'S THE SAD THING-- EVERY GUEST WE HAD ON I ASKED THAT QUESTION. WE HAD A GUY WHO HAD CONDORS AND I SAID, "DO YOU KNOW JENNIFER ANISTON?"
I WOULD SAY MEKNOCKIM.
Jon:  MATTHEW PERRY
