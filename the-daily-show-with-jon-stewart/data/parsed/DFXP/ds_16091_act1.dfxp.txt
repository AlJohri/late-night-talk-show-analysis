JULY 18, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST THE YOUNG ACTOR DANIEL RADCLIFFE. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD HE'S THE STAR OF THE NEW FLICK HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BILLION  DOLLARS IN WORLDWIDE WEEKEND GROSS. SO EXCITING TONIGHT. I FOUND OUT SOMETHING SCIENTIFICALLY I DIDN'T KNOW WAS POSSIBLE. A CANADIAN CAN BREED WITH A GERMAN. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  DID YOU KNOW THAT? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THEY FIT  THEM TOGETHER. THEY'VE CREATED A NEW SPECIES A CANAD-ERMAN. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO FOOLING AROUND. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, OF COURSE, THE DEBT CEILING AND OUR ONGOING SEGMENT. THAT IS IN NO WAY HYPERBOLIC. AS AMERICA MOVES CLOSER TO JUST LAYING OUT A BLANKET IN FRONT OF OUR GARAGE AND  SELLING OFF ALL OUR OLD BOARD GAMES IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT TIME FOR ACTION IS SHORT.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS AN AGREEMENT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SET A DEADLINE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA NOW SAYS IT'S DECISION TIME.
Jon: OH, SNAP, COMMANDER IN CHIEF. THROWING DOWN A DEADLINE. ON FRIDAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BROKE OUT HIS "I MEAN BUSINESS" PODIUM.
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY RUNNING OUT OF TIME. SO WHAT I'VE SAID TO THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IS THAT YOU NEED OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 6  HOURS TO GIVE ME SOME SENSE OF WHAT YOUR PLAN IS TO GET THE DEBT CEILING RAISED THROUGH  WHATEVER MECHANISMS THEY CAN THINK ABOUT. (LAUGHING)
Jon: DAMN! REPUBLICANS, YOU OWE ME A 24 TO MOST LIKELY 36 HOURS TO BE ALL... WE WERE KIND OF THINKING OF MAYBE... DAMN! AND IF YOU DON'T, THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT YOU WILL BE ASKED AGAIN, YOU KNOW, FOR AT LEAST SOME SENSE OF WHAT YOUR PLAN IS BECAUSE... ANYWHO. ALL RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT, WHEN HE DOES LAY DOWN THE SMACKDOWN AND SAY YOU HAVE 24 TO 36 HOURS AND HE  TELLS YOU THAT ON FRIDAY, CERTAINLY BY MONDAY WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME PROGRESS.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU, JEFF. NO TALKS SCHEDULED AT LEAST AS OF YET FOR TODAY AND NO VISIBLE PROGRESS OVER THE WEEKEND.
Jon: HA! NO VISIBLE PROGRESS. NO VISIBLE. ALL THE PROGRESS OVER THE WEEKEND TOOK PLACE IN THE MIKE ROBEIAL WORLD NOT VISIBLE TO  THE NAKED EYE. REPUBLICAN BACTERIA QUITE BUSY ME TAP LIESING THE DEBT CEILING. I'M BEING TOLD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN EITHER. WHY WON'T REPUBLICANS NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH? IS IT BECAUSE PERHAPS THEY SENSE IN THE STAND-OFF AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH DOWN THIS  PRESIDENCY WITH THE SPUTTERING ECONOMY, HASTENING OBAMA'S INEXORABLE SLIDE TO ONE TERMSMANSHIP? OR PERHAPS IS IT SOMETHING THAT IT CLEARLY ISN'T.
WHY HAS THE DEBT LIMIT BEEN RAISED 60 TIMES? WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT? THAT SHOULD PUT HIM IN A POSITION THAT HE SHOULD NOT RECEIVE THE SAME KIND OF  RESPECTFUL TREATMENT WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT IN ORDER TO PAY OUR BILLS. WHY IS HE DIFFERENT?
Jon: HE'S THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO OWN A PORTUGUESE WATER DOG? HE'S... HE VOTED AGAINST RAISING THE DEBT CEILING IN 2006? WAIT, THAT CAN'T BE IT. JUST TELL US.
WHY IS THIS PRESIDENT BEING TREATED SO DISRESPECTFULLY? I AM PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT ONLY THIS PRESIDENT, ONLY THIS ONE, ONLY  THIS ONE HAS RECEIVED THE KIND OF ATTACKS AND DISAGREEMENTS AND INABILITY TO WORK. ONLY THIS ONE. READ BETWEEN THE LINES.
Jon: READ BETWEEN THE LINES. I CAN'T EVEN FOCUS. YOUR SHIRT IS LIKE AN OPTICAL ILLUSION FOR GOD'S SAKES. YOUR SHIRT'S LIKE ONE OF PAGE I CAN EYE POSTERS. MAYBE IF I JUST STAIR AT YOUR SHIRT, I'LL FIGURE OUT... OH! OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY. I'M NOT SURE THAT'S IT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST SAY THAT  IN THE FIRST PLACE? I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THE REASON REPUBLICANS WON'T WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE HE'S BLACK. IT'S BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S CRAZY.
UNLESS THE PRESIDENT GETS OFF HIS ABSOLUTE OBSESSION WITH RAISING TAXES.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUING OBSESSION TO RAISE TAXES.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET JOBS AS LONG AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS THIS  TAX OBSESSION.
Jon: HE IS OBSESSED. THAT EXPLAINS OBAMA'S NEW COLOGNE. WHY DO THEY TREAT THIS PRESIDENT DIFFERENTLY? BECAUSE HE'S NOT WEARING A SHIRT? DO ANY DEMOCRATS HAVE HAIR ON THEIR CHESTS? WEINER? FOR GOD'S SAKES? IS THERE SOME SORT OF LITMUS TEST? OF COURSE THE REPUBLICANS ARE REACTING TO THE PRESIDENT'S DEBT REDUCTION PLAN INCLUDING  REVENUE INCREASES SUCH AS CLOSING CORPORATE LOOPHOLES AND RESCINDING THE BUSH TAX CUTS ON THE RICH. THE RICH OR AS THE REPUBLICANS CALL THEM.
JOB CREATORS.
IT IS CERTAINLY MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THE JOB CREATORS.
GETTING LAUNCHED OFF THE BACKS OF THE JOB CREATORS.
STOPPING TAX INCREASES ON OUR JOB CREATORS.
Jon: REPUBLICANS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE RICH. YOU HAVE TO REFER TO THEM AS JOB CREATORS. YOU CAN'T EVEN USE THE WORD RICH. YOU HAVE TO SAY THIS CHOCOLATE CAKE IS SO MOIST AND JOB CREATOR. MY FAVORITE COMIC BOOK IS JOB CREATOR AND JOB CREATOR. THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE... THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE, IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT A DEBATE, SEEMS AT THIS POINT STILL IN ITS CYNICAL STRATEGY PHASE WHICH OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN GET  AWAY WITH AS LONG AS THE PUBLIC DOESN'T DEMAND ACTION ON THE DEBT CEILING. TOO BAD FOR THE POLITICIANS THAT WE HAVE A VIBRANT AND FOCUSED MEDIA CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY. DEDICATED TO BATTLING OBFUSCATION AND BRINGING CLARITY.
ONLY 20 TO 25% OF AMERICANS WANT A DEAL THAT IS ONLY SPENDING CUTS.
ALMOST 70% OF AMERICANS WANT A SOLUTION THAT INCLUDES BOTH SPENDING CUTS AND REVENUE INCREASES.
AN OVERWHELMING 55% OF AMERICANS WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TAX HIKE AND THE DEBT DEAL.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WANT TAX HIKES TO BE PART OF THE DEBT CEILING DEAL.
11% OF AMERICANS SAY THAT INCREASING GOVERNMENT SPENDING WILL BE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY.
AMERICANS BY ALMOST A 2 TO 1 MARGIN WANT THEIR MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO VOTE AGAINST  RAISING THE DEBT CEILING.
THERE'S NOW MORE AMERICANS WHO SAY RAISE IT. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS TO THE ECONOMY.
JUST 24% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT LIFTING THE DEBT LIMIT.
52% ARE IN FAVOR OF VOTING AGAINST RAISING THE DEBT KREEL
ABOUT 3% OF AMERICANS ADMIT TO WATCHING PORN AT WORK. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: NOW THAT YOU'VE SUFFICIENTLY BAFFLED YOU WITH NONSENSE WE RETURN TO OUR
