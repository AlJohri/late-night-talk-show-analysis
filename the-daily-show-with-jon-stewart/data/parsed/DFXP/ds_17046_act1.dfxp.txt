FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWARTMENT WE'VE  GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OH, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE, THIS OUR GUST TONIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE, THIS NEW NEW YORK "THE TIME OF OUR TIMES COLUMN NEST JOE NOCERA. WE'RE GOING TO YELL AND THROW THINGS. I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS SOPA, SOPA. SOPA THIS, SOPA THAT. I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEN IT HIT ME. THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO FIND OUT, THE OLD LAPTOP. [LAUGHTER] SO I'LL JUST LOOK IT UP.
WIKIPEDIA, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SITES ONLINE. IT'S BLACKED OUT TODAY FOR 24 HOURS. WIKIPEDIA AND OTHERS ARE GOING DARK. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: MAHURIN. MAMA.
WIKIPEDIA'S GONE DARK. WHAT DO THEY EXPECT US TO DO, GO TO THE LIBRARY? LIKE A COMMON MASTURBATOR. WHAT IS THIS, 2009? BUT I HAD TO FIND OUT ABOUT SOPA. AND WITH WIKIPEDIA DOWN, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TURN TO A NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE SOURCE... SORRY. THE NEWS.
TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE LAMAR SMITH INTRODUCED A BILL IN THE HOUSE CALLED THE STOP ONLINE  PIRACY ACT. IT'S CALLED SOPA. THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO KEEP WEB SITES FROM POSTING COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL ILLEGALLY. AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT TO ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN WEB SITES THAT DO THIS.
Jon: WHAT? SHUT 'EM DOWN? THAT'S A LITTLE DRACONIAN, ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, ACCORDING TO LAWYERS THAT HAVE CONTACTED US FREQUENTLY ALL DAY, IT  DOESN'T SHUT DOWN YOUR WEB SITE AND REMOVE IT FROM THE INTERNET. IT JUST MAKES IT SO THAT PEOPLE CANNOT IN ANY WAY ACCESS THE WEB SITE. SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE COMING UP WITH PLAN TO PREVENT TEEN PREGNANCY THAT INCLUDES FILLING  PENISES WITH CEMENT. [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE STILL THERE. YOUR PENIS IS STILL THERE. JUST NOBODY CAN GET AT IT. NOW, OF COURSE, AS OF NOW, EVERYBODY IS THINKING THAT WAS A RIDICULOUS RULE THAT. PROVISION HAS BEEN SCALED BACK. THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE OF SOMEWHAT TROUBLING ISSUES, THOUGH.
INDIVIDUALS WHO STREAM COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL COULD FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND PRISON TIME.
IF YOU RUN AN INTERNET SITE, FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR POSTING SAY TEN PIECES OF COPYRIGHTED MUSIC.
WHOA. THAT'S ROUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT, HOW CAN I EXPRESS THAT? LET ME SEE IF I CAN PUT THIS IN MORE DRAMATIC TERMS. IF YOU STREAM COPYRIGHTED MUSIC, YOU COULD GO TO JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK IS RIGHT. REST EASY. THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE IT AND ARE SUPPORTING IT ARE EXPERTS. YOU CAN STOP WORRYING, RIGHT? BILL SUPPORTER REPRESENTATIVE MEL WATTS.
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE JUST AS AN OLD COUNTRY BOY, AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN  UNDERSTAND THIS COMPLEX STUFF, WE NEED PARALLELS ON THE VIRTUAL... IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD TO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE REAL  WORLD WORLD, AND I THINK THIS BILL DRAWS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE.
Jon: YOU HAVE NO [BLEEPED] IDEA WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. HE SAID. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S OKAY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU'RE ONLY... I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH. YOU'RE ONLY THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUBCOMMITTEE. HEY, DOES ANYONE ON THESE COMMITTEES CHARGE WITH REGULATING THE INTERNET UNDERSTAND HOW ANY OF THIS  INTERNET STUFF WORKS?
I'M NOT A NERD.
I AM NOT A NERD.
I'M JUST NOT ENOUGH OF A NERD.
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO ASK SOME NERDS WHAT THIS THING REALLY DOES.
LET'S HAVE A HEARING, BRING IN THE NERDS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: REALLY? NERDS? I THINK ACTUALLY THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS "EXPERTS."  TO ENLIGHTEN YOU SO YOUR LAWS DON'T BACKFIRE AND BREAK THE INTERNET. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND BY THE WAY, WHEN DID CONGRESS TURN INTO OGRE. BY THE WAY, I'M BEING TOLD THAT THE USE OF THAT CLIP IS AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUE. NOW, LET ME ADDRESS FOR A LITTLE BIT NOT THE LAWMAKERS, BUT THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE  STEALING COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL, BECAUSE THAT IS A REAL ISSUE, ESPECIALLY FOR STRUGGLING ARTISTS TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING. THESE PEOPLE WHO PIRATE CLIPS OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL FOR THEIR OWN FINANCIAL GAIN ARE PARASITES. FEEDING ON THE WORK OF OTHERS SO THEY MAY THRIVE, AND I KNOW EVERYONE IS RIGHTLY CONCERNED  ABOUT THE ARTISTS WHO CREATED THE MATERIAL. BUT NOT ENOUGH IS SAID ABOUT THE DAMAGE THIS DOES TO THE ARTISTS PARENTS, COMPANY, OWNERS, MASTERS, THE VIACOMS OR THE TIMES WARNER OR THE NEWSCORPS OR DISNEY. WHO BESIDES THEIR LEGAL DIVISIONS HAVE NO ONE TO SPEAK FOR THEM. YOU KNOW, WHEN I SEE A GREEDY, FREE-LOADING STOOGE WHO LACKS THE CAPACITY TO CREATE HIS OWN ORIGINAL CONTENT AND STEALS FROM  OTHERS AND RATIONALIZES IT BY CLAIMING FAIR USE, IT MAKES ME  [BLEEPED] SICK. ONE COULD ONLY SPECULATE WHAT BASING YOUR SUCCESS AROUND SUCH A SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE COULD  DO TO A PERSON OVER A PERIOD OF SAY 13 YEARS. MY GUESS IS IT WOULD SOMEHOW ACCELERATE THE AGING PROCESS, RENDERING THE PERSON... [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MY GOD. AND THAT'S WHEN I SMOKED. MAKES YOU LONG FOR A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE RESPECTED THE WORKS OF OTHERS. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THAT WORLD WOULD BE LIKE. ♪ IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE ♪♪ WAIT, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! EVEN AS A JOKE WE DON'T HAVE JOHN LENNON COPYRIGHT MONEY. BY THE WAY, IF YOU POST ANY OF THIS ON YOUTUBE, YOU WILL BE HUNTED DOWN AND SUED. IT MAKES NO SENSE. FOR MORE ON THIS SOPA BILL, WE GO TO OUR NEWEST AND YOUNGEST CORRESPONDENT, JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I CAN'T TALK, JON, I'M SCOUTING THE NEXT FREIGHT TRAIN  TO ANYWHERE-TOWN, JUST TRYING THE KEEP ONE STEP AHEAD OF JOHNNY LAW.
Jon: JESSICA, WHY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW?
SOPA, JON. I'M AN INFRINGER, A SONG SMUGLIER, A COPY-RAT, A RED-HANDED VIDEO LIFTER. I UPLOADED A VIDEO. I'M YOUNG JOHN, IT'S WHAT WE DO. WE UPLOAD THING. ♪ ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ♪ ALL THE SINGLE LADIES  ALL THE SINGLE LADIES ♪♪ MAN, THAT WAS A MISTAKE. I MEAN, I LOOK GOOD, BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY WOULD ARREST YOU FOR SINGING BEYONCE IN YOUR PAJAMAS?
OH, NO, IT'S NOT THAT. DIDN'T YOU SEE THE TV IN THIS T BACKGROUND. IT WAS TUNED INTO AN EPISODE OF "NEWHART." DAMMIT, YOU HAVE [BLEEPED] ME  FOR THE LAST TIME, BOB NEWHART.
Jon: IS THAT REALLY A COPYRIGHT VIOLATION?
OF COURSE, WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY A "NEWHART" D.V.D. WHEN THEY  CAN SEE MY VIDEO OF "NEWHART" BLURRY WITH NO VOLUME FOR FREE.
Jon: JESSICA, DON'T GO. THIS IS ONLY YOUR SECOND ASSIGNMENT. WE HAVE LAWYERS HERE WHO CAN HELP YOU.
I SURE DO APPRECIATE THAT, JON, BUT THERE'S NO ROOM IN THIS ROTTEN WORLD FOR A BUM PALOOKA LIKE ME. BESIDES, JON, YOU HAVE WYATT AND AASIF AND THE TWINS TO TAKE CARE OF. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GROWING UP SO FAST. HEY, GIVE 'EM A HUG FOR ME, WOULD YA? AND ON CLEAR NIGHT, TELL THEM TO STAIR UP AT THE BIG YELLOW MOON, BECAUSE I'LL BE LOOKING UP AT IT, TOO. HEY, JON, I LEFT SOMETHING IN YOUR POCKET FOR DO YOU REMEMBER ME BY.
Jon: HALF A LOCKET.
UH-HUH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'LL WEAR IT FOREVER. YOU'LL WEAR THE OTHER HALF.
WHAT OTHER HALF? [LAUGHTER]
Jon:, THE HALF YOU WEAR SO WHEN WE FIND EACH OTHER AGAIN AND PUT THE TWO PIECES BACK  TOGETHER AGAIN...
OH, NO, JON, THERE'S NO OTHER HALF.
Jon: WE EACH GET ONE, IT SYMBOLIZES NO MATTER HOW FAR APART WE ARE...
OH, NO, I ONLY BROUGHT ONE HALF. SEE YA.
Jon: BYE.
