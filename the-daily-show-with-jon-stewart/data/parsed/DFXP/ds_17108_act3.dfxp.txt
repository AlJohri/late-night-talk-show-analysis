Jon: OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, HE'S NOW THE LIBERTARIAN  CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON. (APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jon: SO YOU ARE NOW THE LIBERTARIAN NOMINEE.
I'M THE LIBERTARIAN NOMINEE. I'VE BEEN ONE OF THREE CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES-- OBAMA AND ROMNEY  BEING THE OTHER TWO.
SO THIS IS BIG DOG STUFF. YOU WERE RUNNING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. OR TRYING TO GET ON...
KIND OF A MUTUAL THING. THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD CONSIDER RUNNING AND FOR THE MOST PART I THINK I'M DELIVERING  A MESSAGE OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM VERY MUCH ALONG THE SAME LINES AS RON PAUL. I DON'T THINK RON PAUL IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL GETTING THE NOMINATION. >>NOMINATION.
Jon: REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. SO THAT MESSAGE GOES AWAY WHEN HIS CANDIDACY COMES TO AN END.
Jon: WAS THERE ANY THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD THEN GO TO THE... DID DO THEY EVER TALK TO HIM OR IS THERE TALK OF THE TWO OF YOU OR IS THERE ANY THAT KIND OF...
NONE OF THAT GOING ON. RON PAUL ASKED FOR MY ENDORSEMENT IN 2008. I READILY GAVE THAT ENDORSEMENT AND WHEN I DROPPED OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I ASKED  EVERYONE THAT WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR ME TO VOTE FOR RON PAUL. LIKE I SAY, I THINK THAT'S GOING TO COME TO AN END.
LIBERTARIAN IS VERY INTERESTING. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH SEEM TO AGREE WITH HALF OF IT.
YEAH.
BUT THE OPPOSITE HALVES.
I GOT IT.
Jon: IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE FRIENDSHIP NECKLACES. EACH ONE HAS THE HALF AND IF THEY PUT IT TOGETHER, OH, MY GOD, A LIBERTARIAN! (LAUGHTER)
WELL, I THINK SO. THE NOTION THAT MOST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE, SOCIALLY TOLERANT, I'M IN THAT GROUP, I THINK MOST AMERICANS ARE IN THAT GROUP. A LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE IS GOING TO COME AT OBAMA FROM THE LEFT AND COME AT ROMNEY FROM THE RIGHT. KIND OF THAT NECKLACE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. WHY IS IT LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATES HAVE TROUBLE, THEN, GAINING TRACTION? EVEN THEN YOU WERE SAYING IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS NO ONE'S GOTTEN MORE THAN 1% BUT THERE IS  VERY POPULAR POLICY WITHIN THOSE PARTY PLATFORMS.
I TOTALLY AGREE. I TOTALLY AGREE THERE ARE MORE LIBERTARIANS, PEOPLE THAT DECLARE THEMSELVES LIBERTARIANS  THAN VOTE LIBERTARIAN. RIGHT NOW THOUGH YOU HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SAYING THEY  WOULD CONSIDER VOTING FOR A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE. WE'LL SEE IF THAT TAKES PLACE. LET'S BRING THE TROOPS HOME, LET'S BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HALF ARE EMBRACED BY THE DEMOCRATS HALF CAN BE EMBRACED  BY THE REPUBLICANS.
Jon: WHAT HOLDS IT BACK? REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE I'M FOR MAKE MIG OWN CHOICES AND THEN PEOPLE SCREW UP. LET'S FACE IT, YOU'RE A MARATHONER, YOU'VE CLIMBED  MOUNTAINS, YOU'RE A GOVERNOR. NOT ALL OF US CAN DO THAT. SOME OF US LIKE DORIE TOES OR... (LAUGHTER).
I DO, TOO, BY THE WAY. (LAUGHS).
Jon: BUT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS LIBERTARIAN... IS THAT A GOOD PARTY FOR PEOPLE  THAT ARE PERHAPS NOT AS ABLE? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALWAYS STRUCK ME IS DO LIBERTARIANS PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN US? ARE WE IMPRESSIVE?
HAVE THE TWO PARTIES GOTTEN SO OUT OF TOUCH? AND PAPER, ROCK, SCISSORS, IF WE ELECT THE REPUBLICAN OR THE DEMOCRATS IS THERE GOING TO BE A  DIFFERENCE FOUR YEARS FROM NOW? I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S REALLY GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE.
WELL, I WOULD SAY THERE WAS... THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET'S SAY GEORGE BUSH AND  WHOEVER THE DEMOCRAT WAS OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBAMA AND WHO THE REPUBLICAN IS I THINK IS...
AND THEN YOU'RE...
Jon: IS THAT DISTANCE, THOUGH, ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT.
I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE IDENTICAL, EACH HAS THEIR OWN PERHAPS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS.
WELL, ABSOLUTELY. AND LIKE I SAID HISTORICALLY I THINK PEOPLE HAVE EMBRACED THE DEMOCRAT PARTY BECAUSE THEY'RE  GOOD ON CIVIL LIBERTIES. I'M GOING TO MAKE THE CASE THAT I'M BETTER ON CIVIL LIBERTIES THAN OBAMA. HISTORICALLY I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE ABOUT DOLLARS AND CENTS, THE CHECKBOOK. HISTORICALLY REPUBLICANS ARE GOOD IN THAT CATEGORY. BUT I'LL NAME CASE THAT I'M BETTER THAN ROMNEY WHEN IT COMES TO DOLLARS AND CENTS. THAT'S THE CASE I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE.
Jon: HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT CASE? HOW DO YOU GET ON TO THE DEBATE. HOW CAN YOU BECOME LIKE ROSS PRO DID AND GET INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE?
THE NOTION HERE IS TO ACTUALLY WIN THE RACE. THAT'S THE PIE IN THE SKY NOTION. TO DO THAT, I'VE GOT TO POLL AT 15% TO GET ON THE NATIONAL DEBATE STAGE WITH OBAMA AND ROMNEY. RIGHT NOW I'M POLLING AT ABOUT 8% AGAINST THE TWO OF THEM. I THINK MORE IMPORTANT...
Jon: HOLD ON. (LAUGHTER)
I'M JUST WORKING THIS OUT.
THE BIGGEST INGREDIENT IN MY BEING 8% IS THAT I'M THE THIRD NAME LISTED. NOT SO MUCH ME. BUT THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE. THERE WILL ONLY BE THREE CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT.
YOU HAVE TO GET TO 15%. WHOSE RULE IS THAT?
THAT'S THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE COMMISSION THAT ESTABLISHED THAT AS A RESULT OF  ROSS PEROT.
Jon: OH, REALLY.
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE THEY WON'T WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER CRACKPOT IN HERE.
EXACTLY.
Jon: (AS ROSS PEROT) "HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO."
SO LET'S SET A 15% THRESHOLD. SO LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE WORLD A LITTLE BIT.
DO YOU... HAVE YOU FOUND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE THEY'RE  MORE OPEN TO IT WHERE YOU GO OUT AND KNOW THERE'S ALSO R.C. COLA, ALSO VERY TASTED. (LAUGHTER) WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE THEY... RIGHT. DO THEY SAY OH, MY GOD, I NEVER TASTED LIBERTARIANISM. LET ME... OH, OH!
THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY. THE NOTION THAT PERHAPS LIBERTARIANS EMBRACE WHAT MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY... YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO PHILOSOPHICALLY BE IN TUNE WITH THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO ACTUALLY POINT OUT THE PROBLEMS THAT FACE THE COUNTRY. I THINK A HOMELESS PERSON COULD DO THOSE TWO... THOSE SAME THINGS BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO  HAVE A RESUME TO ACTUALLY DO THIS AND I'M POSING MYSELF AS HAVING THAT RESUME ALSO. HAVING SERVED TWO TERMS AS GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO IN A STATE THAT'S 2-1 DEMOCRAT AND  TAKEN ON ISSUES THAT I THINK WERE REALLY IMPORTANT AND POLITICS BE DAMNED.
Jon: I'M GLAD THAT YOU GAVE THOSE IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS  BECAUSE AT FIRST I THOUGHT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING WAS "HEY, MAN, I'M BETTER THAN A HOMELESS GUY!" I WASN'T SURE AT FIRST WHERE YOU  WERE GOING WITH THIS. IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE SAYING "A HOMELESS GUY COULD DO WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M JUST SAYING."
A HOMELESS GUY CAN POINT OUT THE PROBLEMS. A HOMELESS GUY COULD MAYBE EVEN POINT OUT THE SOLUTION.
THERE'S A GUY ON MY CORNER DOING IT ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. TURNS OUT IT'S ELEANOR ROOSEVELT'S FAULT! (LAUGHTER) WELL, GOVERNOR, I WISH YOU WELL. HAVE YOU... HAVE YOU HAD GOOD SUCCESS MEETING WITH TEEM AND STARTING TO GENERATE ENTHUSIASM?
WELL, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. I HAVE SEEN NOTHING BUT INCREASED CROWDS, INCREASED APPETITE FOR WHAT IT IS I HAVE THAT TO SAY. I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS IF THAT WEREN'T THE CASE.
Jon: THIS SHOW...
A COUPLE PEOPLE WATCH IT.
Jon: YES, I WAS GOING TO SAY THIS SHOW ISN'T GOING TO  HELP THAT MUCH BUT IT'S A START IS WHAT I'M SAYING. CALL BRIAN LAMB. GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
