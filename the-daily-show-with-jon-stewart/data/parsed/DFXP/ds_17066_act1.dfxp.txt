FEBRUARY 29, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD FUSE HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS DALE DALE WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" .N MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MASHA GESSEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT IS A CLUED IN AUDIENCE, MY FRIENDS. (LAUGHTER) SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND, YOU  KNOW, SOME SEXY PICTURES IN THERE. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THE BOOK. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE LONG WINDING BUMPY ASS ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE. YESTERDAY ANOTHER PRIMARY NIGHT. SO AT 9:00 P.M. THE POLLS CLOSED AND I TUNED IN FOR THE LATEST RESULTS.
POLLS CLOSING. SEVEN SECONDS AND WE CAN MAKE A CALL IN THREE SECONDS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CHIH SECONDS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THREE SECOND? WHO'S GOT THAT TIME! I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT. TWITTER ALREADY TOLD ME WHO WON THE 2016 ELECTION. (LAUGHTER) CONGRATULATIONS, GATT TKPWA. (LAUGHTER) GAGA. I'M KIDDING. TELL US THE RESULTS.
WE AT FOX NEWS CAN PROJECT THAT MITT ROMNEY WILL EASILY WIN ARIZONA.
Jon: YES, ROMNEY WINS ARIZONA BY 9:00! FINALLY A PRIMARY NIGHT THAT ENDS EARLY. GOING TO BED WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT UP AND THINK ABOUT ALL THE...
IN MICHIGAN, ROMNEY'S NATIVE STATE, HE HOLDS A SLIGHT LEAD  OVER SANTORUM BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO PROJECT.
Jon: MICHIGAN! (LAUGHTER) OH, I'M MICHIGAN! (LAUGHTER) I'M SLOW IN MY PRIMARY RESULTS! I'M YOUR UPPER PENINSULA. (LAUGHTER) I GOT MY RESULTS IN EARLY. YOU'RE NOT DENSELY POPULATED! WELL YOU'RE NOT DENSELY... (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: FOR YOU KIDS AT HOME THAT DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST HAPPENED, MY HAND JUST (BLEEP)ED. (LAUGHTER) YES, AS IT TURNED OUT, MICHIGAN WAS NOT CALLED UNTIL WELL AFTER  10:30 P.M. WHICH MEANT THE 24-HOUR NETWORKS HAD SOME TIME ON THEIR HANDS. OF COURSE, BEING SERIOUS NEWS NETWORKS AND REALIZING IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS A NEAR  TIE IN A STATE PRIMARY THAT ASSIGNS DELEGATES PROPORTIONATELY ISN'T ALL THAT  IMPORTANT, THEY FILLED THAT TIME WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTS ON SYRIA AND THE GEOPOLITICAL  RAMIFICATIONS OF THE INCIPIENT... I'M (BLEEP)ING  WITH YOU. (LAUGHTER) THEY JUST KILLED TIME.
WE GOT SOME VOTES COMING IN FROM MICHIGAN RIGHT NOW. VERY, VERY EARLY THE PROCESS, ONLY 1% OF THE VOTE NOW IN. BUT IT'S JUST CHANGED!
IN MICHIGAN... I KNOW MEGAN DOESN'T LIKE TO CALL IT HIS HOME  STATE BUT THE MAN WAS BORN THERE.
NATIVE STATE.
SOMETHING WE HAVE FIRST ON CNN RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SCREEN...
I WAS BORN IN ILLINOIS, THAT IS MY NATIVE STATE. BUT IT'S NOT MY HOME STATE. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
ALL THE INFORMATION IS COMING THROUGH THOSE PARTICULAR LINES  ERE THOSE RED BULBS ARE.LINESWH
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'VE JUMPED THE SHARK. IT'S OFFICIAL.
18,397 FOR ROMNEY BUT, LOOK IT JUST CHANGED! (LAUGHTER)
OH, MY GOD, IT JUST CHANGED! THE ELECTION BOARD! BLITZER, DO YOU HAVE NO SHORT-TERM MEMORY? YOU JUST TOLD US THE VOTES ARE GOING TO BE CHANGING ALL NIGHT AND THEN YOU TURNED AROUND AND  WET "OH! IT CHANGED!" LAST TIME I SAW SOMEONE THIS EXCITED ABOUT NUMBERS CHANGING IS A VAMPIRE  MADE OUT OF FELT. AT LEAST SOME CNN ANCHORS CHOSE TO KILL TIME THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY-- A LEISURELY STROLL TO THE CUBE.
LET'S GO OVER TO THE CUBE TO OUR POLITICAL DIRECTOR MARK AND  CHECK IN WITH HIM, GET A SENSE OF WHEN WE MAY BE ABLE TO PROJECT AN ACTUAL WINNER IN THE  STATE OF MICHIGAN NOW THAT OBVIOUSLY THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED AND WE'VE GOT SON MANY VOTES IN. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO CNN'S CUBE, OR NERD TERRARIUM, IF YOU WILL, IS POP  YOU LATED WITH INDIVIDUALS ON HEADSETS, YET TO GET INFORMATION FROM THEM YOU MUST PACK SOME  GORP AND HIKE THE CANYON. (LAUGHTER) I THINK COOP'S THE ONLY GUY OVER THERE FIT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE JOURNEY. I ASSUME THE TREK WAS WORTH ANDERSON'S WHILE.
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?
WE GOT SOME BREAKING NEWS OUT OF MICHIGAN RIGHT NOW, ANDER SON. WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN AND A BULK OF THE DELEGATES. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU BETTER BE GOING SOMEWHERE WITH THIS, POINDEXTER.
WE CAN NOW BASED UPON OUR CALCULATIONS FROM WHAT OUR DECISION TEAM HAS FOUND OUT IS  AWARD THREE DELEGATES NOT ONLY TO MITT ROMNEY BUT ALSO TO RICK SANTORUM.
SO THEY EACH GET THREE AT THIS POINT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: COOPER ADDED "DON'T EVER (BLEEP)ING CALL KNOW THE  CUBE AGAIN, UNDERSTAND ME?" NEVER. SO NOTHING'S CHANGED. BUT HERE COMES MY FAVORITE PART.
I WANT TO CHECK IN ALSO WITH OUR CONTRIBUTORS, OUR ANALYSTS ABOUT THE DELEGATE COUNT.
Jon: ANDERSON COOPER NOW HAS TO DO THE POST-CUBE NO INFORMATION WALK OF SHAME BACK  TO THE BASE CAMP! WHAT WAS CNN THINKING WITH THAT ONE? (LAUGHTER) TO FIND OUT, LET'S CHECK IN WITH THE BEST (BLEEP)ING NEWS BOX ON TELEVISION. WHAT WE DID IS WE HAD... NO, WE HAD OUR ENGINEERS PUT TOGETHER WHAT WE CALL A CONVEX POLYHEDRON. THEY PUT TOGETHER, SOME OF THE ANALYTICS ARE THERE WHERE PEOPLE GO AND THEN THEY WALK IT DOWN... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AS THEY GO THROUGH TO GET... AND THEN WE GO... OVER HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I'M IN A BOX. OKAY. THIS WAY. AND THEN WE COME DOWN IN. OKAY. WE'RE AT THE NEWS CENTER RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU GUYS... OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF DATA IS COMING THROUGH. DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY INFORMATION FOR ME THAT MIGHT CLARIFY THESE ELECTION RESULTS IN MICHIGAN  LAST NIGHT THIS BIG PRIMARY?
NO.
NO WE HAVE NOTHING.
I HAVE NOTHING. NO.
Jon: THANKS, GUYS, APPRECIATE IT. WE'LL CHECK IN OUR POLYHEDRON A LITTLE LATER. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THANKS, GUYS. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. BEST (BLEEP)ING NEWS BOX ON TELEVISION. WHERE WERE WE? OH, RIGHT! MICHIGAN. ANYWAY, THE WINNER EVENTUALLY DID EMERGE AND IT WAS WILLARD MITTINGHOUSE ROMNEY. A CINDERELLA STORY OF A HUNDRED MILLIONAIRE COMING OUT OF NOWHERE TO BARELY SQUEAK PAST A  CRAZY PERSON IN HIS OWN HOME STATE.
THAT'S HIS NATIVE STATE.
Jon: FINE! (LAUGHTER) BUT MITT IS LOOKING TO PUT SANTORUM IN HIS REAR-VIEW MIRROR6CJ%  AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE HIS EYE ON HIS OPPONENT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.
HE RAISED THE NATIONAL DEBT. I WILL CUT, CAP, AND BALANCE THE BUDGET. HE PASSED OBAMACARE, I WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE. HE LOST OUR A.A.A. CREDIT RATING. I'LL RESTORE OUR A.A.A. CREDIT RATING.
Jon: HE KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN, I WILL REANIMATE HIM. (LAUGHTER) BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE. HE MARRIED MICHELLE OBAMA, I WILL DIVORCE MICHELLE OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) HE TOLD YOU YES, WE CAN. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO PLEDGE TO YOU, NO. NO WE CAN'T. (LAUGHTER) BIZARRO OBAMA. OF COURSE, RICK SANTORUM'S PARTY AFTER LOSING WAS A BIT MORE SUBDUED. HE HAS EARNED, THOUGH, THROUGH THE RECENT PRIMARY RESULTS A STRONG MEASURE OF OUR RESPECT, ADMIRATION FORGED IN THE HEAT OF A DIFFICULT CAMPAIGN. IT ALLOWS RICK SANTORUM TO RISE ABOVE THE CALLOW BARBS THAT STEMMED FROM A CHILDISH WEAPON  PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS FROTHY ASS JUICE. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT WILL NOT COME BACK. TONIGHT, SIR IS YOUR NIGHT.
TO THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN, WE CAME INTO THE BACKYARD OF ONE OF MY OPPONENTS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: KIND SIR, WHY MUST YOU TAUNT US. WE ARE DESPERATELY TRYING HERE.
THAT'S HOW AMERICA WORKS BEST, FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND BUILDING A GREAT AMERICA FROM  THE BOTTOM UP. A FREE SOCIETY FROM THE BOTTOM UP. AND THAT'S THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROPOSE FOR AMERICA. THE BOTTOM UP. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: TONIGHT MITT ROMNEY MAY HAVE COME OUT ON TOP OF US... (LAUGHTER). BUT WE WILL STAY IN AND NOT HEED THE CALLS TO PULL IT. (LAUGHTER) FUELED BY YOUR SPUNK, IT'S ON TO SUPERTUESDAY WHERE WE WILL TOSS  THAT MAN SALAD FROM OHIO TO TENNESSEE.
