FEBRUARY 15, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THANKS FOR JOINING US. OKAY. THIS ONE, OKAY, THAT'S FOR THAT LADY. NOW WE'LL MAKE THIS ONE. THIS LADY BECAUSE WE PREPARED A WHOLE SHOW FOR THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. BUT ALL THEY WANT IS (BEEP). I NOTICE YOU SOMETIMES CHOOSE AN ENTIRE LITTLE PIECE OF SKIN. CAN I HAVE... I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS JANUARY JONES ALTHOUGH.... ( APPLAUSE ) IT IS, OF COURSE, FEBRUARY. I'M BEING TOLD I'VE ALREADY RUINED THE INTERVIEW. AS YOU KNOW, EGYPT'S REVOLUTION, SO-CALLED FOR THE BRAVE WOMAN WHO INSPIRED IT, HAS TOUCHED OFF NOT ONLY AN ENORMOUS RISE IN THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR JASMINE BUT AN  OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD. SOME OF THAT SUPPORT COMING FROM UNUSUAL QUARTERS.
THE NATION OF EGYPT HAS THE RIGHT TO BE FREE. IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO PRACTICE YOUR SOVEREIGNTY, ELECTING THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT, THE  ADMINISTRATION, THE RULERS.
Jon: HOLY... THAT IS MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD STANDING WITH EGYPT. ON THE 32nd ANNIVERSARY OF IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTION. BY THE WAY IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GETTING THEM SOMETHING I BELIEVE THE 32nd ANNIVERSARY  IS THE ENRICHED URANIUM ANNIVERSARY. PERHAPS YOU CAN PICK SOME UP AT MISLABELED CRATE AND BARREL. ANYWHO, AHMADINEJAD SUPPORTING A FREE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO EXPRESSION AND ASSEMBLY WHICH  IS GREAT NEWS. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY IRANIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS WERE PLANNING A LARGE-SCALE  PEACEFUL PROTEST MUCH LIKE THE ONES RICHLY PRAISED BY AHMADINEJAD. THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A LOVEFEST.
IRANIAN SECURITY DETAILS ARE OUT IN FORCE, FIRING TEAR GAS AND BEATING PROTESTORS  WITH BATONS.
Jon: BATONS OF LOVE.
THEY'VE SHUT DOWN THE INTERNET. THEY'VE JAMMED FOREIGN BROADCASTERS.
Jon: JAMMED THEM WITH LOVE.
IRANIAN LAWMAKERS WANT OPPOSITION LEADERS TRIED AND EXECUTED FOR ORGANIZING PROTESTS.
Jon: TRIED AND EXECUTED WITH (BEEP). IT TURNS OUT THE IRANIAN REGIME IS ONLY INTO FREEDOM FOR EGYPTIANS. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AHMADINEJAD, WITH THAT ATTITUDE, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH TIME GETTING RE-ELECTED. REALLY THAT THIRD TERM IS NO SLAM DUNK, SIR. IRANIANS HAVE GOT TO BE THINKING, WHAT DOES THAT EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION HAVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE? YOU KNOW WHAT WORKED FOR THE EGYPTIAN A STANDARD BEARER FOR THE CAUSE. THE EGYPTIANS HAD THAT ARRESTED GOOGLE EXECUTIVE. MAYBE YOU COULD GET THE GOVERNMENT TO GRAB SOMEONE FROM WHATEVER SEARCH ENGINE  IRANIANS ARE ALLOWED TO USE LIKE, OH, YEAH, YAHOO-LULULULU. LULULULULU. DEPENDING ON HOW SHORT THE SHOW WAS TONIGHT, THAT COULD HAVE GONE ON FOR A WHILE. ANYWAY, MACH MUD, IF YOU ARE LISTENING-- AND I KNOW YOU PROBABLY ARE. I'M SURE YOU'LL STAY TUNED AFTERWARDS. WHY DON'T YOU JUST PRETEND THAT EVERYONE IN YOUR COUNTRY IS ACTUALLY EGYPTIAN, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE YOU SEEM TO FEEL DESERVING TO GET RID OF THEIR (BEEP) DICTATOR. OOPS. BUT OF COURSE THE MIDDLE EAST ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE WHERE CITIZENS ARE CALLING FOR AN  OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT. THERE WAS A GROUP OF REVOLUTIONARIES CLOSER TO HOME SPECIFICALLY AT WASHINGTON  D.C. WHERE REPUBLICANS GATHERED FOR C-PAC, THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION  CONFERENCE THAT WAS LAST YEAR REFERRED TO AS THE REPUBLICAN WOOD STOCK. WHAT THIS YEAR'S THEME.
THE PRESIDENT WENT FROM CHANGE YOU CAN BELIEVE IN TO CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS CHANGE?
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, OBAMA MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO BECOMING THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT. NOBODY WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT HIM BEING A MUSLIM THEN.
Jon: BOOM! IT'S LIKE A ROAST. THIS YEAR IT'S A ROAST. IT'S LIKE ONE OF THEM COMEDY CENTRAL THINGS ONLY WITH BARACK OBAMA AS THEIR PAMELA  ANDERSON AND SOCIALISM AS THOUGH SHE WAS MARRIED TO SOMEONE WITH A COMICALLY LARGE PENIS. LIKE ALL ROASTS, COMICS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES GATHERED. LET'S GO WITH THE OLD PRO FREDDY ROMAN.
WASHINGTON HAS UNDERGONE A RATHER BIZARRE TRANSFORMATION. OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. OL BER MAN IS OUT AND REAGAN IS IN.
Jon: THAT WAS A GREAT JOKE FROM SOMEONE BEST KNOWN FOR BEING WHAT YOU HAVE TO DRAW TO  GET INTO ART SCHOOL. BOOM! GOOD STUFF. LET'S SEE HOW THE C-PAC GAME COOK WOULD FAIR, THE GUY WHO IS HUNKY BUT NOBODY EVER  ADMITS TO LIKING.
THIS IS THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD'S ANSWER TO THE GREATEST JOB CRISIS SINCE THE  GREAT DEPRESSION? WHAT'S NEXT? LET THEM EAT CAKE? EXCUSE ME. LET THEM EAT ORGANIC CAKE?
Jon: BANG! HE STOLE THAT JOKE. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I'M IMPRESSED SO FAR WITH THE MATERIAL AND THE PERFORMANCES. WHERE IS THE COMIC YOU SECRETLY FIND REALLY HOT BUT HOPE NEVER EVER BECOMES PRESIDENT.
YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA IS NAMED HU. HIS NAME IS PRESIDENT HU. AND WITH ALL THE MONEY THAT WE OWE CHINA, I THINK WE MIGHT RIGHTLY SAY HU'S YOUR DADDY.
Jon: OKAY. SO NOW WE KNOW HOW YOU WOULD TELL A JOKE TO KINDERGARTENERS. OR AN ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASS. NEITHER OF THEM ARE THERE. OF COURSE LIKE ALL ROASTS CERTAIN THEMES GET BEATEN TO THE GROUND. JOAN RIVERS HAD SOME WORK DONE. THE GUY IS SO OLD HE TAKES HIS TEETH OUT WHEN YOU'RE BLOWING HIM. (LAUGHING) SO WHAT'S THE LINE ON OBAMA?
I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN BY BIRTH. AND I DO HAVE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO PROVE IT.
I'M NOT ONE WHO QUESTIONS THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND THE EXISTENCE  OF HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE. BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIS POLICY, DON'T YOU AT LEAST WONDER WHAT PLANET HE'S FROM?
Jon: YOU'RE JUST SAYING HE WASN'T BORN HERE. COME ON. HEY, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES"? ONE IS BLACK AND WHITE AND FULL OF LIES. THE OTHER IS A PUBLICATION I'VE NEVER READ. BOOM! I'M NOT SAYING MALCOLM X IS HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER BUT THAT IS WHAT I'M SAYING. AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A HECKLERS BUT A REAL PRO HANDLES IT.
ALL RIGHT. SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. (BEEP). LIKE... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE TOTALLY  RANDOM CELEBRITY. MUHAMMAD ALI OR GEORGE HAMILTON FOR SOME REASON ON THE ROAST OF DAVID HASSLEHOFF. C-PACK BOASTED A SPECIAL APPEARANCE FROM A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER WHO IS BEGINNING TO  REPRESENT A VERSION OF HIMSELF.
I WISH... BY THE WAY RON PAUL CANNOT GET ELECTED. I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU. I CAN TELL YOU THIS, IF I RUN AND IF I WIN, THIS COUNTRY WILL BE RESPECTED AGAIN.
Jon: OH, YEAH. YOU'D REALLY CLASS UP WASHINGTON. YEAH. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'D DO TO. I WOULD GET THIS COUNTRY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. THEN I'LL PUT IT BACK INTO BANKRUPTCY. THEN OUT AGAIN. THEN IN AGAIN AND SO-AND-SO FORTH UNTIL, BOOM, IT'S THE FUTURE. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE. YOU'RE FIRED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
