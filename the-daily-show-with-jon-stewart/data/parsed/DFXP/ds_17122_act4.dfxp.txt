JACK BLACK, TEN A SUS D, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, A LOT OF PEOPLE AT HOME ARE WONDERING, DOES IT HURT TO ROCK THAT HARD? DOES IT-- WHAT DO YOU PHYSICALLY FEEL WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE THAT HARD.
IT CAN. IT CAN HURT THE FINGER TIBBS AND THE DELICATE PIPES. BUT YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE. SO-- IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.
Jon: SURE, SURE. HAS THE SQUID PROBLEM BEEN SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR A WHILE?
WE'VE BEEN KILLING IT EVERY NIGHT.
I LOSE SLEEP OVER IT EVERY NIGHT, I THINK ABOUT THE EVIL ALIEN SQUID PROBLEM  THAT COULD BE OUT THERE.
Jon: FROM EVERYBODY, I SAY THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER) THANK YOU. RISE OF THE PHOENIX IS IN STORES NOW. TENACIOUS D. YOU CAN GO SEE THEM AT THE HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM.
