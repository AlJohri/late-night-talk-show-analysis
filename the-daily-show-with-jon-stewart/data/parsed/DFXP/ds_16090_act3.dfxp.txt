TONIGHT. HE WAS AWARDED THE MEDAL OF HONOR BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ON TUESDAY. PLEASE WELCOME ARMY SERGEANT FIRST CLASS LEROY PETRY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANKS FOR COMING. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. BEFORE WE GET INTO THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY IN AFGHANISTAN, MAY I JUST SAY, THAT HAND IS SUPER COOL. HOW DID YOU... WHEN I SHOOK YOUR HAND, IT CURLED AROUND MY HAND WITH A STRONGER GRIP THAN I HAVE.
IT'S DESIGNED TO CONFORM TO DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT ACTUALLY  STOPS WHEN EACH FINGER MEETS RESISTANCE TO GIVE YOU MORE DEXTERITY. WHEN I ACTUALLY LOST IT, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A HOOK, AND I WAS FINE WITH THAT  BECAUSE I LOST IT THE WAY I WANTED TO, BUT THEY GAVE ME THIS HAND, AND I GOT... IT'S AMAZING  AND IT'S GETTING BETTER.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE ONE THAT CAN... LET'S SAY YOU'RE IN TRAFFIC... [LAUGHTER] THERE'S A PROBLEM.
I USE THE GOOD HAND.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. FAIR ENOUGH. THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ONE. WOULD YOU MIND IF WE JUST WENT THROUGH IT BRIEFLY.
SURE.
Jon: YOU WERE ON DAY MISSION.
YES, SIR.
Jon: AND IT WAS A RAID. IS THAT UNUSUAL TO BE ON A DAY RAID LIKE THAT?
FOR US IT IS UNUSUAL.
Jon: YOU'RE AN ARMY RANGER.
YEAH, WE DON'T NORMALLY DO DAYLIGHT RAIDS, BUT THE NECESSITY TO GET OUT THERE AND  GET THIS HIGH VALUE TARGET AND THE TIME OF DAY, WE HAD TO ACT ON IT.
Jon: IN THE BEGINNING OF IT, YOU ARE WOUNDED EARLY ON IN THE FIGHT?
YES, SHOT THROUGH BOTH THIGHS. I ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALIZE IT UNTIL I GOT TO THE MEDICS LATER, BUT I THOUGHT I WAS JUST SHOT IN THE LEFT LEG. IT HAD STUCK IN THERE OR SOMETHING. I DIDN'T FEEL IT GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH BOTH LEGS. SO I WAS RUNNING AROUND DOING THINGS FOR A LITTLE BIT. [LAUGHTER] I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD.
Jon: I COULD STOP YOU THERE. AND BE VERY PROUD OF YOUR SERVICE AND ALL YOU DID. SO IN THIS... NOW, YOU ARE REALLY A VETERAN IN THIS GROUP. YOU HAVE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN. THIS WAS YOUR SIXTH TOUR. AND YOU HAD TWO TOURS IN IRAQ.
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY FIFTH TOUR. I'VE BEEN BACK SINCE.
Jon: YOU'VE BEEN BACK TO AFGHANISTAN FOR ANOTHER TOUR SINCE YOU WERE WOUNDED?
YES.
Jon: YOU'RE LUKE SKYWALKER. THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ALL RIGHT. SO NOW YOU HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN BOTH LEGS. YOU'VE GOT... THESE ARE YOUNGER FELLAS. THEY'RE LOOKING TO YOU FOR LEADERSHIP. ARE YOU STILL FUNCTIONING IN A CAPACITY IN THAT MOMENT?
YES.
Jon: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? IS IT TRAINING? IS IT JUST THERE'S A CERTAIN SOMETHING IN YOU THAT WOULDN'T GIVE UP?
IT'S TRAINING AND IT'S THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL BROTHERS OUT  THERE, AND YOU WOULDN'T... JUST LIKE I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON ONE  OF MY CHILDREN, I WOULDN'T GIVE UP ON MY BROTHERS. AND THAT'S THIS WAY I LOOKED AT IT OUT THERE. AND THE WAY A BIRD TAKES CARE OF IT YOUNG ONE, FEEDS THEM UNTIL THEY CAN GROW AND HOPES THAT  THEY BECOME GOOD LEADERS.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S JUST MENTORING. AND I WAS TAKING CARE OF MY OWN THAT DAY.
Jon: RIGHT. INCREDIBLE. AND IN THIS MOMENT, THE ENEMY THROWS A GRENADE.
YES.
Jon: AND TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE, DO WE HAVE LIKE A RENDERING OF THE COMPOUND THAT  YOU'RE IN THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING. THIS IS THE COURTYARD. ARE YOU IN THE INNER COURTYARD AT THIS POINT, THE OUTER COURTYARD BY THE CHICKEN COOP?
THE INNER COURTYARD. WE'RE ON THE... WELL, I CAN'T TELL WHICH WAY THAT NORTH ARROW IS POINTING.
Jon: WE PURPOSELY MADE THAT TO CONFUSE THE ENTIRE ISSUE. I THINK IT'S POINTING TOWARDS FLORIDA, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY. SO THE ENEMY, WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO SEND A GRENADE YOUR WAY, YOU'RE IN LOBBING DISTANCE OF THE ENEMY. AND THESE GUYS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL PLAYERS. YOU'RE LIKE 20 FEET, 30 FEET AWAY FROM THESE GUYS.
THE CEILING OF THE BUILDING WAS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT FEET HIGH. SO IT WAS EASY FOR THEM TO THROW IT OVER I GUESS.
Jon: SO A GRENADE LANDS, AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD, PEOPLE THAT WHEN A  GRENADE LANDS, THEY GO "GRENADE "GRENADE"! AND PEOPLE WHO KEEP THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM. IN THAT MOMENT, WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND?
THERE WAS A SPLIT SECOND. I TURNED OVER, LOOKED, I SAW IT AND I KNEW IT WASN'T ONE OF OURS  BECAUSE IT WAS THE OLD PINEAPPLE GRENADE. FIRST THING THAT WENT THROUGH MY MIND IS GET IT OUT OF HERE, GET I AWAY FROM MY GUYS AND ME. THAT'S WHAT I DID. I REACHED FOR IT AND STARTED TO THROW IT AND AS SOON AS I OPENED THE HAND, THAT WAS THE LAST  THING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE HAND DISAPPEARED.
Jon: DO YOU AT THAT POINT PASS OUT? IS THAT...
NO, NO. THEY ASK YOU A LOT OF TIMES IF YOU HAD A CONCUSSION, AND I SAID, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU  HAVE A CONCUSSION. YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF TIME. IF YOU HAVE A CONCUSSION, IT'S DARK OUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU KNOW YOU HAD A CONCUSSION, BUT  IF NOBODY ELSE SEES IT, YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT I SAT BACK UP FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE SPLIT SECONDS, AND I GRABBED MY ARM. IT WAS... THE HAND LOOKED LIKE A CIRCULAR SAW HAD TAKEN IT OFF. IT WAS FLAT AT THE TOP AND COMPLETELY GONE. I WAS LIKE... THAT'S THE PART THAT DIDN'T GET ME. I GRABBED IT AND I LOOKED AT IT AND I SAID, WHY ISN'T THIS SPRAYING OFF INTO THE WIND LIKE  IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO IN THIS MOMENT YOU'RE SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED  IT'S NOT AS GORY AS YOU SAW, NOT QUITE AS SPLURTY AS WHAT YOU'D BEEN LED TO BELIEVE?
WELL, I FIGURED I HAD... I WAS LIKE, WOW, I GOT A LOT OF TIME. IT'S NOT BLEEDING THAT BAD. BUT I GUESS WITH THE TRAUMATIC INJURY, THE NERVES TUCK BACK AND ALL THE ADRENALINE AND... I  DIDN'T FEEL ANY PAIN. SO I GRABBED... I WENT TO MY MILITARY TRAINING, GRABBED MY TOURNIQUET AND WAS ABLE TO APPLY  A TOURNIQUET, GET ON THE RADIO AND CONTINUE TELLING MY LEADERSHIP WHAT WAS GOING ON.
Jon: YOU APPLIED YOUR OWN TOURNIQUET.
YES.
Jon: AND STAYED IN COMMAND OF... WOW. I MEAN, I'M HONESTLY SPEECHLESS. IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY, AND THE ONE THING, AS REMARKABLE AS THE HEROISM IN THAT IS, IS YOUR  REMARKABLE HEROISM AND YOUR BROTHERS AND ALL THE SERVICE PEOPLE, AS EXTRAORDINARY AS YOUR  ACTS WERE, WHAT'S REALLY EXTRAORDINARY IS YOUR ORDINARY SERVICE, THE SIX TOURS IN  AFGHANISTAN AND THE TWO TOURS IN IRAQ AND ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE WITHOUT COMMENDATION. I'M SO PLEASED AND HONORED THAT YOU WOULD HERE TODAY. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR NOT JUST YOUR HEROISM BUT JUST YOUR SERVICE, WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY IN AND OF ITSELF. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES? WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE GOING TO THROW IT UP ON THE WEB, THE SECOND PART. WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE. IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO SEE YOU, SIR. SERGEANT FIRST CLASS LEROY PETRY. WE'RE GOING
