SEPTEMBER 27, THE 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MANY I NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, SETH ROGAN. SETH ROGAN IS GOING TO BE HERE. OH, HE'S A FUNNY MAN H.'S CURRENTLY GOT A NEW COMEDY OUT ABOUT A... CANCER. OKAY. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, LET'S BEGIN THE NIGHT WITH CAMPAIGN OBAMA. HIS REELECTION BID HAS TAKEN THEM TO THE WEST COAST WHERE BETWEEN SPEECHES AND FUND-RAISER  IT IS FIRST FELLA VISITED SILICON VALLEY AT A TOWN HALL EVENT HOSTED BY THE COMPANY  LINKEDIN-- WHATEVER THAT IS. (LAUGHTER)
WE CONNECT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ULTIMATELY AROUND THE WORLD. BY CONNECTING TALENT AND OPPORTUNITY.
Jon: OH, IS THAT WHAT IT IS? I THOUGHT IT WAS AN E-MAIL IN-BOX FLOODING SERVICE WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO  REMIND ME A GUY I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH WOULD LIKE ME TO JOIN LINKED IN AND SPAM EVERYONE  I EVER MET. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF IT HELPS PEOPLE GET JOBS...
I HAVE A 222 YEAR VERY SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN I.T. MANAGEMENT.
I LOST MY JOB IN 2009.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MY MOTHER. SHE'S CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED.
I'M FROM CHICAGO. RECENTLY UNEMPLOYED.
I GUESS WHAT WE'RE SAYING, MR. PRESIDENT, I DON'T THINK THIS LINKEDIN THING WORKS. WE'VE BEEN POSTING FOR YEARS AND EVERYONE'S STILL UNEMPLOYED. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS LIKE GOING TO A CRAIGSLIST TOWN HALL AND HAVING  PEOPLE GET UP "DO YOU KNOW ANY ONLINE SITES WHERE YOU CAN GATE HAND JOB AND A GENTLY-USED  FUTON?" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET?"  MY ASSUMPTION IS THEY'RE APPLAUDING THE HAND JOB AND NOT THE FUTON. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR THE PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT AS HE  HELD A $250 A PERSON FUND-RAISER AT THE HOLLYWOOD HOUSE OF BLUES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS THE TROUBLE WITH THESE HOLLYWOOD EVENTS. (LAUGHTER) , THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE MEL GIBSON'S GOING TO SHOW UP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS THE BEAVER! LISTEN, HOW BAD CAN THE ECONOMY BE WHEN A NUT CAN SPEND $250 JUST TOO YELL (BLEEP) TO THE PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) UNLESS THE PRESIDENT IS USING HIS FALLING POLL NUMBERS TO FUND RAISE. YEAH, FOR $250, YOU CAN YELL STUFF AT HIM. FOR $500 YOU CAN GIVE HIM THE CLASSIC PSYCHOHAND SHAKE. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. (BLEEP). MAYBE HE'LL TAKE MAKE WHICH YOU ARE FOR $2,000 HOLDING HIS FAKE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. MEANWHILE, ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THERE'S BEEN A SHAKEUP IN THE G.O.P. FIELD AS PRESUMED  FRONT-RUNNERS RICK PERRY AND MITT ROMNEY LOST THE FLORIDA STRAW POLL BY DOUBLE DIGIT  MARGINS TO FORMER GODFATHER'S PIZZA C.E.O. HERMAN CAIN. THE VICTORY SPEECH, CAIN DECLARED "AS A BLACK REPUBLICAN, HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT OBAMA."
I BELIEVE, QUITE FRANKLY, THAT MY CAMPAIGN, I WILL GARNER A MINIMUM OF A THIRD OF A BLACK VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY AND  POSSIBLY MORE. I THINK THEY'RE OVER THIS FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT THING. I THINK THAT IS BEHIND THEM.
Jon: I'M SURE THAT YOU DO. (LAUGHTER) JOINING US IS OUR SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MARY, TELL ME. IS HERMAN CAIN RIGHT? ARE BLACK VOTERS OVER OBAMA?
WELL, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, JON, IT WAS SWEET TO ELECT THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT BUT IT WILL BE EVEN SWEETER TO SEE THE  FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT KICKED OUT OF OFFICE BY THE SECOND BLACK PRESIDENT! (LAUGHTER) AND IF IT HAPPENED HE'D JUST KICK RICK PERRY'S AWECATION ASS  UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF FLORIDA PROVING SOMETIMES POLITICS IS LIKE A PORN MOVIE. (LAUGHTER)
HOW'S THAT?
YOU KNOW, PIZZA GUY SHOWS UP OUT OF NOWHERE AND (BLEEP)S YOU. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT, JON. WITH CAIN IN THERE BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T LOSE!
Jon: HERMAN CAIN WAS A GREAT WIN IN A FLORIDA STRAW POLL BUT HE'S A LONG SHOT FOR THE NOMINATION.
THEN HE GOES BACK TO MAKING PIZZA. LIKE I SAID, WE CAN'T LOSE!
Jon: I DO NOT SEE HOW YOU CAN BE EXCITED BY HERMAN CAIN! YOU WERE A HUGE OBAMA SUPPORTER.
I DON'T RECALL IT THAT WAY. I VOTED FOR OBAMA BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK, NOT BECAUSE I AGREED WITH HIM. (LAUGHTER) I BARELY AGREED WITH HIM THAT HE WAS BLACK. (LAUGHTER) AND WE'RE NOT GIVING OUT FREE PASS THIS IS TIME AROUND. BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT IS TWICE THE LEVEL OF WHITE UNEMPLOYMENT. AND WHAT DOES OBAMA TELL A BLACK AUDIENCE?
SHAKE IT UP! STOP COMPLAINING! SOME GRUMBLING! STOP CRYING! (LAUGHTER) STOP COMPLAINING, SOME GRUMBLING STOP CRYING? WHY IS HE ALWAYS PICKING ON US, JON? (MUMBLING) (CRYING) WHY DO OUR PROBLEMS ALWAYS HAVE TO COME LAST, JON?
Jon: YOU WERE JUST COMPLAINING AND THEN YOU GRUMBLED AND THEN YOU WERE CRYING. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO!
LOOK, MY POINT IS WHEN JEWISH VOTERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OBAMA'S ISRAEL POLICY HE  ADDRESSES THEM. HE DOESN'T TELL YOU TO STOP COMPLAINING, GRUMBLING AND CRYING SHCHLT.
Jon: WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, JEWS ARE NOT A PARTICULAR  COMPLAINY PEOPLE SO I DON'T SEE WHY HE WOULD TELL US THAT  BECAUSE, QUITE FRANKLY... HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY DO YOU THINK HERMAN CAIN WOULD BE BETTER TO AFRICAN AMERICANS THAN OBAMA? HE HASN'T PROPOSED ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO BLACK VOTERS.
YES, HE HAS. JUST LISTEN TO WITH THE RIGHT EARS.
I'M GOING TO PASS MY 9-9-9 PLAN. A 9% PERSONAL TAX, A 9% NATIONAL SALES TAX.
Jon: 999. IT'S A TAX PLAN AND A SET OF LOTTO NUMBERS! (LAUGHTER) 9... WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE?
Jon: 9.
I'M BOXING THESE NUMBERS, JON. OH, WAIT, I'M GOING TO PLAY IT STRAIGHT, NO, I THINK I'LL BOX THEM.
Jon: HOW DO YOU BOX... FORGET ABOUT IT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BLACK VOTE HERE. WHAT ABOUT WHITE VOTERS? ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE A SECOND BLACK PRESIDENT IN A ROW JUST BECAUSE HE'S...
JON, THEY'LL VOTE FOR A SECOND AND A THIRD. LINE THEM UP, JON. I THINK WHITE VOTERS HAVE FINALLY LEARNED WHAT WHITE WOMEN HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHICH IS...
ONCE YOU GO....
Jon: BLACK.
HEY, HEY, NO, JON, LET ME FINISH, GOD. ONCE YOU GO DOWN THE ROAD TO DIVERSITY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE COURSE AND RETURN TO  ONE'S PREVIOUS MISCONCEPTIONS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY... HOW IS THAT A THING WHITE WOMEN KNOW?
JON, I THINK BECAUSE WOMEN STRUGGLED FOR THEIR OWN RIGHTS. THEY KNOW HOW SATISFYING IT FEELS TO TAKE A MASSIVE....
Jon: BLACK?
NO, JON, STOP! STEP FORWARD, JON!
Jon: SORRY ABOUT THAT.
