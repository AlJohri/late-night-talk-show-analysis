(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, A FOUR STAR GENERAL, SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "IT WORKED FOR ME." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM GENERAL COLIN POWELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU, GOOD TO BE BACK, JON, THANK YOU.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU. YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER BOOK "IT WORKED FOR ME IN LIFE AND LEADERSHIP."  COLIN POWELL, 13 THINGS THAT YOU DO THAT YOU BELIEVE IF OTHER PEOPLE DO THEM THEY CAN BE A  FOUR-STAR GENERAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE.
ABSOLUTELY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT ARE... WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF YOU HAD TO DISTILL IT DOWN THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF  YOUR RECIPE?
IF YOU LOOK AT THE 13 RULES, JUST TAKE THE FIRST ONE AND LAST ONE YOU ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE BOOK. THE FIRST ONE SAYS IT WILL LOOK BETTER IN THE MORNING. NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS LOOK. GO TO BED WITH AN OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDE, CONVEY THAT OPTIMISM TO YOUR FOLLOWERS AND IT WILL  LOOK BETTER IN THE MORNING.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT A DRINKER, ARE YOU? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE A DRINKER IT'S ACTUALLY REVERSED. (LAUGHTER)
IT DOESN'T MEAN THINGS WILL LOOK BETTER IN THE MORNING, IT'S AN ATTITUDE. AND THE LAST RULE, 13, SAYS PERPETUAL OPTIMISM. ALWAYS BE BEING OPTIMISTIC. IT'S A FORCE MULTIPLIER. IN THE MILITARY THAT MEANS YOU HAVE LEVERAGE TO CHANGE THINGS AND SO ALL OF THE RULES SAY BE OPTIMISTIC. HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF. TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE.LrP BE KIND TO PEOPLE. PRETTY SIMPLE RULES. THEY WERE IN MY FIRST BOOK BUT THEY WERE JUST LITTLE LISTING. THIS TIME I EXPANDED THE WHOLE CHAPTER.
IT'S INTERESTING. WE'VE HAD ON A BUNCH OF GUYS FROM THAT ADMINISTRATION, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT WERE  INVOLVED, OBVIOUSLY, IN THE RUNUP TO IRAQ, RUMSFELD, DR. RICE, JOHN BOLTON, RICHARD PEARL, DOUG FIFE. THERE'S A LOT OF BOOKS.
QUITE A CAST.
Jon: YEAH. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I HAVE THAT EVER TALKED TO WHO HAS EXPRESSED ANY REGRET ABOUT THE  INTELLIGENCE LEADING UP TO IT, PLANNING MISTAKES, AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WITH MILITARY EXPERIENCE. AND YOU THINK THAT THATï¿½f HAS SOME CORRELATION TO YOUR OWN... I FIND THAT THE MILITARY GUYS THAT  I MEET ARE VERY INTO FINDING OUT WHAT WENT WRONG, TRYING TO FIX IT. WAS THERE ANY CORRELATION WITH YOUR MILITARY EXPERIENCE TO THAT?
ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE A DOCTRINE THAT'S ATTRIBUTED TO ME THAT WHEN YOU GO INTO A CONFLICT FIRST OF ALL  SEE IF YOU CAN AVOID IT BUT POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC MEANS BUT IF YOU HAVE  TO, GO IN DECISIVE WITH THE FORCE NECESSARY TO GET THE JOB DONE AND I DON'T THINK THAT WAS  DONE IN THIS CASE I OF COURSE REGRET THE U.N. SPEECH THAT I GIVE A BECAME THE PROMINENT  PRESENTATION OF OUR CASE BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS CORRECT AT THE TIME. THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT WAS CORRECT. CONGRESS THOUGHT IT WAS CORRECT. THEY PASSED AN OVERWHELMING RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION BUT MINE IS  THE ONE THAT'S REMEMBERED. AND OF COURSE I REGRET THAT IT TURNED OUT DASH LOT OF IT WAS WRONG.
Jon: MAYBE THIS SPEAKS TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT INSTINCTS BUT IT TURNED OUT THE  INFORMATION OF THE WRONGNESS OF IT WAS THERE BUT NEVER BROUGHT TO FORE, MAYBE AS FORCEFULLY AS  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, THE FACT THAT IT WAS A GUY NAMED CURVEBALL, ONE GUY ON THE  ALUMINUM TUBES FOR ROCKETS NOT CENTRIFUGES.
CURVEBALL IS THE CASE IN POINT BECAUSE HE WAS THE SOURCE OF THIS BACK TIER LOGICAL VAN  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. BUT WHEN I WAS BEING BRIEFED AND PUTTING MY SPEECH TOGETHER THEY SAID THEY HAD FOUR DIFFERENT  SOURCES FOR THAT.
Jon: SURE, CURVEBALL, SPIT BALL, SCREWBALL. (LAUGHTER)
AND WHAT KIND OF SET ME OFF WHEN IT WAS OVER AND WE REALIZED IT HAD COME APART, WE NEVER  TALKED TO THEM. THE GERMANS TALKED TO THEM AND THE GERMANS HAD WARNED US ABOUT THIS FELLOW AND AFTER IT WAS  OVER AND WE FOUND NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THEY SAID WHY DID YOU LISTEN TO THIS GUY IN  THE FIRST PLACE? AND PEOPLE SAID WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT SOLID IN THE BEGINNING. AND THE ANSWERS HAVE NEVER BEEN FAIRLY CLEAR. BUT A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION WAS ON POINT. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT IF SADDAM HUSSEIN STAYED THERE AND HIS REGIME STAYED IN PLACE AND  HE GOT OUT OF U.N. SANCTIONS YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION COMING BACK. HE HAD THE CAPABILITY AND HE USED THEM BEFORE AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE. I'M GLAD HE'S GONE. I'M GLAD THE IRAQI PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO BUILD A MORE STABLE PROPER REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.
THE FIRST PART I'M MUCH MORE IN AGREEMENT. WITH (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SAYING... NOT THAT HE'S A BAD GUY BUT I'M NOT... IT'S  INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THE DOCTRINE OF WHAT... I DON'T KNOW WHO SAYS IT. WAS IT EINSTEIN WHO SAID YOU CANNOT SIMULTANEOUSLY PREVENT AND PREPARE FOR WAR? DO YOU FIND SOMETIMES THAT IN THE PREPARATION FOR IT BECAUSE OF THE FOCUS NECESSARY TO TAKE A  COUNTRY TO WAR THAT IT TENDS TO CREATE A MOMENTUM AND IT SORT OF MOVES ITS OF ITS OWN VOLITION  TOWARDS CONFLICT AS A POSED TO PURPOSE OF IT WHICH WAS AS AS THREAT DIM DIMINISHMENT?
MILITARY FORCE HAS TO BE ON THE TABLE IN ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICT. YOU WANT TO SOLVE IT DIPLOMATICALLY, ECONOMICALLY, BUT ONCE YOU START THINKING ABOUT THE MILITARY THERE IS A CERTAIN MOMENTUM AND THAT'S WHY  POLITICIANS AND GENERALS HAVE TO BE CARE TO FEEL CONTROL THAT SO IT DOESN'T BECOME THE DRIVER, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC PEACE BECOMES THE DRIVER AND WHEN THEY FAIL PUT IN  MILITARY FORCE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CALLED THE RELUCTANT GENERAL FOR THAT REASON.
Jon: IT'S ALWAYS THE GUYS IN THE MILITARY WHO ARE RELUCTANT  BECAUSE I THINK THEY KNOW THE COST OF IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THINGS ABOUT OPTIMISM, HAS IT BEEN DIFFICULT FOR YOU-- A GUY WITH A  STERLING RECORD-- HAS THIS ONE SORT OF VERY KIND OF GLARING BLOT THAT YOU FEEL... HOW DO YOU  GET OVER THAT PERSONALLY? IT IS A BLOT. I ANSWER THIS QUESTION ABOUT THAT U.N. SPEECH EVERYDAY.
Jon: THAT'S WHY I ASKED IT.
YOUR DIDN'T HAVE TO KEEP THE RECORD GOING.
Jon: (LAUGHS) YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET OVER IT. I MAKE THIS CLEAR IN THE BOOK AND IN OTHER WAYS TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THINGS WILL GO WRONG. THINGS WILL BE SEEN AS A FAILURE. YOU HAVE TO GET OVER THOSE. I WAS STILL SECRETARY OF STATE, I STILL HAD WORK TO DO SO I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED AS BEST I COULD AND ROLL IT UP IN A  BALL, THROW IT OVER MY SHOULDER AND TRY TO....
Jon: LEARN FROM IT.
LEARN FROM IT THAT YOU HAVE TO BORE DOWN MORE DEEPLY THAN WE  DID AT THAT TIME WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE AND, OF COURSE, THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM HAS BEEN  REORGANIZED, ALL SORTS OFERS WERE PUT IN TO MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.kï¿½Di  WE HAVE A DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SITTING ON TOP OF IT ALL AND I THINK THE CONGRESS  COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB IN EXAMINING IT.
Jon: DON'T YOU DARE BESMIRCH THE NAME OF CONGRESS, SIR. (LAUGHTER) THEY ARE PATRIOTIC AMERICANS TRYING TO DRESS THEMSELVES AND FEED THEMSELVES. (LAUGHTER) STICK AROUND FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES?
SURE.
Jon: "IT WORKED FOR ME" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
