Jon: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. I'M JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT-- TONIGHT, OUR GUEST, AWE PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR JOHN MEACHAM. HE HAS THIS NEW WORK, A FRUCTOSE-FREE LIFE-- MY YEAR WITHOUT FRUIT. LAUGH ( LAUGHTER ) I'M BEING TOLD AN AN ANTHOLOGY ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR BUT SOMEONE  REALLY SHOULD WRITE THAT FRUCTOSE BOOK. IT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING. HAPPY CINCO DeMAYO. BUT FIRST-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. HERE'S HOW LAME AND OLD I AM-- I THOUGHT IT WAS MAY 5. ( LAUGHTER ) BIG NEWS FROM THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE-- DEBATE IN  SOUTH CAROLINA TONIGHT WILL PIT TIM PAWLENTY AGAINST RON PAUL IN A CONTEST TO DETERMINE ONCE AND  FOR ALL WHO WILL COME IN FOURTH IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ABSENT FROM THE DEBATE, FRONT-RUNNERS DONALD TRUMP AND SARAH PALIN, THE TOM ARNOLD AND ROSEANNE BARR OF THE REPUBLICAN  FIELD, WHO ARE NEVERTHELESS MANAGING TO ADDRESS ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THEIR PARTY'S BASE.
TRUMP IS RAISING SOME EYEBROWS FOR COMPARING HIS OPPOSITION TO LEGALIZING  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE TO HIS RELUCTANCE TO USE A NEW KIND OF PUTTER. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT I  THINK GAY PEOPLE AND STRAIGHT PEOPLE USE THE SAME PUTTERS. ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY A MATTER OF HOLE SELECTION, NOT... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "OH, I'M STOOPING.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SUNDAY QUOTE-- "IT'S LIKE IN GOLF. I DON'T WANT THIS TO SOUND TRIVIAL BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SWILLING TO THESE REALLY LONG  PUTTERS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SINK THREE-FOOTERS ANYMORE AND I HATE IT. I AM A TRADITIONALIST. I HAVE SO MANY FABULOUS FRIENDS WHO HAPPEN TO BE GAY, BUT I AM A TRADITIONALIST. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: I'VE GOT FRIENDS, THEY'RE FABULOUS, THEY'RE GAY, FABUOUSLY GAY, BUT I WANT THIS COUNTRY TO HONOR TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. GAY PEOPLE CAN'T DO IT BUT I CAN DO IT AS MANY TIMES AS I WANT WITH PROGRESSIVELY YOUNGER BROADS. TRADITION! TRUMP 2012. YOU KNOW THE GREATEST THING ABOUT TRUMP-- HE'S STEALING ALL THE CRAZY OXYGEN FROM SARAH PALIN. ALL SHE DID TWEET ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT.
FORMER GOVERNOR SARAH PALIN TOOK TO TWITTER SAYING, "SHOW PHOTO AS WARNING TO OTHER  SEEKING AMERICA'S DESTRUCTION. NO PUSSY FOOTING AROUND. NO POLITICKING. NO DRAMA. IT'S PART OF THE MISSION."
Jon: EXCELLENT. ( LAUGHTER ) SARAH PALIN'S MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT IS THIS-- YOU HAVE TO  SEE THE ENTIRE TASK THROUGH. THE SORT OF IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND PRESIDENTIAL ADVICE SHE HAD TO QUIT HER JOB AS GOVERNOR TO  BE ABLE TO GIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRYING TO PROCESS OUR LATENT 9/11 GRIEF, MIXED WITH A CATHARTIC SERATONIN ECSTASY BATH OF GETTING BIN LADEN, THE PUNDITS HAVE FINALLY  BEEN ABLE TO CRYSTALLIZE THIS MOMENT.
THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN BY U.S. SPECIAL FORCES IS SUMMER A DEFINING MOMENT FOR  PRESIDENT OBAMA,.
A CLOSE-UP OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE SITUATION ROOM YESTERDAY, A DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIS PROCESS.
IT COULD BE THE DEFINING MOMENT IN BARACK OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY.
Jon: IT COULD BE AND IT WILL BE, UNTIL OBAMA'S NO-HOLDS-BARRED DEATH MATCH WITH  KIM JONG IL ON THE MOON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MOON FIGHT! MOON FIGHT! MOON! ON THE MOON! PUNDITS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM VACILLATED BETWEEN WHETHER THIS COULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT FOR  OBAMA OR IF IT ABSOLUTELY WAS A DEFINING MOMENT, SOMETIMES DOING SO WITHIN THE HEAD OF THE SAME PERSON.
NO DOUBT THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN WILL BE THE DEFINING MOMENT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  FIRST TERM, AT LEAST SO FAR.
Jon: FIVE MINUTES LATER...
WILL KILLING OSAMA BIN LADEN PROVE TO BE THE DEFINING MOMENT FOR THIS PRESIDENT? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: THAT'S CHRIS MATTHEWS, ASKING HIMSELF THE QUESTION THAT HE HIMSELF HAD ANSWERED FIVE MINUTES EARLIER ON HIS OWN PROGRAM. ( LAUGHTER ) ALTHOUGH, IN HIS DEFENSE, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP A THOUGHT IN A HEAD THAT LARGE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S-- ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S SO MUCH OPEN SPACE FOR THOUGHTS TO ROAM. YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY GOT LESS OF A HEAD, MORE OF A FREE-RANGE IDEA FARM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND TO BE FAIR TO THE MEDIA, GETTING BIN LADEN IS A MOMENTOUS EVENT, AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEFINING MOMENT OF ANYONE'S PRESIDENCY. IT'S NOT LIKE THE MEDIA THROWS A PHRASE LIKE THAT AROUND FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY EVENT.
THE LAME DUCK SESSION IN CONGRESS DISTINGUISHES HIS MOMENT IN HIS PRESIDENCY.
COULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIS PRESS AGAINST.
EXTENDING THE BUSH-ERA TAX CUTS-- IS THIS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA?

I THINK THIS G.M. DECISION IS ANYTHING TO BE ONE OF THE DEFINING MOMENTS OF THIS OBAMA  PEREZ DESPERATE.
AFGHANISTAN IS THE TOUGHEST ISSUE HE'S FACED.
COULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT FOR THIS PRESIDENCY?
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
Jon: EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT HAD LUNCH. COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE DEFINING SANDWICH OR PERHAPS THE YOGURT SHAKE IS THE PRESIDENCY'S  DEFINING BEVERAGE. LOOK, ANY ONE OF YOU WITH A TELEVISION SHOW, ANY ONE OF THOSE COULD BUILD A MONTAGE IN  THE MEDIA SUGGESTING DIFFERENT MOMENTS OF THE DEFINING MOMENT IN OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY. ONE NEW CASTER BOLD ENOUGH TO ONLY USE THIS PHRASE TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU THE DEFINER.
JUST VOTED TODAY TO DENY UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. I MEAN, ISN'T THIS SOMEWHAT OF A DEFINING MOMENT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?
WHY IS SOCIAL SECURITY 99 ON THE TABLE? THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE DEFINING MOMENTS.

I VIEW THIS AS A REAL DEFINING MOMENT.
IS THIS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR PROGRESSIVES?
UNLIMITED CORPORATE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.

THIS IS GOING TO BE A DEFINING MOMENT IN MINING HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVES A SPEECH TOMORROW THAT MAY BE-- I  DON'T KNOW, IS IT THE DEFINING MOMENT IN HIS FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT? I THINK IT IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SLEEP WELL, AMERICA! KNOW THAT WHILE YOU REST ONE, MAN IT S OUT THERE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IS OF EQUAL YET URGENT IMPORT. ( LAUGHTER ) DEFINER AWAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
