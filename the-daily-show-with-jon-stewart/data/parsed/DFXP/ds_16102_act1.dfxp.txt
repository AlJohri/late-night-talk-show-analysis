AUGUST 4, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SO NICE TO SEE YOU. ON TONIGHT'S SHOW, SENATOR DICK DURBIN FROM THE GANG OF SIX, THE GANG OF SIX. YO YO. YOU KNOW TO, GET INTO THE GANG OF SIX, THEY BEAT YOU INCH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THAT. SACKSBY CHAMBLISS JUST GETS UP, COME ON, LET'S DO IT. ANYWAY, SPECIAL DAY. IT'S OUR PRESIDENT'S 50th BIRTHDAY, AND I AM NO INGRATE. I GOT HIM A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT I THINK HE'S GOING TO REALLY ENJOY.
MASSIVE 500-POINT SELL-OFF DOUSING WALL STREET IN A SEA OF RED.
AND THE BEARS ARE MAULING WALL STREET.
WATCHING IT FALL LIKE A ROCK IN A SWIMMING POOL.
THE 14th-WORST POINT DECLINE FOR THE S&P 500.
EXTREME FEAR AND PANIC. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪♪  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, I DON'T HAVE A RECEIPT FOR THAT. SO... [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, AMERICA'S RECENT FISCAL TROUBLES IN THE ECONOMY SHOULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE  FACT AND SHOULDN'T LET US FORGET THAT WE ALL HATE EACH OTHER. [LAUGHTER] A QUICK REMINDER OF THAT IN OUR NEW SEGMENT "CULTURE WAR UPDATE, THE DIVIDENING OF AMERICA." OUR FIRST DISPATCH COMES FROM A VETERAN CULTURE WARRIOR, MR. LOU  DOBBS, WHO SEEMED A LITTLE ALARMED LAST NIGHT OVER A RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD OF  COMIC BOOKS.
PETER PARKER, WHO WAS A WHITE ORPHAN FROM QUEENS, WAS KILLED  OFF IN JUNE DURING A FIGHT WITH HIS NEMESIS, THE GREEN GOBLIN. MARVEL COMICS SAYING IT'S REPLACING THE ICONIC CHARACTER WITH MILES MORALES, WHO IS PART  LATINO AND PART BLACK.
Jon: MY GOD! IT'S LOU DOBBS' WORST NIGHTMARE, A LATINO THAT CAN CLIMB WALLS. [LAUGHTER] NOT TO IN ANY WAY SUN ON HIS PARADE, BUT THE NEW MULTIRACIAL SPIDER-MAN APPEARS IN THE COMIC  "ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN," WHICH IS ACTUALLY SET IN A DIFFERENT ALTD  NAT UNIVERSE THAN THAT OF THE REAL SPIDER-MAN WHO STILL EXISTS AND IS STILL CAUCASIAN AND ALSO  IS NOT REAL. [LAUGHTER] BUT, OF COURSE, THE ARTS ARE NOT THE ONLY BATTLEFIELD IN OUR CULTURE WARS. THIS CONFLICT IS ALSO BEING FOUGHT IN AND AROUND OUR PEE HOLE.
BIRTH CONTROL FOR WOMEN NOW GOING TO BE COMPLETELY FREE.
NO CO-PAY OR DEDUCKABLE.
I MIGHT BE FOR THAT IF I DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT  THERE ABLE TO BUY A NEW PAIR OF SHOES.
IF YOU CAN AFFORD A $5 FRAPPUCCINO AT STARBUCKS, YOU CAN PAY YOUR $5 CO-PAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A $5 FRAPPUCCINO AND YET STILL HAVE GENITALS? SEE, DANA, AND YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH, YOU AND I AS WELL-KNOWN TELEVISION  PERSONALITIES ARE ABLE TO USE OUR SALARIES TO LIVE ON AND SET ASIDE OUR SPEAKING FEES FOR  FRAPPUCCINOS AND CONTRACEPTION. [LAUGHTER] NOT EVERYONE CAN. YET THEY WOULD STILL LIKE TO KEEP THEIR, AND LET ME USE YOUR STARBUCK'S PARLANCE, TALL FAMILY  FROM BECOMING VENTI. [LAUGHTER] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THE SIDES AREN'T THAT FAR APART. LET'S BREAK DOWN THE ARGUMENT.
SUPPORTERS SAY THIS MARKS A MILESTONE IN WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE. BIRTH CONTROL OPPONENTS ARGUE THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT MESSING WITH GOD. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: I SEE. SO ON THE ONE SIDE THEY'RE SAYING GREATER ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION COULD RESULT IN  $19 BILLION WORTH OF SAVINGS AND INCREASED HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE SAYING, YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! [APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, BOY, I GOT TO TELL YOU THIS, AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS, THE SANCTIMONIOUS  RIGHT-WING PUNDITS ALWAYS WANT TO FORCE THEIR VISION OF THE WORLD ON EVERYONE ELSE. BECAUSE THEY'RE OFFENDED, WE ALL HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING UP.
THIS IS PAIR OF STEEL BEAMS IN THE FORM OF A CROSS FOUND IN  THE WRECKAGE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. A GROUP OF ATHEISTS HAVE RECENTLY FILED A LAWSUIT SAYING THAT THIS CROSS SHOULD NOT BE  PART OF THE GROUND ZERO MEMORIAL.
Jon: ATHEISTS! [LAUGHTER] DAMN YOU TO -- ATHEISTS. [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, ATHEISTS, WHY DO YOU GIVE A [BLEEPED]? THAT CROSS IS AN ARTIFACT. IT WAS FOUND AT GROUND ZERO. IT HAS COME TO MEAN SOMETHING TO PEOPLE WHO VIEW IT AS A SYMBOL OF COMFORT. IF IT REALLY BOTHERS YOU, WHY NOT JUST THINK OF IT AS A METAL T-SHAPED THINGY? OR PURELY AN ARCHITECTURAL TERM. IT'S NOT A CROSS. IT'S A CROSS BEAM. DON'T THINK OF IT AS AN ODE TO JESUS. THINK OF IT AS AN HOMAGE TO JESUS THE CANAANITE WITH A RELATIVELY UNSUCCESSFUL CARPENTRY BUSINESS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S FINE, THAT'S FINE. THAT'S OUR SYSTEM. YOU CAN FILE LAWSUITS. JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A LAWSUIT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR DAY IN COURT. IT'S NOT LIKE THE ATHEISTS ARE BEING TOTAL DICKS ABOUT IT.
HERE'S A QUOTE FROM DAVE SILVERMAN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD ATHEISTS ORGANIZATION. "THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CROSS HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN ICON. IT HAS BEEN BLESSED BY HOLY MEN AND PRESENTED AS A REMINDER THAT THEIR GOD, WHO COULDN'T BE  BOTHERED TO STOP THE MUSLIM TERRORISTS OR PREVENT 3,000 PEOPLE FROM BEING KILLED IN HIS  NAME, CARED ONLY ENOUGH TO BESTOW ON US SOME RUBBLE THAT RESEMBLES A CROSS."  [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon:, WELL, I CAN SEE WHY HE'S THE PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ATHEIST ORGANIZATION, I PROMISE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE, EVEN  THOSE WHO ARE INDIFFERENT TO OUR CAUSE, WILL [BLEEPED] HATE US. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THE ATHEISTS SUGGESTED AN ALTERNATIVE STATUE AT GROUND ZERO. ATOMS ARE ALREADY WELL REPRESENTED AT GROUND ZERO. THERE ARE BILLIONS OF THEM THERE. [LAUGHTER] SO I GUESS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A SIZE ISSUE. YOU'RE MAD THAT THE ATOMS ARE MICROSCOPIC AND THE CROSS IS BIG. PERHAPS AS A COMPROMISE, WE COULD BUILD YOU AN ATOMIC SYMBOL STATUE, BUT IT HAS TO BE MADE  OUT OF BILLIONS OF CROSSES. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
