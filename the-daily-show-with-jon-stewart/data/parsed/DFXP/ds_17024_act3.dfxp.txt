( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING DIRECTOR.
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN SITTING ACROSS FROM THE SHOPS.
Jon:  THAT'S ACTUALLY THE WHOLE MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME MARTIN SCORSESE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DISPR NICE TO SEE YOU  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHEW! FIRST OF ALL, LET ME TELL YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY, FOR GOODNESS SAKE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU. I WENT AND SAW THIS FILM LAST NIGHT. I DON'T NORMALLY DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T NORMALLY RESPECT MY GUESTS (  LAUGHTER  )  IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM. NOT THE BODY COUNT THAT I NORMALLY LIKE TO SEE IN ONE OF YOUR FILMS. BUT A BEAUTIFUL-- JUST A REALLY WONDERFUL, LOVELY ODE-- A LOVE LETTER ALMOST TO FILM MAKING.
THAT'S PART OF IT. OF COURSE THE BOY WHO IS 12 YEARS OLD, ASSA BUTTERFIELD, LIVING IN PARIS IN 1931. THIS ISOLATED KID GETS INVOLVED WITH THE OLDER GENTLEMAN YOU SAW PLAYED BY BEN KINGSLEY, WHO  TURNS OUT TO BE GEORGE MELIER, ONE OF THE GREAT PIONEERS OF CINEMA. HE DID HAVE A TOY STORE. 16 YEARS AFTER HIS LIFE HAD BEEN DESTROYED, AFTER HE CREATED EVERYTHING WE DO NOW IN CINEMA, FROM JIM CAMERON, SPIELBERG, LUCAS, ALL COMES FROM WHAT HE DID. IT DOES HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.
Jon:  IT HAS A WONDERFUL ENDING. I DIDN'T REALIZE BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY FANTASTIC AND FANTASTICAL ELEMENTS BUT I  GRABBED A LITTLE WIKIPEDIA TODAY. IT'S A TRUE STORY (  LAUGHTER  ).
IT'S TRUE. HE MADE ABOUT 500 FILMS. WHEN THEY FOUND HIM AT THE STATION, 1928,, "THEY SAID YOU LOOK LIKE MELUOUS. HE SAID I AM. HE LOST MOST OF HIS FINANCING WHEN THE BIGGER COMPANIES CAME IN. WHAT HAPPENED EDISON, HERE, ALSO AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON WITH COPYRIGHT AND THAT  SORT OF THING. BUT IN ANY EVENT, THEY SAID-- THEY TOOK HIM IN. THEY-- HE WAS FETTED EVERYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. I THINK HE DIED IN 1938. HE WAS HOPING TO COME TO HOLLYWOOD TO WORK ON A FANTASY FILM IN HOLLYWOOD.
Jon:  THAT'S TREMENDOUS. THERE'S A STORY EDISON HAD TAKEN ONE OF HIS FILMS AND SHOWED IT, AND IT BECAME ENORMOUSLY POPULAR IN AMERICA BUT EDISON DECIDED NOT TO PAY-- I GUESS WHAT WE  WOULD CALL IN THESE DAYS, ROYALTIES.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HE-- THE FILM, I THINK WAS THE FAMOUS ONE, "A TRIP TO THE MOON."
Jon:  WHEN THE MOON GET HIT IN THE EYE--
THEY WERE JUST TAKING THE FILMS AND MAKING DUPEES OF THEM. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE WAS FINISHED FINANCIALLY, ULTIMATELY.
Jon:  IN SOME WAYS EDISON, ALSO THE INVENTOR OF THE PHONOGRAPH AND ALL THOSE THINGS, INVENTED PIRATING MOVIES (  LAUGHTER  ).
OH, YES. IT'S A GREAT IDEA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A FILM, PUT A NICKEL IN HERE.
Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS A 3D MOVIE IS THIS YOUR FIRST 3D.
YES.
Jon:  YOU PITCHED THE IDEA TO THE STUDIOS. YOU SAID I HAVE AN IDEA FAIR MOVIE. IT'S A 3D MOVIE INSIDE OF A CLOCK.
BUT IT LOOKS GREAT INSIDE OF THE CLOCK. I WENT UP THERE AND THOSE-- THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S AMAZING. I MEAN, WE AMPLIFIED SOMEWHAT BASED ON BRIAN'S BOOK, BRIAN SELZNICK. FIVE YEARS I WAS GOING TO MAKE THE PICTURE. THINGS DIDN'T TURN OUT. MY WIFE READ THE BOOK AND SAID, "IT'S FOR YOU." IN THE MEANTIME-- IN THE MEANTIME-- 12 YEARS AGO (  LAUGHTER  )  WE HAD A LITTLE GIRL. IN THE MEANTIME, ALL THIS TIME-- WHEN THE KIDS COME, THEY'RE SMALL.
Jon:  BUT THEY'RE NOT HAMPSTERS.
NO, BUT THAT'S THE POINT. THEY GROW. WHEN THEY GROW, YOU KNOW, THEY START TO WALK. THEY START TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS, START TO TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE LIVING WITH THIS-- THIS-- YOU KNOW, A PERSON.
Jon:  YES.
AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THESE THING. SO WHAT HAPPENS THE KID READS THE BOOK, SHE LIKES THE BOOK, HELEN LIKING THE BOOK AND FINALLY THEY ALL LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU MACH A  PICTURE YOUR KIDS CAN SEE FOR ONCE? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU."
I HAD ASTHMA ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID. I WAS ISOLATED. I COULDN'T SPLAY SPORTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I WAS KEPT IN A ROOM-- YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I DID GO OUT A LITTLE BIT. THEY WOULDN'T LET ME OUT.
Jon:  THEY KEPT YOU IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE.
IN THE APARTMENT, YES. I WENT OUT. I WENT OUT. I WENT TO SCHOOL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO RUN OR LAUGH.
Jon:  WHAT!
THE POINT IS I'D START LAUGHING AND, YOU KNOW --
BUT YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT LAUGH.
WELL, THAT'S WHY NOW.
Jon:  SO YOU SAT IN A ROOM AS A BOY WORKING ON YOUR LAUGH. ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU HAD TO. WHERE I CAME FROM.
Jon:  WHY ISN'T THIS A MOVIE BECAUSE THIS-- ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT AN INCREDIBLE FILM THAT  WOULD BE. I THINK IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX CLOCKS? BECAUSE WE COULD-- I.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THAT.
Jon:  HAS THIS PERSON THAT HAS GROWN IN YOUR HOUSE SEEN THE FILM?
YES, BUT SHE'S ONLY SEEN IT THREE TIMES. I SAID, "COME, NOW. YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE."
Jon:  EXACTLY.
THE MINUTE I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO THE FILM, ALL HER AND HER  FRIENDS YELLED, "IN 3D, RIGHT?"
Jon:  IT HAD TO BE IN 3D. NOW THAT SHE'S SEEN IT DOES SHE COMPREHEND WHAT YOU DO?
WELL, SHE-- SHE WAS EXCITED WHEN THAT "SHUTTER ISLAND" OPENED. OF COURSE SHE COULDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT (  LAUGHTER  ) THE KID IS LIKE NINE YEARS OLD  AND ASKING, "DAD,LYO IS THISN THIS. LOOK WHOSE HAPPENING." SO FINALLY, WE WERE DOING SOME OF THE SHOTS IN LONDON AND SHE  WAS THERE FOR THE SUMMER. AND WE WERE DRIVING BACK IN THE CAR AND SHE LEANED OVER TO ME AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, I THINK  THIS MIGHT BE REALLY INTERESTING, THIS FILM." "NO OFFENSE ABOUT "SHUTTER  ISLAND" BUT I THINK THIS-- AND SHE HAD ANOTHER IDEA, TOO, WHICH WAS INTERESTING. "WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN MAKE A FILM. I SAID, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. SO YOU'RE THINKING --
I LOVE IT.
WHAT HAPPENS, YES, THE KIDS IN THE MOVIE WERE WONDERFUL. ASA AND CHLOE.
Jon:  IT'S A WONDERFUL FILM. IT REALLY IS. THANK GOD I WAS WEARING 3D GLASSES BECAUSE I WAS CRYING LIKE AN IDIOT. "HUGO" IN THE THEATERS NOVEMBER 23. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
