Jon: JUST SO YOU KNOW THE REAL PROFESSOR BUTTERSCOTCH IS ALIVE. I DIDN'T REALLY SQUEEZE HER SO HARD SHE TURNED INTO A GLASS SIAMESE CAT. ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY YOU NOTICE THAT THE DEFAULT  REPUBLICAN NOMINEE MITT ROMNEY SPENDS LITTLE OR NO TIME DOING INTERVIEWS ON THE TV WHERE THE OTHER  CANDIDATES ARE WORKING THE SUNDAY NEWS SHOW CIRCUIT LIKE A POLITICIAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WHY NO ONE ON ONES FOR ROMNEY? BECAUSE HE'S RUNNING A CLASSIC POLITICAL GAMBIT CALL KD THE MARLIN MONEY STER STRATEGY. ROMNEY APPEARS ONLY IN DEBATE SURROUNDED BY MONEY STERS. AKA THE OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. AND INSTANTLY VOTERS THINK THAT PRETTY ONE SEEMS NORMAL. BUT ON TUESDAY NIGHT ROMNEY DECIDED TO DITCH THE MONEY STERS AND SIT DOWN ONE-ON-ONE WITH FOX NEWS  BRETT BAIER WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON SURROUNDED ROMNEY WITH JELLIES AND MARMALADES. OR MAYBE THAT'S THE FOX SURVIVAL BUNKER THAT GLENN BECK LEFT BEHIND. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CAN'T THINK OF-- BUT IT WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW BY BAIER AND AS BAIER TOLD BILL  O'REILLY AFTERWARD, ROMNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT SO MUCH.
HE THOUGHT IT WAS OVERLY AGGRESSIVE. CLEARLY GOT UP SET WITH THE QUESTION. HE WAS IRRITATED BY THE INTERVIEW.
AND AFTER WE FINISHED HE WENT TO HIS HOLDING ROOM AND THEN CAME BACK AND SAID HE  DIDN'T LIKE THE INTERVIEW. AND THOUGHT IT WAS UNCALLED FOR.
Jon: OH [BLEEP], JAM FIGHT IN THE MARMALADE ROOM! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JAM FIGHT IN THE MARMALADE ROOM! LET'S GO TO IT LET'S SEE WHAT IS ON.
LIGHTNING ROUND HERE. WHAT WAS THE LAST BOOK YOU READ.
I'M READING A FUN ONE SO I WILL SKIP THAT, I JUST READ DECISION POINTS BY  PRESIDENT BUSH.
Jon: GOOD CALL ON READING THE FUN ONE THAT MIGHT HUMANIZE YOU UNDER YOUR HAT. FAVORITE FOOD.
I'M GOING TO KEEP ONES THAT OTHER HUMANS EAT TO MYSELF, AND-- PROTEIN-BASED PASTE. (LAUGHTER) NAILED IT. BY THE WAY, MITT DID YOU SAY THE BOOK YOU JUST FINISHED WAS PRESIDENT BUSH'S  DECISION POINTS, BECAUSE IF I RECALL ARE YOU WERE ASKED THAT SAME QUESTION GO SIX  MONTHS AGO ON THE "TODAY SHOW". LET'S SEE WHAT --
WHAT IS THE LAST BOOK YOU READ.
I JUST FINISHED PRESIDENT BUSH'S BOOK, DECISIONS (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TELL ME SOMETHING, YOU CAN'T JUST FINISH THE SAME BOOK TWICE OVER A SIX MONTH SPAN. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON JUST FINISHED A BOOK IS LIKE TWO WEEKS. ACTUALLY THAT WASN'T EVEN A PART OF THE INTERVIEW THAT MADE ROMNEY UP SET. THIS WAS.
YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF SOME ISSUES.
CLIMATE CHANGE, ABORTION, IMMIGRATION, GAY RIGHTS.
WELL, BRETT, YOUR LIST IS JUST NOT ACCURATE. SO ONE WE'RE GOING HAVE TO BE BETTER INFORMED ON MY VIEWS ON ISSUES AND OUR PLAN --
DID YOU SAY ON CAMERA ANDO AND OTHER PLACES THAT AT TIMES YOU THOUGHT IT  WOULD BE A MODEL FOR THE NATION.
YOU ARE WRONG, BRETT.
NO, NO, THERE IS TAPE.
NO, THE TAPE OUT THERE, CONTINUE TO READ THE TAPE AND THE TAPE GOES ON TO SAY FOR EACH STATE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT,.
FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T READ TAPES. SECOND OF ALL--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M SURE IF YOU READ IT LONG ENOUGH IT IS AS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO YOU  BECAUSE IT TAKES YOU INTO PRESENT-DAY WHERE YOU HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED YOUR POSITION. SO BUT HERE'S THE THING, LOOK HOW ANGRY AND DEFENSIVE MITT ROMNEY GETS ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT PREVIOUS  POLITICAL POSITIONS HE TOOK WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF A MORE LIBERAL STATE, MASSACHUSETTS. AND THE POLITICAL POSITIONS HE TOOK WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN THE MORE  MODERATE 2008 REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT EVASIVE, DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE RECENTLY.
SHE HAD THE 61 TEXT OR CALL, SOME OF THEM -- OR 5 IN THE MORNING.
ALL THIS IS AS IS 61 CALLS. I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE 61 TIMES. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT WAIT, THAT'S HERMAN CAIN TRYING TO EVADE QUESTIONS ABOUT A POTENTIAL MISTRESS. I MEAN WHY WOULD MITT ROMNEY BEHAVE THE SAME WAY ABOUT HIS POLIT-- I THINK I  FIGURED OUT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. JUST LIKE HERMAN CAIN, MITT ROMNEY HAS AN EMBARRASSING PERSON IN HIS PAST WHO HE IS  DESPERATELY TRYING TO HIDE. FOR HERMAN KANE A WOMAN NAMED GINGER WHITE. FOR MITT ROMNEY, IT'S MITT ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER) MITT ROMNEY, MITT ROMNEY IS HIS OWN MISTRESS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND BY THE WAY, IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEY SAY OPPOSITES ATTRACT. ROMNEY KNOWS IF VOTERS FIND OUT ABOUT THIS OTHER FAR MORE LIBERAL GUY HE'S BEEN  WITH, THEY'LL NEVER TRUST HIM AGAIN. OH, THE EMBARRASSMENT. HERE HE WAS TO TRUMP THE PUBLIC FIGURE HOLDING POLITICAL OFFICE OFFICE ALL  WHILE SECRETLY LAVISHING HIS LOVER WITH HEALTH CARE AND AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. AND I'M SURE HE'S JUST GOING TO CLAIM THAT HE WAS FRIENDS WITH HIS YOUNGER SPOUSE BUT  COME ON-- ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME NEVER TAPPED THAT? (LAUGHTER)
