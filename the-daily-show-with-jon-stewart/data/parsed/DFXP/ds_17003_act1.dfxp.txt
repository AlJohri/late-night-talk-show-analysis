OCTOBER 5, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JON JON WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ACT YOUR HUGH JACKMAN. THIS IS IS INTERESTING, HUGH JACKMAN. HE IS PROBABLY THE ONE ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD THAT I AM MOST OFTEN CONFUSED WITH. [LAUGHTER] DID I SAY HUGH JACKMAN? I MEN DANNY DeVITO. DANNY, I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING. WE BEGIN RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. THERE WAS A MARCH ON WALL STREET TODAY SPONSORED BY THE GROUP OCCUPY WALL STREET AND ODDLY  ENOUGH SUNNY D, FOR EXTREME PROTESTERS. THE OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT HAS BASICALLY BEEN A FOUR-WEEK, DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN LIVEIN, WHICH HAS SPREAD TO CITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, CAUSING THE MEDIA  TO MOVE ITS COVERAGE DIAL FROM BLACKOUT TO CIRCUS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S TOO BAD THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO SETTINGS IT HAS. INTREAD PIT REPORTERS FROM ALL THE MAJOR NETWORKS AND CNN WENT DOWN TO TALK WITH THE PROTESTERS. OF COURSE, THE REPORTERS CHANGED INTO THEIR UNDERCOVER 21 JUMP STREET OUTFITS. WHAT'S UP, PROTESTERS? MIND IF WE CHILAX WITH YOU IN H.D. BECAUSE THE ASPECT RATIO ON THE SHOT'S GOING TO BE... [LAUGHTER] WHY ARE THE PROTESTERS THERE? WELL, THE ANSWERS RANGED FROM EXTREMELY EARNEST COLLEGE REMATEY TO POWERFUL AND COGENT.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT?
BRING ATTENTION TO THE PERVASIVE INFLUENCE THAT CORPORATIONS HAVE IN THE  POLITICAL PROCESS.
WHAT DO WE AS AMERICANS AGREE ON AND WHAT CAN WE DO?
WE'RE HERE TO TAKE THE POWER BACK.
THE LIVING STANDARDS DECREASED WHILE THE WEALTHIEST 1% HAS HAD IT BETTER THAN EVER. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR PARTICIPATION IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
Jon: WHEW, YEAH. THAT MUST HAVE BROUGHT  [BLEEPED]. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING? WHAT'S UP, TEA PARTY? I SEE YOUR HAT AND I RAISE YOU A UNION SOLDIER. [LAUGHTER] SO THOSE ARE THE PROTESTERS, OR TO PUT THEIR WORDS ANOTHER WAY...
I THINK IF YOU PUT EVERY SINGLE LEFT-WING CAUSE INTO A BLENDER AND HIT POWER, THIS IS  THE SLUDGE YOU'D GET.
I SAW ONE GUY WITH A GUITAR, AND THEY ASKED HIM...
VERY HIPPIE.
IT'S LIKE WOODSTOCK MEETS BURNING MAN MEETS PEOPLE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE.
THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST UNINFORMED PEOPLE IF YOU LISTEN TO THEM.
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE MAP.
DEMOLITION OF CAPITALISM. IF WE LEARN TO SHARE, WE CAN ALL LIVE IN PROSPERITY.
ALL OF THOSE QUOTES COULD HAVE BEEN SAID IN 1789 FRANCE OR THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OR THE  RUSSIAN REVOLUTION OR WITH ONLY SLIGHT MODIFICATION WHEN THE NAZIS WERE COMING TO POWER. THIS IS ALWAYS THE BEGINNING OF TOTALITARIANISM.
Jon: THIS GROUP IS A LAUGHABLE GANG OF DISORGANIZED, CONFUSED NAZIS. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS AN ILL-DISCIPLINED, HIGHLY TRAINED, WEED-SMOKING, FASCIST ORGANIZATION. BUT THE PROTESTERS DO HAVE SOME SURPRISING DEFENDERS.
YOU KNOW, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN TAXPAYER KNOWS THAT AT  THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR THE TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF  DOLLARS THAT WE'RE USING TO BAIL OUT THESE COMPANIES, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE, AND THEY ARE EXPRESSING THEIR FRUSTRATION, WHICH I THINK IS QUINTESSENTIALLY AMERICAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [SLOW CLAP] BRAVO, SEAN HANNITY, BREAKING RANKS WITH YOUR CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS -- OH, THAT'S A CLIP  FROM 2009 ABOUT THE TEA PARTY? OH. OH. OH. WHAT DOES SEAN HANNITY THINK ABOUT THESE PROTESTERS' FRUSTRATIONS?
THEY HATE CORPORATIONS. THEY HATE CAPITALISM, AND IN THE END ULTIMATELY THEY WANT STATISM OVER FREE MARKETS. SO THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE FREEDOM.
Jon: OH, ALL RIGHT. SO RAGE AGAINST DUAL ELECTED GOVERNMENT IS PATRIOTIC AND AMERICAN, BUT RAGE AGAINST  MULTINATIONAL SHAREHOLDER CORPORATIONS IS ANTI-AMERICAN. GOT YOU. I DON'T GET IT. HERE'S A GROUP OF AMERICANS DISENCHANTED RAILING AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT BAILOUT, ANGRY  BECAUSE THEY PLAYED BY THE RULES, WORKED HARD, AND NOW THEY'RE IN DEBT WITH STUDENTS  LOAN AND UNEMPLOYED. IF THIS TURNS INTO THROWING TRASH CANS INTO STARBUCKS WINDOW, NOBODY'S GOING TO BE  DOWN WITH THAT. WE ALL LOVE STARBUCKS. [LAUGHTER]
BUT THESE PROTESTERS, HOW ARE THEY NOT LIKE THE TEA PARTY? ALL RIGHT. SOME OF THEM SMOKE AND HAVE PANTS MADE OUT OF POT. SO CALL THEM THE T.H.C. PARTY. AREN'T THESE FOLKS REAL CITIZENS WITH REAL PROBLEMS? AREN'T THEY ALSO SPEAKING FOR AMERICA?
THESE FOLKS AREN'T SPEAKING FOR AMERICA.
JUST YOUR BASIC GREEN ANTI-CAPITALIST, ANTI-BANK, ANTI-WALL STREET, ANTI-MESH DEMONSTRATION.
THAT'S NOT TEA PARTY BEHAVIOR. THAT'S NOT AMERICA-LOVING BEHAVIOR.
Jon: THEY PROBABLY DON'T EVEN MASTER BAIT TO THE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. I'LL BITE. WHY, WHY ARE THE OCCUPY WALL STREET FOLKS UNWORTHY OF TEA PARTY RESPECT AND IDEALS.
THEY'RE NOT LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. THEY'RE CAMPING IN A PARK WHERE CAMPING ISN'T ALLOWED. THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAWS ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE. THAT'S NOT TEA PARTY BEHAVIOR. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: EVERYTHING YOU DESCRIBED THERE I BELIEVE IS A MISDEMEANOR. THE ACTUAL TEA PARTY WAS A  [BLEEPED] FELONY. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE... DID YOU KNOW WHAT THE TEA PARTY ACTUALLY WAS? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'D GET IN IF YOU BROKE INTO A SHIP, STOLE THE CARGO FROM THE SHIP'S OWNERS AND JUST THREW IT OVERBOARD, NOT TO MENTION THE  E.P.A. FINES AND THE DAMAGE IT WOULD DO TO YOUR INDIAN COSTUME? [LAUGHTER] THE TEA PARTY NAMESAKE, YOU'RE NAMED AFTER THE MOST CELEBRATED ACT OF THEFT AND VANDALISM OF  PRIVATE PROPERTY IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY AND YOU CAN'T STOMACH A LITTLE PARK CAMPING? [LAUGHTER] BUT IF THERE IS ONE CRITICISM THAT NEARLY EVERYONE, EVEN THEIR SUPPORTERS SEEMED TO SHARE, IT  WAS THIS:
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MESSAGE, THOUGH, WHAT IS IT THESE PROTESTERS ARE TRYING THE GET ACROSS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T  NECESSARILY SEEM A VERY COHESIVE ONE.
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE TO CRYSTALLIZE THEIR MESSAGE.
THE MESSAGE IS MUDDLED.
DID YOU JUST CALL THE PROTESTERS MUDDLED? [LAUGHTER] BUT I WATCH A LOT OF MOVIES. THIS GUY BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT. WE CANNOT EXPECT A BUNCH OF DISENFRANCHISED PARK DWELLERS TO COME UP WITH A COHERENT SOLUTION  TO OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC WOES. WE HAVE A POLITICAL RULING CLASS TO DO THAT.
CONGRESS DEMANDING ANSWERS ON WHAT CAUSED THE ECONOMIC MELTDOWN.
A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS KNOWN AS THE "GANG OF  SIX" IS WORKING ON A PROPOSAL TO CUT THE DEFICIT.
THE CONGRESSIONAL SUPER COMMITTEE CREATED TO CUT THE DEFICIT.
THE SIMPSON BOWLES PLAN,
SENATOR COBURN'S PLAN.
DOESN'T THIS SOUND LIKE A GREAT IDEA.
THE BOWLES SIMPSON DEAD ON ARRIVAL.
THE TEN OF YOU SPENT MONTHS WORKING ON, THIS AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS SIGNIFICANT DISSENT.
I THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP THESE BANKS.
BREAK UP EVERY INSTITUTION RIGHT NOW COULD HAVE BEEN DESTABILIZING.
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR OWN BUDGET TOGETHER. YOU'RE SITTING TO BE SIDELINES BLAMING OTHERS. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER, HOWARD... [BOTH SPEAKING OVER ONE ANOTHER]
GENTLEMEN.
Jon: I THINK I GOT IT. I THINK I GOT IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR GOD'S SAKES, PEOPLE, NOW I SEE WHY YOU'RE MAD AT THEM FOR  BEING MUDDLED AND INCOHAIRNTS. THAT'S YOUR [BLEEPED] JOB. ALTHOUGH WE DID PASS DODD-FRANK.
IN JUST OVER TWO WEEKS THE DODD-FRANK LAW WILL BE A YEAR  OLD, AND WE'RE NOT REALLY ANY CLOSER TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING IT.
THE STUFF THAT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THE FRAUD, TOO BIG TO FAIL, DERIVATIVES, FROM ALMOST  ALL OF THOSE MEASURES WERE EITHER REJECTED OUTRIGHT OR WATERED DOWN TO NEAR MEANINGLESS.
AN ESTIMATED 400 REGULATIONS TO BE WRITTEN, JUST 38 ARE COMPLETE.
Jon: AND THOSE 38 WERE THE EASY ONES -- NO SPITTING, DON'T  TAKE YOUR [BLEEPED] OUT BEFORE 5:00. YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO FIX OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAD ACTUALLY  DONE IT, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS WOULDN'T BE GETTING [BLEEPED] FOR NOT OFFERING SOLUTIONS. WHILE WE ALL FIGHT, THE REAL VICTIMS, AS ALWAYS, CONTINUE TO SUFFER.
I WAS IN BOSTON THIS WEEKEND, AND THEY HAD "OCCUPY BOSTON." THERE WERE 1,000 PEOPLE.
YOU WERE PROTESTING?
I WAS JUST DRIVING BY. I WAS TRYING TO GET TO SUPPER, AND 1,000 PEOPLE WERE BETWEEN ME AND A STEAK DINNER.
Jon: STEVE DOOCY REACTING TO THE REVOLUTION. LET ME
