Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE... YES. BACK IN MY BODY, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. (LAUGHTER) TEXAS IS A REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD BUT ARE THE RIGHT KIND OF REPUBLICANS REALLY IN POWER THERE? JOHN OLIVER HEADED TO THE LOAN-STAR STATE TO FIND OUT.
REPUBLICANS IN TEXAS ARE A PRETTY COMMON SITE BUT JEWISH REPUBLICANS LIKE JOE STRAUSS ARE  ABOUT AS RARE AS A PORK RIB ON A PRAIRIE MULE. TWO YEARS AGO, STRAUSS BECAME THE FIRST JEWISH SPEAKER OF THE STATEHOUSE, BUT THAT MEANT  TROUBLE WHEN HE CAME UP FOR REELECTION? JANUARY.
REPUBLICAN GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SURFACED CALLING FOR  STRAUSS TO BE REMOVED IN FAVOR OF A "MORE CHRISTIAN" SPEAKER.
AND THE CHARGE WAS LED BY STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIAL JOHN COOK WHO WROTE IN AN E-MAIL  "WE ELECTED A HOUSE WITH CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE VALUES. WE NOW WANT A TRUE CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE RUNNING IT." COULD IT POSSIBLY BE THAT A JEW  WOULD BE DRIVEN OUT OF YET ANOTHER DESERT LAND? I MADE A PILGRIMAGE TO HEAR ONE MORE TALE OF THIS FORSAKEN PEOPLE.
PEOPLE CLAIMING THAT SOMEONE COULDN'T DO A JOB BECAUSE THEY  WEREN'T CHRISTIAN IN PUBLIC SERVICE IS VERY DISTURBING AND SCARY.
BUT RABBI, DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE LAWS OF TEXAS COULD ONLY REALLY PROBABLY BE  SHEPHERDED BY A CHRISTIAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE?
NO.
WELL... SORRY, I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU TO STAY NO TO THAT AT ALL.
MANY TIMES PEOPLE USE THE WORD "CHRISTIAN" AS A SYNONYM FOR GOOD.
CHRISTIAN DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN GOOD, IT JUST MEANS BETTER. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY, THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW CHRISTIANS WHO ARE DEFINITELY  NOT BETTER THAN JEWS.
NAME THREE.
NAME THREE CHRISTIANS THAT ARE NOT GOOD?
THAT ARE NOT BETTER THAN JEWS.
HITLER. MOUSSE LEENY, STALIN.
OKAY, NAME FOUR.
TED KACZYNSKI.
DO YOU NOT THINK IT'S A LITTLE OFFENSIVE, RABBI, WHENEVER YOU THINK OF CHRISTIANS YOU JUST THINK OF SERIAL KILLERS? (LAUGHTER)
BUT WAS THIS REALLY A CASE OF ANTI-SEMITISM OR WAS IT, AS HAS  BEEN THE CASE THROUGHOUT JEWISH HISTORY, A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING. I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OUST STRAUSS MOVEMENT, DAVID WELCH OF THE TEXAS PASS STORE COUNCIL.
JOE STRAUS'S FAITH WAS NEVER A PART OF THIS ISSUE AND ISN'T AT THIS MOMENT.
SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIM BEING JEWISH?
NOT AT ALL. WE CALLED OUT AND RAISED UP THE CALL THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO ACCEPT JOE STRAUS AS THE  ANOINTED ONE.
ALL WELCH CARES ABOUT IS THE PEOPLE VOTE THEIR FAITH-- WHATEVER THAT FAITH IS. SO, IN 90% CHRISTIAN TEXAS, JEWS WOULD GET A FAIR 10% OF THE VOTE.
THE PRINCIPLES, WE BELIEVE, ARE GOOD FOR ALL OR WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE A  RELIGIOUS LITMUS TEST FOR THE ELECTED OFFICIAL.
CAN WE AT LEAST AGREE WE DON'T WANT A MUSLIM SPEAKER?
I WOULD SAY RIGHT NOW YES. (LAUGHTER) FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. IT GIVES ME DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE LOYALTIES OF MUSLIMS TO THE CONSTITUTION.
RIGHT, SO YOU SAY TO YOUR CONGREGATION YOU CAN VOTE FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT REGARDLESS OF  THEIR DENOMINATION APART FROM A MUSLIM?
YES.
AND, LO, THEY DID CONTRADICT THEMSELVES. AND SO IT WAS ON THE 23rd DAY OF THE MONTH OF ADD DA, THE ELECTION WOULD COME TO PASS. WHILE THIS RACE CLEARLY WASN'T ABOUT RELIGION, IT COULDN'T HURT  TO HOLD A PRAYER VIGIL ON THE STATEHOUSE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE VOTE.
FATHER, WE PLEAD WITH YOU THAT YOU WOULD GIVE US A GODLY HUMBLE LEADER OF THE TEXAS HOUSE
AND YET AGAIN THE HEBREWS WERE VANQUISHED.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOE STRAUS WON REELECTION AFTER A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE.
WAIT, WHAT? HE WHAT? RABBI, HAS OF THE. (LAUGHTER)
THANKS, I REALLY DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR CONGRATULATIONS.
'TWAS A MIRACLE. IT LOOKED LIKE YOU ONLY HAD ENOUGH VOTES TO CARRY ONE DISTRICT AND INSTEAD HE CARRIED EIGHT. (APPLAUSE)
BUT IT WASN'T THAT KIND OF...
AND THAT DAY IN TEXAS FOREVER CAME TO BE KNOWN AS YOM HA HA HA.
NO.
THE JEWISH FESTIVAL OF YOM HA HA HA.
THERE'S NO YOM HA HA HA.
SO IT WAS A SMALL BAND OF CONSERVATIVE JEWS TRIUMPHED OVER A LARGER EQUALLY CONSERVATIVE  BAND OF CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS AND THAT IS WHY THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS HAVE NOW EMBRACE THIS NEW  HIGH HOLIDAY. A DAY OF CELEBRATION. SOLEMNITY. AND SONG. ♪ MANY ANTI-SEMITES WERE OUT TO GET HIM BUT THE MAN NO ONE THOUGHT WOULD LAST  ♪ GOT A SECOND CHANCE, GET A SECOND CHANCE ♪ YEE HA HAPPY YOM HA HA HA ♪  (CHEERS AND APPLAUS
