( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK! , YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT'S MONEYY WOES, BUT EVEN HARDER HIT ARE OUR NATION'S  STATES, FACING RECORD BUDGET SHORTFALLS. HOW WILL MAIN STREET, U.S.A., BE AFFECTED BY THESE ENORMOUS STATE DEFICITS? HEY, HEY, MR.JENKINS. OH, I LOVE YOU. I'LL BE COMING BY LATER TO PICK UP COLD MEDICINE. OF COURSE, NICE STREETS ARE EXPENSIVE. WITH THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT IS, MANY TOWNS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT BACK.
CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, IT'S UNDER SIEGE. TOMORROW, THEY EXPECT MAJOR LAYOFFS.
A QUARTER OF THE CITY EMPLOYEES ARE GONE. HALF OF THE POLICE GONE. AND A THIRD OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GETTING PINK SLIPS.
Jon:  IN CAMDEN? ( LAUGHTER ) FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA, CAMDEN  IS WHERE PEOPLE FROM NEWARK GO. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN THEY WANT TO FEEL GREAT ABOUT NEWARK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE CUTTING THE POLICE AND THE FIRE FORCE IN CAMDEN? LOOK, I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CAMDEN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT MY  BEST GUESS IS, YOU'RE BETTER OFF GOING A SURGE. ALL RIGHT, SOME TOUGH CUTS, BUT IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP ANY TOWN UP AND RUNNING, OKAY. AS LONG AS THERE AREN'T GOING TO BE ANY OTHER.
IN ARIZONA TODAY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED CANCELLING HEALTH INSURANCE FOR 280,000 OF THE  STATE'S POOR. ONE SUGGESTION IN TEXAS-- ELIMINATE THE SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.
MIR BEGAN OWES $3.7 BILLION.
DETROIT MAY HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. CAN YOU IMAGINE? HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, CLASSROOM SIZE, THAT MEANS, WILL GO FROM 32 STUDENT FOR ONE TEACHER TO 62. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  YES, IT WILL DOUBLE. FROM 32 TO 62. AND THEN HOW WILL THE CHILDREN LEARN MATH? ( LAUGHTER ) SO NOW THAT ALL THESE CUTS AND CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE, WHY  DON'T WE CHECK BACK IN ON GOOD OLD ANY TOWN U.S.A., AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. THAT'S NOT GOOD. THAT'S-- WELL, AT LEAST THE HOSPITAL HAS A BOUNCER NOW. THAT'S GOING TO HELP. OH, BOY. ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE WE GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE?
GUARDIAN ANGELS WILL PATROL SOME NEW JERSEY CITIES FORCED TO LAY OFF POLICE. ( LAUGHTER ) DISPL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO REPLACE COPS WITH VIGILANTE  CRIME FIGHTERS YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH A PLAYBOY. THESE GUYS, VERY WELL INTENTIONED, BUT SATIN JACKETS? NOT GOING TO CUT IT IN CAMDEN. NO MATTER HOW MANY SERVICES WE CUT, THOUGH, ANY TOWN IS LOSING MONEY. ISN'T THERE SOME WAY TO BRING REVENUE IN?
STATE AFTER STATE IS TURNING TO SLOTS AS AN EASY WAY TO RAISE  REVENUE AND INCREASE JOBS AND NO STATE HAS BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN LURING GAMING IN THE LAST FEW  YEARS THAN PENNSYLVANIA.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GAMBLING SINCE ORGANIZED SOCIETY WAS FORMED ON THE BANKS OF THE  TIGRESS AND EUPHRATES. THEY WERE GAMBLING. AND THEY'LL GAMBLE AS LONG AS THERE'S LIFE ON THIS PLANET, AND THAT'S A FACT.
Jon:  THAT'S GOVERNOR RENDELL OF PENNSYLVANIA GETTING IN ON THE GAMBLING GRAVY TRAIN. IT'S THE SAME THING ABOUT MURDER. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO DO IT, SO WHY DON'T WE JUST BUILD A THUNDERDOME? ( LAUGHTER ) WE COULD TAX THE CONCESSION STANDS AND MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY. OF COURSE, PENNSYLVANIA ISN'T REALLY GOING TO BUILD AN ARENA WHERE MEN PUMMEL EACH OTHER  UNTIL ONE BEGS FOR MERCY JUST TO CLOSE THEIR BUDGET GAP. THAT IS WHAT NEW YORK IS DOING.
NEW YORK IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES, SIX IN TOTALLAL, THAT HAS BANNED FIGHTING BUT THE  CHAMPIONSHIP IS GETTING READY TO SPAR WITH THE NEW YORK GOVERNOR AND STATE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW  THE CONTROVERSIAL SPORT IN THE STATE. IT WILL CREATE MORE THAN 200 JOBS.
Jon:  MORE THAN 200 JOBS-- ALTHOUGH THOSE JOBS ARE IN THE SPONGING UP BODILY FLUID  SECTOR WHICH HAS YET TO RECOVER SOME MAYOR GIULIANI'S TIMES SQUARE SEX CLEANUP. NOT ALL OF YOU LIVED IN THE CITY BACK THEN, BUT IT WAS MOIST. I HESITATE TO CHECK BACK IN WITH OUR ANYTOWN. IT'S THE-- OH, BOY, THAT'S NOT-- OH, LOOK! IT'S A DOG CARRYING A HUMAN HEAD. OF COURSE, NOT EVERY STATE HAS A GREAT COMMONSENSE SOLUTION. SOME OF THED WHYS TO CLOSE THE BUDGET DEFICIT ARE A LITTLE OIT OUTTHERE. I WARN YOU WHEN YOU HEAR THIS ONE IT WILL MAKE YOU ANGRY.
ILLINOIS JUST RAISED ITS INCOME TAX BY TWO-THIRD.
TO CLOSE A DEFICIT OF $15 BILLION, PERSONNEL INCOME TAXES HERE ARE RISING FROM THE CURRENT  3% TO 5%.
REALLY, REALLY? IS THAT REALLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE STATE BUDGET?
Jon:  WHICH WE COULD JUST GET PEOPLE TO BARE-KNUCKLE FIGHT EACH OTHER IN A RING? WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE THINGS WE WANT DONE FOR US? WHEN WE COULD LIVE... YEAH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
