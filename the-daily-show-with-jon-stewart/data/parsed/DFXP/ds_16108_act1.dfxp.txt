WE GOT A GREAT GUEST TONIGHT, OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MATT LONG, NEW YORK CITY FIREFIGHTER WHO HAS COMPETED IN TRIATHLONS. OH, I GUESS THAT DOESN'T SOUND THAT IMPRESSIVE UNTIL YOU REALIZE HE'S DONE IT AFTER BEING  HIT BY A BUS. (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) HE HAS A BOOK ABOUT IT. VERY EXCITING. IT'S BEEN A LONG SUMMER SO TONIGHT A LITTLE CHANGE OF PACE. WE'RE GOING TO COVER POLITICS. (LAUGHTER) IN THE WAKE OF HER SATURDAY ALL OR NOT IMPORTANT LESS THAN 200  VOTE VICTORY OVER CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL IN THE AMES, IOWA, STRAW POLL, MICHELE BACHMANN'S STAR SHONE BRIGHTLY WITH THE APPEARANCES ON THE FIVE SUNDAY  TALK SHOW. THIS WEEK, "FACE THE NATION," "MEET THE PRESS," "THE FOX NEWS  SUNDAY" "STATE OF THE UNION" SHE WENT ON ESPN SUNDAY NIGHT  BASEBALL, "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY" AND INTO THE NIGHT  BY ATTEMPTING TO BUST PHINEAS AND FERB. SHE WAS EVERYWHERE! CLEARLY THE MEDIA IS SMITTEN. BACHMANN FEVER, WE CAN SET UNTIL FOR A LENGTHY MEDIA OVERFEEDING AT THE TROUGH OF BACHMANN.
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY OFF AND RUNNING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
THE TEXAS GOVERNOR COMES OUT PUNCHING AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.
THE TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY HAS HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.
RICK PERRY COMING OUT FIRING ALL GUNS.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT MINNESOTA CONGRESSMAN  MICHELE BACHMANN THINKS ABOUT RICK PERRY! HE'S NEW NEW! WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM BEFORE. THE MEDIA REALLY IS THE DOG IN "UP." BALL! (LAUGHTER) SQUIRREL! SQUIRREL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN SEVEN HOURS, I'M TIRED OF MICHELE BACHMANN. SQUIRREL! (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, AS THE MEDIA SAID, RICK PERRY HAS HIT THE GROUND RUNNING  AND WAS FIRING ALL GUNS OR, TO PUT THAT SLIGHTLY MORE FACTUALLY CAMPAIGNING AROUND IOWA IN A BUS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN DOWNGRADING AMERICAN JOBS, HE'S  BEEN DOWNGRADING OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT JOBS, BUT I THINK THE ONLY JOB HE CARES ABOUT IS THE ONE HE'S GOT. I THINK YOU WANT A PRESIDENT THAT IS PASSIONATE ABOUT AMERICA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S IN LOVE WITH AMERICA.
Jon: YOU WANT A PRESIDENT THAT'S IN LOVE WITH AMERICA. YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD IN A RAINSTORM GRAB AMERICA'S HAND AND... (LAUGHTER) ... TAKE SHELTER WITH AMERICA IN A NEARBY BARN, MAYBE HELP  AMERICA OUT OF ITS WET CLOTHES, MAYBE LAY AMERICA DOWN ON SOME HAY BAILS AND THEN AS AMERICA AND RICK PERRY BECOME ONE, THE  SOUNDS OF THEIR LOVE MAKING MERGING WITH THE THUNDERSTORMS A CALFNY, THE BARN SHUTTERS  RATTLING, THE LIVESTOCK THEY WANT TO LOOK AWAY BUT THEY CAN'T. THEIR EYES ARE TRANSFIXED. I AM RICK PERRY AND UNLIKE BARACK OBAMA, I WILL (BLEEP) THE (BLEEP) OUT OF AMERICA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, AMERICA! OOH! OH, LORD, AMERICA! OH! AMERICA, YOU GOT A PRETTY MOUTH! I LOVE YOUR MOUTH, AMERICA! (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS AWKWARD. ANYWAY, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? RIGHT, RIGHT. GOVERNOR, IT'S DAY TWO AND YOU'RE ALREADY COWBOY BOOT DEEP IN HAY HITTING ON AMERICA. IT'S LONG CAMPAIGN, MAN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DIAL BACKBACK THE TEXAS A NOTCH. YOU'RE ALREADY AT YOSEMITE SAM LEVEL. (LAUGHTER) YOU'VE GOT TO DIAL IT BACK TO "WALKER, TEXAS RANGER" TERRITORY  OF COURSE, WHILEst REPUBLICANS JOUST FOR POSITION, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  HAS THE PRIVILEGE AND BENEFIT OF STAYING ABOVE THE FRAY. MONTHS AWAY FROM HAVING TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY WITH SWING STATE BUS TRAVEL.
Reporter: PRESIDENT OBAMA GOES TO MINNESOTA TODAY, STARTING A THREE DAY, THREE STATE BUS TOUR.
Jon: OH FOR (BLEEP)'S SAKE. (LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY? OBAMA'S BACK IN CAMPAIGN MODE ALREADY?
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS INSIST THIS IS AN OFFICIAL EVENT, NOT A CAMPAIGN EVENT.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION INSISTS THIS IS NOT A CAMPAIGN TRIP.
Jon: RIGHT. NO, IT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN TRIP. I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT JUST HAD SOME FREQUENT GREYHOUND MILES HE HAD TO BURN. (LAUGHTER) BY THE END OF AUGUST OR HE LOSES THEM. PLUS I HEAR THAT NATURALLY OCCURRING SWING STATE RED, WHITE AND BLUE BUNTING FIELDS ARE IN  FULL BLOOM. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THE WHITE HOUSE INSIST THIS IS TRIP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION.
IT'S A CHANCE FOR BARACK OBAMA TO TALK ABOUT JOBS. NOT LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE OUT THERE IN MIDDLE AMERICA PANDERING.
WHY CANNON FALLS?
WHY CANNON FALLS? (APPLAUSE) WELL, I HAD HEARD THAT CANNON FALLS HAS SOME OF THE SMARTEST, BEST LOOKING KIDS AROUND. AND YOU HAVE CONFIRMED THE RUMOR ABOUT THE OUTSTANDING CHILDREN OF CANNON FALLS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: NOT LIKE NEARBY ARLEN'S CORNERS. I MEAN, I HEARD THEIR KIDS ARE UGLY AS A BAG OF WALRUS US (BLEEP), AM I RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) WALRUS (BLEEP). ANYBODY BEEN TO ARLEN CORNERS? I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, I'D SHOW YOU THEIR KIDS AND A BAG OF WALRUS  (BLEEP) AND YOU'D NEVER BEEN B ABLE TO TELL THEM APART. WHERE ARE WE HEADING NEXT, BOB? OH, HAAR LEN'S CORNERS? ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD. ALL RIGHT, FINE, IT'S A CAMPAIGN TRIP AND MAYBE A CHANCE FOR BARACK OBAMA TO WORK OUT NEW  MATERIAL ON THE ROAD.
PART OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, HEALTH CARE REFORM, ALSO KNOWN AS OBAMACARE. BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME TELL YOU, EVERY NO PROBLEM WITH FOLKS SAYING OBAMA CARES. I DO CARE. (APPLAUSE) IF THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO BE THE FOLKS WHO DON'T CARE, THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
Jon: THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. WHAT THEY'RE... OH! A LITTLE SWITCHEROO! OH, REALLY, YOU SAY OBAMACARE HAS NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS, I FIND OBAMACARE QUITE COMPLEMENTARY. I'M GLAD YOU USED THAT PHRASE. AND THANK YOU FOR USING THIS POSTER AT YOUR RALLY. I'M A BIG FAN OF CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S. (LAUGHTER) I AM RUBBER, YOU ARE GLUE, WHATEVER YOU SAY BOUNCES OFF ME AND STICKS TO YOU. AS A PRESIDENT, THE LAST TIME HE RAN WITH AUDACITY OF HOPE, CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN, I'M NOT SURE IT WILL FLY. WHAT'S THIS CAMPAIGN'S "YES, WE CAN"?
WE HAVE A POLITICAL CULTURE THAT DOESN'T SEEM WILLING TO  MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES TO MOVE AMERICA FORWARD. WHAT'S BROKEN IS OUR POLITICS. SOME IN CONGRESS WOULD RATHER SEE OPPONENTS LOSE THAN AMERICA WIN. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES. I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED AND I'M FRUSTRATED, TOO.
Jon: SO I GUESS THIS TIME AROUND THE MESSAGE IS "I THOUGHT  WE COULD BUT IT TURNS OUT THE OTHER GUYS ARE ASS (BLEEP)S." (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
