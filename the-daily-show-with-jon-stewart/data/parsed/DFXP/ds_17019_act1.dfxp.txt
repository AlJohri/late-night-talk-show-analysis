CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK S THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO DALE DAY MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. DEMOCRATIC MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI WILL BE JOINING US TO EXPLAIN HOW A BILL BECOMES A BILL. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. HERMAN CAIN WAS ON TV. I LOVE THAT GUY.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE HERMAN CAIN GET THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. WHILE A BUSINESSMAN BY THE NAME HERMAN CAIN STEPPED FORWARD. HERE I AM. THAT'S THE PERSON HERMAN CAIN IS. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT HERMAN CAIN IS THAT THE PERSON PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT HERMAN CAIN TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Jon: WOW, NOW HERMAN CAIN IS ACTING LIKE HE NEVER MET HERMAN CAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO TALKS IN THE THIRD PERSON. MAYBE HERMAN CAIN IS THE HULK. HERMAN CAIN SAD. EITHER WAY JON STEWART ISN'T PROUD. [ LAUGHTER ] TUESDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE SHOWS THAT SINCE WE HEARD ABOUTg6m| CAIN'S  OLD EMPLOYER THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SETTLING TWO CLAIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT  AGAINST HIM MORE THAN A WEEK AGO, WE SWIFTLY MOVED TO STAGE FOUR OF A POLITICAL SEX SCANDAL. STAGE ONE WAS LAST MONDAY. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALK BSMG STAGE TWO WAS THAT SAME NIGHT. OH, RIGHT, THAT THING. AND STAGE THREE WAS THE REST OF THE WEEK -- I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO STAGE FOUR THE PRESS CONFERENCE TO ASSUAGE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY HOW  BADLY HE HANDLED STEPS 1-3. HE KICKED THINGS OFF AT A LOCAL WHOLESALE FLAG WAREHOUSE WITH A DEFINITIVE DENIAL.
I HAVE NEVER ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY WITH ANYONE PERIOD. [ LAUGHTER ] >>
Jon: UNLESS YOU THINK OFFERING A JOB IN EXCHANGE FOR A ROADSIDE HUMMER IS IN  APPROPRIATE QUESTION MARK. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS SEMI COLON, CLOSED PARETHESES. THE DENY IS WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG. HE HAS ONE IMPORTANT PERSON IN HIS CORNER.
I HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 43 YEARS TO MY GLORA. MY WIFE SAID AND THIS WAS Aq DIRECT QUOTE, I HAVE KNOWN YOU FOR 46 YEARS. THAT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE ANYTHING WOULD YOU DO TO ANYONE.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF MARRIAGE WOULD YOU HAVE IF WHEN YOU GET ACCUSED OF PUTTING YOUR HANDS UP  OTHER WOMEN'S SKIRTS YOU ARE WIFE GOES, THAT IS SO YOU. THAT IS SO YOU, HERMAN. THAT IS SO YOU. SHE'S YOUR WIFE! OF COURSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU DO THAT (bleep). I BET YOUR WIFE DOESN'T KNOW YOURER IN BET IS WROWZER HAS A CLEAR HISTORY BUTTON ON IT. IT'S YOUR WIFE, HERMAN. YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO A LIE DETECTOR TEST TO PROVE YOUR  HONESTY IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
YES. GO AHEAD. YES, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD.
Jon: NOW YOU ARE COOKING WITH GAS HERMAN CAIN. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T IMMEDIATELY UNDERCUT THE POWER AFTER THIS STATEMENT.
I WOULD BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT UNLESS I HAVE A GOOD REASON TO DO THAT.
Jon: A GOOD --  [  APPLAUSE  ] [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME THINK OF A GOOD REASON. OH, OH, I GOT ONE! YOU ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF FIVE FLAGS BEING ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THREATENING TOSINK YOU CAMPAIGN. THAT'S A PRETTY REASON. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK MY FAVORITE PART OF PRESS CONFERENCE WAS THIS NEXT NUGGET. THE FACT IS:  THESE ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE AND NOW THE DEMOCRAT MACHINE IN AMERICA  HAS BROUGHT FORTH A TROUBLED WOMAN TO MAKE FALSE ACCUSATIONS.
Jon: AAHH, THE DEMOCRAT MACHINE. I BELIEVE I'VE SEEN ONE OF THOSE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE DEMOCRAT MACHINE -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT  COSTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I RUNS ON SOLAR ENERGY AND IT TURNS HOPE INTO DISAPPOINTMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH (bleep) DEAL WITH IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY THAT SOUND LIKE THAT JOKE PHYSICALLY HURT THEM. HOPING DO DISAPPOINT ME. OH, MY BALDEROS. [ LAUGHTER ] MR. CAIN, NOTHING PERSONAL BUT I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE  TRYING1/L TO SABOTAGE YOUR CAMPAIGN BECAUSE A WE ALL KNOW DEMOCRATS  DON'T THINK SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DISQUALIFIES YOU FROM HOLDING THE PRESIDENCY. [ LAUGHTER ] (bleep) DEAL WITH IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, B, THEY'VE SEEN YOU DEBATE.
GENTLEMEN, BEFORE WE LEAVE THE MEDICARE DISCUSSION, DEFINED  BENEFIT PLAN OR PREMIUM SUPPORT?
A DEFINED -- YOU GO FIRST, NEWT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU KNOW, AH, YEAH, YOU KNOW, SO MANY SPECIFIC THOUGHTS ABOUT DEFINED BENEFIT V PREMIUM SUPPORT I NEED TO  ORGANIZE THEM IN A MATTER OF THIS VERY KNEWANCE, SMOKE BOMB! [ LAUGHTER ] HERMAN CAIN IF YOU WANT TO BLAME A POLITICAL PARTY FOR YOU HAVING TO ADDRESS THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT  CLAIMS BLAME THE REPUBLICANS. YOU ARE GETTING THIS LEVEL OFVOL SCRUTINY BECAUSE YOU ARE THE FRONT RUNNER AND YOU ARE ONLY  THE FRONT RUNNER BECAUSE YOU ARE UP AGAINST THE KEYSTONE CONSERVATIVES. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T LED SO FAR ARE THE SO CALLED REASONABLE ONE AND THE ONE WHOSE  NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH ASS
