MARCH 28, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  HEY, WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." WHAT A SHOW WE HAVE FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE ARB, TO SCUS O DISCUSS HIS NEW BOOK "PAKISTAN ON THE BRINK."  I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT-- ( LAUGHTER ) IS MY BEST FRIEND. COME OUT OUT HERE, JUST-- HELLO. THE CHEESEBURGER. SO SAVORY AND DELICIOUS. YES, YOU ARE. NEVER LET ME DOWN. A COMPANION ON COLD LONELY NIGHTS SINCE WE WERE KIDS TOGETHER, OR INDIVIDUALS LIKE IT. I JUST LOVE THEM SO MUCH. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN.
A WHISTLEBLOWER HAS COME FORWARD TO TELL CONSUMERS ABOUT THE GROUND BEEF A LOT OF US BUY  AT THE SUPERMARKET.
70% OF THE GROUND BEEF WE BUY AT THE SUPERMARKET CONTAINS  SOMETHING HE CALLS "PINK SLIME" BEEF TRIMMINGS THAT WERE ONCE USED ONLY IN DOG FOOD AND  COOKING OIL, NOW SPRAYED WITH AMMONIA TO MAKE THEM SAFE TO EAT.
THE FIRST LADY CAN FILL UP, UP TO 15% OF EVERY GROUND BEEF PATTY IN THE U.S ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  MOTHER ( BLEEP ). HOW COULD YOU! YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE ALL BEEF! FILLED WITH SOME PINK SLIME AMMONIA GOOP? THAT IS THE LAST THING I WANT MIXED UP IN MY MULCHED UP COW CORPSE. I'M SO MAD AT YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE ANY FOOD CAN BE DISGUSTING IF YOU TAKE ITS INGREDIENTS OUT OF CONTEXT. LIPS AND ANUSES SOUND GROSS IN OUR HOT DOGS, BUT WE LOVE THEM IN OUR PORN. ( LAUGHTER ) MY POINT IS THIS-- MAYBE-- MAYBE IT'S OKAY. LET'S GET THE WHOLE STORY.
HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE. THOSE WASTE TRIMMINGS ARE GATHERED, SIMMER AT LOW HEAT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SEPARATE FAT  FROM MUSCLE, PUT IN A CENTRIFUGE, AND SPUN TO FINISH THE SEPARATION.
Jon:  MMM! JUST LIKE MOM USED TO SEPARATE. WHAT'S THE REST OF THIS DELICIOUS SECRET RECIPE?
NEXT, THE MIXTURE IS SENT THROUGH PIPE WHERE'S IT'S  SPRAYED WITH AMMONIA GAS TO KILL BACTERIA. AND FINALLY COMPRESSED INTO BRICKS AND FLASH FROZEN FOR SHIPMENT TO MEAT PACKERS AND  GROCERY STORES, WHERE IT'S ADDED TO MOST GROUND BEEF. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THAT ANIMATION? THAT EXACTLY MIRRORS MY DIGESTIVE PROCESS. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT-- RIGHT DOWN TO THE PINK BRICKS. SURE-- SURE WISH I COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CUT THE CORNERS OUT OF THOSE. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE ) BY THE WAY, YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT WE'VE GOT AN ENTIRE SUPPLY  OF MEAT BRICKS, AND WE'RE USING THEM TO CUT THE PURITY OF OUR HAMBURGERS? HOW ARE WE NOT BUILDING MEAT HOUSES WITH THOSE? ACTUAL McMANSIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) WE COULD SOLVE OUR HUNGER AND HOMELESS PROBLEMS AT THE SAME TIME. SO HOW IS IT ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR FOODS HAS BEEN FILLED WITH AMMONIA-SPRITZED PINK SLIME  AND WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT? LET ME GUESS-- THE BEEF INDUSTRY DOESN'T CALL IT PINK SLIME.
THE OFFICIAL TERM IS "LEAN, FINELY TEXTED BEEF."
Jon:  OH! FINELY TEXTURED BEEF! WELL DONE, BEEF P.R. TEAM. MAKES IT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING RICH BEEF EATERS CAN BUY FROM HAMMACHER SCHLEMMER. IT'S THE CASHMERE OF BEEF. BOVINE VELVET, JOHNNIE WALKER PING, IF YOU WILL. NOW THE WORLD IS AWARE THAT LEAN FINELY TEXTED BEEF IS AMMONIA SOAKED CENTRIFUGED SEPARATED  BY-PRODUCT PASTE.
STORE AFTER STORE DROPPED IT, INCLUDING THE NATION'S LARGEST CHAINS, CROEGS.
TACO BELL PULLED THE PINK SLIME.
McDONALD'S ANNOUNCED IT'S NO LONGER USING THE CONTROVERSIAL BEEF.
Jon:  MCDONALD'S WALKED AWAY FROM IT? ( LAUGHTER ) MCDONALD'S DOESN'T THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THING TO EAT? SAID THE PEOPLE WHO MOLDED A PORK DISK INTO A RIB-SHAPED SANDWICH, THAT CONTAINS NO RIBS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOBODY KNOWS HOW THEY DID IT. BUT THIS STUFF, SPIRCHG SLIME, THAT'S TOO FAKE FOR McDONALD'S. ( LAUGHTER )
IN A CORPORATE STATEMENT, McDONALD'S SAID, "THE DECISION WAS NOT RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR EVENT."  ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  BULL ( BLEEP )! YOU GOT RID OF IT BECAUSE WE FOUND OUT IT WAS PINK SLIME. OH, IT WAS A COINCIDENCE, JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT DIET PILL FROM THE 80s, AND THEY CHANGED  IT-- EVERY PRODUCT HAS SOME FILLER. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S.D.A. ALLOWS ME TO MARKET THIS AS A COMEDY SHOW BUT ANY EFFORT WILL INCLUDE  15% OF FINELY TEXTED PRODUCT. GROUNDED UP JOKES, SWEAR WORDS. OH, WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE SMART PEOPLE, THOUGH. WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT. WHAT CAN WE DO? WHAT CAN WE DO? AH! I'VE GOT IT. PINK SLIME IS AALLOWED TO MAKE UP 15% OF OUR GROUND BEEF PRODUCT SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE  OUR BURGERS BE 100% BEEF BUT JUST 15% SMALLER. YEAH. I'M JUST SPITBALLING HERE, WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS ABOUT 7% OF MOST BURGERS. LET'S JUST CUT OUT THE PINK SLIME. A WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN.
THE MAKEERCE OF THE MEAT FILLER KNOWN AS PING SLIME HAS SUSPENDED OPERATIONS AT ALL BUT  ONE OF ITS PLANT.
200 PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AT THREE PLANT.
Jon:  WE'RE A PINK SLIME-BASED ECONOMY. ( LAUGHTER ). SO BY NOT PUTTING PINK SLIME IN MY KIDS' MOUTHS, I'M TAKING  SLIME OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF KIDS TRYING TO PUT SLIME ON THEIR FAMILY'S TABLE. GUILTY AND NAUSEOUS. WELL PLAYED, MEAT INDUSTRY, WELL EMPLOYEED.
JOOOON!
Jon:  THIS COULD BE A WHOLE NEW START FOR AMERICA. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO MACROBIOTIC, ORGANIC, LOCALLY RAISED GRASS FED CATTLE RAISED FROM FAMILY FARM, NOT FACTORIES, NO PINK SLIME.
JOOON, I KNOW YOU STILL WANT ME, PINK SLIME AND ALL.
Jon:  NO, I CAN'T GIVE IN TO YOUR MECHANICALLY SEPARATED MEAT PULP.
I'M FINELY TEXTED.
Jon:  YOU'RE A JERK AND A LIAR!
LOOK AT ME.
Jon:  I DESERVE FRESH, GRADE-A, AMMONIA FREE--
GODDAMN IT, JOHNNY, I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND! DON'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME! WE BELONG TOGETHER! ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT, BUDDY? YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD. I'M READY TO.-
AAHHHH! YEAH! ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  TOO MUCH.
FEELS RIGHT, DOESN'T IT, JON, HUH? ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR MOUTH TOO FULL TO RESPOND? I'LL GIVE YOU A SECOND. NOW USE YOUR SHOW TO TELL THE WORLD --
Stephen:  NO, I DON'T THINK I SHOULD DO THAT. NO! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL!
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, I WILL! PINK SLIME. FACE IT, IT'S REALLY NO WORSE THAN ( BLEEP ) YOU ALREADY EAT.
THAT'S MY GUY!
Jon:  THANK YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE )
