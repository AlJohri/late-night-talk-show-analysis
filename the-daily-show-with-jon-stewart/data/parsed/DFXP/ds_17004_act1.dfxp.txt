OCTOBER 6, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE HAVE A NICE SHOW TONIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY YOURSELF, OUR GUEST JASON SUDEIKIS HERE TO PRO  NOTE-- PROMOTE A NEW PROGRAM HE'S ON SATURDAY,-- ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", GOD  BLESS HIM. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS THOUGH IS GOING TO LAST, EVERYBODY KNOWS, SATURDAY NIGHT IS BRIDGE NIGHT. EVERYBODY THAT WATCHES THE PROGRAM WE RECENTLY SPENT TIME ANALYZING HOW SARAH  PALIN HAS BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY IN A CONSTITUTION WRAPPED BUS FREQUENTING  EARLY PRIMARY STATES AND TALKING ABOUT HER PLANS TO SAVE AMERICA WHICH SUGGESTED TWO VERY DISTINCT REQUESTEDS.
YOU ARE EITHER RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR YOU ARE A CRAZY PERSON. (LAUGHTER) WELL, LAST NIGHT SARAH PALIN WENT ON FOX NEWS, BRAVELY SUPPORTING-- THAT COULD HAVE  EASILY CAR KEYED HER AWAY IN -- TO PROVIDE THE ANSWER.
NO, I'M NOT RUNNING.
Jon: SO I'M READY TO CALL IT WITH 100% OF SARAH PALIN'S REPORTING TONIGHT. THE WINNER IS CRAZY PERSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CRAZY PERSON WAS THE OBVIOUS FRONT-RUNNER. ONLY THING NOW IS FOR SARAH PALIN TO MAKE HER CONCESSION SPEECH. BUT UNLIKE CERTAIN ATTENTION WHORES WHO WILL REMAIN THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, SARAH PALIN PLAYED IT IN HER TYPICAL LOW KEY FASHION. STATEMENT RELEASED FOR THE RADIO THEN A FEW HOURS LATER ON THE PEOPLE.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I MADE MY ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY IN THE FORMAT THAT I DID  BECAUSE THAT WAS HIS 7 1,000,000, NO AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT. I WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF PUT THE MARKER DOWN AND SAY NO, I'M NOT RUNG. NOT HAVE A BIG PRESS CONFERENCE, NOT MAKE A BIG DARN DEAL ABOUT IT, BECAUSE  THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. ALTHOUGH TRUTH BE TOLD YOU CAN'T SPELL AMERICA WITHOUT--  (LAUGHTER)  OR IF I MAY ASK YOU GOVERNOR PALIN, THAN WHAT WERE YOU DOING.
SARAH PALIN HAS STARTED THE NATIONWIDE BUS TOUR.
SHE CASHED MITT ROMNEY'S PARTY BRINGING HER BUS TOUR TO NEW HAMPSHIRE ON THE SAME  DAY THE FORMER MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR WAS THERE TO ANNOUNCE FOR PRESIDENT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKES HIS FIRST 2011 VISIT IN IOWA, AND AT THE SAME TIME SARAH PALIN MAKES AN APPEARANCE.
SARAH PALIN WASN'T IN THE BIG DEBATE AND SHE IS NOT ON SATURDAY'S IOWA EXTRAPOLL  BALLOT BUT ROLLED INTO THE STATE FAIR.
THE TOUR IS REALLY STEALING THE POLITICAL CENTER FROM SO OTHER PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES  WITHIN THE WORST PART ISN'T SHE IS LIKE A GUEST AT A WEDDING THAT SHOWS UP  WEARING A WEDDING DRESS BUT INSISTS, HEY, I AM NOT HERE SPOILING YOUR BIG DAY, I'M  JUST HERE TO HELP YOU GET YOUR MESSAGE OUT ABOUT FIDDLITY. (LAUGHTER) OH, AND IF YOU DON'T MIND, I HAVE SOME VOWS I WANT TO READ, IT WON'T TAKE A MINUTE. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT-- FOR THE MOST PART HER NARCISSISM IS VICTIMLESS  CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THIS.
TWO WEEKS AGO PALIN SUPPORTERS GOT A LETTER FROM SARAHPAC CURIOUSLY SPECIFIC  ABOUT ITS PURPOSE. AS YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR PALIN IS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING HER DECISION OF WHETHER OR  NOT TO RUN FOR OFFICE. SOMEONE MUST SAVE OUR NATION FROM THE ROAD TO EUROPEAN SOCIAL ILL, DO YOU THINK IT  SHOULD BE GOFF TER PALIN. IF SO, CAN YOU SEND YOUR BEST ONE TIME GIFT TO SARAHPAC AND SHOW HER WE SUPPORT HER IF SHE DECIDES  TO RUN. SO EVERYONE, LET ME TRANSLATE THAT, IF YOU WANT TINKER BELL TO LIVE, CLAP HARRER. (LAUGHTER) NOW SARAHPAC ISN'T JUST SOME GRASS ROOTS PALIN FAN CLUB THAT SPROUTED UP NATURALLY  OUT OF THE MANURE FIELDS OF WASILLA. IT'S SARAH PALIN'S PAC AND BY PAC I MEAN PACK OF MONEY. IT'S HER MONEY, SHE CONTROLS IT, SHE ALREADY USED PREVIOUS DONATIONS FOR HER  FAMILY VACATION NECESSITIES LIKE THE 14,000 DOLLAR CONSTITUTION BUS ART, $10,000 ON LOGISTICAL TRIP CONSULTING. $7,000 ON LODGING AND $3200 THAT WANT TO HER PARENTS, CHUCK AND SALLIE HEATH FOR PURPOSE OF DISBURSEMENT CORRESPONDENCE AND CARD MAILING. NOW YOU MAY SAY TO YOURSELF, WOW, THAT IS [BLEEP] CRAZY. BUT THOSE ARE THE RULES THAT ARE SET UP. THE ONLY WAY THAT THE LITTLE SCHEME WOULD BE DISHONORABLE OR SHADY IS IF PALIN HAD  KNOWN ALL ALONG WHAT HER DECISION WAS YET CONTINUED TO DANGLE HER INDECISION AS A LURE. TO UNSUSPECTING DONORS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROVE THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE CLOSE TO THE OPERATION BUT PERHAPS TOO NAIVE TO REALIZE SHE HAS  INADVERTENTLY SPILLED THE BEANS ON LET'S SAY JUNE 28th.
DO YOU GET THE SENSE THAT YOUR MOM HAS NOT MADE UP HER MIND OR DO YOU THINK SHE  KNOWS AND HASN'T TOLD US.
YOU KNOW, SHE DEFINITELY KNOWS. WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, BUT SOME THINGS JUST NEED TO STAY IN THE FAMILY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SEE, THAT KIND OF TAKES THE OUT OF THE SELF-LESS CATEGORY AND PUTS  IT IN THE NIGERIAN PRINCE TERRITORY. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW EVERY TIME GOD CLOSES A DOOR SHE OPENS A WINDOW. HERMAN CAIN BACKED BY SOARING POLL NUMBERS HAS LUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE APPEARING LATE NIGHT TO  SUNDAY MORNING TO WHATEVER THIS IS.
HI,S WITH AS YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET MITT ROMNEY AND PERRY TO COME AND  DO A VIDEO WITH ME AND SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T ACCEPTED. AND I WANTED TO GET A FIRST-TIER CANDIDATE SO WE HAD TO MAKE OUR-- OUR OWN, HERMAN CAIN. LA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU BETTER HURRY UP THE INTERVIEW BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT LA QUINTA SUITE IS  BOOKED FOR A PORN SHOOT AT ABOUT 2:00. (LAUGHTER)
THE SECRET TO CAIN'S SUCCESS, BRANDING AND CHARM.
THERE IS ICE MILK AND HAGEN DANZ BLACK WALNUT.
BLACK WALNUT ISN'T A FAVORITE OF THE WEEK.
YOU STILL SEE BLACK WALNUT MOVING UP THE CHARTS WITHIN I CAN EAT BLACK  WALNUT ALL THE TIME.
BLACK WALNUT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: VERY LIKABLE. DON'T YOU THINK BLACK WALL NRT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST 70 BLAXPLOITATION MOVIE EVER. RUDY RAY, BLACK WALNUT. THE BLACK PRIVATE DICKï¿½ï¿½ WHO'S SHELL IS REALLY THICK. GEORGE KENNEDY IS HIS ARCH NEMESIS HONKY PISTACHIO. AND PAM GREER IS THE HOTTEST WOMAN EVER IN THE WORLD. HERMAN CAIN ISN'T ALL ICE CREAM, HE'S GOT SUBSTANCE. HE HAS TAKEN ON THE WALL STREES PROTEST.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT BUT I THINK THEY THINK THAT THE BANKS HAVE GIVEN  THEM A RAW DEAL OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.
I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP.
Jon: LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. HERMAN CAIN, THAT IS ADORABLE. I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO BACK-- YOU STILL EXPECT THE MEDIA TO DEMAND YOU BACK  YOUR CLAIMS UP WITH FACTS? WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS A LITTLE LONGER YOU WILL REL REALIZE THEY [BLEEP]. THAT REPORTER IS NOT LISTENING TO YOU, HE IS JUST ADMIRING HIS PAYING ATTENTION FACE IN THE  MONITOR BEHIND YOU. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT NO FACTS.
I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP, BUT I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT THESE  DEMONSTRATIONS ARE PLANNED AND ORCHESTRATED TO DISTRACT FROM THE FAILED POLICIES OF  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
Jon: THAT'S ALL YOU GOT? HEY, MAN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE FACTS TO BACK IT UP, WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT MORE OUT  THERE I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP BUT I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS A SPY FROM AN  ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE DINOSAURS NEVER WENT EXTINCT AND PEOPLE ARE KEPT AS PETS, YOU KNOW. I WILL TELL YOU, GIVE US ANOTHER STUPID NONFACTUAL BLACK WALNUT PROTEST ANALYSIS.
DON'T BLAME WALL STREET. DON'T BLAME THE BIG BANKS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB AND YOU ARE NOT RICH, BLAME YOURSELF.
IT NOT A PERSON'S FAULT BECAUSE THEY SUCCEEDED. IT IS A PERSON'S FAULT IF THEY FAILED.
Jon: THAT IS INTERESTING, SO PEOPLE SHOULD NOT SCAPE GOAT ANYBODY JUST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T ATTAIN THE AMERICAN DREAM.
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIJACKED  BY THE LIBERALS IN WASHINGTON D.C..
Jon: WAIT, I SAW YOU BLAME YOURSELF. OH, SO IT'S NOT, YOU DON'T BLAME-- YOU DON'T BLAME BIG BUSINESS. YOU BLAME YOURSELF AND LIBERALS.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP-- BUT THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A PLOT  TO BRING DOWN PIZZA CHAINS. AND ACTIVIA YOGURT IS FILLED WITH TINY GHOSTS WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO SCARE THE POOP OUT OF YOU. (LAUGHTER) AND BESIDES, AND BESIDES, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON CORPORATE CORE RUPING HAS EXPIRED. YOU DON'T THINK THE BANKS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE WENT INTO IN 2008.
THEY DID HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE WENT INTO IN 2008. BUT WE ARE NOT IN 2008. WE'RE IN 2011.
Jon: IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO. IF WE WERE BEES WE WOULD ALREADY BE DEAD AND OUR GREAT GRANDCHILDREN WOULD BE IN CHARGE. YOU THINK BEES WORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THREE GENERATIONS AGO. THEY ARE TOO BUSY MAKING HONEY AND COMMUNICATING THROUGH DANCE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP--  (LAUGHTER)  BUT JOHN BOEHNER CRIES A LOT BECAUSE HIS NOSE IS AN ONION. (LAUGHTER)
