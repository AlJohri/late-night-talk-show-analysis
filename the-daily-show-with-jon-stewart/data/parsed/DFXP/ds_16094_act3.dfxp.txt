Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE'S A WRITER. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE PRESIDENT AND THE AS ASSASSIN: McKINLEY EMPIRE AT THE DAWN OF  THE CENTURY." PLEASE WELCOME SCOTT MILLER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED. BIG McKINLEY FANS OUT THERE TONIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I GOT TO TELL YOU, I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER, BUT I GOT TO TELL  YOU, BEAUTIFULLY DONE. McKINLEY GETS NO LOVE. WHY DOES McKINLEY GET NO LOVE? YOU HAVE YOUR ASSASSINATED PRESIDENTS, YOUR LINCOLN, YOUR KENNEDY, GARFIELD GETS A LITTLE LOVE. McKINLEY, NO LOVE. THE LAST GUY IN THE TRIVIA QUESTION.
HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING FOLLOWED BY ONE OF OUR MOST BELOVED AND CHARISMATIC  PRESIDENTS, THEODORE ROSE VEL, AND McKINLEY, BECAUSE HE WAS ASSASSINATED, HE DIDN'T LEAVE A LOT OF WRITTEN RECORD. HIS WIFE WAS AN INHAVE A LID, SHE DIDN'T SURVIVE TO WRITE VERY MUCH. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS FIVE YEARS IN OFFICE FROM 1897 TO 1901, THEY WERE FILLED WITH GREAT DRAMA, GREAT EXCITEMENT. HE LED THE U.S. INTO WAR WITH SPAIN. HE TOOK OVER CUBA, PUERTO RICO AND...
Jon: CHINA.
SMALL THINGS LIKE THAT. GOT INTO NASTY WAR IN THE PHILIPPINES. IT WAS REALLY A DRAMATIC PERIOD IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: AND BATTLED TERROR AT HOME. THE FELLA WHOS AS -- WHO ASSASSINATED HIM DISCOVERED AN, AISM A FEW YEARS BEFORE. HE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT AMERICANS LABORED UNDER AT THIS TIME IN  THE LATTER PART OF 1900s. HE WAS LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION, AND AN, ARCHISM APPEALED TO HIM. HE WENT TO A SPEECH GIVEN BY EMMITT GOLDMAN IN 1901, MAY 1901, WHERE HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED. HE SAID THAT HER WORDS MADE HIS SKULL HURT HE WAS SO TAKEN BY WHAT SHE SAID.
Jon: ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, HIS SKULL PROBABLY HURT BEFOREHAND BECAUSE HE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A KNUCKLE HEAD.
HE WAS A BIT OF A LOANER.
Jon: I WAS STRUCK BY IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS, USUALLY EVEN IN THESE SITUATIONS, AN  ASSASSIN, THEY GO TO THE FAMILY. EVERYBODY WHO IS FAMILY IS LIKE, YEAH, WE NEVER LIKED THAT GUY. HIS STEP DAD AND SISTER ARE LIKE, YEAH, THAT GUY WAS NUTS. I KNEW SOMETHING BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE.
IT WAS VERY SAD WHEN THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS DESCENDED ON THE FAMILY. HIS STEPMOTHER IN PARTICULAR WAS LIKE, WE KNEW HE WAS NO GOOD.
Jon: YEAH.
THE ONLY THING THAT SURPRISED HIM WAS THAT HE HAD ENOUGH AMBITION AND ENERGY TO DO  SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
SHE SAID, THAT CAN'T BE HIM, HE'S KIND OF A COWARD.
EXACTLY.
Jon: IT WAS CRAZY. THE THEMES, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS TRY AND LOOK BACK. I ALWAYS LIKE TO IN MODERN TIMES WE GET THIS SENSE THAT WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF, YOU KNOW, UNPRECEDENTED DIFFICULTIES AND TENUOUS TIMES. PEOPLE BACK THEN COMPLAINED ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED, TENUOUS, DIFFICULT TIME, THE VIOLENCE, THE TERROR, HOW WE HAD LOST OUR MORAL COMPASS. HOW OFTEN DOES THAT... IT APPEARS TO HAVE REACHED A PEAK AT THAT TIME.
PEOPLE, ORDINARY AMERICANS WERE VERY AWARE AND VERY AFRAID OF ANARCHISTS IN THE 1890s. THERE HAD BEEN A STRING OF ATTACKS IN EUROPE AGAINST ROYAL HOUSEHOLD AND INDUSTRIALISTS. IN THE U.S., FOUR ANARCHISTS WERE HACKED BECAUSE OF THE MURDER OF A CHICAGO POLICEMEN. IT WAS A LOONY TOON BOMB, A ROUND THING WAS A FUSE THEY HAD THROWN IN, KILLED A POLICEMEN. A COUPLE YEARS LATER ANARCHISTS TRIED TO ASSASSINATE HENRY CLAY FRICK, A STEEL MAGNATE.
THE STORY OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO TRIED TO ASSASSINATE FRICK WHERE HE BASICALLY MAKES AN  APPOINTMENT WITH FRICK, BURSTS INTO HIS OFFICE, SHOOTS HIM TWICE IN THE NECK, STABS HIM, WRESTLES HIM...
UH-HUH.
Jon: GUY WALKS AWAY.
FRICK WAS ONE TOUGH GUY.
Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY.
YES. HE REFUSED ANAESTHESIA DURING THE OPERATION WHEN THEY REMOVED THE BULLETS FROM HIS NECK. ONCE THEY STITCHED HIM UP, HE WENT BACK TO HIS DESK AND COMPLETED A BANK LOAN AND WROTE  A LETTER TO HIS MOM AND LIVED FOR DECADES.
Jon: HERE'S THE CRAZY PART ABOUT THE LETTER, IT DIDN'T MENTION THE SHOOTING. BUT IT'S LIKE, THEY'RE PROBING HIS NECK, YEAH, THAT'S IT, THAT HURTS. UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S ALSO INTERESTING HOW THE SPEECH, YOU KNOW, ANARCHISTS COULD SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT  PRAISING KILLING. IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT TIME IN AMERICA. YOU IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS LESS FREEDOM OF SPEECH, BUT IN MANY WAYS IT WAS MORE. EMMITT GOLDMAN WHO HE SITES, HE BASICALLY SAID, "I KILLED McKINLEY BECAUSE EMMITT  GOLDMAN." THINK OF HOW WE ARE IN THIS SOCIETY, YET SHE STILL CONTINUED TO GIVE SPEECHES.
IT WAS A VERY FINE LINE THAT EMMITT GOLDMAN WALKED BETWEEN  DISAVOWING VIOLENCE AND THEN SHE ALSO OCCASIONALLY WOULD SHOW COMPASSION FOR ANARCHISTS WHO  HAD MURDERED SOMEBODY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. SHE WAS VERY FAMOUS AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR GIVING SPEECHES. SHE WAS OFTEN ARRESTED. SHE KEPT A BOOK WITH HER BECAUSE SHE SPENT SO MANY NIGHTS IN JAIL  SO SHE'D HAVE SOMETHING TO DO. POLICE WOULD TAKE HER OUT OF JAIL IN THE MORNING AND SEND HER ON TO THE NEXT TOWN. GET OUT OF OUR HAIR.
WERE THEY WORD SEARCHES? JUMBLES? JUST READING AND THAT SORT OF THING?
YEAH.
Jon: IS McKINLEY'S LEGACY, WOULD YOU SAY, THE FACT THAT HIS ECONOMY USHERED US INTO  THE INDUSTRIAL AGE OR THAT HIS WARRING USHERED US INTO THE IMPERIAL AGE? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
I WOULD THINK THAT THE LATTER. FOR THE FIRST TIME, UP UNTIL HIM, UP UNTIL McKINLEY, THE U.S. HAD BEEN VERY MUCH FOCUSED  ON SETTLING THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT. WHEN HE WAS KILLED, FOR THE FIRST TIME THE U.S. HAD POSSESSIONS OVERSEAS. WE HAD COLONIES. THE PHILIPPINES WAS A VIRTUAL COLONY. WE HAD DEVELOPED A POLICY WITH REGARD TO CHINA, THE OPEN-DOOR POLICY, WHICH REALLY GUIDED OUR  POLICY IN THE FAR EAST RIGHT UP UNTIL PEARL HARBOR. SO HE REALLY INTRODUCED AMERICA TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND PROVIDED COMMITMENTS FOR US.
Jon: THAT'S THE NICEST WAY I'VE EVER HEARD THAT PUT. HE INTRODUCED US TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND COMMITMENTS, COMMITMENTS WE STILL ENJOY TODAY. [LAUGHTER] "THE PRESIDENT AND THE ASSASSIN" ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. SCOTT MILLER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
