FACTS. A CANDIDATE TOO SUCCESSFUL FOR TAXES. A CITY FAMOUS FOR ITS... I WANNA SAY GOLF COURSES. FROM TAMPA, FLORIDA, THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION: THE ROAD TO JEB BUSH, 2016. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY! WHAT IS HAPPENING? WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. DAY TWO. IT IS DAY TWO FOR US HERE IN... BEAUTIFUL TAMPA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW INSECURE THESE PEOPLE ARE. (LAUGHTER) OUR GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MR. HERMAN CAIN WILL BE JOINING US! LAST NIGHT WAS A VERY COMPLICATED NIGHT FOR THE CABLE NETWORKS, BUT THEY DID MANAGE TO  SUCCESSFULLY MOUNT FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF NIGHT ONE OF THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WHILE  SAME-SEX COUPLELY AIRING COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF HURRICANE PORN FROM YOUR STANDARD GUY OUTSIDE IN THE  RAIN TO WOMEN IN RAIN BURKAS STANDING UNDER THE GUTTER OF DAMOCLES TO GUY ABOUT TO BE  SUCKED OUT TO THE SEA. (LAUGHTER) TO REPORTERS SO DRENCHED THEY TRANSFORM INTO WATER CREATURES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PEOPLE, I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH AT HOME: DON'T GO CHASING WATERFALLS. (LAUGHTER) MR. ANDERSON COOPER WAS THERE WHERE HE AND AN EQUALLY HANDSOME  ROB MARCIANO DID NOT APPARENTLY REALIZE THEY COULD JUST MOVE FROM THE SPOT WHERE WATER WAS  DRAINING OFF THE TOP OF THE TENT ON TOP OF THEM TO A DRIER PLACE UNDERNEATH SAID TENT! (LAUGHTER) IF YOU'VE GOT TO WATERBOARD ONE OF YOUR GUYS, CNN... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HUH? MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE'S REPUBLICAN OF TAMPA THE  REPUBLICANS FACED THE DIFFICULT CHALLENGE OF THEIR OWN. COULD THEY FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD MAKE AMERICA LOVE MITT ROMNEY?
I COULD TELL YOU WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM. HE WAS TALL, LAUGHED A LOT. HE WAS NERVOUS, GIRLS LIKED THAT, IT SHOWS THE GUY'S A LITTLE INTIMIDATED. HE WAS NICE TO MY PARENTS BUT HE WAS ALSO REALLY GLAD WHEN THEY WEREN'T AROUND. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, LISTEN, YOU SEEM KIND OF CHARMING SO I CAN GET WHY HE'S INTO YOU. BUT UNLESS THERE'S TIME IN THIS CAMPAIGN FOR MITT ROMNEY TO TAKE  US ALL TO A DANCE I DON'T THINK THE LOVE THING IS HAPPENING. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE US FALL IN LOVE WITH MITT ROMNEY, WHAT ABOUT HATE FOR THE OTHER GUY? R.N.C. CHAIR REINCE PRIEBUS.
BARACK OBAMA THINKS THE GOVERNMENT IS AT THE CENTER OF THE ECONOMIC UNIVERSE. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NEVER RUN A COMPANY! HE HASN'T EVEN RUN A GARAGE SALE OR SEEN THE INSIDE OF A LEM NATE STAND!
Jon: WOW. I GOTTA SAY, IF THE TONE YOU WERE GOING FOR THERE WAS ANGRY DRUNK GUY... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ... YOU NAILED IT. (AS ANGRY DRUNK GUY) AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT... I'LL TELL YOU  SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT BARACK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) HE'S AN ASS (BLEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THIS GUY'S NAME ISN'T REINCE PRIEBUS, IT'S RYAN PETERSON AND HE'S ALWAYS TOO (BLEEP)ED UP WHEN HE SAYS IT TO PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) (AS DRUNK GUY) WHAT'S MY NAME? MY NAME IS REINCE PRIEBUS. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, PRIEBUS WAS SOUNDING WHAT WAS THE MAIN MOTIF OF THE  EVENING: THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE (BLEEP)ED LIVES, TOO.
MY DAD AND MY UNCLES OWNED A BAR IN CINCINNATI. I WORKED THERE GROWING UP, MOPPING FLOORS, WAITING TABLES. IN COLLEGE I WORKED IN A HOSPITAL CAFETERIA.
MY PARENTS IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY WITH $10 IN THEIR POCKETS.
DAD GREW UP IN POVERTY.
FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS I BUILT A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
I BUILT BUSINESSES AND CREATED HUNDREDS OF JOBS.
Jon: I WAS BORN INSIDE A BLOATED DEAD RABBIT CARCASS! (LAUGHTER) AND I WAS RAISED BY MAGGOTS! (LAUGHTER) TODAY I OWN THREE WENDY'S FRANCHISES. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE... (LAUGHTER). AT HOME I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO SPEAK MAGGOT. IT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF THE NIGHT'S THEME: SELF-RELIANCE ENCAPSULATED BY A NEW REPUBLICAN  CALL TO ARMS. SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH IT.
HE THINKS THAT IF YOU STARTED A BUSINESS "YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT."  YOU DID BUILD THAT!
WE BUILT IT!
THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T BUILD IT, THEY BUILT IT!
THEY REALLY DID BUILD IT!
WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT!
MITT ROMNEY WAS NOT HANDED SUCCESS. HE BUILT IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). (LAUGHTER).
Jon: EMPHASIS WAS A LITTLE OFF THERE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HEARD A CATCH PHRASE THAT WAS SUCH A PECULIAR MIX OF BRAGGADOCIO AND  WHINEY PETULANCE.
WOW, WINNING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: YEAH, I THINK THAT WAS IT. WE BUILT THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN RETORT TO BARACK OBAMA'S COLLECTIVISM. AND IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST POLITICAL MANTRAS I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME THAT SOUND LIKE  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THE WORD "DUH" BEFOREHAND. DUH, WE BUILT IT! (LAUGHTER) ONLY ONE PROBLEM: THIS DEFINING THEME OF THE CAMPAIGN IS BASED ON A STATEMENT THAT THE  PRESIDENT MADE.
YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
Jon: BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO...
SOMEBODY HELPED TO CREATE THIS UNBELIEVABLE AMERICAN SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THAT ALLOWS  YOU TO THRIVE. SOMEBODY INVESTED IN ROADS AND BRIDGES. IF YOU GOT A BUSINESS, THAT... YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT.
Jon: SEE, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ROADS, BRIDGES, CONVENTION CENTERS, THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THAT GOVERNMENT HAS A HAND IN BUILDING THAT HELPS CREATE THE STABLE CONDITIONS THAT AID ENTREPRENEURSHIP. SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO BRING SOME NUANCE AND NOT OVERPLAY YOUR HAND ON THIS  "WE BUILT IT...".
PERFORMING "I BUILT IT," LANE TURNER! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! HOW DO YOU BUILD A SONG... (BLEEP) JUST PLAY IT. ♪ I BUILT IT WITH NO HELP FROM UNCLE SAM... ♪ (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: WOW. I OWE YOU WILL I. AM'S "YES, WE CAN" SONG A HUGE APOLOGY. WOW, T-SHIRTS, SONGS, I IMAGINE SOON "WE BUILT IT" WILL HAVE ITS  OWN BREAKFAST CEREAL... REALLY? ALREADY? (LAUGHTER) WE BUILT THAT, THE FREE MARKET CEREAL WHERE EVERY BOX COMES WITH A PRIZE INSIDE. THE PRIZE IS RAT FECES BECAUSE THE F.D.A. CAN SUCK MY BALLS. (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR MORE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S INDUSTRIOUS  INDIVIDUALISM WE GO TO AASIF MANDVI AT THE CONVENTION CENTER. AASIF, WHERE ARE YOU? I'M ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR, JON!
Jon: WHY IS IT RAINING?
OH, NO, THIS ISN'T RAIN. THE DELUGE I'M STANDING IN IS SWEAT POURING OFF THE BODIES OF THE EXTREMELY INSPIRED, HARDWORKING "NO HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT" SELF-RELIANT REALLY  SWEATY GROUP OF REAL AMERICANS!
Jon: SO THERE'S... THEY SERE BUSY BUILDING STUFF, THAT'S  WHERE THE SWEAT IS COMING FROM? IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I WAS A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS OF ANDERSON COOPER AND OTHER REPORTERS BATTING THE ELEMENTS. I JUST WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, SHOW THEM THAT I COULD HACK IT. I COULD BE CNN'S SANJAY GUPTA OF STORMS. YOU KNOW, STORM-JAY GUPTA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU SET UP A RAIN MACHINE INSIDE THE COB SREPBGS CENTER.
IT'S MOSTLY SPIT AND BEER. SEE, THESE PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE "THE DAILY SHOW."  OR "THE LAST AIR BENDER." IT WAS M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN, IT WAS A GOOD SCRIPT!
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. AASIF MANDVI. I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT THE WHOLE "WE BUILT IT" CHANT THING... IT'S A LITTLE CALL AND RESPONSEY. MAYBE IT'S THE CRUSHING HUMIDITY OR THE REALLY RICK DID HROUBG HUMIDITY BUT... (LAUGHTER). I'M KIND OF GETTING INTO IT. LET ME ADDRESS THE CONVENTION. LET ME SEE IF I CAN ADDRESS THE PEOPLE THERE AND SEE IF I CAN GET INTO THIS THEME. ALL RIGHT, READY? A CONVENTION THEME AT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN CYNICALLY BASED AROUND SOMETHING THE  PRESIDENT NEVER ACTUALLY SAID.
WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT!
YES, YOU DID BUILD THAT. NO ONE CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU. ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE. A PARTY-WIDE PERSECUTION COMPLEX WHERE ANY REFERENCE TO THE COLLECTIVE GOOD IS SOMEHOW TAKEN  AS A DENIGRATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S ACHIEVEMENT.
WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT!
Jon: YOU DID BUILD THAT, TOO! YOU'RE VERY BUSY. ALL RIGHT LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE. A MORAL CODE THAT EQUATES PARENTAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH MOXIE AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  WHILE EQUATING GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH LACK OF CHARACTER AND WAY OF LIFE  DESTROYING DEPENDENCY.
WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT!
Jon: YES, YOU DID! YES, YOU DID! OH, WAIT, I GOT ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOLD ON, I GOT ONE! I GOT ONE. THE CONVENTION CENTER YOU'RE SITTING IN.
WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT!
Jon: THAT'S FACTUALLY INACCURATE. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THAT WAS TAXPAYER MONEY AND UNION WORKERS. LET ME TRY AGAIN. AN ALTERNATE REALITY WHERE BARACK OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST MUSLIM, GLOBAL WARMING IS FROM  POLAR BEAR FARTS, FOX NEWS IS FAIR AND BALANCED AND THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR WAY OF  LIFE IN A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ADVANTAGE FOR THE  WEALTHY IS TWO DUDES WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED.
WE BUILT IT! WE BUILT IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: YOU MUST
