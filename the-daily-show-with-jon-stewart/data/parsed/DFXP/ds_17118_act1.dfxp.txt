JUNE 21, 20 TWELVE, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JOB STEWART. WOW, DO WE HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, BASSEM YOUSSEF.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YOU HEAR THAT? THE CROWD FROM EGYPT GOES WILD. A SAT TIRIST FROM EEGYPT, WHERE CIVILIZATION BEGAN, WHERE HUMOR BEGAN, ENTIRE SHOW, HIEROGLYPHICS, TREMENDOUS. WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE HIM HERE TODAY. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE CONTROVERSY REGARDING ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET YOU CAUGHT UP ON IT AS QUICK PLEA AS WE CAN. IT ALL BEGAN WITH AN A.T.F. PROGRAM CALLED FAST AND FURIOUS IN WHICH THE USE  GOVERNMENT ALLOWED GUNS TO BE SMUGGLED TO MEXICAN DRUG RUNNERS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHERE  MEXICAN DRUG RUNNERS WERE GETTING THEIR GUNS.   ( LAUGHTER )  IT TURNED OUT TO BE-- IT TURNED  OUT TO BE FROM OUR GOVERNMENT. THEY ACTUALLY-- CIRCLE OF LIFE. ANY-WHOOO, WE LOST TRACK OF ABOUT-- HOLD ON, HOLD ON-- 2,000 GUNS. ALTHOUGH, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, WE DID END UP FINDING ONE OF THEM WHEN IT WAS USED TO KILL A U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENT. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, WHISTLE BLOWERS BEGAN TO BLOW WHISTLES. CONGRESS ULTIMATELY ASKED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THE DETAILS OF THIS FAST AND ACTUALLY  SOMEWHAT CURIOUS PROGRAM TO WHICH THE D.O.J. RESPONDED IN FEBRUARY 2011, PROGRAM? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM. I NEVER HEARD-- LET ME LOOK FOR THE LETTER "F" FAST AND FIZZY, FARTS AND AT THAT POINTA. NOPE, NO FAST AND FURIOUS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ABOUT A MONTH LATER, CBS BREAKS THE STORY OF THE PROGRAM PUBLICLY AT WHICH POINT THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAITS ANOTHER NINE MONTHS AND WITHDRAWS THE FIRST LETTER AND SENDS CONGRESS  A NEW LETTER SAYING, OH, FAST AND FURIOUS.   ( LAUGHTER )  YEAH. WE HAVE THAT. WE'VE JUST-- WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT DONDESUSPICIOUS ESTA LOS WEAPONS AUTOMATICO. BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW. SO CONGRESS HAS FOR THE PAST YEAR OR SO NOW BEEN ASKING FOR THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS RELATING  TO THIS NO PROGRAM. OH, THAT PROGRAM, SWITCHEROO THING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID. ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER HAS REFUSED TO GIVE THE DOCUMENT. YESTERDAY THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE VOTED TO HOLD HOLDER IN CONTEMPT.   ( LAUGHTER )  IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME WAY TO  TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF THIS WHOLE THING UP A NOTCH.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ENTERED THE FREY AND EXERTED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER THE DOCUMENTS  THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY CONGRESSMAN ISSA. >>ISSA.
Jon:  OH, NO YOU DIDN'T! EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE ON ( BLEEP ). OOO-AAA.   ( LAUGHTER )  WAIT. EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE-- I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHEN AN EXECUTIVE GETS TO HAVE SEX WITH YOUR WIFE ON  YOUR WEDDING NIGHT. ISN'T THAT-- I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLD THAT IS CALLED PRIMA  NOTHINGRA, AND THAT ONLY APPLIES TO KINGS. THAT EXECUTIVE TOTALLY LIED TO ME. DAMN YOU, LEE IACOCCA! I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE THIS TERRIBLE STORY FUNNY. SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- IT TURNS OUT THAT DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, EXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE WAS SEEN BY THE DEMOCRATS AS A REFUGE OF SCOUNDRELS, A METHOD OF  OBSTRUCTION USED FROM ANYTHING TO KEEPING THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE VALERIE PLAME DOCUMENTS SECRET, TO PREVENTING HARRIET MYERS TESTIFYING ABOUT THE 2007 ATTORNEYS PURGE. IT UPSET MANY, MANY PEOPLE BACK THEN. HERE'S ONE CHOSEN AT RANDOM.
THERE'S BEEN A TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION  TO TRY TO HIDE BEHIND EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE EVERY TIME THERE'S  SOMETHING A LITTLE SHAKY THAT'S TAKING PLACE. AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE BEST SERVED BY COMING CLEAN ON THIS.   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THAT HANDSOME YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR IS RIGHT.   ( LAUGHTER )  BUT IF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT  IGNORES THIS YOUNG MAN'S ADVICE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO DEFEND AN EXECUTIVE ACTION TATHEY  THOROUGHLY DENOUNCED DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOT FIVE YEARS PRIOR, WHICH MEANS WE HAVE  NO CHOICE BUT TO PLAY EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE GAME.
DIFFERENTIATE YOUR PARTY'S ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION'S!   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  YOU KNOW THE RULES. DEMOCRATIC CONTESTANTS HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY OBAMA'S ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS MORE  VALID THAN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S USE OF IT IN 2007. OUR FIRST CONTESTANT IS NEW YORK REPRESENTATIVE CAROLYN MALONEY. DIFFERENTIATE THAT PRIVILEGE.
IF IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN COMMUNICATE IN  A-- IN AN AGENCY OR ALL OF YOUR DOCUMENTS HAVE TO COME TO THE PUBLIC, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR  PEOPLE TO REALLY EXPRESS THEMSELVES, AND HE DREW THE LINE THERE.
Jon:  DRAWING LINE, A FINE EXPLANATION, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO  PROTECT HIS ABILITY TO GET ADVICE,. IF THAT ADVICE IS SOMETHING SOMETHING INCREDIBLY STUPID LIKE WHY DON'T WE LET MEXICAN DRUG  SMUGGLERS SMUGGLE GUNS INTO MEXICO AND NOT TRACK THEM FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM HOW REPUBLICANS JUSTIFIED BUSH.
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO HAVE ADVISERS THAT KNOW WHEN THEY ADVISE HIM THEY CAN SPEAK  FRANKLY AND SPEAK IN CONFIDENCE.
THE COURT HAS LONG HONORED THE PRESIDENT'S NEED TO KEEP  ADVISERS' ADVICE CONFIDENTIAL ( BUZZER ).
Jon:  IT'S THE SAME. NEXT JAY CARNY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GONE LONGER WITHOUT ASSERTING THE PRIVILEGE THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN  THE LARGE THREE DECADES.
Jon:  EXCELLENT EXCUSE! COME ON, EVERYBODY! OBAMA HELD OUT SO LOCK! EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, IT'S LIKE VIRGINITY, YOU HOLD ON TO IT FOR  AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, AND ONE DAY YOU'RE LIKE, "I JUST GOTTA HAVE IT, MAN!"  HAVE A LITTLE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. JUST TOUCH IT ONCE.   ( APPLAUSE )  BUT, IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT  REPUBLICANS SAID IN 2007? SURVEY SAYS--
IN REALITY, PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS RAISED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE  FIVE TIMES MORE THAN PRESIDENT BUSH ( BUZZER ).
Jon:  DIDN'T DIFFERENTIATE. SAME ARGUMENT. SURE, OUR GUY DID IT AND IT WAS WRONG BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT AS MUCH AS THE LAST GUY. WE GET IT. YOU WERE BOTH VIRGINIAIPS COMPARED TO THE SHUT WHO WAS IN OFFICE BEFORE YOU. YOU'RE DOWN TO YOUR LAST SHOT, DEMOCRATS. YOU HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE TO SHOW OBAMA'S ACTION ARE DIFFERENT FROM GEORGE BUSH'S IN 2007. PERHAPS SOMETHING IN THE PROCESS YOU FIND OBJECTIONABLE.
THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A POLITICAL WITCH-HUNT.
WITCH-HUNT.
IT'S OBVIOUS, ED, A WITCH-HUNT.
IN WHICH IGNORANT PEOPLE ARE CONDEMNED BY THE IGNORANT AND THE FEARFUL. IN 2007 THE PROCESS WAS, WHAT WAS IT?
IT SEEMS NOW THAT WE HAVE A FISHING EXPEDITION.
Jon:  A FISHING EXPEDITION! A METHOD OF SUSTAINING ONESELF AT A TIME OF HUNTER. WAY TO GO DEMOCRATS, YOU'VE DONE IT. HUNTING WITCHES AND FISHING-- I'M BEING TOLD THEY'RE THE SAME.   ( APPLAUSE )  WELL, I GUESS THAT'S ALL THE  TIME WE HAVE FOR TODAY, BUT STAY TUNED FOR OUR SPIN-OFF SHOW FOR REPUBLICANS, RECONCILE YOUR  CURRENT OUTERAGET OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S USE OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE WITH YOUR  FORMER APOLOGIA FOR BUSH'S USE O
