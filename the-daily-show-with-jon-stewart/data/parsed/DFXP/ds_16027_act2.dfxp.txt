Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT SERVED AS A SECRETARY OF DEFENSE IN TWO DIFFERENT  PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS. MOST RECENTLY UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH. HIS MEMOIR IS CALLED KNOWN AND UNKNOWN. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DONALD RUMSFELD. SIR, NICE SO SEE YOU -- NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE COME AND JOIN US. THANK USM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THANK YOU. [  APPLAUSE  ] THANK YOU. PLEASE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: WE APPRECIATE IT. THE BOOK IS "KNOWN AND UNKNOWN." THAT'S YOU RIGHT INTEREST -- RIGHT THERE IN A VEST.
IN TAOS, NEW MEXICO.
Jon: IS THAT TAOS, LOVELY PLACE. OBVIOUSLY HE WILL TPAPBLT IN THE ROOM, TENSION. I THINK I KNOW WHY YOU ARE HERE AND LET ME DEFLATE THE TENSION RIGHT OFF THE BAT. APOLOGY ACCEPTED. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW WE CAN MOVE ON AND HAVE A NICE DAY, A NICE CONVERSATION. I KNOW IT'S BEEN TROUBLING YOU FOR SOME TIME NOW. I DO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START. SO LET'S START WITH IRAQ.
OKAY WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW I'LL TAKE YOUR STONEY SILENCE AS ACCEPTANCE. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S AN INTERESTING QUOTE THAT YOU HAD IN THE BOOK ABOUT JOHN YOU ARE -- YOU URLICHMAN. YOU SAY TO HIM ABOUT HIM, HE SEEMED TO HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY ABOUT HIS VIEWS THAT  BORDERED ON ARROGANCE, A TRAIT THAT DID HIM NO FAVORS AS HE GATHERED MORE INFLUENCE IN THE  WHITE HOUSE. CERTAINTY WITHOUT POWER CAN BE INTERESTING AND AMUSING. CERTAINTY WITH POWER CAN BE DANGEROUS. I THOUGHT, BOY IF THERE WAS OF A SOLID CRITIQUE OF HOW I FELT ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION YOU  SERVED UNDER UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH IT WOULD BE THAT. CERTAINTY WITH POWER IS DANGEROUS. TRUE OR FALSE? [LAUGHTER]
IF YOU GO TO THE WEB SITE THAT I PUT UP, RUMSFELD.COM, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS, THOUSANDS OF PAGES, AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THE ABSENCE OF CERTAINTY. YOU WILL SEE PROBING, QUESTIONING, WONDERING, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION, ARE THERE MORE THINGS WE OUGHT TO KNOW. IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.
Jon: IF YOU WOULD GO TO MY TiVo.
I DON'T THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
Jon: YOU SAID RUPLZFELD.COM. YOU ARE AHEAD OF ME. I'M LICKING STAMPS AND PUTTING THEM ON ENVELOPES AND HOPING IT  GETS TO WHEREVER IT'S GOING. I GUESS I'M DRAWING A DISTINCTION PERHAPS BETWEEN THE INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS AND --
RIGHT.
Jon: AND WHAT WAS PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. BECAUSE PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WAS A PICTURE OF NOT JUST RELATIVE CERTAINTY, CERTAINTY BORDERING ON ARROGANCE. THERE WAS A DISMISSIVENESS TO ANYONE WHO CHALLENGE THAT CERTAINTY. NOT HOW YOU REMEMBER IT?
IT ISN'T AT ALL REALLY.
Jon: WHY?
I KNOW WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND AND I KNOW THE KINDS OF  QUESTIONS THE PRESIDENT WOULD ASK AND THE QUESTIONS THAT COLIN POWELL OR CONDI RICE OR THE VICE  PRESIDENT WOULD ASK. THERE WAS A SEARCHING -- THERE WAS LOTS OF QUESTIONS.
Jon: A YEARNING, IF YOU WILL.
NOT QUITE THE WORD I WOULD HAVE USED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU DISAGREE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SHOWED A FACE OF CERTAINTY WHEN IT COME TO THE  INTELLIGENCE IN THE LEADUP TO THE IRAQ WAR.
NO, IN THAT RESPECT YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. THERE'S NO QUESTION BUT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY PRESENTED THAT INFORMATION. COLIN POWELL MADE THE PRESENTATION AT THE UNITED NATIONS. HE SPENT -- HE PROBABLY HAD AS MUCH EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS AS ANYONE  IN THE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.I.A. HE SPENT DAYS ON IT. HE WORKED HARD ON IT. HE BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID AND HE PRESENTED IT THAT WAY. NOW, THE INTELLIGENCE ALWAYS IS NEVER PERFECT. IT'S ALWAYS QUESTIONED. YOU HAVE TO REQUEST IT.
Jon: DID YOU KNOW INTELLIGENCE WAS NEVER PERFECT?
OH, MY GOODNESS, YES.
Jon: I FEEL LIKE WE'RE SITTING ON A PORCH NOW SIPPING LEMONADE.
I SAID WHAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.
Jon: GEE WILLIKERS.
I MAKE FUN OF THAT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO IN THE HEARTLAND  OF AMERICA THAT TALK LIKE I DO. MAYBE NOT THE COAST.
Jon: ON THE COAST WE JUST CURSE AND HAVE GAY SEX. THAT'S ALL WE DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE JUST RETURN AROUND CURSING AND GAY SEXING EACH OTHER. [LAUGHTER]
LET ME GO BACK TO COLIN POWELL.
Jon: POWELL WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
OF COURSE NOT. THE PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION. COLIN POWELL MADE THE PRESENTATION. THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE NSC WHO DISAGREED WITH THAT.
Jon: I WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH SOME OF THEM. BEFORE -- FOR INSTANCE, THE LINKAGE BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN AND AL QAEDA IN TERMS OF THE INTELLIGENCE.
THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A LINKAGE AT ALL.
Jon: THANK YOU. WE DIDN'T HEAR THAT THOUGH. WHAT WE HEARD WAS THERE WAS A DIRECT LINK. YOU CAN NOT TALK ABOUT THE WAR ON TERROR. YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS FELLOW, YOU DIDN'T MENTION HIS NAME BUT AL LIBBY DESCRIBED TRAINING THAT  HAD BEEN OCCURRING FROM IRAQ TO AL QAEDA.
THERE HAVE BEEN TRAINING CAMPS AND THERE WAS AN AL QAEDA CONNECTED GROUP THAT WAS  ACTUALLY PREPARING CHEMICALS. WE FOUND TRACES OF RICIN AND POTASSIUM CHLORIDE AFTER OPERATIONS. SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS GIVING $25,000 TO THE FAMILIES OF SUICIDE BOMBERS. HE WAS ON THE STATE DEPARTMENT TERRORIST LIST FOR YEARS.
Jon: NO QUESTION, HE WAS ON THE LIST. MY ULTIMATE POINT IS -- I'M SOMEWHAT GETTING TO IT -- THERE WAS NO REAL MOMENTUM FOR A WAR  IN IRAQ. WE HAD TO FOCUS THE COUNTRY ON THAT AFGHANISTAN DIDN'T TAKE MUCH CONVINCING. PEOPLE, I THINK, THEY ARE BEHIND THAT.
THAT IS FAIR.
Jon: SO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD TO COORDINATE A PRETTY  EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT TO GATHER INFORMATION AND CONVINCE AMERICA THAT THIS WAS IN OUR BEST  INTEREST TO DO SO. AND WOULD IT BE FAIR TO CONSIDER THAT IN THE EFFORT THAT IT TOOK TO SELL US THIS --
THAT'S A --
Jon: LET ME BACK UP.
A LITTLE STRONG.
Jon: IN THE EFFORT IT TOOK TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO --
PRESENT -- I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. IF ONLY I TALKED TO YOU BEFORE. [LAUGHTER] NOT SELL -- I WOULDN'T SAY PRESENT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT PRESENT. THEY GAVE US -- AGAIN THEY WERE PRETTY CERTAIN WHEN IT CAME OUT. ALL THE DELIBERATION HAD BEEN DONE.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I DO AT ONE POINT?
Jon: YES.
IN THE BOOK I TALK ABOUT IT. I SAT DOWN AND PREPARED A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG.
Jon: A PARADE OF HORRIBLES.
EXACTLY. ONE OF THEM WAS THERE MIGHT NOT BE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
ANOTHER ONE WAS IT MIGHT LAST SIX OR EIGHT YEARS.
Jon: DID YOU STAR THOSE?
NO, I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM I JUST KNEW THAT A RATIONAL PERSON HAD TO SAY WHAT COULD GO WRONG.
Jon: GREAT. NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
I PRESENTED THEM TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. CAN I GIVE YOU A BACKGROUND.
Jon: NO. WOULDN'T A RATIONAL PERSON -- I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING THE EFFORT  ON PRESENTING US THE INFORMATION OF CERTAINTY THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS A GREAT THREAT THAT HAD  WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CAPABILITY AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DISSEMINATING THAT TO  AL QAEDA OP PRA ACTIVES, THE EFFORT TO -- OPERATIVES --
JIEWF OVERSTATED. GOODNESS GRACIOUS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. WE'LL COME BACK AND I WILL FINISH. I'LL TRY TO RECALIBRATE --
ME.
Jon: YES. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE WITH
