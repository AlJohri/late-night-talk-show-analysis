Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE HOST OF MSNBC'S  "THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW RACHEL MADDOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Jon: I AM... I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU I COULDN'T EVEN SHAKE YOUR HANDS. I WAS CONTAGIOUS WITH THE BU BONS. YOU AND YOUR STAFF WERE VERY KIND WITH SLIPPERS AND GINGER ALE. I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE.
I FELT MYSELF SLIPPING INTO THAT KIND OF FEELING WITH HITLER  AND THE SEX SCENE CAMEO FROM THE WHATTINGHAM PALACE? I GOT A LITTLE...
Jon: I FOUND IT VERY TASTEFUL.
REALLY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: GIVEN WHAT SOME OF OUR ORIGINAL CHOICES WERE. [LAUGHTER] BUT CAN I TELL YOU MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT ALL, THAT TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THESE GUYS WHAT WE  WANTED THEM TO DO. THAT'S RIGHT. NOW, A STRAP-ON WITH HITLER. THAT'S RIGHT. HITLER. ADOLF HITLER. THAT'S RIGHT. AND WE'D LIKE HIM TO BE WEEPING. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST. WE NEED IT BY MONDAY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? THESE ARE FOR A NEWS PERSON I IMAGINE THESE ARE EXCITING TIMES. DO THEY CALL YOU WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AND SAY, GET DOWN HERE. DOES YOUR BEEPER GO OFF?
YEAH. LOTS OF PEOPLE START CALLING, AND EVERYBODY ON MY STAFF IS VERY NICE AND THEY SAY, HEY, YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TOO IMPORTANT TONIGHT, ARE YOU? AND THEN THE BOSS CALLS AND SAYS, RUN TO THE STUDIO. SO IT'S VERY... IT'S EXCITING. IT MAKES YOU FEEL... IT'S ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN IF YOU HAVE A BIG EGO ABOUT WORKING IN THE  NEWS BUSINESS, IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE, BECAUSE SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO OSAMA BIN LADEN AND  I'M THE ONE WHO IS NEEDED NOW? I'M NOT SURE THAT I AM.
Jon: HOP IN THE NEWS MOBILE.
HOP IN THE NEWS MOBILE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MESS UP UNLESS YOU TRY TO GET OUT AHEAD OF IT. ESSENTIALLY OUR JOB RIGHT NOW IS TO GIVE THE INFORMATION, GIVE THE INFORMATION TO AN AMERICAN  PUBLIC THAT IS INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY HUNGRY TO HEAR IT IN GREAT DETAIL BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE  OUT THERE SINGING IN THE STREETS ABOUT THIS, WE'RE ALL HAVING AN  EMOTIONALLY CATHARTIC REACTION TO IT.
Jon: VERY VISCERAL.
AND I THINK WE JUST NEED TO... I THINK WE NEED TO BE HUMBLE AND NOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD  OF THE FACTS, NOT GET IDEOLOGICAL ABOUT IT AND JUST LET PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS  WE KNOW ABOUT IT. IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK TEN YEARS.
Jon: WHAT'S SO GREAT IS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT REALLY DID LAST FOR OVER I THINK  LIKE 47 MINUTES AS I WATCHED THE NEWS. DIDN'T YOU NOTICE THAT? IT WAS LIKE THAT FIRST NIGHT EVERYBODY WAS IN THAT MODE. THE NEXT NIGHT IT'S LIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK FOR OBAMA'S POLL NUMBERS. IT ALL OF A SUDDEN DEVOLVED BACK INTO THE REGULAR SORT OF CATEGORIES THAT THE NEWS HAS TO  PLACE THINGS IN AS THEY GO ALONG.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO THINK THIS IS A TIME WHEN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU EITHER  PROVED YOURSELF AS A JERK OR YOU PROVED YOURSELF NOT. IF YOU CAN RESIST THAT TEMPTATION, I HONESTLY THINK THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN TRYING THE  LEAD EVEN THE MEDIA. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN TRYING THE SAY, THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR UNITY. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR RECRIMINATION. LET'S CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT. THERE IS A NEWS EQUIVALENT TO THAT WHICH IS STAYING CLOSE TO THE FACTS AND NOT TRYING TO MAKE  THIS HELP YOU SCORE WHATEVER POLITICAL POINT YOU WANT TO MAKE. THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. OSAMA BIN LADEN WILL BE DEAD FOREVER. OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NEVER COMING BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: VERY QUICKLY, CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT? BECAUSE... [LAUGHTER] AS WE SAW, BUT IMMEDIATELY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE REALITY THAT YOU LIVE INCH I  TURN ON THE NEWS AND IMMEDIATELY YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE SAYING, WELL, IS HE DEAD? IT'S AWFULLY WEIRD THAT... DO YOU THINK THEY DID IT TO DISTRACT FROM THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. [LAUGHTER] AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, REALLY? THAT'S WHAT'S LIVING IN YOUR HEAD? IS THAT... ARE YOU THAT JUST INSANE?
THE IDEA THAT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS THE REAL STORY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THE DISTRACTION FROM IT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW  ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY INVESTED IN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE STORY. IF YOU THINK THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN IS THE DISTRACTION THAT AMERICA NEEDS, I THINK THAT PUTS  THAT IN THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE. THE WHOLE LIKE IF WE DON'T SEE THE PICTURES, NONE OF US WILL  EVER BELIEVE HE'S DEAD THING IS A COUNTRY THAT I DON'T RECOGNIZE.
Jon: AND IF THEY SHOW THE PICTURES, THEY'LL GO, YOU SEE  THIS SHADOW, IT'S PHOTOSHOPPED IN. YOU CAN TELL THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY DO THAT. DID THEY TELL YOU GUYS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS SPEECH WHAT HAD HAPPENED? DID EVERYONE KNOW?
WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO ANNOUNCE, BUT NOT THAT FAR OUT  IN ADVANCE. I MEAN, NOT... NOBODY HAD ADVANCED PLANNING NOTES FOR SUNDAY NIGHT SOMETHING'S GOING  TO HAPPEN. IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. BUT ONCE IT WAS CLEAR THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT, THEN PEOPLE  STARTED GETTING WORD ABOUT WHAT THE GENERAL CONTENT OF THAT WOULD BE.
Jon: IT WAS FUNNY TO WATCH PEOPLE BE SO COY, BECAUSE YOU KNEW THEY KNEW, AND SO THEY WERE  ... I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S... IT'S C.I.A. IT INVOLVES A VERY SKINNY MAN, A SKINNY MAN, MAN THAT YOU MIGHT THINK HAS RICKETTS. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW. LIKE THEY WERE TRYING. HOW DO YOU WALK THAT LINE?
IT'S THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DEAL WITH AN EMBARGO SPEECH. SOMETIMES A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE THE PRESIDENT OR SOMEBODY ELSE VERY IMPORTANT IS GOING TO  GIVE A SPEECH, YOU GET THE FULL TEXT, AND THEN YOU GET ALL THESE PUNDITS SAY, WHAT WE OUGHT TO  EXPECT... YOU'RE SAYING, YOU'RE A SPEED READER. I CAN SEE YOU SKIPPING AHEAD TO PREDICT THE THING THAT YOU KNOW IS GOING TO HAPPEN. PEOPLE LIE ABOUT THAT STUFF ALL THE TIME.
SUDDENLY I FELT LIKE I WAS THE STUDENT WHO GOT TO HANG AROUND. LIKE WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS? YOU GET THE SPEECH BEFOREHAND.
REALLY?
Jon: WELL, YOU CONTINUE TO DO AN EXCELLENT JOB.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I ENJOYING SEEING YOUR PROGRAM. IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO COME BY AND SEE US. I KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY.
