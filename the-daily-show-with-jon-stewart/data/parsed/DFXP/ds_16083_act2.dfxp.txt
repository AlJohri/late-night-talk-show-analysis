LET ME TELL YOU THIS. THE MARRIAGE EQUALITY ACT PASSING IN NEW YORK WASN'T THE ONLY BIT OF GOOD NEWS HERE  THIS WEEKEND. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
UP NEXT, SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT OUR INTERVIEW LAST WEEK WITH JON STEWART.
Jon: YES! FINALLY. ( APPLAUSE ) LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON. I DO AN INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS WALLACE. I MENTIONED FOX NEWS VIEWERS WERE THE MOST CONSISTENTLY MISINFORMED VIEWERS IN EVERY POLL. POLITIFACT SAID I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID EVERY POLL. JUST MOST. I BROUGHT UP A 21 LIE SALUTE OF POLITIFACT SPOT FACT CHECKING SO I ASSUME THAT  CHRIS WALLACE NOW BEGINS THE WORK OF APOLOGIZING FOR FOX'S MANY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS. PROBABLY DO A BLOOPER SHOW AND CARRY US INTO THE 2014 MIDTERM S WITH A CLEAR CONSCIOUS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT FOX NEWS IS EXACTLY THE IDEOLOGICAL EQUIVALENT... OF NBC NEWS.
I THINK WE'RE THE COUNTERWEIGHT. I THINK THEY HAVE A LIBERAL AGENDA. I THINK WE TELL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY. JON SEEMED TO THINK THAT WAS A BIG DEAL THAT I SAID WE TELL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY. I WISH I HAD SAID THE FULL STORY. HERE'S WHAT I MEANT.
Jon: WAIT. THAT WAS A BIG DEAL THAT YOU SAID THAT. THAT'S YOUR SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT? I ACCIDENTALLY TOLD THE TRUTH AND WISH I COULD TAKE IT BACK? YOU'RE NOT THE... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S CRAZY. HOW ARE YOU NOT THE COUNTERWEIGHT?
LET ME GIVE YOU A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT FAIR AND BALANCED MEANS TO ME. AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA PILED ON FEMA FOR ITS FAILURE TO RESPOND TO  THE CRISIS. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID A LOUSY JOB. BUT IT WAS FOX NEWS THAT STARTED REPORTING ON THE FAILURE OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE CITY OF NEW  ORLEANS AND THE STATE OF LOUISIANA TO HELP PEOPLE. YES, WE REPORTED FEMA'S PROBLEMS BUT WE ALSO TOLD THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY.
Jon: THAT'S YOUR EXAMPLE? YOU HAD A WEEK TO PREPARE AN EXAMPLE AND YOU CAME UP WITH IN 2005 EVERYONE WAS (BEEP) ON  THE REPUBLICANS AND WE MADE SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT LOCAL LOUISIANA DEMOCRATS (BEEP) TOO. I MEAN, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY IN YOUR WEEK OF DIGGING FOR THAT, DID YOU FIND IT ON  THURSDAY OR FRIDAY OR WAS IT BROADCAST NEWS WHERE JOAN SPRINTED IN DURING THE SHOW  COUNTDOWN, "I FOUND ONE." HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL FIND SOMETHING. HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL FIND SOMETHING MAYBE MORE FROM THE RECENT PAST THAT I THINK TELLS THE FULLER STORY. IT'S NOT CRAZY. MOTHER SAYS I'M CRAZY TO HAVE THESE BOOKS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S CRAZY. I THINK IT'S SMART TO HAVE THESE BOOKS. HERE'S ONE. HERE'S ONE. BRETT BEAR'S SHOW. THAT'S ON THE NEWS SIDE. THEY WERE REPORTING ON THE CRAZY ATF OPERATION THAT ALLOWED MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS  TO PURCHASE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS INTO AMERICA AND SELL THEM BACK TO MEXICO.
SOME SAY IT WAS INNOCENT. OTHERS BELIEVE IT WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN TO JUSTIFY TOUGHER GUN LAWS IN THE U.S.
Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT? HE JUST THREW IT RIGHT IN THERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS EITHER INCOMPETENT MAKING AN INNOCENT MISTAKE OR THE ARCHITECT OF AN  EVIL CONSPIRACY TO WREAK VIOLENT CARNAGE IN MEXICO AS A WAY TO TAKE AWAY AMERICA'S GUNS. YOU KNOW, BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY. WHO SAID THAT NERK AMERICA WAS INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF CONSPIRACY THAT, IF TRUE, COULD OPENLY LEAD TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF A PRESIDENT? WHO SAID IT?
OTHERS.
Jon: OF COURSE CHRIS WALLACE'S MAIN CLAIM TO CREDIBILITY WAS THIS.
AS WE SHOWED TODAY WE DON'T GO EASY ON REPUBLICANS.
Jon: THAT AT LEAST FOR ONE HOUR OF FOX'S 168 HOURS OF PROGRAMMING A WEEK, REALLY, IT'S THREE HOURS BECAUSE IT'S REPEATED TWICE. MOTHER SAID IT'S CRAZY TO WATCH IT LIKE THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S CRAZY. I THINK WATCHING IT AT 2:00 AND 6:00 WHEN IT'S REPEATED IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. I WONDER. I WONDER. I WONDER IF THE FACT THAT I MAKE FUN OF DEMOCRATS WOULD THEN BE PROOF THAT I'M NOT BIASED.
AM I AN ACTIVIST IN YOUR MIND.
YEAH.
THEN I DISAGREE WITH YOU. I ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S THE CASE. I DON'T THINK....
I THINK YOU TAKE SHOTS AT... ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S TO MAINTAIN CREDIBILITY AND YOU'RE NOT AS COMFORTABLE WITH IT. YOU TAKE SHOTS AT OBAMA AND AT THE LIBERALS. YOU LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF CONSERVATIVES.
Jon: DO YOU SEE THE GAME? I MAKE FUN OF CONSERVATIVES OR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE I'M A LIBERAL PARTISAN IDEOLOGUE. I MAKE FUN OF LIBERALS OR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE I WANT AS PART OF MY BRILLIANT YET  CYNICAL STRATEGY TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH CREDIBILITY TO CONTINUE MAKING FUN OF CONSERVATIVES  AND REPUBLICANS. AND THAT NARRATIVE OF CONSERVATIVE VICTIMIZATION IS THE TRUE GENIUS OF WHAT FOX  NEWS HAS ACCOMPLISHED. ANY EDITORIAL JUDGMENT IN NEWS OR SCHOOLS OR MOVIES THAT DOESN'T FAVOR THE CONSERVATIVE  VIEW IS ELITISM AND IS EVIDENCE OF LIBERAL BIAS. WHEREAS ANY EDITORIAL JUDGMENT THAT FAVORS THE CONSERVATIVE VIEW IS EVIDENCE OF MERELY OF  FAIRNESS AND DONE TO PROTECT THEM FROM LIBERAL BIAS. AND IF YOU CRITICIZE FOX FOR THIS GAME, GUESS WHAT THAT IS EVIDENCE OF? HOW RIGHT THEY ARE ABOUT HOW PERSECUTED. IT IS AIRTIGHTER THAN AN OTTER'S ANUS. DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW THAT. THEY CAN'T LOSE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WHOLE VICTIM THING MAKES FOX? PERHAPS THIS TERM A FRIEND OF MINE USED ONCE TO DESCRIBE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL  ADMINISTRATION IS MOST APT.
THEY ARE THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF CRY BABIES I HAVE DEALT WITH IN MY 0 YEARS IN WASHINGTON. (   CHEERS
