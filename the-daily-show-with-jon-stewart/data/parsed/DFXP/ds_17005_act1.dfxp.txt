OCTOBER 17, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TODAY. SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US. WE'RE BACK, BABY. ON TONIGHT ELLEN SCHULTZ, THE AUTHOR OF THE RETIREMENT HEIST WHICH IS A GREAT FLICK. STARRING JACK NICHOLSON. I'M SORRY. IT'S ABOUT PENSION FUNDS MAXIMIZING THEIR OWN PROFIT. IT'S SO FAR FETCHED. HERE'S WHAT I THINK HAPPENED. I THINK THE TATTOO GUY PUT A HOT GIRL ON HIS LEG, RIGHT? THE TATTOO GUY (BEEP) AND THEN YOU'RE LIKE SCREW IT. JUST THROW A BOBO-FET HELMET ON IT. WE'LL CALL IT EVEN. THAT'S WHAT I THINK HE DID. GET A TATTOO OF BOBA-FET AS A WOMAN. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT. I BELIEVE THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS LIKE I LOVE I DREAM OF JEANY. WHY DON'T YOU PUT HER ON MY LEG. THEY (BEEP) HER FACE. I'LL PUT A HELMET ON THAT. OBVIOUSLY WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK. SO WE HAVE A LOT TO CATCH UP. LAST WE LEFT OFF I BELIEVE RICK PERRY'S ENTRANCE INTO THE  "PLEASE DON'T MAKE US VOTE FOR ROMNEY" REPUBLICAN RACE. PERRY BEFORE HE EVER UTTERED A WORD SHOT TO THE TOP OF THE FIELD. UNFORTUNATELY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT DOES REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF WORD UTTERING. WHICH PERRY'S DONE ON FOUR SEPARATE DEBATE OCCASIONS.
IS IT THE MITT ROMNEY THAT WAS ON THE SIDE OF AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT BEFORE HE WAS  FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT? WAS IT... BEFORE HE WAS BEFORE THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS?
Jon: THUS ALMOST COMPLETELY NOT HELPING THE WIN FOR LOSING THE BEFORE HE WAS WINNING NOW  HE... HEY, WHO WANTS TO SEE ME ELECTRO CUTE A GUY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED IN THE POLL THERE BUT ALMOST ALL  OF PERRY'S SUPPORT APPEARS TO HAVE GONE TO HERMAN KAINE BECAUSE AGAIN NOBODY LIKES  MITT ROMNEY. NOBODY. HE IS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S ULTIMATE SAFETY SCHOOL. WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO HARVARD. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS LOOKS LIKE A STRETCH. SO HELLO GLASS BREAUX STATE. GO FIGHTING FALLBACKS. WHY IS IT THAT RICK PERRY WHO IS BASICALLY A 200-POUND BAG OF CHOICE CUT GRADE-A  REPUBLICAN DROPPING LIKE A COW PIE? IS IT HIS MANGLED DEBATE PERFORMANCES? POSSIBLE. QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS LESS THAN PRISTINE RECORD AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS? PERHAPS. THE FACT THAT HIS FAMILY'S LONG-TIME HUNTING FACILITY WAS FORMERLY CALLED (MUMBLING) IT  HAS THAT NAME (MUMBLING.
I KNOW YOU'LL REFRAIN FROM SAYING THAT WORD. THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS CALLED NIGGER HEAD.
Jon: THANK YOU, BLACK WALNUT. BUT ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE ANITA PERRY, THE REAL REASON FOR GOVERNOR RICK PERRY'S DECLINE IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE INSIDIOUS.
WE'VE BEEN BRUTALIZED BY OUR OPPONENTS, OUR OWN PARTY, SO MUCH OF THAT IS I THINK THEY LOOK AT HIM BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH.
Jon: TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE. WHERE ARE YOU? YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THAT PAINTING BEHIND HER? I BET IF YOU REMOVE ANITA PERRY THERE'S A PICTURE OF A WOMAN WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE  HER ALREADY STANDING THERE... ALL RIGHT. AND NUMBER TWO, REPUBLICANS ARE BRUTALIZING RICK PERRY BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH? YES, NO ONE GETS IT WORSE FROM THE BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. OR AS THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN, THE BASE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT AT LEAST SOME EVANGELICALS ARE FIGHTING BACK. LIKE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF DALLAS PASTOR AND RICK PERRY SUPPORTER ROBERT JEFFRESS WHO  GOES IN HARD ON MITT ROMNEY SUPPORTERS.
MITT ROMNEY IS A GOOD, MORAL PERSON BUT HE'S NOT A CHRISTIAN. MORMONISM IS NOT CHRISTIANITY. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A CULT BY THE MAINSTREAM OF CHRISTIANITY.
Jon: I MEAN, IF Y'ALL WANT TO VOTE FOR A CULT LEADER, I'M  NOT GOING TO... THAT IS IS THE SWEETEST, MOST GOOD-NATURED, PLEASANT (BEEP) ON AN ENTIRE RELIGION. I HAVE EVER SEEN. BLESS HIS HEART. HE DESERVES TO BE IN HELL BUT CERTAINLY ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR THAN HITLER. ARE WE READY FOR A MORMON PRESIDENT OR SHOULD MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN CRISTIANS STILL BE SUSPICIOUS. FOR MORE WE GO TO SAMANTHA BEE AND WYATT CENAC. NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LET ME JUST START HERE. WYATT.
WAIT.
Jon: I'M GOING THE START WITH WYATT.
JUST A SECOND HERE. WHY IS WYATT TEAM NORMAL? OKAY. THAT IMPLIES THAT MORMONS AREN'T NORMAL.
PLEASE, IT'S JUST SEMANTICS. I'M NOT SITTING HERE COMPLAINING THAT YOUR SHIRT DOESN'T SAY TEAM TEAM CULT ON IT.
WE ARE NOT A CULT. MORMONISM IS A PROUD RELIGION FOUNDED BY A GREAT MAN WHO WAS GUIDED BY THE ANGEL MORONI TO  GOLDEN PLATES BURIED IN UPSTATE NEW YORK THAT HE PLACED IN A BOTTOM OF A HAT  WHERE HE READ THEM USING A SEEER STONE. RIGHT. FROM THE GUY WHO BELIEVES THAT JESUS COULD WALK ON WATER AND HEAL THE SICK WITH HIS MAGIC FINGERS.
YES. BUT MORMONS BELIEVE THAT TOO.
OH, SHEEP WHISKERS. YOU'RE RIGHT.
OF COURSE I'M RIGHT. LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT JESUS WAS BORN IN BETHLEHEM AFTER BEING CONCEIVED BY THE VIRGIN  MARY AND THE HOLY GHOST.
THAT IS JUST COMMON SENSE.
ACTUALLY NOT EVERYBODY....
WE ALL AGREE THAT HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND ASCEND TO HEAVEN.
YES. AND THEN HE RETURNED TO MISSOURI.
CULT. THAT'S CULTISH. THAT'S CULT.
Jon: I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE PROBLEM HERE. NEITHER OF YOU HAS AN ISSUE SUSPENDING YOUR DISBELIEF ABOUT ANY OF THE STORIES IN  THE NEW TESTAMENT. WYATT, YOU SEEM THROWN OFF BY SOME OF THE MORE ECCENTRIC TWEAKS THAT MORMONS HAS MADE TO THE STORY.
LOOK WHO'S TALKING. THE GUY WHOSE PEOPLE THINK IT'S NORMAL TO HANG OUT IN SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM AND  WATCH A GUY WITH A BEARD CUT OFF A BABY'S PENIS WHILE EVERYONE EATS POUND CAKE. WOO-HOO.
I HAVE A BEARD AND I WOULDN'T LET ME....
NO.
Jon: IN MY DEFENSE, IT'S JUST THE TIP. AND THE CAKE IS IS INCORRODE I BELIEVEY MOIST. ... IS INCREDIBLY MOIST. BESIDES THE POINT. WHAT WE WANT TO GET TO IS SIMPLY THIS. WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH WITH THE MORMON THING HERE? IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS AGREE ON THE BASICS.
MAGIC UNDERWEAR.
Jon: I REALIZE MORMONS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SWEAR. IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN COME UP WITH.
I'M TOO EXHAUSTED SINCE I CAN'T DRINK (BEEP) COFFEE, OKAY.
YOU SWORE.
BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS YOU SUCKING MOTHER....
Jon: GUYS, CALM DOWN. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS SHOULD BEING MORMON DISQUALIFY YOU FROM THE PRESIDENCY? I MEAN, YOU BOTH BELIEVE IN JESUS, RIGHT?
YES.
YES.
Jon: AS LONG AS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BELIEVES IN THE BASIC TENETS, I AM THE  WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME.
THAT IS A GOOD ONE.
Jon: LET THE ONE AMONGST YOU WHO IS WITHOUT SIN BE THE FIRST TO CAST THE STONE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE ARE FIGHTING ABOUT THE SILLY PROBLEM.
Jon: IF YOU WANT TO BE PERFECT GO SELL YOUR POSSESSIONS AND GIVE TO THE POOR. YOU WILL TREASURE IN HEAVEN.
OKAY.
Jon: THE MAN WITH TWO TUNICS SHOULD SHARE WITH ME WHO HAS NONE AND THE ONE WHO  HAS FOOD SHOULD DO THE SAME.
NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO. WHAT KIND OF OCCUPY WALL STREET (BEEP) IS THAT?
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT JESUS WAS A FREE MARKET GUY.
Jon: I'M JUST QUOTING SCRIPTURE.
AHA.
WOO-HOO.
Jon: SAMANTHA
