(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. THE REVOLUTION IN EGYPT HAS BEEN SPARKING RESPONSES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. FOR MORE THAT WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE. SAMANTHA BEE IN WAZIRISTAN AND JASON JONES INSIDE GLEN BECK'S BRAIN. WYATT, WE'LL START WITH YOU.
JON, WE DID IT. WE TOPPLED ANOTHER DESPOT I CAN DICTATOR. WOO!
Jon: I DON'T THINK THIS IS US THOUGH. DO YOU REALLY THINK, WYATT, THAT THE UNITED STATES DESERVES THE CREDIT HERE?
HELL, YEAH. JUST LOOK AT THIS DRAMATIC IMAGE OF OUR BEAR... BRAVE BOYS TEARING DOWN THE STATUE  OF THE TYRANT MUBARAK. USA! USA!
Jon: WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO... SAMANTHA BEE, YOU'RE COVERING A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT TONIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. I'M HERE DEEP IN TRIBAL PAKISTAN AT AL QAEDA WORLD HEADQUARTERS.
Jon: THEIR HEADQUARTERS IS AN OFFICE PARK.
WELL ACTUALLY IT ISN'T ALL THEIRS. THEY DO SHARE SPACE WITH A DENTAL PRACTICE. ANYWAY, JON, AL-QAEDA WANTS THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT WHILE THEY SUPPORT THIS COUPs OF A  SECULAR WESTERN BACKED AUTOCRAT, THEY DEPLORE THE METHODS USED IN CARRYING IT OUT.
Jon: IT WAS A PEACEFUL, HOME GROWN REBELLION. EGYPTIANS RISING UP FOR THEMSELVES THAT LED TO REAL RESULTS.
WHICH IS FINE AS FAR AS IT GOES. IT'S JUST THAT AL QAEDA LIKES TO THINK THERE'S STILL A PLACE  IN THE WORLD FOR VIOLENT, KAY ANOTHER I CAN ONFEW TILE EXPRESSIONS OF MURDERIST, EXTREMIST RAGE.
JON! JON, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Jon: JASON JONES.
JON, LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME. I DO NOT HAVE MUCH TIME IN HERE, JON. BUT I JUST OVERHEARD BANG OWES TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TOPPLE SAUDI ARABIA  WITH NOTHING BUT THE PLAY BOOK AND SOME BROWNIES. I AM TELLING YOU, MAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN HERE WHEN THIS GUY DRANK. IT IS LIKE BEING IN A MOVIE.
Jon: WE'LL GO BACK TO WYATT.
JON, NEW TAKE. YOU KNOW HOW BAD-ASS OBAMA IS, TO FOMENT MIDDLE EASTERN DEMOCRACY, THIS TIME HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO SEND OUR MILITARY. ALL OBAMA HAD TO DO WAS THINK EGYPT. TOTAL JEDI.
THIS IS NOT THE DICTATOR YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
Jon: HE DIDN'T... IF ANYTHING HE WAS ON THE FENCE. HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT. UP AND BACK I GUESS NOT TO MEDAL WITH EGYPT'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS BUT MORE LIKELY HE GOT  LUCKY THAT HIS DITHERING KIND OF WORKS OUT.
IS THAT WHERE THIS HAS TO GO? YOU WANT TO GIVE LESS CREDIT TO THE USA THAN TO MARK ZUCKERBERG AND A BUNCH OF  EGYPTIANS NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD OF.
Jon: IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
FROM NOW ON, YOU JUST SIT BACK AND LET NATIONS BUILD THEMSELVES? HE CAN REBUILD EGYPT BETTER THAN US? WE ALREADY DID IT ONCE IN LAS VEGAS AND IT'S WAY BETTER THAN THE REALLY JIPT. THE REAL PYRAMIDS DON'T EVEN HAVE SLOTS. JON, WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT MAKES IT OURS. WE BOUGHT IT. WE GET TO BREAK IT.
Jon: SAM BEE, IS A PEACEFUL PEOPLE'S REVOLT AL QAEDA'S WORST NIGHTMARE? HOW DO THEY PLAN TO KEEP THEIR MESSAGE RELEVANT WHEN THE ONE JUST SENT WAS OF NON-VIOLENCE  AND HUMAN DIGNITY.
THERE ARE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS BUT THEY DO WANT TO RECTIFY THEM. IN FACT, BIN LADEN HAS JUST RELEASED A VIDEO RESPONDING TO THE JASMINE REVOLUTION.
BROTHERS, AL QAEDA UNDERSTANDS TODAY'S BUSY JIHADIST HAS NON-SUICIDE  BOMBING OPTIONS FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT OVERTHROW NEEDS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE OFFERING ANYONE WHO STAYS WITH AL QAEDA 1,000 BONUS MINUTES. JUST OUR WAY OF SAYING THANKS. AS ALWAYS, BEST TO AMERICA.
AND THOSE ARE ANY TIME MINUTES, JON. THEY'RE GOOD FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.
Jon: IT'S CERTAINLY A COMPETITIVE OFFER.
JON! IT'S GETTING WORSE.
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW, JASON?
OH, MY GOD. IS THAT SOROS? A GIANT FLOATING HEAD OF GEORGE SOROS HAS FOUND ME. PLEASE, NO. NO, NO,.
Jon: ARE YOU OKAY, JASON? WHEN HAS A TV EVER DONE THAT? (LAUGHING) WE ALWAYS USE THAT TO... OKAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
