(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE FACTS TO BACK THIS UP--  (LAUGHTER) BUT I HEARD THAT WHEN WE GO  TO SLEEP THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT GOES AND BATHES IN THE REFLECTING POOL. (LAUGHTER) AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD WALL STREET IS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED. BUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON DOWN THERE. FIND OUT WE SENT SAM B TO THE OCCUPATION, TO OCCUPY THE OCCUPIERS.
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN, THE ANGER OF THE PEOPLE IS  RAISING TO THE SURFACE.
I'M FED UP. I'M ANGRY.
I'M UP SET.
I'M ANGRY, ENOUGH, GUYS, GO HOME.
I WANT THE PROTESTORS TO GO HOME.
I'M SORRY WHAT.
THE PROTESTORS.
YES, IN AMERICA'S NEW RAGE-BASED ECONOMY, THE WORKERS ARE SPEAKING OUT IN  ANGER, AGAINST PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT IN ANGER AGAINST THE MAN.
THEY'VE BEEN HARASSING US, THEY'VE BEEN ABUSING US.
YOU WALK INTO THE STORE AND THERE IS [BLEEP] ALL OVER THE PLACE AND SOMEBODY  THOUGHT IT WAS FINE TO LEAVE IT LIKE THAT.
Reporter: OKAY, SO SOMEONE CAME INTO YOUR BATHROOM STALL, AND [BLEEP] ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND LEFT.
I HAD THIS ONE GUY COME IN, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORE, YELLING BOYCOTT PENINI.
THEY BROKE IT.
ONE OF THE SINKS IS PULLED OFF THE WALL BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO SHOWER IN THE SINK.
THEY ACTUALLY CAME IN HERE THE OTHER DAY AND WANTED ME TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR WASTE.
THE PROTESTORS CAME TO YOUR STORE AND ASKED YOU TO DISPOSE OF THEIR BAGS OF HUMAN --
EXACTLY.
EXKREMENT.
EXACTLY.
OH MY GOD. WAS'S THE MINIMUM PURCHASE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY SOMEONE CROP DUSTING YOUR WASHROOM  AND WASHING THEIR CROC IN YOUR SINK.
NORMALLY A BOTTLE OFED SO ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.
I REALIZED I KNEED TO GIVE VOICE TO THE POWERLESS TO CONFRONT THE OTHER POWERLESS.
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T THINK IS RIGHT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE IT. AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE IT. AND AS AN AMERICAN, I THINK YOU HAVE THE DUTY TO TRY TO CHANGE IT.
SPEAKING OF DOESN'TY, WHERE IS EVERYONE AROUND HERE POOPING?
MOSTLY AT THE McDONALD'S. THE BURGER KIN WOULDN'T LET US IN.
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU --
WENT TO THE BATHROOM.
YEAH.
I JUST WENT --
ARE YOU BEING RESPECTFUL OF THE LOCAL BUSINESSES.
I'M NOT PATRONIZING THEM BUT --
YOU'RE NOT PATRONIZING THEM.
THAT'S MY RIGHT AS A CONSUMER. THAT'S HOW-- THE FREE MARKET WORKS.
NO, IT ISN'T. YOU ARE SUPPOSED GO IN THERE AND BUY SOMETHING, YOU CAN'T SPONGE BATHE YOUR GENITALS  IN THE REST ROOM. EVERYBODY WANTS TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU ARE DOING BUT WHEN YOU GO INTO THE STORES AND  USE THEIR WASHROOMS AND THEN THE SINK BREAKS AND WATER GOES EVERYWHERE, AND THE  PLACE FLOODS, AND THERE'S ASS JUICE ON EVERYTHING, IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY.
I DON'T DISAGREE.
THERE HAD TO BE A WAY TO BRING THESE TWO SIDES TOGETHER SO AMERICA COULD MOVE FORWARD. I HAD A COUPLE OF IDEAS.
STACEY, THIS IS BOBBIE, BOBBIE THIS IS STACEY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING.
OKAY.
BOBBY CAME IN HERE ONCE BEFORE AND GOT TURNED AWAY BECAUSE HE WASN'T GOING TO  BUY ANYTHING. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A BRIDGE HERE TODAY.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
BOBBY HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND HE IS GOING TO BUY SOMETHING IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT. SO THAT HE CAN JUSTIFY USING YOUR WASHROOM, LIKE A REGULAR CUSTOMER. SO --
I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
OH FOR [BLEEP] SAKES, FINE. IF I COULD HEAL THE NATION FOR THE COST OF A MUFFIN, IT WOULD BE WORTH IT.
ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE SURE NOTHING WEIRD HAPPENS.
OKAY, HERE WE GO. VERY GOOD. AND YOU BETTER KEEP IT CLEAN, NO DRIPS.
IF YOU WANT JUSTICE FOR ALL WORKERS, YOU ALSO HAVE TO BELIEVE IN JUSTICE FOR  THE WORKERS IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
LEFT IT CLEANER THAN WE
