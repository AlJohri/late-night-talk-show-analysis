(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WOMEN. WOMEN. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE AND APPARENTLY THEY'RE NOW ALLOWED TO VOTE. JASON JONES FILE THIS IS REPORT.
ARE THERE'S A NEW AND POWERFUL VOTING BLOCK THIS FALL HEY'RE CALLED WOMEN.T
WOMEN ARE THE TIPPING VOTE.
THEY HAVE TO WIN WOMEN.
WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN, WOMEN.
BUT JUST WHO ARE THEY? TO GET INSIDE THE MIND OF A TYPICAL WOMAN VOTER I SAT DOWN WITH POLITICAL STRATEGIST TAD DIVINE. (LAUGHTER)
WOMEN ARE THE MOST CRITICAL VOTING BLOCK IN OUR ELECTORATE. POLITICIANS WHO IGNORE WOMEN DO SO AT THEIR OWN POLITICAL PERIL. WOMEN ARE THE NEW SOCCER MOMS.
WELL, SOCCER MOMS WERE CRITICAL SWING VOTE IN 2004 AND WOMEN IN THIS ELECTION I THINK  ARE PARTICULARLY MOTIVATED BY THE RHETORIC...
SORRY, I'M GOING TO STOP YOU. I THINK IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT TWO GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WITH NO WOMEN PRESENT. EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FAR TOO LONG. LIKE WHEN DARRELL ISSA HELD AN ALL-MALE PANEL ON CONTRACEPTION AND WHEN MSNBC AND FOX HELD ALL  MALE PANELS TO TALK ABOUT IT.
HOW DO YOU DO A PIECE ABOUT WOMEN WHEN THERE'S ONLY MEN TALKING ABOUT IT? IT'S PATHETIC. GET SOME WOMEN HERE.
TAD, I'M SORRY WE'RE GOING TO TALK...
OKAY, OKAY.
CHANGE WAS GOING TO BEGIN WITH ME. SO I ASSEMBLED REPRESENTATIVES FROM SOME OF THE LEADING WOMEN'S GROUPS-- THE NATIONAL  ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, EMILY'S LIST, ELEANOR'S LEGACY, GIRLS  FOR GENDER EQUITY AND THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT WOMEN ARE HEARD? TAD, I'M GOING TO START WITH YOU. (LAUGHTER)
I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE MORE WOMEN THAN MEN WHO VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY SO THEY HAVE A HUGE VOICE.
IF WE HYPOTHETICALLY HAD A GROUP OF WOMEN IN A ROOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD BE  THINKING RIGHT NOW. TADD?
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACTUALLY TALK TO THEM AND LISTEN. AND LISTEN. TALK TO THEM AND LISTEN AND YOU'LL HEAR WHAT THEY THINK.
LISTENING IS SO KEY. (LAUGHTER)
WE'RE JUST PISSED OFF.
WHAT WAS THAT?
WE'RE PISSED OFF.
PARDON HE?
WE'RE PISSED OFF. WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
WOMEN WANT EQUALITY, WOMEN WANT SAFETY, WOMEN WANT EQUAL PAY.
WOMEN ON AVERAGE ARE BEING PAID 77 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR.
WOMEN WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED LIKE FULL-FLEDGED CITIZENS AND TO HAVE OUR LIVES  RECOGNIZED AND NOT DEVALUED AND MARGINALIZED. WE COUNT.
TAD, DO THEY COUNT?
THEY CERTAINLY DO WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTORAL POLITICS, THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERFUL FORCE  AND AMERICAN ELECTORAL POLITICS.
THAT'S KIND OF JUST THE POINT I MADE.
WOMEN ARE AN IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL FORCE. BUT WHICH ISSUES DO THEY CARE ABOUT MOST IN 2012?
MY WIFE HAS THE OCCASION, AS YOU KNOW, TO CAMPAIGN ON HER OWN  AND ALSO WITH ME AND SHE REPORTS TO ME REGULARLY THAT THE ISSUE WOMEN CARE ABOUT MOST IS THE ECONOMY.
IS THE ECONOMY REALLY THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR WOMEN, STPHA *D.
I THINK WOMEN, LIKE MEN, IF YOU ASK THEM IN THE POLLS, WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE SAY JOBS, THE ECONOMY, ECONOMIC ISSUES.
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE DOWN HERE? WHAT'S SHE THINKING?
I'M A WOMAN WHO WANT MISBIRTH CONTROL. NO ONE NEEDS AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY OUR CIVILIZATION NEEDS IT. VIRTUALLY ALL WOMEN USE BIRTH CONTROL.
TAD, DO ALL WOMEN USE BIRTH CONTROL?
WELL, I'VE SEEN IN POLLS THAT 99% OF WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE IN FACT HAVE USED CONTRACEPTIVES.
WE'RE HERE AND WE CAN SPEAK FOR OURSELVES. WE NEED TO HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF CONTRACEPTIONS WE'LL USE.
Jon: TAD WHEN SHE SAYS THAT WHAT DUD SHE MEAN?
I THINK SHE'S REFERRING TO SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN TOLD BY A  BUNCH OF MEN... LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE CONTRA ACCEPTION HEARING WAS HELD BY  THE HOUSE, CONGRESSMAN ISSA HELD THE HEARING AND DECIDED TO TALK  ABOUT FIVE MEN, I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW OFFENSIVE AN EVENT LIKE THAT WAS FOR ALL WOMEN.
WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST THAT WOMEN...
TAD WAS NOT FINISHED. TAD?
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY PATHETIC, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. AND WHAT WAS EVEN MORE PATHETIC..
THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH. WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WE FEEL DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO FACE  THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE LIGHT OF THIS AND FOR THIS TO BE A JOKE SO WE NEED TO BE HEARD HERE.
I... I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. SOMETIMES WE'RE GETTING CARRIED AWAY. I F I CAME OFF AS RUDE, IGNORANT OR SEXIST IN ANYWAY I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE TO ALL OF YOU. ESPECIALLY WHAT WOMEN ARE GOING THROUGH IN THESE TIMES. I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
NOW, TAD, IS THAT THE TYPE OF PANDERING CANDIDATES WILL NEED TO REACH THE WOMEN BLOCK? (APPLAUSE)
I THINK IF WE SHOWED THE FILM OF YOUR APOLOGY, YEAH, IT WOULD GO OVER VERY WELL.
CANDIDATES, THE LESSON IS CLEAR IN 2012, WOMEN FINALLY MATTER.
HIGH 5.
Jon: JASON JONES. WE'LL BE RIG
