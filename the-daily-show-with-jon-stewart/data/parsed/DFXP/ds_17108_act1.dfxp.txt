JUNE 5, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE GARY JOHNSON. VYING TO BE THE THIRD AMERICAN PRESIDENT NAMED JOHNSON AND THE FIRST NAMED GARY. (LAUGHTER) LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL IN  AMERICA'S DAIRYLAND, WISCONSIN. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S... ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T EVEN WANT TO DO THIS TO YOU PEOPLE BUT HERE WE GO. LET'S HEAR WHAT'S AT STEAK. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
IT'S A CRUCIAL DAY FOR VOTERS IN WISCONSIN.
A RECALL ELECTION IS BEING HELD.
SCOTT WALKER IS A VILLAIN TO SOME AND A HERO TO OTHERS.
THE REPUBLICAN WILL EITHER STAY IN CHARGE OF THE STATE OR SUFFER ONE OF THE WORST  INDIGNITIES FOR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL: LOSING IN A RECALL ELECTION.
WHAT? THAT'S NOT THE WORST INDIGNITY. THE I WORST INDIGGITY WOULD BE GIVING A SPEECH AND REALIZING YOU'RE NAKED FROM THE WAIST DOWN. RIGHT, MR. LINCOLN? YEAH! (AUDIENCE REACTS) I NEVER NOTICED THIS BEFORE. CAN YOU MAKE THAT PENIS BIGGER AND BRING IT CLOSER TO MY FACE, PLEASE? (LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, IS THERE ANY NEWS ORGANIZATION WHO KNOWS  WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE HERE?
WE LIVED IN CHINA, A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME  FREEDOMS AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AND HOW DO YOU RELATE IT TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN WISCONSIN? (LAUGHTER)
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT'S AN ENTIRELY REASONABLE WAY OF FRAMING THIS DISCUSSION  WITH A PRO-WALKER WISCONSIN SCHOOLTEACHER.
GOVERNOR WALKER'S NOT REELECTED AND THE UNIONS CONTINUE TO THRIVE I SEE A LOT  OF FREEDOMS AND CHOICES FOR TEACHERS FOR WISCONSIN FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE TO  BE TAKEN AWAY. IT'S NOT GOING TO GET AS EXTREME AS COMMUNISM BUT THOSE CHOICES WILL SLOWLY GO AWAY.
Jon: IT WILL BE LIKE COMMUNIST CHINA. (LAUGHTER) IF WALKER LOSES WE'LL ALL BE FORCED TO JOIN UNIONS-- LIKE IN CHINA. (LAUGHTER) SO GRETCHEN CARLSON BRAVELY STANDING UP TO WISCONSIN'S  MONTEREY JACKBOOTED UNION THUGS. BUT LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THERE WAS A TRAITOR IN THE FOX MIDST. A CERTAIN PROPAGANDA MASTER/POLLSTER NAMED FRANK LUNTZ WHOSE CAREFULLY SELECTED  FOCUS GROUP OF WISCONSIN VOTERS STRATEGICALLY FRAMED BY PRESIDENTIAL PORTRAITS FEATURED  AN INCREDIBLY SUBVERSIVE MESSAGE DELIVERED UNWITTINGLY BY THIS WOMAN RIGHT THERE. SEE IT? CAN I GET A CLOSEUP OF THAT PLEASE? NOTICE ANYTHING? (LAUGHTER) HOW THAT WOMAN'S HAIR TRANSFORMS OUR GREATEST CONSERVATIVE HERO  RONALD REAGAN'S PORTRAIT TURNING IT INTO, I DON'T KNOW, STALIN? (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU. STUMBLING UPON THIS MADE FOR A VERY ENJOYABLE MORNING WRITER'S MEETING, I MIGHT ADD. (LAUGHTER) IF SHE HAD GRAY HAIR REAGAN WOULD LOOK LIKE SAM ELLIOT. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOR WISCONSINITES, TODAY'S RECALL ELECTION SPOKE TO A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED DEMOCRACY ITSELF. WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
SCOTT WALKER BECAME GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN IN 2010. HIS TERM DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL 2014 BUT THAT JUST ISN'T SOON  ENOUGH FOR DEMOCRATS LIKE JEREMY LEVIN SON WHO COLLECTED ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO FORCE TODAY'S  RECALL ELECTION.
IT'S A HARD THING TO DO TO GET A RECALL ELECTION. THE CONSTITUTION SETS A THRESHOLD REQUIRING A GREAT NUMBER OF SIGNATURES.
WHAT'S IT, LIKE, 80% OF THE POPULATION?
WELL, THE WAY THE NUMBER IS STABLISHD IS THEY REQUIRE 25%E OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT  VOTED IN THE LAST GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION.
WAIT, SO YOU ONLY NEED 25%? WHY NOT JUST HAVE THE RECALL PETITIONS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE VOTING BOOTH, GET PEOPLE TO SIGN  THEM THEN. YOU'D SAVE WISCONSIN TONS OF MONEY.
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES WE WAIT ONE YEAR BEFORE STARTING THE RECALL PROCESS.
(BLEEP) THAT. RECALL THE CONSTITUTION. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, IT'S A PROCESS. OVER A MILLION WISCONSINITES SIGNED A PETITION. A MILLION PLUS WISCONSINITES CAN'T BE WRONG.
BUT APPARENTLY ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY ONE  CAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY VOTED FOR SCOTT WACHNER 2010. I'M CONFUSED. DID HE BREAK THE LAW? WAS HE CAUGHT WITH PROSTITUTES?
NO. THE RECALL PROCESS IS A SAFETY VALVE ON THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES DURING A  FOUR-YEAR TERM WHERE WHOEVER WAS ELECTED...
SO WHEN YOU SAY IT'S "RARE CIRCUMSTANCES" YOU MEAN WHEN  SOMEBODY GETS ELECTED YOU DON'T AGREE WITH? (LAUGHTER)
UM... (LAUGHTER).
Reporter: THE DEMOCRATS' ACTIONS HAVE INFURIATED MANY IN  THE STATE LIKE REPUBLICAN ISAAC WEEKS.
THEY'RE RECALLING A GOVERNOR WHO WAS PUT INTO OFFICE WITH THE  MAJORITY OF THE VOTE AND DID WHAT HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. PEOPLE MIGHT HATE WALKER. WALKER MIGHT BE (BLEEP). WALKER MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE GOVERNOR. HE MIGHT BE AN IDIOT BUT HE WON. YOU DON'T JUST RECALL EVERY DUMB PERSON BECAUSE THEY'RE A DUMB PERSON. (LAUGHTER)
YES. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THE REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING BACK.
I'M RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT IN THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT. YOU'RE RUNNING AS A DEMOCRAT?
YES.
SO YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN RUNNING AS A FAKE DEMOCRAT...
DON'T USE "FAKE DEMOCRAT."
BUT YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT.
EVERYTHING THAT IS BEING DONE IS PERFECTLY LEGAL.
IT IS CERTAINLY AN UNABASHED ATTEMPT TO DEFRAUD THE VOTERS.
SO THEY WERE MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM. AND HOW IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING DIFFERENT?
UM... INSTEAD OF THE PHRASE "MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM" I  THINK I'D PREFER EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PETITION FOR A RECALL ELECTION.
WHILE THIS STRAIGHT-LACED REPUBLICAN STILL HAS A WAYS TO GO TO BECOMING A PRESENTABLE DEMOCRAT...
LATTE.
LATTE?
LATTE.
LATTE.
LATTE.
VAMPIRE WEEKEND.
VAMPIRE WEEKEND.
...AT LEAST THIS RECALL PROCESS HAS SHOWN THAT WE HAVE TWO POLITICAL PARTIES THAT ARE  BOTH ETHICAL AND MATURE.
THE REPUBLICANS STARTED IT.
WELL, THE DEMOCRATS STARTED IT.
IT'S CERTAINLY SLEAZY, IT'S CERTAINLY OFFENSIVE.
IT'S A SLEAZY, UNDERHANDED THING TO RECALL A GOVERNMENT.
THEY'RE CHEATING.
THEY'RE WASTING A BUNCH OF MONEY.
IT'S A GOOD BIT OF WHINING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
I THINK THEY'RE BEING WHINEY BABIES.
BUT THEY DID AGREE ON ONE THING.
THIS IS HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS.
THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION.
JUST AS OUR FORE FATHERS INTENDED. RIGHT, I GET IT. IT'S LIKE WHEN I VOTE I'M EXERCISING MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, BUT WHEN SOMEONE THAT I  DON'T AGREE WITH VOTES THEY'RE MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM. WHY DON'T PEOPLE SEE THAT?
I MEAN, LOOK, THE RECALL IS... I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SEEN AS AN UNUSUAL BUT  BREATHTAKING EXERCISE OF DEMOCRACY.
NOW WHEN YOU SAY "BREATHTAKING" DO YOU MEAN, LIKE... OR DO YOU MEAN... (LAUGHTER) (GASPING) CAN'T, BREATHE.
NO, I MEAN INSPIRING.
(GASPING)
NO, BREATH TAKING IN THE SENSE OF BEING INSPIRED.
(GASPING)  > ARE YOU OKAY?ING.>
THANKS, WISCONSIN, FOR INSPIRING US ALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WYATT
