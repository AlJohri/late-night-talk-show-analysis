<p begin="00:01:48.909" end="00:01:50.110">&gt;&gt; IT WAS LUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.110" end="00:01:52.546">IT&apos;S THE MOST AMAZING PIECE OF LUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.546" end="00:01:58.118">THEY WERE GOING TO FILM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOUNG CHIMP IN HIS FAMILY AND HIS GROUP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.118" end="00:02:00.587">WHEN THE MOTHER WAS KILLED BY A LEOPARD....</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.587" end="00:02:04.057">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS LUCK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:09.429">&gt;&gt; IT WAS LUCK THAT THEY WERE THERE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE HE SHOULD HAVE DIED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.429" end="00:02:11.665">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY SHOULD HE HAVE DIED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.665" end="00:02:17.604">IF IN HIS TRIBE IF THE MOTHER LEAVES, DOES THE TRIBE NOT NORMALLY TAKE OVER FOR THE ORPHANED CHIMP?</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.604" end="00:02:20.073">&gt;&gt; USUALLY IT&apos;S AN OLDER BROTHER OR SISTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.073" end="00:02:26.213">IN ALL THE YEARS WE&apos;VE HAD JUST ONE OR TWO EXAMPLES OF A NON-RELATIVE ADOPTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.213" end="00:02:31.118">NORMALLY IT DOESN&apos;T HAPPEN BECAUSE THE MOTHERS ARE LOOKING AFTER THE BABIES AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.118" end="00:02:32.920">THE MALES ARE DOING MALE THINGS.</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.191" end="00:02:38.592">&gt;&gt; HE IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.592" end="00:02:42.763">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE IS THE ONE WHO TAKES OVER OSCAR&apos;S EDUCATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.763" end="00:02:44.598">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.598" end="00:02:45.866">HONESTLY IT&apos;S SO MOVING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.866" end="00:02:49.169">IT BRINGS TEARS TO YOUR EYES TO SEE THIS GREAT BIG MALE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.169" end="00:02:55.375">IN ORDER TO CARE FOR LITTLE OSCAR, THE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPS OVER TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.375" end="00:03:02.115">HE IS REALLY NEGLECTING HIS DUTIES OF LEADING HIS GUYS TO PATROL THE BOUNDARY OF THE TERRITORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.115" end="00:03:08.589">THAT&apos;S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE NEIGHBORS WHO COVERED SOME OF THE NUT GROVES </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.589" end="00:03:09.623">IN THAT TERRITORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.623" end="00:03:13.861">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU SAY &quot;NEIGHBORS,&quot; CHIMPS?</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.434" end="00:03:25.906">YOU KNOW, WHEN FREDDY NEGLECTS THIS, WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS FAMILY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.906" end="00:03:28.775">ARE THEY OVERRUN BY THIS OTHER GROUP?</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.775" end="00:03:32.779">&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE&apos;S AN ATTEMPT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.779" end="00:03:35.082">THIS IS THE DRAMA OF THIS FOOTAGE IS UNBELIEVABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.082" end="00:03:41.088">AND THE ENEMY, YOU KNOW, THE ENEMY IS MOVING IN TO TRY AND TAKE OVER THESE NUT GROVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:43.524">THE ONLY ONES GROWING THERE BY THE WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.524" end="00:03:46.860">BECAUSE FREDDY HAS BEEN SO PRE-OCCUPIED WITH LITTLE OSCAR,</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:52.432">THEY DON&apos;T HEAR THE SOUND OF PATROLLING WHICH IS DRUMMING ON THE TREES SO THE ENEMY IS </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.432" end="00:03:53.800">COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.800" end="00:03:54.468">THEY ATTACK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.468" end="00:03:56.803">IT&apos;S THE MOST INCREDIBLE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.803" end="00:04:00.707">DRAMATIC FOOTAGE THAT I&apos;VE SEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.707" end="00:04:03.143">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT NOBODY DIES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.143" end="00:04:05.679">LIKE CAN YOU JUST TELL US...</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.679" end="00:04:07.047">FREDDY AND OSCAR MAKE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.047" end="00:04:09.149">&gt;&gt; FREDDY AND OSCAR MAKE IT.</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.071" end="00:04:33.073">THEY WANTED TO MAKE A CHIMP FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.073" end="00:04:35.876">WE TALKED ABOUT IT ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.876" end="00:04:38.445">IT&apos;S AMAZING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.445" end="00:04:39.446">IT&apos;S EXPENSIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.446" end="00:04:41.415">IT&apos;S HARD, HARD, HARD WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.415" end="00:04:44.084">I HOPE EVERYBODY WHO SEES IT UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS DOES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.084" end="00:04:47.087">&gt;&gt; Jon: I CAN&apos;T EVEN IMAGINE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.087" end="00:04:49.923">THEY&apos;RE LIVING IN REALLY THE JUNGLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.923" end="00:04:51.525">&gt;&gt; THICK, THICK RAIN FOREST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.525" end="00:04:58.398">THEY HAVE TO CARRY THESE INCREDIBLY HEAVY CAMERAS AND TRIPODS AND THE SOUND RECORDING EQUIPMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.398" end="00:04:58.866">THERE&apos;S VINES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.866" end="00:05:03.570">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID THEY THINK, WE&apos;RE GOING TO PULL THE PROJECT&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:08.709">HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR FREDDY TO REALIZE, &quot;, NO, NO,</p>

<p begin="00:05:10.143" end="00:05:11.445">&gt;&gt; IT WAS LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.445" end="00:05:13.046">THEY HAD TO STAY A BIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.046" end="00:05:13.947">I CAN&apos;T REMEMBER WHY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.947" end="00:05:18.619">THEY NOTICED THAT, FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS INTERESTING FOOTAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.619" end="00:05:21.455">THEY WERE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE FEMALES.</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.962" end="00:05:34.635">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU WATCH THE BEHAVIORS, CHIMPS ARE 98% GENETICALLY LIKE PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.635" end="00:05:35.235">RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.235" end="00:05:39.806">ALTHOUGH IF YOU SAW ME WITH MY SHIRT OFF, YOU&apos;D THINK 99.9.</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.175" end="00:05:43.110">&gt;&gt; WE WON&apos;T HAVE A DEMONSTRATION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:43.977">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, WE WILL NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.977" end="00:05:48.882">WHEN YOU SEE THEM ALSO EXHIBIT THE MORE NEGATIVE HUMAN EMOTION, IS THAT MOVING AS WELL?</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.882" end="00:05:51.084">IS THAT ALSO....</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.084" end="00:05:53.086">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT WAS AWFUL?</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.086" end="00:05:57.090">I WATCHED NOT THIS GROUP BUT MY OWN JUMPS FOR YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.090" end="00:06:00.427">I THOUGHT, GOSH, THEY&apos;RE REALLY LIKE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.427" end="00:06:01.895">BUT SOMEHOW NICER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.895" end="00:06:10.270">THEN I SAW THE FIRST OF THESE INTERGROUP TERRITORIAL ATTACKS WHERE A VICTIM MAY BE LEFT TO DIE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.270" end="00:06:12.206">FIRST IT WAS SHOCKING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.206" end="00:06:17.044">BUT THE AWFUL THING WAS I REALIZED THEY WERE FAR MORE LIKE US THAN I THOUGHT BEFORE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.044" end="00:06:19.179">THEY HAVE A DARK SIDE JUST AS WE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.179" end="00:06:20.647">THEN THEY HAVE THIS GENTLE,</p>
