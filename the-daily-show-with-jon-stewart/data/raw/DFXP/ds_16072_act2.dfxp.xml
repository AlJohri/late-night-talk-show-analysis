<p begin="00:00:19.586" end="00:00:22.456">PEOPLE WONDER WHAT IS IT ABOUT SARAH PALIN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.456" end="00:00:25.192">WHY SO DIVISIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.192" end="00:00:29.930">ON FRIDAY SHE WAS AT A BAKERY IN BOSTON AND OFFERED UP HER VERSION OF THE FAMOUS MIDNIGHT </p>

<p begin="00:00:57.925" end="00:01:04.131">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT SHE JUST SAID BUT SHE APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN A WELL KNOWN </p>
<p begin="00:01:04.131" end="00:01:08.902">HISTORICAL EVENT AND TURNED IT INTO A FOLKSY TALE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.902" end="00:01:12.272">THERE WAS ENOUGH ADJACENT THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.272" end="00:01:13.340">WHO REALLY ACTUALLY CARES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.340" end="00:01:16.210">THIS IS THE PART THAT DRIVES PEOPLE A LITTLE BONKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:19.413">&gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE YOU MESSED UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE, DON&apos;T YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.413" end="00:01:22.416">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN&apos;T MESS UP ABOUT PAUL REVERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.416" end="00:01:23.550">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.550" end="00:01:25.118">THAT&apos;S THE THING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.118" end="00:01:33.293">THAT&apos;S THE PALIN... YOU DO A LITTLE OFF-THE-CUFF JUMBO AND THEN YOU GO ON TV TWO DAYS </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.293" end="00:01:39.566">LATER AND YOU&apos;RE WEARING SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ROBBED A VATICAN OR </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.566" end="00:01:42.102">ABOUT TO MARRY JESUS IN LAS VEGAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.102" end="00:01:45.939">THEN YOU INSIST THAT YOU INSIST THAT YOU MEANT TO SAY YOU WERE RIGHT AND YOU WERE </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.939" end="00:01:47.841">THE VICTIM OF SOME AWARENESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.841" end="00:01:52.746">&gt;&gt; IN A SHOUT-OUT GOTCHA TYPE OF QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF ME I ANSWERED CANDIDLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.746" end="00:01:56.250">I KNOW MY AMERICAN HISTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:01:57.784">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WAS A GOTCHA QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.784" end="00:02:00.721">WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.721" end="00:02:02.890">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M GOING TO REPEAT THE GOTCHA QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.890" end="00:02:09.129">WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR TODAY AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR VISIT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.129" end="00:02:10.197">&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE&apos;S A TIP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.197" end="00:02:16.403">IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE IT A GOTCHA QUESTION, IT DOESN&apos;T MAKE YOU A GOTCHA QUESTION JUST BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.403" end="00:02:18.839">IT GOT-YA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.839" end="00:02:22.075">BY THE WAY I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.075" end="00:02:23.477">SO IT&apos;S A GOTCHA QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.477" end="00:02:25.245">MEANWHILE THE BUS TOUR ROLLS ON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.245" end="00:02:26.780">JOHN OLIVER HAS THIS REPORT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.987" end="00:02:35.856">HISTORIC SIGHTS ON THE EAST COAST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.856" end="00:02:38.525">BUT THE MEDIA MISSED THE BIGGEST STORY OF ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.525" end="00:02:40.661">THE BUS ITSELF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.661" end="00:02:49.803">THIS 46-FEET FLAG DIPPED LIBERTY COACH TOOK OUR GREATEST TREASURES AND PUT THEM IN A SPACE NORMALLY </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.803" end="00:02:51.672">RESERVED FOR OUR FIGHTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.672" end="00:02:54.308">THOSE WHO SAW IT WERE HUMBLED BY ITS POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.308" end="00:02:56.343">&gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER FORGET IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.343" end="00:02:57.678">THE BUS WAS JUST GORGEOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.678" end="00:02:59.213">BEAUTIFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.213" end="00:03:03.350">&gt;&gt; HAS THE CONSTITUTION EVER LOOKED BETTER THAN SPLASHED ON THE SIDE OF A BUS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.350" end="00:03:05.819">&gt;&gt; IF IT HAS, I HAVEN&apos;T SEEN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.819" end="00:03:10.324">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BUS DRIVES INTO YOUR MEMORY AND PARKS AND THEN NEVER LEAVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.324" end="00:03:11.225">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.225" end="00:03:13.560">I&apos;LL SEE THAT BUS FOREVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.560" end="00:03:17.798">&gt;&gt; SARAH PALIN&apos;S BUS WAS A FEAST FOR THE SENSES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.798" end="00:03:21.869">YOU JUST WANT TO GET ON HER AND RIDE HER FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.869" end="00:03:23.203">&gt;&gt; STAY ON HER FOREVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.203" end="00:03:23.604">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.604" end="00:03:24.505">&gt;&gt; YEP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.505" end="00:03:27.074">ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.074" end="00:03:29.076">&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.076" end="00:03:30.110">&gt;&gt; THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.110" end="00:03:30.611">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.611" end="00:03:31.078">THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.078" end="00:03:31.445">THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.445" end="00:03:34.114">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.114" end="00:03:36.650">&gt;&gt; SHE&apos;S SPACIOUS ONCE YOU GET INSIDE HER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:40.687">&gt;&gt; JUST LOOKING AT HER, I&apos;D SAY YOU&apos;RE PROBABLY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.687" end="00:03:43.090">&gt;&gt; JUST TO BE SAFE, WE&apos;RE TALKING ABOUT THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.090" end="00:03:44.892">&gt;&gt; THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.892" end="00:03:50.264">&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA DIDN&apos;T APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.264" end="00:03:52.599">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S BEEN FRUSTRATING FOLLOWING HER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.599" end="00:03:55.435">NO ADDRESSES, NO EYE TIN RE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.435" end="00:03:55.903">NO INFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.903" end="00:03:57.905">&gt;&gt; SHE&apos;S THROWING US TINY CRUMBS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.905" end="00:04:00.107">&gt;&gt; WE PROBABLY DESERVE A SCHEDULE AT THE VERY LEAST.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.107" end="00:04:03.810">&gt;&gt; THEY COULDN&apos;T EVEN CATCH A STORY IF IT FELL RIGHT INTO THEIR LAPS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:09.583">&gt;&gt; AT THE VERY LEAST YOU&apos;VE INTERVIEWED THIS BUS&apos;S BIGGEST SUPER FAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.583" end="00:04:10.584">&gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.584" end="00:04:14.655">&gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVEN&apos;T INTERVIEWED HIM EVEN THOUGH YOU&apos;RE LOOKING AT HIM RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.655" end="00:04:15.589">INTERVIEW HIM ABOUT THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.589" end="00:04:17.224">&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE BUS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.224" end="00:04:20.227">&gt;&gt; I (BEEP) LOVE THE BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.227" end="00:04:23.764">QUESTION TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.764" end="00:04:25.299">ARE YOU KIDDING ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.299" end="00:04:27.234">WAS THAT IT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.234" end="00:04:27.801">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.801" end="00:04:30.904">&gt;&gt; HOW MANY PSIs ARE IN THE TIRES OF THIS BUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.904" end="00:04:36.410">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S JUST EXACTLY THE KIND OF GOTCHA JOURNALISM THAT YOU MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:04:36.410" end="00:04:38.111">BECOME FAMOUS FOR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.111" end="00:04:41.949">BUT IF THIS BUS TOUR WAS ABOUT ANYTHING IT WAS ABOUT EDUCATING AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.949" end="00:04:43.617">HAVE YOU EVER READ THE CONSTITUTION?</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.617" end="00:04:45.786">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.786" end="00:04:49.089">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVERY READ THE CONSTITUTION ON THE SIDE OF A BUS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.089" end="00:04:49.690">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.690" end="00:04:50.424">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.424" end="00:04:52.492">THE ANSWER IS NO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.492" end="00:04:56.663">NO, YOU HAVEN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.663" end="00:04:58.999">IT WAS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.999" end="00:05:02.202">&gt;&gt; I READ &quot;WE THE PEOPLE&quot; BUT THE REST OF THE WORDS WERE </p>
<p begin="00:05:02.202" end="00:05:06.773">KIND OF BLURRY AND TOO SMALL TO READ.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.773" end="00:05:11.712">&gt;&gt; THE BUS TRULY REPRESENTS EVERYTHING GREAT ABOUT AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.712" end="00:05:12.379">IT&apos;S BIG.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.379" end="00:05:13.647">IT&apos;S BRASH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.647" end="00:05:17.651">YOU&apos;RE NOT ALLOWED TO SMCHLT...</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.651" end="00:05:18.886">(BEEP) ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.886" end="00:05:22.155">NO MATTER HOW FAR IT ROAMS IT WILL ALWAYS BE CLOSE TO US.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.155" end="00:05:23.190">&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE BUS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.190" end="00:05:26.426">&gt;&gt; THE BUS IS A COUPLE MILES AWAY I BELIEVE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.426" end="00:05:27.694">&gt;&gt; SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.694" end="00:05:32.432">IT WAS JUST A COUPLE MILES AWAY IN OUR HEARTS.</p>
