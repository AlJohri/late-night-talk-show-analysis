<p begin="00:00:05.005" end="00:00:05.405">SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.405" end="00:00:10.177">SO AS YOU NAY KNOW, HEADING INTO LAST NIGHT&apos;S CAUCUS, MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.177" end="00:00:12.880">WAS FEELING A PARTICULAR KIND OF SPECIAL CONFIDENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:16.517">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;RE GOING TO SEE A MIRACLE HAPPEN ON TUESDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.517" end="00:00:19.553">I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.553" end="00:00:24.858">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND LO FOR MANY MONTHS DID BACHMANN DWELL AMONGST </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.858" end="00:00:26.994">IOWA&apos;S VOTERS AND CAME IN SIXTH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.994" end="00:00:27.861">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.861" end="00:00:29.363">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.363" end="00:00:31.798">OUT OF SIX.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.798" end="00:00:32.165">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.165" end="00:00:36.270">YET WHEN SHE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE THIS MORNING, BACHMANN MADE ONE THING STILL VERY CLEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:40.307">&gt;&gt;LY NOT BE CONTINUING IN THIS RACE FOR THE PRESIDENCY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.307" end="00:00:46.980">MY FAITH IN THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, THIS COUNTRY AND OUR REPUBLIC IS UNSHAKABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:49.149">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNSHAKEABLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.149" end="00:00:50.017">HER FAITH IN GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.017" end="00:00:53.654">SHE WAS EXPECTING A MIRACLE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.654" end="00:00:58.025">REALLY DIDN&apos;T GET IT, AND YET STILL HAS FAITH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.025" end="00:01:00.727">PERHAPS SHE THINKS GOD IS SETTING HER UP HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.727" end="00:01:05.532">MAYBE FOR ONE OF THOSE GOD MOMENTS LIKE WHEN ABRAHAM WAS ABOUT TO STAB ISAAC AND GOD WAS </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.532" end="00:01:07.301">LIKE [BLEEPED].</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.301" end="00:01:08.569">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.569" end="00:01:13.473">BUT THE TROUBLE, OF COURSE, WAS THAT THE REPUBLICAN FIELD BACHMANN WAS COMPETING AGAINST </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.473" end="00:01:19.279">NOT JUST FOR THE FACT THEY WERE REPUBLICAN VOTERS BUT FOR THE AFFECTION OF GOD WAS EQUALLY </p>
<p begin="00:01:19.279" end="00:01:21.181">TENACIOUS IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE BIG MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.181" end="00:01:24.785">&gt;&gt; IT IS TO THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS THAT WE GIVE PRAISE THIS EVENING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.785" end="00:01:28.322">&gt;&gt; OUR CONVICTION THAT FREEDOM IS A GIFT OF GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.322" end="00:01:33.861">&gt;&gt; AND WITH A LITTLE PRAYER AND REFLECTION, I&apos;M GOING TO DECIDE THE BEST PATH FORWARD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.861" end="00:01:36.930">&gt;&gt; FOR LOVING ME, WARTS AND ALL,</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:41.201">I OFFER A PUBLIC THANKS TO GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.201" end="00:01:42.536">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.536" end="00:01:45.839">&gt;&gt; Jon: GOD MAY LOVE YOU, BUT I THINK HE&apos;S JUST BEING POLITE </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.839" end="00:01:47.574">ABOUT THE WARTS QUITE FRANKLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.574" end="00:01:54.114">FOR MORE ON WHICH CANDIDATE MAY RECEIVE THE COVETED GOD ENDORSEMENT, WE GO OUT THE WYATT CENAC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.114" end="00:01:54.915">WYATT, WHERE ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.915" end="00:01:57.684">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M IN HEAVEN, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.684" end="00:01:58.418">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.418" end="00:02:00.420">THAT LOOKS LIKE A VEGAS SPORTS BOG.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:05.058">&gt;&gt; GOD&apos;S GOT HIS HANDS IN A LOT OF HUMAN PIE, FOOTBALL, GRAMMY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.058" end="00:02:09.329">LATIN GRAMMY, AMERICAN MUSIC AWARD, COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.329" end="00:02:11.064">ASIAN COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.064" end="00:02:14.434">&gt;&gt; Jon: GOD&apos;S JUST KEEPING AN EYE ON SPORTS AND AWARDS SHOWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.434" end="00:02:18.071">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S WHY HE&apos;S GOT PICTURE IN PICTURE IN PICTURE FOREVER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:19.439">IT&apos;S AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.439" end="00:02:21.508">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S CONFUSING, WYATT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.508" end="00:02:26.547">ALL THE CANDIDATES SEEM THE BELIEVE GOD HAS CALLED THEM TO THIS RACE, SO WHY DOESN&apos;T GOD </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.547" end="00:02:27.548">JUST TELL US WHO HE SUPPORTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.548" end="00:02:36.490">&gt;&gt; OH, SURE, HE COULD JUST SEND US A SIGN, MAYBE PUT NEWT GINGRICH&apos;S FACE ON A POTATO OR </p>
<p begin="00:02:36.490" end="00:02:41.662">PUT NEWT GINGRICH&apos;S FACE ON A MARSHMALLOW OR PUT NEWT GINGRICH&apos;S FACE IN A BELL OF </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.662" end="00:02:47.868">TARTAR SAUCE, REALLY GINGRICH GINGRICH&apos;S FACE COULD APPEAR ON ANY STARCHY OR GLOBULAR FOODSTUFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.868" end="00:02:50.103">CHOWDER, OH, IT COULD GO IN CHOWDER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.103" end="00:02:53.440">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, BUT WHY IS GOD BEING COY HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:56.677">WHY NOT JUST PUT OUT A YARD SIGN IN FRONT OF THE PEARLY GATE </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.677" end="00:03:02.082">SAYING, I&apos;M FOR SANTORUM OR I&apos;M FOR GINGRICH AND SETTLE THE WHOLE DAMN THING ONCE AND FOR </p>
<p begin="00:03:02.082" end="00:03:02.382">ALL IN </p>
<p begin="00:03:02.382" end="00:03:11.925">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW, WHY DOESN&apos;T HE SETTLE JUDYISM VERSUS CHRISTIANITY VERSUS ISLAM?</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.925" end="00:03:17.197">WHY CREATE A LOW-LYING, A PELLOW AND THEN DESTROY IT WITH A TSUNAMI?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.197" end="00:03:19.800">THE DUDE WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.800" end="00:03:21.535">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE LOVES THE GAME OF IT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.535" end="00:03:23.070">&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS PLACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.070" end="00:03:25.272">HE&apos;S GOT ACTION ON THIS ALL THE WAY TO THE CONVENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.272" end="00:03:29.843">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO GOD WILL ACTUALLY BE IN TAMPA COME AUGUST?</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.843" end="00:03:31.612">&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU BEEN THE TAMPA?</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.612" end="00:03:34.882">THAT PLACE IS A [BLEEPED] HOLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.882" end="00:03:38.619">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT GOD DID CREATE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.619" end="00:03:40.954">&gt;&gt; SERIOUS WAVES, JON.</p>
