<p begin="00:00:20.554" end="00:00:22.155">&gt;&gt; Reporter: IN THIS ECONOMY,</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.155" end="00:00:25.526">MANY PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR HOMES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.526" end="00:00:27.661">AND FOR THIS COUPLE OF NAPLES,</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.661" end="00:00:33.300">FLORIDA, RECEIVING A FORECLOSURE NOTICE FROM BANK OF AMERICA WAS THE LAST THING THEY EXPECTED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:34.801">FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.801" end="00:00:36.336">&gt;&gt; WE HAD NO MORTGAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.336" end="00:00:37.538">WE PAID FOR IT IN CASH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.538" end="00:00:39.940">THE BANK DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO FORECLOSE ON US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.940" end="00:00:43.644">&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU HAD NO MORTGAGE WITH THEM BUT THEY TRIED TO FORECLOSE ON YOU ANYWAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.644" end="00:00:44.845">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.845" end="00:00:47.047">THAT&apos;S EXACTLY HOW IT WENT DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.047" end="00:00:48.015">&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEN WHAT HAPPENED?</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.015" end="00:00:51.051">&gt;&gt; WE APPROACHED ABOUT 25 DIFFERENT LAWYERS AND NONE OF THEM WANTED THE CASE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.051" end="00:00:56.690">&gt;&gt; Reporter: NO ONE WOULD TAKE ON THIS DINOSAUR EXCEPT SUPER LAWYER TODD ALLEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.690" end="00:01:00.694">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE BEEN A LAWYER FOR EIGHT MONTHS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.694" end="00:01:02.296">&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.296" end="00:01:04.631">&gt;&gt; YEAH, I&apos;VE BEEN A LAWYER FOR EIGHT MONTHS.</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.439" end="00:01:14.074">I MIGHT BE OUT OF MY MIND HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.074" end="00:01:14.641">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.641" end="00:01:19.613">BUT I WAS SO MAD AT THE WAY THE BANK OF AMERICA HAD TREATED THEM THAT I FELT LIKE I HAD TO ACT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.613" end="00:01:24.151">&gt;&gt; Reporter: SO THEY BRAVELY TOOK BANK OF AMERICA TO COURT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.151" end="00:01:27.754">&gt;&gt; THEY AWARDED US DAMAGES BUT THE BANK WOULDN&apos;T PAY THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.754" end="00:01:31.458">&gt;&gt; Reporter: THEY WOULDN&apos;T GIVE YOU THE MONEY THAT THE COURT ORDERED THAT THEY PAY YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.458" end="00:01:35.329">&gt;&gt; YOU GOT IT, JUST UNDER $3,000 FOR OUR TIME AND EFFORT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.329" end="00:01:39.366">&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT WHAT COULD TWO AVERAGE AMERICANS AND A ROOKIE LAWYER DO AGAINST A </p>
