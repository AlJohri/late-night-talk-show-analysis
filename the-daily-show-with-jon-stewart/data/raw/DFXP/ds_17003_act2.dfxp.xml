<p begin="00:00:40.407" end="00:00:43.076">I MEAN, WAY UP THEY&apos;RE THINKING ABOUT MOVING IT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.076" end="00:00:45.312">THAT COULD MEAN CHAOS ON THE CALENDAR THIS WINTER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.312" end="00:00:48.048">WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN OUR POLITICAL TICKER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.048" end="00:00:48.682">THAT&apos;S COMING UP.</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.771" end="00:01:48.008">TO MOVE ITS PRIMARY UP AN ENTIRE MONTH TO JANUARY 31st.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.008" end="00:01:52.479">&gt;&gt; THIS MOVE WILL LIKELY THROW THE CAREFULLY ARRANGED REPUBLICAN NOMINATING CALENDAR </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:57.217">INTO DISARRAY AND JUMPSTART THE NOMINATING PROCESS A MONTH EARLIER THAN PARTY LEADERS HAD HOPED.</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.713" end="00:02:29.449">YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY WE LET IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTE FIRST?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.449" end="00:02:30.684">BECAUSE THEY&apos;VE EARNED OUR TRUST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.684" end="00:02:32.219">WHEN WE LET THEM USE OUR VOTES,</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.612" end="00:03:35.249">BUT THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER MORE INSIDIOUS REASON WHY FLORIDA IS SO ANXIOUS TO BE FIRST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.249" end="00:03:37.351">&gt;&gt; YOU GET ATTENTION TO YOUR ISSUES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.351" end="00:03:41.722">LET&apos;S REMEMBER, THIS WE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE THE NATIONAL SUBSIDY FOR ETHANOL THAT WE HAVE </p>

<p begin="00:04:04.077" end="00:04:05.746">THIS BECOMES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.329" end="00:04:26.767">&gt;&gt; THE OTHER EARLY PRIMARY AND CAUCUS STATES ARE ALL BUT CERTAIN TO MOVE THEIR CONTESTS </p>
