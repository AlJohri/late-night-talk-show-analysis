<p begin="00:01:21.081" end="00:01:23.083">&gt;&gt; I&apos;VE MOAN THE PRESIDENT A LONG TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.083" end="00:01:28.322">HE WAS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND THEN THAT&apos;S WHERE WE KNEW EACH </p>

<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:03.824">LET&apos;S MAYBE TRY AND DECONSTRUCT WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE PLACE THAT MAY SUCK YOUR SOUL OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.824" end="00:02:05.392">I THINK IT&apos;S INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.392" end="00:02:09.129">YOU HAD SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING WHICH IS YOU STUDIED ECONOMICS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.129" end="00:02:13.967">YOU STUDIED JOB CREATION, AND THEN YOU GO TO WASHINGTON AND THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT ALL </p>

<p begin="00:02:27.147" end="00:02:35.088">LOOK, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHATEVER WERE THE WORDS THAT THE POLL, RIDICULOUS, DISGUSTING,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.088" end="00:02:40.093">WHAT HAVE YOU ABOUT THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE, THE LAST THING WE NEEDED, WE&apos;VE TAKEN SOME </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.093" end="00:02:41.595">HEAVY BLOWS SO FAR THIS YEAR,</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.595" end="00:02:49.369">OIL PRICES, THE STUFF FROM EUROPE, THE DISASTER IN JAPAN IN ADDITION TO BEING THE HUMAN COST </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.369" end="00:02:51.305">HAD THIS IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.058" end="00:03:11.692">DIRECT INVESTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.692" end="00:03:12.826">NO ONE PAID ATTENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.826" end="00:03:18.432">IT WAS ALL WHO POUNDED THEIR FISTS THE LOUDEST AND WHAT COLOR WAS THEIR TIE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.432" end="00:03:20.834">THAT&apos;S PART OF WASHINGTON...</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.834" end="00:03:23.403">THAT PART OF WASHINGTON IS...</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.403" end="00:03:29.443">&gt;&gt; Jon: TO BE FAIR, GOING OUT TO COMPANIES IS ANOTHER FORM </p>
<p begin="00:03:29.443" end="00:03:33.080">OF... IT&apos;S STILL JUST PROPAGANDA TO SOME EXTENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:35.148">IT&apos;S NOT POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.148" end="00:03:37.885">IT&apos;S LOOK AT ME, I&apos;M IN A FACTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.885" end="00:03:46.093">I&apos;M GOING TO SHAVE PEOPLE&apos;S HAND, CONGRATULATING THEM ON STILL HAVING JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.093" end="00:03:50.264">THAT DOESN&apos;T MAKE ANY SENSE EITHER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.264" end="00:03:54.635">&gt;&gt; LOOK, IT&apos;S FAIR THAT A WAY TO DEMONSTRATE... WE&apos;RE GOING TO </p>
<p begin="00:03:54.635" end="00:03:58.939">HAVE POLICIES, SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE CAN DO IN A BIPARTISAN BASIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.939" end="00:04:04.378">WHICH I STILL... THE NAIVE PART OF ME, WHY DON&apos;T WE JUST DO THOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.378" end="00:04:09.116">BOTH PARTIES AGREED ON FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT WE COULD DO AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.116" end="00:04:10.651">TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.651" end="00:04:14.955">&gt;&gt; WHEN WE COME BACK WE&apos;LL TALK ABOUT THE... WE&apos;LL DECONSTRUCT </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.955" end="00:04:17.491">IT A LITTLE BIT, TALK ABOUT THE EXACT THINGS WE COULD DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.491" end="00:04:20.861">THAT&apos;S THE WAY TO DO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.861" end="00:04:22.963">LOOK AT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.963" end="00:04:27.534">I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE A BABY PACIFIER AND SOME GLOW STICKS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.534" end="00:04:31.672">IT&apos;S LIKE YOU&apos;VE TAKEN ECSTASY.</p>
