<p begin="00:00:08.242" end="00:00:14.448">WE KNOW, MITT ROMNEY&apos;S STRENGTH IS HIS BRILLIANT,</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.448" end="00:00:15.516">DETAIL-ORIENTED BUSINESS MIND </p>
<p begin="00:00:15.516" end="00:00:19.820">&gt;&gt; ANYONE MAKING UNDER $200,000 A YEAR, WE&apos;LL ELIMINATE ALL </p>
<p begin="00:00:19.820" end="00:00:25.425">TAXATION ON INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND TAKE THE CORPORATE RATE FROM 35 TO 29.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.425" end="00:00:28.262">THE PLAN I PUT TOGETHER IS 59 DIFFERENT ACTION STEPS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.262" end="00:00:30.364">&gt;&gt; Jon: 59 ACTION STEPS!</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.364" end="00:00:34.835">BECAUSE 60 WOULD BE LIKE HOW MANY [BLEEPED] STEPS DO YOU NEED?</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.835" end="00:00:38.138">AND 58 WOULD BE, WHERE&apos;S YOUR PLAN, MAN?</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.138" end="00:00:40.874">ALL THESE NUMBERS RIGHT AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.874" end="00:00:43.877">IT&apos;S LIKE THERE&apos;S NO QUESTION ABOUT MONEY THAT CAN STUMP MITT ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.877" end="00:00:46.513">&gt;&gt; GOVERNOR, WILL YOU RELEASE YOUR INCOME PLAN RECORD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.513" end="00:00:49.483">&gt;&gt; I HADN&apos;T PLANNED ON RELEASING TAX RECORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.483" end="00:00:55.155">THE LAW REQUIRES US TO RELEASE ALL OF OUR ASSETS, IF THAT&apos;S BEEN THE TRADITION, I&apos;M NOT </p>
<p begin="00:00:55.155" end="00:00:56.023">OPPOSED TO DOING THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.023" end="00:00:56.990">TIME WILL TELL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.990" end="00:01:02.162">BUT I ANTICIPATE THAT MOST LIKELY I&apos;M GOING TO GET ASKED TO DO THAT AROUND THE APRIL TIME </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.162" end="00:01:03.797">PERIOD AND I&apos;LL KEEP THAT OPEN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.797" end="00:01:05.666">&gt;&gt; Jon:, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.666" end="00:01:10.404">CERTAINLY I DON&apos;T INTEND IN ANY WAY TO BE HOLDING UP THE PROCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.404" end="00:01:14.641">I CERTAINLY WOULD WHEN I&apos;M ASKED AND THE QUESTION -- OH, MY GOD,</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.641" end="00:01:15.609">BATMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.609" end="00:01:17.144">[LAUGHTER]</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.112" end="00:01:19.913">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.913" end="00:01:21.882">SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.882" end="00:01:23.617">JUST GIVE US THE BIG PICTURE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.617" end="00:01:26.119">WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME DO YOU PAY IN TAXES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.119" end="00:01:27.621">THE TOP RATE IS 39%.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.621" end="00:01:33.861">MAN OF YOUR MEANS, YOUR ACCOUNTANT IS PROBABLY HIGH 20s AND MAYBE 30%.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.861" end="00:01:37.331">WHILE YOU&apos;RE TELLING ME, I&apos;LL HAVE A SIP OF THIS HOT CUP OF COINS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.331" end="00:01:41.535">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S CLOSER TO THE 15% RATE THAN ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.535" end="00:01:49.943">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.943" end="00:01:52.112">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK I PULLED A TONGUE MUSCLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.112" end="00:01:54.815">THAT&apos;S NOT AN EASY SPIT TAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.815" end="00:01:58.752">SO MITT ROMNEY PAYS THE SAME TAX RATE AS THE GUY WHO DRIVES THAT </p>
<p begin="00:01:58.752" end="00:02:01.421">[BLEEPED] BUS BEHIND HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.421" end="00:02:02.789">HOW&apos;S ROMNEY PULL THAT OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.789" end="00:02:09.897">&gt;&gt; MY LAST TEN YEARS, I&apos;VE... MY INCOME COMES OVERWHELMINGLY FROM </p>
<p begin="00:02:09.897" end="00:02:14.134">INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE PAST RATHER THAN ORDINARY INCOME OR RATHER THAN EARNED ANNUAL INCOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.134" end="00:02:21.942">AND THEN I GET SPEAKERS FEES FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT NOT VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.942" end="00:02:25.279">&gt;&gt; Jon: [LAUGHING]</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.279" end="00:02:28.348">OF COURSE NOT, WHO WOULD PAY MITT ROMNEY TO SPEAK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.348" end="00:02:33.086">EVEN WHEN HE PRACTICES SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, HIS REFLECTION FALLS ASLEEP.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.086" end="00:02:34.988">IT&apos;S PROBABLY NOT VERY MUCH MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.988" end="00:02:42.095">&gt;&gt; ROMNEY EARNED NEARLY $275,000 IN SPEAKING FEES IN 2010.</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:45.499">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.499" end="00:02:53.207">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.207" end="00:03:01.682">&gt;&gt; Jon: DON&apos;T WORRY, THESE WERE LICKED BY MARIO BATALI BEFORE I PUT THEM IN MY MOUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.682" end="00:03:05.252">$375,000, THOUSAND, IN SPEAKING FEES IN ONE 12-MONTH PERIOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.252" end="00:03:07.588">MOST AMERICANS WOULD THINK THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.588" end="00:03:09.056">I BET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.056" end="00:03:12.292">I WONDER HOW MUCH MONEY I&apos;D BET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.292" end="00:03:15.629">&gt;&gt; 10,000 BUCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:17.097">A 10,000 DOLLAR BET.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.097" end="00:03:18.098">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.098" end="00:03:22.503">I WAS THINKING LIKE $20.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.503" end="00:03:23.971">A HYUNDAI AT BEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.971" end="00:03:25.873">YOU KNOW WHAT, MITT, YOU&apos;RE A RICH MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.873" end="00:03:27.207">WE ALL KNOW IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.207" end="00:03:28.275">CUT THE CRAP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.275" end="00:03:33.280">&gt;&gt; THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS, THE 80% TO 90% OF US.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.917">&gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT IT&apos;S LIKE TO WORRY WHETHER OR NOT YOU&apos;LL GET FIRED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.917" end="00:03:41.555">THERE WERE A COUPLE TIMES WHETHER I WONDERED WHETHER I WOULD GET A PINK SLIP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.555" end="00:03:45.092">I&apos;M ALSO UNEMPLOYED.</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.507" end="00:04:02.176">AND JUST OWN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.176" end="00:04:08.282">JUST COME OUT OF YOUR OBSCENELY LARGE MAHOGANY PANELED CLOSET.</p>
