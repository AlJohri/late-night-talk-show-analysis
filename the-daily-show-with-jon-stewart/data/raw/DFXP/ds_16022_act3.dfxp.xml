<p begin="00:01:13.473" end="00:01:16.410">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE MOVIE IS A FINE...</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.410" end="00:01:17.778">THERE&apos;S A LOT OF INTRICACIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.778" end="00:01:18.111">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.111" end="00:01:18.979">&gt;&gt; Jon: TO THE PLOT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.979" end="00:01:20.681">I DON&apos;T WANT TO GET INTO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.681" end="00:01:22.549">&gt;&gt; AND I CAN&apos;T ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.549" end="00:01:23.650">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CAN&apos;T ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.650" end="00:01:24.218">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.218" end="00:01:26.053">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE&apos;LL TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.326" end="00:01:34.928">&gt;&gt; I THINK HE&apos;LL BE A BIG STAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.928" end="00:01:37.464">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE&apos;S A BIG HUNK OF A MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.464" end="00:01:37.831">MASSIVE.</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.107" end="00:01:47.908">HE&apos;S FROM NEW JERSEY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.908" end="00:01:49.543">&gt;&gt; THAT RUINS IT FOR ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.543" end="00:01:51.845">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT DOES RUIN IT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.845" end="00:01:53.180">SOMETIMES THE TRUTH HAS TO BE TOLD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.180" end="00:01:55.549">YOU ARE FROM ONE OF THE DAKOTAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.549" end="00:01:56.383">WHICH ONE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.383" end="00:02:00.153">&gt;&gt; DOES IT MATTER?</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.153" end="00:02:01.488">NOBODY EVER CARES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.488" end="00:02:04.057">&gt;&gt; Jon: I ASSUME ZIP CODEWISE IT DOES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:06.593">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S ALL ONE ZIP CODE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.593" end="00:02:09.429">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE SHOULD REFER TO IT AS DAKOTA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.429" end="00:02:10.264">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.264" end="00:02:11.298">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.298" end="00:02:12.833">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT TRUE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.833" end="00:02:14.368">&gt;&gt; STILL THE DAKOTA TERRITORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.368" end="00:02:16.904">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.904" end="00:02:19.373">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M FROM SOUTH JUST TO BE CLEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.373" end="00:02:20.941">THERE IS A BIT OF A RIVALRY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.941" end="00:02:22.176">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT TRUE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.176" end="00:02:24.044">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.044" end="00:02:26.513">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS IT A MASON-DIXON SITUATION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.513" end="00:02:29.950">ARE WE... WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:37.191">DOES ONE CALL A SUBMARINE SANDWICH A SUB AND THE OTHER A HOAGIE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.191" end="00:02:37.824">WHAT LEVEL....</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.824" end="00:02:43.931">&gt;&gt; WE MAKE FUN OF EACH OTHER&apos;S ACCENTS AND THE WAY WE DRIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.931" end="00:02:44.898">SOUTH DAKOTA....</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.898" end="00:02:49.436">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M JUST CURIOUS AS TO THE DIFFERENCE IN DRIVING ABILITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.436" end="00:02:51.371">SEEMS LIKE A VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.371" end="00:02:54.508">&gt;&gt; EVERYONE THINKS THEY&apos;RE BETTER BECAUSE THEY GET MORE SNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.508" end="00:02:56.009">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.009" end="00:03:00.480">AND WHAT WOULD SOUTH DAKOTA AT THAT POINT LORD OVER NORTH DAKOTA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:02.616">&gt;&gt; MOUNT RUSHMORE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.616" end="00:03:03.984">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S BEAUTIFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.984" end="00:03:05.118">&gt;&gt; THE BAD LANDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.118" end="00:03:05.886">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.886" end="00:03:07.454">YOU HAVE BAD LANDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.454" end="00:03:09.289">MOUNT RUSHMORE AND THEY HAVE SNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.289" end="00:03:09.790">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:12.092">WE&apos;VE GOT A LOT OF SNOW TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.092" end="00:03:13.360">THEY JUST MAY GET MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:15.395">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS BRAGGING RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.395" end="00:03:17.397">AND FORGIVE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.397" end="00:03:20.200">ROGER MARIS IS SOUTH OR NORTH?</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.200" end="00:03:22.169">DO YOU KNOW ROGER MARIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.169" end="00:03:22.836">&gt;&gt; BASEBALL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.836" end="00:03:24.438">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE YANKEE GREAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.438" end="00:03:26.773">51 HOME RUNS, NO STEROIDS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.773" end="00:03:29.376">&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE SOMEONE FAMOUS IN SOUTH DAKOTA?</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.376" end="00:03:30.711">&gt;&gt; Jon: SETTLE DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.711" end="00:03:32.379">I WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.379" end="00:03:35.449">&gt;&gt; TOM BROKAW WAS, IS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.449" end="00:03:37.217">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE LIVES IN SOUTH DAKOTA NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.217" end="00:03:38.285">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.285" end="00:03:41.154">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;VE NEVER BEEN TO SOUTH DAKOTA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.154" end="00:03:44.491">IT IS NOW... IT&apos;S BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.491" end="00:03:48.095">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S... MAYBE A TALL TALE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.095" end="00:03:51.765">IT&apos;S LEGENDARY THAT SOMEONE HAS COME FROM THERE BESIDES....</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.765" end="00:03:55.302">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUNYAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.302" end="00:03:56.803">DO YOU STILL HAVE FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.803" end="00:03:58.038">&gt;&gt; ALL MY FAMILY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.038" end="00:03:59.339">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT TRUE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.339" end="00:03:59.706">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.706" end="00:04:01.508">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DO THEY FEEL ABOUT....</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.508" end="00:04:03.644">&gt;&gt; I HOPE THEY&apos;RE NOT MAD ABOUT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.644" end="00:04:08.015">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY WOULD THEY BE MAD ABOUT YOU (BEEP) ON WHERE THEY LIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.015" end="00:04:09.716">WHY WOULD THAT BOTHER THEM IN ANY WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.716" end="00:04:11.618">&gt;&gt; I LOVE SOUTH DAKOTA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.618" end="00:04:14.121">I JUST SAID WE&apos;RE BETTER THAN AT LEAST NORTH DAKOTA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.121" end="00:04:16.657">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.657" end="00:04:17.624">AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.624" end="00:04:18.091">&gt;&gt; IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.091" end="00:04:20.194">&gt;&gt; Jon: WERE YOU AN OUTDOORS PERSON?</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.194" end="00:04:24.531">&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE STATE IS AROUND 600,000, 700,000 PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.531" end="00:04:27.301">SO THERE&apos;S NOT... YOU DO MOST EVERYTHING OUTSIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.301" end="00:04:29.736">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID YOU HAVE A HOME?</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.736" end="00:04:31.805">&gt;&gt; WE DID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.805" end="00:04:32.773">AND LAND.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.773" end="00:04:36.343">&gt;&gt; Jon: (LAUGHING) I WOULD NOT FAREWELL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.343" end="00:04:37.778">HOW WOULD I BE THERE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.778" end="00:04:38.745">DO THEY HAVE JEWS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.745" end="00:04:41.415">LET ME ASK YOU THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.415" end="00:04:42.182">&gt;&gt; WE DON&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.182" end="00:04:49.122">&gt;&gt; Jon: COULD WE SET UP ALMOST LIKE A PRESERVE WHERE JEWS COULD ROAM FREELY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.122" end="00:04:50.924">&gt;&gt; WITH THE BUFFALO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.924" end="00:04:56.396">&gt;&gt; Jon: PEOPLE COULD COME AND GO OH, THEY&apos;RE MUCH SOFTER THAN I THOUGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.396" end="00:04:57.564">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.564" end="00:05:00.667">I BROUGHT A BOYFRIEND HOME ONCE WHO WAS JEWISH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.667" end="00:05:01.935">IT WAS THE TALK OF THE TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.935" end="00:05:02.603">I&apos;LL TELL YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.603" end="00:05:07.307">&gt;&gt; Jon: IN SUPER BOWL ALLEGIANCE WHERE DO THE DAKOTAS GO?</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.307" end="00:05:08.141">MINNESOTA, GREEN BAY?</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.141" end="00:05:11.612">WHAT WAS YOUR... IN THE SUPER BOWL WHAT WAS YOUR ALLEGIANCE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.612" end="00:05:13.881">&gt;&gt; STEELERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.881" end="00:05:15.282">I&apos;M A STEELERS FAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.282" end="00:05:18.085">MY DAD WAS A STEELERS&apos; FAN WHEN I WAS A KID.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.085" end="00:05:21.021">&gt;&gt; Jon: PASS DOWN TO THE NEXT GENERATION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.021" end="00:05:24.691">&gt;&gt; IF YOU&apos;RE FROM THE EAST OR WEST SIDE YOU CAN GO VIKINGS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.691" end="00:05:28.629">BEARS, PACKERS OR YOU CAN GO BRONCOS....</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.629" end="00:05:29.630">&gt;&gt; Jon: WEST SIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:30.697">&gt;&gt; MAYBE KANSAS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.697" end="00:05:31.532">YEAH, WEST SIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.532" end="00:05:35.936">&gt;&gt; Jon: AGAIN IS THIS ANOTHER FEUD LIKE WEST SIDE EAST SIDE BECAUSE I KNOW NORTH AND SOUTH </p>
<p begin="00:05:35.936" end="00:05:37.404">AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE LIKE...</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.404" end="00:05:43.143">YOU HAVE THAT FEUD AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE... I GUESS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.143" end="00:05:46.346">NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.346" end="00:05:48.916">&gt;&gt; THEY DUEL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.916" end="00:05:51.084">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY WOULD DUEL OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.084" end="00:05:55.889">WHENEVER I&apos;VE SEEN IMAGES IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY ROMANTIC VISTA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.889" end="00:05:57.357">IT SEEMS BEAUTIFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.357" end="00:05:57.658">OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.658" end="00:05:58.458">YOU ARE UNIMPRESSED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.458" end="00:06:00.460">&gt;&gt; YOU SAW DANCING WITH WOLVES,</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.460" end="00:06:00.861">DIDN&apos;T YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.861" end="00:06:02.996">&gt;&gt; Jon: I DID SEE DANCING WITH WOLVES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.996" end="00:06:07.034">I THOUGHT LAKOTA, DAKOTA (BEEP) CLOSE ENOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.034" end="00:06:08.635">ARE YOU IN A MOVIE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.635" end="00:06:09.970">&gt;&gt; OH, RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.970" end="00:06:11.905">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE MOVIE IS CALLED UNKNOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.905" end="00:06:14.007">IT&apos;S GOING TO BE IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.007" end="00:06:14.875">IT&apos;S QUITE GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.875" end="00:06:15.976">&gt;&gt; YES IT IS GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.976" end="00:06:17.945">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE IN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.945" end="00:06:19.813">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S THE ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU.</p>
