<p begin="00:00:08.342" end="00:00:12.412">SO DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN FORMER HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.412" end="00:00:16.383">WAS ARRESTED THIS WEEK AFTER AGENCIEDLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A HOTEL MADE HAS </p>
<p begin="00:00:16.383" end="00:00:21.889">POSTED BAIL OF $1 MILLION IN CASH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.889" end="00:00:27.294">HOW DOES THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND GET THAT KIND-- WELL, THERE </p>
<p begin="00:00:27.294" end="00:00:29.429">GOES NIGERIA&apos;S MOSQUITO NET MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.429" end="00:00:31.765">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.765" end="00:00:37.204">OBVIOUSLY ONE IS PRESUMED INNOCENT--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.204" end="00:00:39.239">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:42.376">ONE WOULD LIKE TO RESERVE JUDGEMENT, LET THE COURTS DO THEIR WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.376" end="00:00:49.116">OF COURSE THAT HAS NOT PREVENTED STRAUSS-KAHN SUPPORTERS FROM MAKING THE CASE FOR HIS INNOCENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.116" end="00:00:58.859">FOR INSTANCE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER BERNARD HENRI LEVY, LOOK IT UP, PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:02.596">THAT&apos;S HOW IT IS PRONOUNCED,--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.596" end="00:01:07.734">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE HAS WRITTEN IN AN ESSAY, QUOTE, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SATURDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.734" end="00:01:11.839">BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW HOW A CHAMBER MADE COULD HAVE WALKED IN ALONE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.839" end="00:01:15.943">CONTRARY TO THE HABITUAL PRACTICE OF MOST OF NEW YORK&apos;S HOTELS OF SENDING A </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.943" end="00:01:20.080">CLEANING BRIGADE OF TWO PEOPLE INTO THE ROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:23.417">THAT&apos;S YOUR GOTCHA?</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.417" end="00:01:25.786">EVERYONE KNOWS MADES COME IN PAIRS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.786" end="00:01:28.121">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:28.121" end="00:01:33.627">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND BY THE WAY, ONLY THE FRENCH WOULD REFER TO TWO MADES AS A BRIGADE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.627" end="00:01:36.496">(LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.496" end="00:01:41.935">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THAT&apos;S JUST JUST-- INTERESTING, LITTLE KNOWN FACT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.935" end="00:01:48.375">IN WORLD WAR II GERMANY&apos;S ORIGINAL CONQUERING FORCE THROUGH PARIS WAS ACTUALLY </p>
<p begin="00:01:48.375" end="00:01:49.543">JUST A CLEANING CREW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.543" end="00:01:51.245">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.245" end="00:01:57.551">&gt;&gt; Jon: ACROSS THE RHINE AND INTO PARIS, NOTHING MORE THAN A PUSH BROOM AND DECORATIVE SOAPS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.551" end="00:02:02.556">LOOK, ALL RIGHT, THREE NAMED FRENCH GUYS A HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.556" end="00:02:07.961">BUT STRAUSS-KAHN HAS A SECOND DEFENDER WITH EQUALLY AIRTIGHT REASONING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.961" end="00:02:14.101">&gt;&gt; FORMER NIXON SPEECHWRITER BEN STEIN IS MAKING EXCUSES FOR THE GUY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.101" end="00:02:16.136">&gt;&gt; Jon: BEN STEIN?</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.136" end="00:02:18.705">FROM WIN BEN STEIN&apos;S MONEY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.705" end="00:02:19.940">FERRIS BUELLER?</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:22.743">THE COMMERCIALS FOR BEACH BALL MOISTURIZER?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.743" end="00:02:28.515">&gt;&gt; STEIN WRITES PROSECUTORS SAY THAT MR. STRAUSS-KAHN FORCED THE COMPLAINANT TO </p>
<p begin="00:02:28.515" end="00:02:31.251">HAVE ORAL AND OTHER SEX WITH HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.251" end="00:02:33.620">HOW DID HE HAVE A GUN?</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.620" end="00:02:35.322">DID HE HAVE A KNIFE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.322" end="00:02:42.162">HE&apos;S A SHORT, FAT, OLD MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.162" end="00:02:48.602">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES K HE&apos;S NOT MERELY IN THE KIND OF RAPING SHAPE HE USED TO BE IN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.602" end="00:02:56.410">I MEAN 15 YEARS AGO THIS GUY WAS A RAPING MACHINE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:00.080">THAT IS A TERRIBLE DEFENSE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:01.448">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.448" end="00:03:02.182">&gt;&gt; Jon: GOT SOMETHING WORSE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.182" end="00:03:10.958">&gt;&gt; AND CAN ANYONE TELL ME ANY ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF VIOLENT SEX CRIMES?</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.958" end="00:03:14.361">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:14.361" end="00:03:17.064">&gt;&gt; Jon: ANYONE, ANYONE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.064" end="00:03:20.400">ANYONE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:23.103">BUMER-- BUHLER?</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.103" end="00:03:25.506">BUHLER?</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.506" end="00:03:31.678">SO NOT BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY ECONOMISTS WHO HAVE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED PEOPLE IS EVIDENCE OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.678" end="00:03:32.312">STRAUSS-KAHN&apos;S EVIDENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.312" end="00:03:36.216">OF COURSE THAT WOULD MEAN ON THE FLIP SIDE A LAUNDRY LIST OF ECONOMISTS WHO COMMITTED </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.216" end="00:03:39.453">SECT ALL CRIMES WOULD BE IPSO FACTO EVIDENCE OF HIS GILL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.453" end="00:03:43.090">IF IT PLEASES THE COURT,</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.090" end="00:03:49.363">RICHARD NYWANGA ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN STRAUSSBERG UNIVERSITY CONVICTED OF SECTION ASSAULT, ROBERT </p>

<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:12.152">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:04:12.152" end="00:04:18.292">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL A CORDING TO MY DATA, ECONOMISTS ARE THE RAPIEST PROFESSION GOING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.292" end="00:04:21.061">IT TURNS DOURBT -- (APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:04:21.061" end="00:04:26.533">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET IS VERY </p>
<p begin="00:04:26.533" end="00:04:28.502">[BLEEP] TOUCHY-FEELY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.502" end="00:04:36.310">SO I REALLY HOPE-- IT IS A REDISTRIBUTION OF RAPE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.310" end="00:04:41.481">I HOPE YOU HAVE SOMETHING BEYOND COME ON, ECONOMISTS DON&apos;T DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.481" end="00:04:45.085">BESIDES, YOU&apos;VE BARELY EVEN DEGRADED THE VICTIM YET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.085" end="00:04:52.359">&gt;&gt; HE GOES ON TO WRITE I&apos;VE HAD HOTEL MADES THAT WERE COMPLETE LUNATICS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.359" end="00:04:54.094">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THERE YOU GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:55.429">A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.429" end="00:05:01.802">THE NEXT TIME YOU STAY IN A HOTEL, I URGE YOU, SIR, IF YOU GET TURN DOWN SERVICE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.802" end="00:05:06.039">DO NOT EAT THAT CHOCOLATE THEY LEAVE FOR YOU ON THE PILLOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.039" end="00:05:07.040">WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK.</p>
