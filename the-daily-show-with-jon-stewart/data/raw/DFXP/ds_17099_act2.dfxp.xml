<p begin="00:00:41.475" end="00:00:47.581">&gt;&gt; THIS BILL CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT THAT AN EMPLOYER CAN&apos;T FIRE AN EMPLOYEE IF </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.581" end="00:00:52.686">THEY OWN FIREARMS, IF THEY USE FIREARMS.</p>

<p begin="00:00:57.791" end="00:01:01.195">THEY WOULDN&apos;T HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE YOU FOR THAT REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.195" end="00:01:04.264">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, BUT AREN&apos;T GUN OWNERS ALREADY PROTECTED?</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.264" end="00:01:11.171">&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT SHOULD BE ABIDED BY AT ALL TIMES.</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.641" end="00:01:48.308">&gt;&gt; TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.308" end="00:01:51.345">I&apos;M NOT AWARE OF ANYBODY HAVING THAT PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.345" end="00:01:53.747">&gt;&gt; SINCE WHEN COULD YOU BE FIRED FOR HAVING A GUN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.747" end="00:01:55.449">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT&apos;S WHAT THE LAW,</p>
