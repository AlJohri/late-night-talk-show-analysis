<p begin="00:03:59.573" end="00:04:03.143">IT&apos;S MORE THE LOGISTICS OF WHAT HAPPENED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.143" end="00:04:06.647">IT WOULD BE LIKE JUST DESCRIBING OTHER THINGS THAT WAY, LIKE IN THE BIBLICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.647" end="00:04:11.451">YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH JESUS IS JUST NOT PUT HIM UP ON THE WOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.451" end="00:04:12.186">THAT WAS THE TROUBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.186" end="00:04:16.623">YOU KNOW, IT&apos;S MAYBE A CONTEXTUALIZING OF A HISTORICAL-- </p>

<p begin="00:04:42.950" end="00:04:46.486">HE THOUGHT THEY MUST HAVE GONE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.486" end="00:04:53.193">&quot;YEAH, CRUCIFIXION.&quot; &quot;I&apos;LL BE THERE.&quot; HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME.</p>
