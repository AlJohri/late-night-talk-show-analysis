<p begin="00:00:07.207" end="00:00:12.346">&gt;&gt; Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A FORMER AMBASSADOR AND U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY TO AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.346" end="00:00:17.084">HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE WARS OF AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.084" end="00:00:24.892">PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROBLEM PETER TOMSEN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.892" end="00:00:26.260">HAVE A SEAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.260" end="00:00:30.998">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.998" end="00:00:36.303">&gt;&gt; Jon: MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU IS SIMPLY THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.303" end="00:00:37.804">REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.804" end="00:00:41.909">(LAUGHTER) REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.909" end="00:00:45.913">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S PRETTY BIG.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.913" end="00:00:46.513">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.513" end="00:00:51.485">&gt;&gt; YEAH (LAUGHTER) DON&apos;T DROP IT ON YOUR TOE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.485" end="00:00:53.654">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.654" end="00:01:03.530">VOLUME 2, WHAT PERIOD OF WARS DOES THIS COVER AND HOW MUCH OF THE AMAZON IS NOW GONE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.530" end="00:01:06.900">(LAUGHTER) WHAT PERIOD OF WARS ARE WE DEALING WITH HER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:12.706">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY IT&apos;S SIX, TWO IN THE 19th CENTURY, ONE IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY, AND THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:12.706" end="00:01:16.210">REST WITH THE SOVIET INVASION AND AFTERWARDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:17.878">&gt;&gt; Jon: STARTING IN &apos;79.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.878" end="00:01:18.245">&gt;&gt; RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.245" end="00:01:23.984">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS SO ALLURINGLY INVADABLE ABOUT--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:01:23.984" end="00:01:27.154">&gt;&gt; Jon: AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT TO DO IT THEY DON&apos;T HAVE OIL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.154" end="00:01:31.225">THEY DON&apos;T APPEAR TO HAVE MINERAL WEALTH, ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY&apos;VE RECENTLY </p>
<p begin="00:01:31.225" end="00:01:31.959">DISCOVERED THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.959" end="00:01:39.466">THEY APPEAR TO JUST HAVE A TIGHTLY KNIT GROUP OF TRIBES WHO DON&apos;T CARE FOR BEING INVADED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.466" end="00:01:40.133">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.133" end="00:01:43.203">AND IN OUR CASE WE CALLED IT AN INTERVENTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.203" end="00:01:46.940">SOME CALL IT AN INVASION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.940" end="00:01:53.113">THE BIG, THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT AFGHANISTAN IS THE HIGHLAND OF YOUR ASIA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.113" end="00:01:58.585">IF YOU GET CONTROL OF THE HIGHLAND, SPEAKING ABOUT THE OUTER RING OF GREAT POWERS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.585" end="00:02:03.056">THEN YOU HAVE ADVANTAGE OVER YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OVER YOUR OPPONENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.056" end="00:02:06.059">&gt;&gt; Jon: BACK WHEN BOILING OIL WAS THE MAIN WEAPON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:07.761">BUT--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:07.761" end="00:02:12.199">&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES REALLY BEING ABOVE YOUR ENEMIES IN 29 1st CENTURY, DO WE REALLY THINK </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.199" end="00:02:14.234">I&apos;M ABOVE PAKISTAN, I WIN,</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.234" end="00:02:14.968">YOU KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.968" end="00:02:18.071">IS THAT STILL REALLY STRATEGICALLY SO VITAL?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:19.072">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.072" end="00:02:22.142">AND YOU ALSO DENY IT TO YOUR OTHER ENEMIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.142" end="00:02:26.914">I MEAN IF YOU CAN CONTROL THE HIGHLAND OR YOU CONTROL AFGHANISTAN, THEN YOU CAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.914" end="00:02:30.083">MAKE IT UNAVAILABLE TO OTHER ENEMIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.083" end="00:02:31.852">AND THE CASE OF PAKISTAN,</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.852" end="00:02:38.592">THEY WANTED TO CONTROL THE HIGHLAND IN ORDER TO EXPORT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AROUND THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.592" end="00:02:42.095">&gt;&gt; Jon: CAN&apos;T DOW THAT ON A FLAT SURFACE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.095" end="00:02:45.098">&gt;&gt; NO I THINK YOU NEED MOUNTAINS, YOU NEED CAVES,</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.098" end="00:02:47.835">YOU NEED PLACES TO HIDE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.835" end="00:02:54.107">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF PAKISTAN-- NOW WE HAD THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN ON AND HE ASSURED </p>
<p begin="00:02:54.107" end="00:02:56.109">ME THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ANY OF THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.109" end="00:03:00.280">SO I DON&apos;T KNOW IF IN YOUR RESEARCH YOU CAME ACROSS ANYTHING ON THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.280" end="00:03:05.919">BUT PAKISTAN IS, COULD HE BE TELLING THE TRUTH THAT PAKISTAN WAS UNAWARE OF THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.919" end="00:03:08.155">ARE THEY PLAYING A CONSCIOUS DOUBLE GAME?</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.155" end="00:03:13.460">IS THERE A GROUP WITHIN PAKISTAN THAT&apos;S SUBVERTING A LARGER GROUP IN PAKISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.460" end="00:03:13.961">WHAT&apos;S HAPPENING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.961" end="00:03:14.228">&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.228" end="00:03:18.332">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&apos;S COMING FROM THE PAKISTANI ARMY WHICH ACTUALLY DOMINATES THE STATE </p>
<p begin="00:03:18.332" end="00:03:19.333">OF PAKISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.333" end="00:03:25.639">THAT&apos;S BEEN TRUE SINCE THEY HANGED THE PRIME MINISTER IN 1977 AND TOOK OVER EITHER </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.639" end="00:03:30.544">DIRECTLY DURING THE DICTATOR DICTATORSHIPS OR THROUGH CIVILIAN GOVERNMENTS, NONE </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.544" end="00:03:33.213">OF WHICH SERVED OUT THEIR TERM, UP UNTIL NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.213" end="00:03:35.649">THE MILITARY HAS DOMINATED AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.649" end="00:03:42.789">AND IT&apos;S THE MILITARY THROUGH THE ISI WHICH IS AS PRESIDENT MUSH AR AV SAID,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.789" end="00:03:46.193">ISI FOLLOWS ORDERS, PART OF THE COMMAND STRUCTURE AND THEY DO WHAT THE CHIEF OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:46.193" end="00:03:52.299">THE ARMY STAFF IE PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF, WHEN HE WAS ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF AND DICTATOR,</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.299" end="00:03:54.001">TELL THEM TO DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.001" end="00:03:59.840">SO IT&apos;S NOT ROGUE OUTFITS WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, IT&apos;S ACTUALLY </p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:03.877">A POLICY, A STRATEGY OF THE-- .</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.877" end="00:04:04.912">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.912" end="00:04:10.050">WHEN YOU SAY EXPORT EXTREMIST INTO AFGHANISTAN WHAT IS THEIR STRATEGIC </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.050" end="00:04:14.188">ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT DOESN&apos;T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT IS EASILY CONTROLLABLE AND IT </p>
<p begin="00:04:14.188" end="00:04:16.456">GETS IT THAT AREA INVADED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.456" end="00:04:21.295">&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY THERE&apos;S-- THERE&apos;S TWO AREAS OF ADVANTAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.295" end="00:04:24.064">ONE THE DOMESTIC IN PAKISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.064" end="00:04:30.070">THE MILITARY IS ABLE TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE PAKISTANI STATE AND KEEP THE SECULAR </p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:32.206">DEMOCRATIC PARTIES OUT OF POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.206" end="00:04:36.109">THE SECOND IS TO KEEP A LARGE MILITARY BUDGET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.109" end="00:04:42.783">THE MILITARY SINCE THEY TOOK OVER HAS GOBBLED UP OVER 50% OF THE MILITARY OF THE TOTAL BUDGET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.783" end="00:04:46.186">THAT MEANT EDUCATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS GONE DOWNHILL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.186" end="00:04:48.922">AND FINALLY THERE IS-- .</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.922" end="00:04:50.290">&gt;&gt; Jon: SORRY, YOU SAID TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:51.291">YOU SAID TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.291" end="00:04:53.327">&gt;&gt; OH, SORRY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.327" end="00:04:55.095">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CAN&apos;T-- NO, TWO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.095" end="00:04:56.396">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.396" end="00:04:57.431">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS THE THIRD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.431" end="00:04:58.799">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.799" end="00:04:59.333">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.333" end="00:05:05.272">&gt;&gt; THE THIRD ONE IS ACTUALLY IT&apos;S FOUR--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.272" end="00:05:09.510">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CAN GIVE ME FOUR FOUR-- BUREAUCRACY LET&apos;S HAVE FOUR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:12.479">&gt;&gt; WELL, OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.217">DEFENSIVE TO BUILD DEFENSIVE SORT OF DEPTH AGAINST INDIA,</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.217" end="00:05:22.055">HINDU INDIA, ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS DEFENSIVE DEPTH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.055" end="00:05:29.663">AND OFFENSIVE IN TERMS OF SORT OF SOWING THE SEEDS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM WITH PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:05:29.663" end="00:05:33.967">LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN WHO WAS PROTECTED BY THE MILITARY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.967" end="00:05:37.304">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IS THIS THE GRAND BARGAIN SAUDI ARABIA HAD MADE AND FOUND OUT DID </p>
<p begin="00:05:37.304" end="00:05:38.672">NOT WORK THAT WELL FOR THEM,</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.672" end="00:05:44.511">WHICH IS IF WE TRY AND CONSOLE THE MILITANTS AND GIVE THEM CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY WANT AS A GRAND </p>
<p begin="00:05:44.511" end="00:05:46.213">BARGAIN TO KEEP AWAY FROM US,</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.213" end="00:05:51.652">IS THAT WHAT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO DO OR IS IT THAT THEY ALSO BELIEVE IN THE SAME GOALS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.652" end="00:05:54.388">&gt;&gt; THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THE SAME GOALS BUT THEY DON&apos;T,</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.388" end="00:05:56.790">THEY TURN AGAINST THEIR MASTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.790" end="00:05:57.791">IT&apos;S LIKE SNAKES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.791" end="00:06:00.494">YOU CAN&apos;T TRAIN SNAKES WHOM NOT TO BITE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.494" end="00:06:06.633">AND THE SNAKES STARTED BITING SAUDI ARABIA AND THE BOMBS STARTED GOING OFF IN SAUDI ARABIA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.633" end="00:06:10.771">AND THE MONARCHY DIDN&apos;T LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO STAY IN POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.771" end="00:06:17.578">NOW THE PAKISTANI TALIBAN WHO IN THE EYES OF PAKISTAN ARE ARE THE BAD -- </p>
<p begin="00:06:17.578" end="00:06:20.614">EXTREMISTS, THEY HAVE TURNED AGAINST THE PAKISTANI STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.614" end="00:06:26.787">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THERE ARE EVEN A SPECTRUM EVEN WITHIN THE EXTREMIST WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.787" end="00:06:29.489">&gt;&gt; JAKES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.489" end="00:06:33.227">&gt;&gt; YEAH JRZ I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEY CAN BE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.227" end="00:06:35.929">THE WARS OF AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.929" end="00:06:37.631">IT&apos;S ON BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.631" end="00:06:41.735">OR YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT INTO A BOOK SHELF.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.735" end="00:06:42.536">IT PETER TOMSEN.</p>
