<p begin="00:00:00.968" end="00:00:02.035">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.035" end="00:00:04.805">THE LABOR UNREST IN WISCONSIN,</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.805" end="00:00:08.876">ITS EFFECTS GO FAR BEYOND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS PAUL RYAN REMINDS US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.876" end="00:00:12.646">&gt;&gt; PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR WAY BUT WE HAVE TO GET THIS DEFICIT AND DEBT </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.646" end="00:00:17.684">UNDER CONTROL IN MADISON IF WE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD BUSINESS CLIMATE AND JOB CREATION IN WISCONSIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.684" end="00:00:24.992">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES BECAUSE IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT MAKES A WELCOMING CLIMATE, IT&apos;S WISCONSIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.992" end="00:00:26.159">BUT HE MAKES A GOOD POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.159" end="00:00:31.098">THIS COUNTRY MUST MAKE CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT WE DO BUSINESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.098" end="00:00:35.102">IF WE ARE TO APPEAL MORE TO CORPORATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.102" end="00:00:46.513">SO AMERICAN WORK FORCE, MEET ME AT CAMERA 3.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.513" end="00:00:48.849">HOW ARE YOU DOING?</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.849" end="00:00:49.383">DOING GOOD?</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.383" end="00:00:50.484">YOU&apos;RE A LITTLE ANGRY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.484" end="00:00:50.984">AREN&apos;T YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.984" end="00:00:52.219">YOU&apos;RE A LITTLE ANGRY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.219" end="00:00:54.788">YOU DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND WHY CORPORATIONS DON&apos;T LOOK AT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.788" end="00:00:57.791">THE SAME WAY THEY DID IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.791" end="00:01:03.830">BEFORE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ALLOWED YOU TO LIMIT WHEN AND WHERE THEY COULD LOOK AT YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.830" end="00:01:08.702">YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE MAKING THE SACRIFICES NECESSARY TO RAISE A MIDDLE CLASS TOGETHER </p>
<p begin="00:01:08.702" end="00:01:15.709">WITH A CORPORATION BUT WHILE YOU WERE HOME ON WEEKENDS OR FEDERALLY MANDATED HOLIDAYS OR </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.709" end="00:01:25.052">HAVING YOUR DENTAL WORK, YOUR CORPORATION WAS OFF BANGING MEXICO, INDIA OR CHINA&apos;S INDUSTRIES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.052" end="00:01:27.354">AND NOW YOU WANT &apos;EM BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.354" end="00:01:30.657">WELL IT&apos;S NOT LIKE HE HASN&apos;T BEEN TELLING YOU WHAT TURNS HIM ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.657" end="00:01:33.894">&gt;&gt; I WOULD ARGUE THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL TAX CUTS WE NEED TO MAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.894" end="00:01:39.800">WHEN WE&apos;RE DEALING WITH A 35% TAX ON BUSINESS WHEN THE WORLD AVERAGE IS 18%, WE&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.800" end="00:01:41.435">INCREASINGLY UNCOMPETITIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.435" end="00:01:47.541">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO WANTS 35 WHEN THEY CAN GET 18?</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.541" end="00:01:54.681">LIKE ANY RED BLOODED AMERICAN COMPANY, HE WANTS A CORPORATE TAX RATE THAT IS BARELY LEGAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.681" end="00:01:59.786">AND BELIEVE ME, HE COULD GET THAT IN CAMBODIA, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.786" end="00:02:01.522">THAT&apos;S JUST FOR STARTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.522" end="00:02:05.359">IN THE OLD DAYS AMERICAN WORKER, YOU WERE WILD AND EXCITING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.359" end="00:02:10.163">YOU WOULD DO IT ALL NIGHT AND ALL DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK IN EVERY ROOM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.163" end="00:02:14.001">EVEN THE ONES WITH NO FIRE EXITS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.001" end="00:02:19.573">BUT NOW WHEN HE ROLLS OVER AND HE ANNOUNCES HE WANTS TO START DRILLING YOU&apos;RE ALL, OH, NO,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.573" end="00:02:20.707">MISTER, NOT HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.707" end="00:02:22.676">NOT WITHOUT PROTECTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.676" end="00:02:28.015">&gt;&gt; DOCUMENTS DESCRIBE BAD WIRING AND A LEAK IN THE SO- CALLED BLOW-OUT PREVENTER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.015" end="00:02:32.119">EVEN A DEAD BATTERY MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN IT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.119" end="00:02:34.621">MEMBERS SAY THIS PROVES THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE REGULATION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.621" end="00:02:43.263">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT WHEN I WEAR A BLOW- OUT PREVENTER, I BARELY FEEL LIKE I&apos;M DRILLING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.263" end="00:02:46.233">AND THE CONSTANT NAGGING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.233" end="00:02:50.270">&gt;&gt; CORPORATIONS LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES WILL NOT SELF REGULATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.270" end="00:02:52.139">BP, WALL STREET ARE ALL EXAMPLES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.139" end="00:02:54.141">&gt;&gt; Jon: LEAVE WALL STREET ALONE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.141" end="00:02:55.909">THEN THEY RUIN THE ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.909" end="00:03:00.047">LEAVE THE OIL COMPANIES ALONE AND THEN THEY RUIN THE GULF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.047" end="00:03:03.050">YOU CAN&apos;T TRUST THE CORPORATIONS TO POLICE THEMSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:05.385">&gt;&gt; Jon: INDIA AND CHINA UNDERSTAND CORPORATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.385" end="00:03:08.388">INDIA AND CHINA LET THEM BE THEMSELVES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.388" end="00:03:14.328">THE CORPORATION WANTS TO COME HOME LATE AND GO WAKE THE KIDS UP BECAUSE IT&apos;S TIME FOR THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:03:14.328" end="00:03:17.264">SHIFT, THAT&apos;S COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.264" end="00:03:18.966">THEY JUST WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.966" end="00:03:25.572">LOOK, YOU KNEW THEY WERE SOCIOPATHS WHEN HE MARRIED THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.572" end="00:03:30.444">NOT THAT THERE HAVEN&apos;T BEEN HINTS AT WHAT YOU MIGHT DO TO CREATE A MORE WELCOME </p>
<p begin="00:03:30.444" end="00:03:31.111">CORPORATE ATMOSPHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.111" end="00:03:33.881">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S TIME FOR UNIONS TO STEP FORWARD AND TAKE A CUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.881" end="00:03:43.056">IF WE DON&apos;T CUT THE SIZE OF THE PAYROLL OR CUT SALARIES HERE, WE CAN&apos;T AFFORD THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.056" end="00:03:46.693">SERVICES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.693" end="00:03:51.498">&gt;&gt; THE AVERAGE TEACHER SALARY IN WISCONSIN, HERE IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.498" end="00:03:51.965">$51,121.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.965" end="00:03:54.001">THAT&apos;S JUST SALARIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.001" end="00:03:59.907">&gt;&gt; Jon: PRETTY NICE, PROFESSOR TRUMP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.907" end="00:04:02.075">SO, AMERICAN WORKERS, SLIM DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.075" end="00:04:04.044">WORK MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.044" end="00:04:05.712">FOR LESS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.712" end="00:04:06.680">(BEEP) CONDITIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:11.084">I&apos;M NOT TALKING HALF PAY SATURDAYS AND PARTIAL DENTAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.084" end="00:04:15.455">OH, THE CORPORATIONS ARE SAYING YOU&apos;RE LOOKING GOOD AND THEY REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.455" end="00:04:20.627">BUT THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU WANT FIRST WORLD CORPORATIONS TO THINK YOU&apos;RE ATTRACTIVE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.627" end="00:04:22.996">YOU&apos;RE GOING TO NEED A THIRD WORLD MAKEOVER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.996" end="00:04:27.401">THIS FAMILY DOES YOUR JOB FOR 70 PESOS A WEEK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.401" end="00:04:31.004">IF YOU REALLY WANT CORPORATIONS BACK AND YOU REALLY MEAN IT, NEXT YEAR&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:04:31.004" end="00:04:35.275">CHRISTMAS CARD COULD BE A REALITY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.275" end="00:04:37.477">BUT YOU&apos;VE GOT TO WANT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.477" end="00:04:38.645">WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK.</p>
