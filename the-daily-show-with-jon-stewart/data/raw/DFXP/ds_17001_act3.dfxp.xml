<p begin="00:00:03.637" end="00:00:08.842">MY NEXT TONIGHT PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST HIS NEW BOOK WHICH HE CO-AUTHORED IS </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.842" end="00:00:13.547">CALLED &quot;THAT USED TO BE US: HOW AMERICAN FELL BEHIND IN A WORLD IT INVENTED AND HOW WE </p>
<p begin="00:00:13.547" end="00:00:18.485">CAN COME BACK.&quot; PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM THOMAS FRIEDMAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.485" end="00:00:26.293">(  <span tts:fontStyle="italic">CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )</span> &quot;THAT USED TO BE US.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:26.293" end="00:00:29.530">THERE IS A WISTFUL QUALITY TO THAT TITLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.530" end="00:00:31.932">YOU SENSE A MID-LIFE CRISIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.932" end="00:00:39.072">YOU SENSE PEOPLE OF GIRTH SITTING ON A STOOP WATCHING YOUNG PEOPLE DANCE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.072" end="00:00:44.778">&gt;&gt; JON, IT DOES... IT&apos;S A FORWARD LOOKING BOOK WITH A BACKWARD LOOKING TITLE FOR A REASON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.778" end="00:00:49.383">THE ARGUMENT OF THE BOOK IS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.383" end="00:00:51.585">IT GOES BACK TO HAMILTON AND LINCOLN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.585" end="00:00:57.524">IT WAS BASICS BASICALLY BUILT ON EDUCATING OUR PEOPLE UP TO AND BEYOND WHATEVER THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:57.524" end="00:01:00.894">TECHNOLOGY WAS, HAVING THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE, HAVING THE BEST IMMIGRATION POLICY </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.894" end="00:01:07.334">THAT ATTRACTED ENERGETIC AND INTELLIGENT IMMIGRANTS, HAVING THE BEST RULES FOR CAPITAL </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.334" end="00:01:10.904">INVESTING AND PREVENTING RECKLESSNESS AND HAVING THE MOST GOVERNMENT-FUNDED RESEARCH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.904" end="00:01:15.809">AS YOU LOOK AT OUR HISTORY THAT&apos;S WHAT ACTUALLY GOT US HERE THAT FORMULA FOR SUCCESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.809" end="00:01:19.246">THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS IS WE&apos;VE GOTTEN AWAY FROM THAT FORMULA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.246" end="00:01:24.151">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK THOUGH THAT WE ALSO AT THAT TIME HAD A FRONTIER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.151" end="00:01:26.119">WHICH INCREASES OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.119" end="00:01:32.659">WE HAD NOT NECESSARILY COLONIES BUT WE HAD A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURAL RESOURCES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.659" end="00:01:34.494">THAN WE HAVE NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.494" end="00:01:40.267">ARE WE A VICTIM TO SOME EXTENT TOO OF NO FRONTIER AND THE FACT THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.267" end="00:01:43.136">NOT AS BEAUTIFULLY EXPLOITABLE AS WE USED TO FIND THEM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.136" end="00:01:45.105">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THAT&apos;S PART OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.105" end="00:01:50.444">OF IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT&apos;S HAPPENED IN THE WORLD SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR THERE </p>
<p begin="00:01:50.444" end="00:01:52.813">WOULD ALWAYS BE RELATIVE DECLINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.813" end="00:01:53.881">CHINA AND INDIA ROSE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.881" end="00:01:56.116">WE&apos;LL BE RELATIVE TO THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.116" end="00:01:57.951">THE CONCERN IS IS WE DON&apos;T HAVE ABSOLUTE DECLINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.951" end="00:01:59.419">I MEAN, I THINK, YOU KNOW,</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.419" end="00:02:00.854">WHAT IS THE FRONTIER GOING FORWARD?</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.854" end="00:02:04.057">WHAT IS OUR VISION FOR THE COUNTRY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.057" end="00:02:09.563">WE WOULD LIKE AMERICA TO BE TO THE WORLD WHAT CAPE CANAVERAL TO AMERICANS IN THE &apos;60s.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.563" end="00:02:11.298">THAT&apos;S WHERE WE DID OUR ONE MOON SHOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.298" end="00:02:16.069">I THINK AMERICA&apos;S FUTURE IS BEING THE LAUNCHING PAD WHERE EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WOULD </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.069" end="00:02:18.071">WOULD WANT TO COME TO START SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:19.640">THAT&apos;S OUR NEW PLACE IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.640" end="00:02:23.744">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT WE COLONIZE MARS BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHAT I&apos;M HEARING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.744" end="00:02:25.579">&gt;&gt; IF THEY&apos;LL COME AND START SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.579" end="00:02:27.848">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN YOU SAIL IT SHOULD BE THE PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY COMES TO START </p>
<p begin="00:02:27.848" end="00:02:35.088">SOMETHING, WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL THOUGH BECAUSE HOW DO YOU ENTICE, FORGET ABOUT STARTING SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.088" end="00:02:37.925">WE JUST WANT TO BE THE COUNTRY THAT WE CAN MAKE STUFF WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.925" end="00:02:40.460">I THINK WE STILL INNOVATE TO A LARGE EXTENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.460" end="00:02:49.236">WHEN WE INNOVATE THOSE PRODUCTS ARE MADE ELSEWHERE BECAUSE OUR WORKERS LIKE TO HAVE FOOD AND....</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.236" end="00:02:51.104">&gt;&gt; FOOD AND PENSION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.104" end="00:02:52.139">IT&apos;S INTERESTING, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.139" end="00:02:56.109">ONLY LAST YEAR DID CHINA ACTUALLY OVERTAKE AMERICA AS THE WORLD&apos;S BIGGEST </p>
<p begin="00:02:56.109" end="00:03:01.648">MANUFACTURER IN TERMS OF VALUE OF GOODS PRODUCED SO WE ARE TRYING TO ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE </p>
<p begin="00:03:01.648" end="00:03:03.817">IN TERMS OF VALUE THE SAME AMOUNT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.817" end="00:03:07.821">THEY DO IT WITH LIKE 100 MILLION PEOPLE AND WE DO IT WITH 11 MILLION PEOPLE BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.821" end="00:03:10.190">WE STILL FOCUS ONED ADVANCED MANUFACTURING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:12.860">THAT&apos;S WHERE THE BEST JOBS ULTIMATELY ARE GOING TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.860" end="00:03:14.628">YOU TOUCHED ON WHAT IS IS A CHALLENGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.628" end="00:03:19.499">I DON&apos;T THINK ANYONE HAS THE ANSWER YET WHICH IS YES WE DO LAUNCH INNOVATION HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.499" end="00:03:24.738">HOW DO WE MAKE MORE OF IT HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.738" end="00:03:26.173">WITHOUT A BLUE COLLAR SECTOR YOU CAN&apos;T HAVE A MIDDLE CLASS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.173" end="00:03:27.674">THAT&apos;S THE BIG TRANSITION WE&apos;RE STRUGGLING WITH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.674" end="00:03:32.112">HOW DO MORE OF THESE PEOPLE ENTER A SERVICE ECONOMY AND STILL HAVE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.112" end="00:03:33.514">AND MIDDLE CLASS WAGES?</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.514" end="00:03:38.085">WE HAVE A CHAPTER IN THE BOOK CALLED AVERAGE IS OVER WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT THAT STRUGGLE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.085" end="00:03:40.087">I LIVE IN D.C. NEXT TO BALTIMORE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.087" end="00:03:44.591">50 YEARS AGO THE BIGGEST COMPANY IN BALTIMORE WAS BETHLEHEM STEEL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.591" end="00:03:45.792">YOU COULD GET A JOB THERE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.792" end="00:03:47.394">JOIN THE UNION, BUY A HOUSE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.394" end="00:03:51.098">GET A MORTGAGE, RAISE TWO KIDS AND RETIRE AND LEAD A VERY GOOD MIDDLE CLASS LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.098" end="00:03:54.968">THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN BALTIMORE TODAY IS JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.968" end="00:03:58.372">THEY DON&apos;T LET YOU CUT THE GRASS THERE WITHOUT A B.A..</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.372" end="00:03:59.106">&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.106" end="00:04:02.075">&gt;&gt; THAT HAS MOVED UP EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.075" end="00:04:03.343">THAT&apos;S I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.343" end="00:04:10.250">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW NICE IS THEIR GRASS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, I MEAN, WITH A B.A.,.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.250" end="00:04:11.518">&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU COULD DO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.518" end="00:04:14.054">&gt;&gt; Jon: EACH BLADE INDIVIDUALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.054" end="00:04:16.490">&gt;&gt; THE SMARTEST GRASS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.490" end="00:04:20.928">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW, ANY COUNTRY OF THIS SIZE IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT THAT QUICKLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.928" end="00:04:24.231">WE&apos;RE IN A DIFFICULT PLACE BECAUSE WE&apos;RE PLURALISTIC.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.231" end="00:04:28.135">WE&apos;RE THE ONLY EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU DON&apos;T HAVE THAT NATIONAL IDENTITY OTHER THAN </p>
<p begin="00:04:28.135" end="00:04:30.938">LIKE YOU SAY AN ASPIRATIONAL ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.938" end="00:04:32.206">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S A HUGE ADVANTAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.206" end="00:04:35.075">BECAUSE IN THIS WORLD WE CAN...</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.075" end="00:04:36.510">SO MANY THINGS ARE MADE NOW,</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.510" end="00:04:36.877">JON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.877" end="00:04:40.380">IT&apos;S NOT MADE IN AMERICA, MADE IN CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.380" end="00:04:41.782">THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.782" end="00:04:43.884">IT&apos;S MADE IN THE WORLD SO PART OF IT IS DONE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.884" end="00:04:44.952">PART OF IT IS DONE THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.952" end="00:04:50.924">AS LONG AS WE ARE PART OF THAT CHAIN AND HOPEFULLY AT THE HIGHER END, THE MORE </p>
<p begin="00:04:50.924" end="00:04:54.094">INNOVATIVE END, THEN THERE WILL BE WORK FOR THE BUTCHER,</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:55.929">THE BAKER AND THE CANDLESTICK MAKER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.929" end="00:05:00.601">IF WE&apos;RE NOT PART OF THAT INNOVATIVE SIDE OF THE EQUATION WE&apos;RE GOING TO LOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.601" end="00:05:01.768">THAT&apos;S THE BIG CHALLENGE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.768" end="00:05:07.541">&gt;&gt; Jon: AT THE RISK OF THAT STRATIFICATION YOU GET A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF SUPER RICH AND </p>
<p begin="00:05:07.541" end="00:05:10.611">THEN JUST A LARGER UNWASHED STRUGGLING GROUP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.611" end="00:05:12.279">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S REALLY WHAT YOU&apos;RE SEEING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.279" end="00:05:16.316">THE LABOR MARKET GETS TOTALLY STRATIFIED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.316" end="00:05:18.919">WHAT DIGITIZATION, AUTOMATION,</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.919" end="00:05:22.389">OUTSOURCING DO IS IT COLLAPSES ALL THOSE MIDDLE JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.389" end="00:05:25.492">THERE ARE SO MANY SERVICE JOBS THAT HAVE COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.492" end="00:05:27.160">AND THE QUESTION REALLY IS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.160" end="00:05:32.733">HOW DO YOU GET EVERYONE TO BE STARTING SOMETHING, SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE&apos;S LIVES MORE </p>
<p begin="00:05:32.733" end="00:05:34.201">HEALTHY, SECURE, COMFORTABLE,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.201" end="00:05:36.770">MORE PRODUCTIVE OR MORE ENTERTAINING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.770" end="00:05:38.739">BUT WE ALL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.739" end="00:05:41.575">EVERYONE IS ABOVE AVERAGE AT SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.575" end="00:05:45.979">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU MORPHED INTO SHARI LEWIS THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.979" end="00:05:52.853">I QUESTION THE... I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT COLOR IS YOUR PARACHUTE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.853" end="00:05:53.487">I&apos;M (BEEP) OLD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.487" end="00:05:56.523">THAT USED TO BE US IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.523" end="00:05:58.091">THOMAS FRIEDMAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.091" end="00:05:58.926">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JON.</p>
