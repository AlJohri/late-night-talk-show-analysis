<p begin="00:01:34.628" end="00:01:40.000">IS YOUR ABILITY TO DICTATE WHAT SIDE OF THE ROAD PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DRIVING ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.804">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S TRUE BUT IF YOU NOTICE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.938" end="00:02:26.480">THEY ACTUALLY WHETHER THE THESE INCREDIBLE CARS THAT THEY THEN YOU DON&apos;T KNOW HOW </p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:28.448">THEY STUCK IT ON A RACE CAR,</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.448" end="00:02:33.353">BUT THEY HAD TWO RACE CAR DRIVERS DRIVING OUR HOVER CAR THAT WAS ON TOP OF A RACE CAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.353" end="00:02:36.757">ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.757" end="00:02:39.560">&gt;&gt; Jon: MI SEEMS SOMEWHAT INEFFICIENT.</p>

<p begin="00:02:55.375" end="00:02:57.110">&gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS LIKE 40 OF THOSE THINGS OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:03:05.185">&gt;&gt; SO A LOT OF THE ONES AROUND US THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE THAT WERE PRACTICAL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.185" end="00:03:09.056">WE&apos;RE GOING 60 MILES AN HOUR DOWN AN OLD UNUSED AIRSTRIP.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.056" end="00:03:10.691">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHERE IS THIS AIRSTRIP.</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.229" end="00:03:22.603">SO YOU ARE ACTUALLY MOVING YOU&apos;RE DRIVING AROUND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.603" end="00:03:25.372">&gt;&gt; WHICH IS WHY WE CAN HIT EACH OTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.372" end="00:03:27.774">THE RACE CARS ARE WERE COMPLETELY FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.774" end="00:03:28.775">IT WAS TER FIING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.775" end="00:03:30.477">I EXPECTED TO GO FLYING OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.477" end="00:03:33.614">SOMETIMES THE DOOR WOULDN&apos;T CLOSE, THE SEAT BELT WOULD BREAK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.614" end="00:03:35.315">JUST CROSSING YOUR FINGERS.</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.858" end="00:03:48.262">&gt;&gt; Jon: DID THE RACE CAR GUYS EVER LET YOU DRIVE YOUR RACE CARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.262" end="00:03:50.998">&gt;&gt; NO, WE DIDN&apos;T GET TO DRIVE THEIR RACE CARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.998" end="00:03:52.699">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEN YOU HAVE FAILED US.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.699" end="00:03:54.101">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M SORRY, SHOULD I GO.</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.353" end="00:04:16.623">&gt;&gt; Jon: A WOMAN&apos;S HEAD COMES OFF AND IT&apos;S A BOMB.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.623" end="00:04:18.058">FOR GOD&apos;S SAKE.</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.939" end="00:04:36.076">THIS ONE DOESN&apos;T TAKE PLACE ON MARS, IT TAKES PLACE LIKE THE WAY IT WAS IN THE BOOK.</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.089" end="00:04:52.259">IT IS TAKEN FROM THE SOURCE MATERIAL MORE THAN ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.259" end="00:04:54.294">&gt;&gt; Jon: AN COLIN FARRELL IS SHORTER.</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.311" end="00:05:46.680">SO I JUST SIT QUIETLY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.680" end="00:05:49.082">&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS KIND OF WONDERFUL, I GUESS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.082" end="00:05:50.083">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNTIL MORNING.</p>
