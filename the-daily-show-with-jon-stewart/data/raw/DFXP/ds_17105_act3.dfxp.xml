<p begin="00:02:40.761" end="00:02:45.866">YOU&apos;VE WORKED AS A TV NEWSMAN FOR A LONG TIME, SO THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A STRANGE QUESTION-- </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.866" end="00:02:54.341">HAS TELEVISION BEEN A BOON TO PEOPLE&apos;S KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION ABOUT POLITICS OR HAS IT NOT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.341" end="00:02:57.678">WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLY ABOUT HOW TELEVISION CHANGED THE GAME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.678" end="00:02:58.145">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.145" end="00:03:03.584">&gt;&gt; Jon:  AT A CERTAIN POINT TSEEMED LIKE TELEVISION OUTSMARTED THE POLITICIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.584" end="00:03:05.352">HAS THAT REVERSED NOW?</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.352" end="00:03:06.320">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT HAS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.320" end="00:03:09.056">I THINK THE POLITICIANS HAVE OUTSMARTED TELEVISION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.056" end="00:03:13.126">OVERALL, I THINK TELEVISION HAS ADDED TO EVERYBODY&apos;S KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING, BUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:13.126" end="00:03:16.496">LIKE THE INTERNET, WHICH IS NOW DOMINANT IN NEWS OR SOON TO BE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.496" end="00:03:19.933">IT HAS ITS PLUSES AND MINUSES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.933" end="00:03:22.369">BUT EACH SUCCESSIVE PRESIDENCY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.369" end="00:03:27.207">FOR EXAMPLE, HAS GOTTEN SMARTER AND SMARTER ABOUT HOW TO MANIPULATE THE MEDIA, MANIPULATE </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.207" end="00:03:29.376">THE PRESS AND USE TELEVISION TOTS ADVANTAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.376" end="00:03:33.514">THERE IS ALSO THE TRIVIALIZATION OF THE NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.514" end="00:03:43.123">YOU WANT TO CALL THE POLITICALIZATIONES OF NEWS WITH SOME NETWORKS BEING PARTISAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:43.123" end="00:03:43.790">POLITICAL PROPAGANDA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.790" end="00:03:44.458">&gt;&gt; Jon:  REALLY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.458" end="00:03:49.763">I DON&apos;T PUBLICLY FOLLOW THE 24-HOUR NEWS NETWORKS BUT I UNDERSTAND THEY&apos;RE ALL ABOVE </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.763" end="00:03:56.370">ABOARD, AND I WOULDN&apos;T-- DOES IT, FOR YOU-- THIS IDEA OF LIBERAL BIAS AND THE IDEA-- YOU </p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:01.808">BE, IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, HAVEN&apos;T MOST JOURNALISTS, HAVEN&apos;T THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:04:01.808" end="00:04:03.610">POLITICS BEEN SOMEWHAT MORE LIBERAL?</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.610" end="00:04:05.913">&gt;&gt; NO, IT HASN&apos;T BEEN MY CHEERNS.</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.714" end="00:04:09.049">&gt;&gt; IT HASN&apos;T BEEN MY EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.049" end="00:04:11.084">MOST JOURNALISTS I GREW UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.084" end="00:04:16.957">MOST JOURNALISTS I WORKED WITH AND PRACTICED WITH WERE TRYING TO BE HONEST BROKERS OF INFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.957" end="00:04:22.896">WHAT SOMETIMES GOT YOU A REPUTATION OF LIBERAL,</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.896" end="00:04:27.301">JOURNALISTS FORM AN APPRENTICESHIP COVERING THE POLICE BEAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.301" end="00:04:32.372">THE JOURNALISTS, THE BEST OF THEN, SEE A KEYNESIAN SIDE OF SOCIETY THAT MOST PEOPLE DON&apos;T SEE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.372" end="00:04:35.843">SO WHEN THEY TRY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THAT, PEOPLE WHO </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.843" end="00:04:41.348">DON&apos;T LIKE IT, SAY, &quot;OH, YOU&apos;RE LIBERALS.&quot; IT HAS NOT BEEN MY EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.348" end="00:04:48.088">I KNOW IT&apos;S WIDELY BELIEVED THAT CBS, NBC, ABCS, CHOCK FULL OF LIBERALS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.088" end="00:04:49.089">NOT TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.089" end="00:04:55.095">WHAT IT&apos;S CHOCK FULL OF IS PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GIVE HONEST NEWS, STRAIGHTFORWARD NEWS, AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:55.095" end="00:04:56.697">VOTED BOTH WAYS IN MANY ELECTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.697" end="00:05:02.836">I&apos;M NOT SAYING THAT NOBODY IN THE NEWSROOM WAS LIBERAL ANY MORE THAN I WOULD SAY NOBODY WAS CONSERVATIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.836" end="00:05:05.572">PEOPLE DESCRIBED AS CONSERVATIVES WANT TO SAY, &quot;I WORK AT CBS NEWS, AND ALMOST </p>
<p begin="00:05:05.572" end="00:05:10.143">EVERY THERE WAS LIBERAL.&quot; WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN IS NOT EVERYBODY THERE AGREED WITH HIM </p>
<p begin="00:05:10.143" end="00:05:10.744">ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.744" end="00:05:11.612">THIS IS A SHAM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.612" end="00:05:13.480">IT&apos;S A CAMOUFLAGE -- </p>
<p begin="00:05:13.480" end="00:05:17.184">&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE, THAT WORKING THE REPS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.184" end="00:05:18.619">THAT&apos;S WHAT I WOULD SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.619" end="00:05:19.853">IT&apos;S REALLY WORKED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.853" end="00:05:25.859">PEOPLE ARE NOW VERY AFRAID TO APPEAR IN ANY WAY AS THOUGH THEY&apos;RE TAKING A POSITION ON ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.859" end="00:05:26.527">&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT&apos;S TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.527" end="00:05:28.829">AND THAT&apos;S WHY I SAY JOURNALISM,</p>
