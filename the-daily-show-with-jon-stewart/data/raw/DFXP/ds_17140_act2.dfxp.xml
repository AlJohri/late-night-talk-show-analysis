<p begin="00:00:06.874" end="00:00:12.412">NOW THAT CHICK FLAY HAS PROVED THAT WEARING YOUR BELIEFS ON YOUR CORPORATE SLEEVE CAN SEND </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.412" end="00:00:17.251">YOUR SALES THROUGH THE ROOF WE NOW EXPECT OTHERS TO TAKE OUT OTHER IDEOLOGICAL TERRITORY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.251" end="00:00:22.189">&gt;&gt; THE C.E.O. OF PAPA JOHN&apos;S SAID &quot;IN 2013 OUR BEST ESTIMATE </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.189" end="00:00:26.627">IS THAT THE OBAMACARE WILL COST ABOUT 11 TO 14 CENTS PER PIZZA.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:26.627" end="00:00:28.028">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT THE... WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.028" end="00:00:34.201">I&apos;M GOING TO PAY AN EXTRA 11 TO 14 CENT SO THE GUY WHO MAKES MY PIZZA CAN GET ANTIBIOTICS TO </p>
<p begin="00:00:34.201" end="00:00:37.404">KEEP HIM FROM HANGING UP LUNG TISSUE ON TO MY PIZZA?</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.404" end="00:00:37.838">OUTRAGEOUS!</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.838" end="00:00:39.907">(AUDIENCE REACTS) SOMETHING TELLS ME I&apos;M NOT ALONE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.907" end="00:00:42.409">&gt;&gt; IF YOU LIKE PIZZA GET READY TO COUGH UP MORE DOUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.409" end="00:00:45.512">&gt;&gt; WILL OBAMACARE MAKE YOUR PIZZA MORE EXPENSIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.512" end="00:00:48.682">&gt;&gt; YOU WILL SOON HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR YOUR PIZZA!</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.682" end="00:00:50.417">AND YOU HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA TO THANK FOR THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.417" end="00:00:51.652">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.652" end="00:00:56.423">I THINK WE CAN ABSORB THAT 11 TO 14 CENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.423" end="00:01:00.928">CONSIDERING YOU CAN&apos;T TURN ON THE T.V. WITHOUT BEING OFFERED TWO PIZZAS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.928" end="00:01:06.700">AND IF YOU CALL RIGHT NOW CRAZY BREAD, A TWO LITER SODA AND A THIRD PIZZA MADE OUT OF OREOS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.700" end="00:01:08.769">(LAUGHTER) SEEMS TO BE THE CHEAPEST FOOD PRODUCT ON THE PLANET.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.769" end="00:01:13.140">OF COURSE, IT&apos;S NOT ABOUT THE 11 CENTS, IT&apos;S ABOUT A LARGE HERB ISSUE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:17.411">&gt;&gt; OBAMACARE IS DRIVING THE PRICE OF PIZZA THROUGH YOUR ROOF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.411" end="00:01:22.249">SOCIALISM SURBGS!</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.249" end="00:01:22.683">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.683" end="00:01:27.321">&gt;&gt; Jon: UNDER SOCIALISM HEALTH CARE WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE AND NOT PRIVATE </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.321" end="00:01:34.528">BUSINESSES WHICH I&apos;M SURE YOUR COLLEAGUE BOB BECKEL WHO IS A LIBERAL WILL POINT OUT TO YOU </p>

<p begin="00:01:36.830" end="00:01:37.731">SHUT THE LID!</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.731" end="00:01:42.669">THAT IS NOT RIGHT!</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.669" end="00:01:44.705">(LAUGHTER) YOU ARE HYPNOTIZING HIM!</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.705" end="00:01:47.508">THAT IS NOT FAIR!</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.508" end="00:01:52.446">ALL RIGHT, FINE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.446" end="00:01:54.448">THAT IS A SNEAKY ARGUMENT MOVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.448" end="00:01:56.116">I GUESS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE THEIR POINT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.116" end="00:01:59.353">WE MUST END OBAMACARE TO SAVE OUR PIZZA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.353" end="00:02:01.388">JUST ONE THING, I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY A STUPID QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.388" end="00:02:05.592">ARE THERE ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD ALSO DRIVE UP THE COST OF PIZZA?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.592" end="00:02:09.596">&gt;&gt; 64% OF THE U.S. IS NOW IN SOME FORM OF DROUGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.596" end="00:02:09.897">64%.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.897" end="00:02:13.200">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S FEAR THAT FOOD-- THINGS LIKE DAIRY, MEAT PRICES,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:16.737">EVEN THE PRICE OF PIZZA COULD SKYROCKET.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.737" end="00:02:21.708">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, RIGHT, THIS SUMMER&apos;S CROP-KILLING MILK SCORCHING DROUGHT OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.708" end="00:02:24.845">COME TO THINK OF IT THAT MIGHT ALSO BE AFFECTING THE PRICE OF PIZZA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.845" end="00:02:29.349">NOT TO MENTION THE FUTURE OF THE PLANET BUT LET&apos;S FOCUS ON THE PIZZA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.349" end="00:02:31.084">SUMMER&apos;S ALMOST OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.084" end="00:02:32.819">THAT WILL SOLVE THE HEAT WAVE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:33.153">RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.153" end="00:02:37.191">&gt;&gt; THERE IS A CONNECTION TO THESE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS THAT WE&apos;VE BEEN SEEING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.191" end="00:02:41.495">&gt;&gt; THEY ARE, IN FACT, A PRODUCT OF GLOBAL WARMING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.495" end="00:02:45.999">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT DO YOU KNOW NASA SCIENTIST?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.999" end="00:02:49.903">(LAUGHTER) THAT&apos;S JUST A SCIENTIFIC FACT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.903" end="00:02:57.110">ONE THAT HAPPENS TO BE CONFIRMED BY A RECENT STUDY FUNDED BY CLIMATE-DENYING PETROCHEMICAL BILLIONAIRES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.110" end="00:03:00.814">SO AS UPSET AS THE RIGHT GOT OVER OBAMACARE&apos;S EFFECT ON THEIR </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.814" end="00:03:03.750">PIZZA I CAN&apos;T IMAGINE HOW WIGGED OUT THEY&apos;LL BE ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:07.087">&gt;&gt; OUR GOVERNMENT SPENDING OVER $10.6 MILLION OF YOUR TAXES ON </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.087" end="00:03:12.960">CLIMATE RESEARCH TO INCREASE ALL THIS SPENDING ON COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING ON THE HUNCH IT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.960" end="00:03:13.360">MAN MADE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:18.465">&gt;&gt; TRYING TO REDESIGN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AS WELL AS FOREIGN POLICY ON THE BASIS OF A </p>
<p begin="00:03:18.465" end="00:03:21.535">THEORY THAT PROVED TO BE GROUNDED IN LITTLE MORE THAN HYSTERIA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.535" end="00:03:22.169">&gt;&gt; THIS IS SURPRISING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.169" end="00:03:25.539">I HAVEN&apos;T HEARD ON THE OTHER CHANNELS THAT SOME OF THE GLACIERS ARE GETTING BIGGER BUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:25.539" end="00:03:28.842">THAT&apos;S WHY PEOPLE WATCH FOX.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.842" end="00:03:31.245">(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.245" end="00:03:33.614">&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, THAT&apos;S WHY THEY WATCH FOX.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.614" end="00:03:42.189">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE IT&apos;S SO MUCH EASIER THAN LITERALLY STICKING UP YOUR HEAD </p>
<p begin="00:03:42.189" end="00:03:44.658">UP YOUR OWN ASS TO SHUT OUT REALITY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.658" end="00:03:48.662">SO PIZZA COSTS MORE BUT IN RETURN EVEN GETS HEALTH INSURANCE, OUTRAGEOUS!</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.662" end="00:03:54.935">BUT IF IT COSTS MORE BECAUSE HUMAN ACTIVITY IS BURNING OUR PLANET TO AN UNINHABITABLE HUSK,</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.935" end="00:03:56.236">OH, WHAT THE (BLEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.236" end="00:03:58.772">(LAUGHTER) RIGHT?</p>
