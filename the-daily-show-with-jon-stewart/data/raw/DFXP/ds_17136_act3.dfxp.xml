<p begin="00:01:06.800" end="00:01:11.071">&gt;&gt; WHEN I LEFT AFGHANISTAN I WAS SO YOUNG I DIDN&apos;T EVEN REALIZE I </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.071" end="00:01:12.906">WAS WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.906" end="00:01:19.847">WRITING THIS BOOK WAS IN N A WAY GOING BACK AND RELIVING YOUR CHILDHOOD AND IF IT WASN&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:01:19.847" end="00:01:23.550">FOR... FUN THE FIRST TIME IT WASN&apos;T THE SECOND TIME WHEN YOU&apos;RE WRITING AS AN ADULT BUT </p>
<p begin="00:01:23.550" end="00:01:30.357">AS I WROTE IT I REALIZED HOW COMMON IT WAS AND THAT BECAME HARDER BECAUSE I GOT LUCKY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.357" end="00:01:36.096">I WAS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE THE FAMILY THAT I DID AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS IN THE FAMILY, THEY </p>

<p begin="00:01:44.505" end="00:01:45.105">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.105" end="00:01:54.581">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND SO... AND YOU LIVED... DESCRIBE THE LIVING ARRANGEMENT FOR THE FOLKS WHO </p>

<p begin="00:01:57.951" end="00:02:05.092">&gt;&gt; THE LIVING ARRANGEMENT WAS BASICALLY A BIG BUILDING WHICH IS CALLED... THE LITERAL MEANING </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.092" end="00:02:10.230">IS CASTLE AND BASICALLY THE WALLS ARE EIGHT FEET TALL AND YOU&apos;RE STUCK IN THE WALLS AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.230" end="00:02:13.300">YOU DON&apos;T COME OUTSIDE... AS A FEMALE YOU DON&apos;T COME OUTSIDE </p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:17.437">THOSE WALLS AND YOU LEAVE THAT HOUSE WHEN YOU ARE A BRIDE, GROW TO YOUR HUSBAND&apos;S CASTLE AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:17.437" end="00:02:27.814">YOU&apos;RE IN THOSE WALLS AND YOU LEAVE THAT WHEN YOU DIE AS A DEAD BODY TO GO TO THE CEMETERY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.814" end="00:02:32.119">FOR ME TO COME OUT OF THOSE WALLS A LOT HAD TO HAPPEN AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MADE IT </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.119" end="00:02:36.423">POSSIBLE IS THE RUSSIAN INVASION BECAUSE IT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR MY FAMILY TO LEAVE THAT CASTLE </p>
<p begin="00:02:36.423" end="00:02:37.357">AND GO TO PAKISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.357" end="00:02:43.130">ONCE YOU GO TO PAKISTAN YOU START THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN, THAT... SINCE </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.130" end="00:02:47.100">COMING TO AMERICA AND THAT BECAME A POSSIBILITY AND THAT ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE MY </p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:51.572">GRANDFATHER, HE REFUSED TO LET THE BOYS IN MY FAMILY COME TO AMERICA WITHOUT THE GIRLS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.572" end="00:02:54.241">AND THAT&apos;S WHY I&apos;M SITTING HERE TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.241" end="00:03:03.083">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THIS IS... IT&apos;S VERY UNUSUAL IN MANY RESPECTS YOUR GRANDFATHER OR YOUR BABA </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.083" end="00:03:06.153">WHO IS A MULLAH, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.153" end="00:03:08.856">&gt;&gt; HE WAS THE VILLAGE ELDER,</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.856" end="00:03:09.122">YES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.122" end="00:03:10.457">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE VILLAGE ELDER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.457" end="00:03:12.659">HE HAD VERY PROGRESSIVE VALUES WHEN IT CAME TO WOMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.659" end="00:03:19.333">YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR FRIEND WHOSE FAMILY WAS NOT THAT WAY AND SHE HAD AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE AT A </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.333" end="00:03:22.903">VERY YOUNG AGE, HER BROTHERS BEAT HER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.903" end="00:03:28.075">HOW DID YOU COPE WITH KNOWING YOUR FRIEND IS DEALING WITH THAT AND YOU&apos;RE IN THIS OTHER SITUATION?</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.075" end="00:03:28.876">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF GUILT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.876" end="00:03:30.577">THERE WAS A LOT OF GUILT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.577" end="00:03:35.716">I&apos;M LIVING WITH THAT GUILT TODAY, TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.716" end="00:03:39.353">IT&apos;S VERY HARD FOR ME TO ENJOY NORMAL DAY LIFE IN AMERICA BECAUSE I KNOW MY FRIEND, MY </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.353" end="00:03:45.826">BEST FRIEND, IS IN AFGHANISTAN AND SHE LOOKS 30 YEARS OLDER THAN I DO AND IT MAKES ME VERY </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.826" end="00:03:49.696">SAD BECAUSE SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON AND HER BROTHER USED TO BEAT HER UP AND MY BROTHER WOULD </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.696" end="00:03:53.700">TEASE ME AND SAY &quot;YOU BETTER WATCH OUT OR I&apos;M GOING TO BEAT YOU UP, TOO.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.700" end="00:03:58.906">AND I WOULD TELL HIM YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF MY GRANDFATHER AND MY MOTHER </p>
<p begin="00:03:58.906" end="00:04:04.444">AND THE REASON MY GRANDFATHER WAS THAT WAY WAS BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS TAKEN BY THE K.G.B.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.444" end="00:04:08.582">AGENT HE MADE MY GRANDFATHER PROMISE TO MAKE SURE HIS DAUGHTER WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL </p>
<p begin="00:04:08.582" end="00:04:11.485">AS HIS SON DID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.485" end="00:04:12.619">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT WAS INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.619" end="00:04:19.293">YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY UNUSUAL GUY AND WAS TAKEN BY THE RUSSIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.293" end="00:04:23.931">THERE&apos;S A TRADITION WHEN THEY SAY THE MALE CHILD IS BORN THEY SHOOT OFF GUNS BUT WHEN YOU WERE </p>
<p begin="00:04:23.931" end="00:04:25.299">BORN YOUR FATHER DID THE SAME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.299" end="00:04:26.834">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.834" end="00:04:30.871">&gt;&gt; AND HIS FRIENDS SAID ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU DON&apos;T DO THAT FOR A DAUGHTER?</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.871" end="00:04:31.972">WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.972" end="00:04:35.475">AND HE SAID &quot;MY DAUGHTER&apos;S GOING TO BE BETTER THAN MANY SONS AND </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.475" end="00:04:39.680">SHE&apos;S GOING TO DO A LOT MORE FOR SOME PEOPLE.&quot; WHICH WAS HIS OWN PURPOSE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:45.619">AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE WAS TAKEN BY K.G.B. BECAUSE HE WAS A BIG ACTIVIST FOR PASHTUN </p>
<p begin="00:04:45.619" end="00:04:50.757">AND HE DIDN&apos;T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO COME AND INTERFERE WITH PASHTUN CULTURE AND TRADITION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.757" end="00:04:54.394">SO HE SAID THAT AND A N A LOT OF WAYS THAT&apos;S WHAT MOTIVATES ME </p>
<p begin="00:04:54.394" end="00:05:01.935">AND THAT&apos;S WHAT MOTIVATED KNOW WRITE THE BOOK BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT </p>
<p begin="00:05:01.935" end="00:05:02.469">CHANGED MY LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.469" end="00:05:06.707">IF HE HADN&apos;T SAID THAT I WOULD BE SITTING IN A VILLAGE AND I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA THAT YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:05:06.707" end="00:05:07.908">SHOW EXISTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.908" end="00:05:08.308">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.308" end="00:05:11.578">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND WOULDN&apos;T THAT BE THE REAL TRAGEDY HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.578" end="00:05:12.045">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:05:12.045" end="00:05:12.779">&gt;&gt; TOTALLY!tQ3 </p>
<p begin="00:05:12.779" end="00:05:17.050">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU... THERE&apos;S SO MANY FRIGHTENING MOMENTS IN THE BOOK </p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:20.187">WHERE YOU DODGED DEATH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.187" end="00:05:25.559">YOU HAVE THE STORY OF BEING HIT BY A BUS AND IN A COMA.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.559" end="00:05:27.127">NOBODY THOUGHT YOU WOULD SURVIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.127" end="00:05:35.903">THE BOMBING OF THAT KHALA WHEN THE RUSSIANS BOMBED IT AND YOU EMERGED FROM THE RUBBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.903" end="00:05:37.504">&gt;&gt; I WAS SLEEPING INNING THE ROOM, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.504" end="00:05:41.408">I WAS SLEEPING IN THE ROOM AND THE BOMB DROPPED AND IT DIDN&apos;T EXPLODE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.408" end="00:05:46.346">IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I GUESS I WASN&apos;T MEANT TO GO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.346" end="00:05:50.984">IT DIDN&apos;T EXPLODE, IT MADE THE WALLS CRUSH DOWN ON ONE SIDE SO I WALKED OUT ALL DUSTY AND MY </p>
<p begin="00:05:50.984" end="00:05:56.356">MOTHER WAS REALLY SHOCKED AND SHE SAID &quot;I DIDN&apos;T KNOW YOU WERE SLEEPING THERE.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:05:56.356" end="00:06:01.895">I WAS LIKE I KNOW, THAT&apos;S HOW CHILDREN IN AFGHANISTAN�r ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.895" end="00:06:08.602">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE BEAUTIFUL WAY YOU ARE ABLE TO SMILE AND FIND LITTLE MOMENTS OF HUMOR WITHIN </p>
<p begin="00:06:08.602" end="00:06:10.904">THIS BOOK IS JUST WONDERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.904" end="00:06:12.239">IT&apos;S WONDERFUL TO READ.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.239" end="00:06:18.045">THE PASHTUN ELEMENT OF SILT INTERESTING BECAUSE I KEPT WONDERING, PEOPLE DON&apos;T IDENTIFY </p>
<p begin="00:06:18.045" end="00:06:19.613">AS AFGHANS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.613" end="00:06:21.582">THEY IDENTIFY MORE TRIBALLY,</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.582" end="00:06:23.684">PASHTUN BEING ABOUT 40% OF AFGHANISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.684" end="00:06:27.788">&gt;&gt; MORE THAN 40%.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.788" end="00:06:31.058">AND IF YOU GO INTO THE VILLAGES IT&apos;S 100% PASHTUN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.058" end="00:06:35.896">IF YOU GO INTO KABUL YOU HAVE MORE NON-PASHTUN THERE IS BECAUSE THEY GRAVITATE TOWARDS </p>
<p begin="00:06:35.896" end="00:06:39.867">THE CENTRAL COUNTRY WHICH IS BASICALLY KABUL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.867" end="00:06:42.703">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THAT WOULD BE THE CITIES, PASHTUN ARE MORE..</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.703" end="00:06:44.571">&gt;&gt; THE VILLAGES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.571" end="00:06:48.575">THE VILLAGES ARE MORE PASHTUN AND THAT&apos;S WHERE I SPEND MOST OF </p>
<p begin="00:06:48.575" end="00:06:52.579">MY TIME BECAUSE THAT&apos;S WHERE MY FAMILY IS FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.579" end="00:06:58.886">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW THE PASHTUN CULTURE SEEMS TO MEAN EVERYTHING TO THEM AND THERE ARE VERY, VERY </p>
<p begin="00:06:58.886" end="00:07:00.654">IMPORTANT RULES OF PASHTUN CULTURE.</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.829" end="00:07:11.899">THERE ARE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THESE RULES.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.899" end="00:07:18.438">IF I DO SOMETHING THAT WAS AGAINST ONE OF THE RULES BEFORE I GET HOME MY FAMILY WOULD KNOW </p>

<p begin="00:07:37.524" end="00:07:41.195">&gt;&gt; AND I DIDN&apos;T SPEAK ENOUGH ENGLISH TO TELL THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.195" end="00:07:44.064">TO SAY &quot;PLEASE DON&apos;T TELL MY UNCLE.</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.481" end="00:08:03.150">WHERE DID YOU FEEL A PART OF?</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:07.921">&gt;&gt; I GOT A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES IN YOUR HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.921" end="00:08:10.724">A LOT OF TIMES I FELT VERY CONFLICTED.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.724" end="00:08:12.559">I LOVED THE SOLDIERS, THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.559" end="00:08:17.564">I LOVED THEM BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE GIVING UP A LOT.</p>
