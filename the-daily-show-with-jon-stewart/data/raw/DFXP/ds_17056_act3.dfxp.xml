<p begin="00:00:18.018" end="00:00:25.025">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.326" end="00:00:28.529">&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:30.631">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED &quot;THE BLACK BANNER.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:00:30.631" end="00:00:36.403">NOW WE&apos;RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT... I WANT TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT&apos;S HAPPENING TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.403" end="00:00:41.408">TEN YEARS AGO THE IDEA WAS THE NEW THREAT IS STATE...</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.408" end="00:00:42.109">NONSTATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.109" end="00:00:48.415">IT APPEARS NOW WE&apos;RE ENTERING A PHASE WHEN IRAN AND SYRIA AND </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.415" end="00:00:53.754">ISRAEL ARE ABOUT TO... I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THE TECHNICAL TERM IS IN COUNTERTERRORISM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.754" end="00:00:54.154">THROW DOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.154" end="00:01:00.627">(LAUGHTER) ARE YOU GETTING THE SENSE AS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT WHAT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.627" end="00:01:02.062">HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IN THESE PLACES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.062" end="00:01:03.363">&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.363" end="00:01:08.535">IT SEEMS THAT IRAN IS NOW USING NON-STATE ACTORS TO, AGAIN,</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.535" end="00:01:12.639">THROW OUT THE POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND IN THE REGION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.639" end="00:01:17.711">JUST TODAY, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON TWO ISRAELI DIPLOMATS, ONE IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:17.711" end="00:01:19.179">GEORGIA AND ONE IN INDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.179" end="00:01:27.087">AND THAT COMES ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE TERRORIST LEADER FROM HAZARD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.087" end="00:01:29.656">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT ALSO...</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.656" end="00:01:30.657">&gt;&gt; HEZBOLLAH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.657" end="00:01:33.427">&gt;&gt; Jon: IRANIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN TARGETED AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.427" end="00:01:35.896">IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS JOCKEYING IN THIS PROXY WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.896" end="00:01:36.697">&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.697" end="00:01:40.834">AND THERE&apos;S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT POSSIBLY THE ISRAELIS ARE BEHIND THE ATTACK </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.834" end="00:01:44.104">ON THE SCIENTISTS BUT THE SITUATION IS WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:46.707">THERE&apos;S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES HAPPENING INSIDE IRAN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.707" end="00:01:49.610">IRAN IS NOT A MONOLITHIC SOCIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.610" end="00:01:54.381">YES IT&apos;S KNOWN TO BE A PERSIAN CHAUVINISTIC SOCIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.381" end="00:01:56.316">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE SAID THAT, I DIDN&apos;T THEY!</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.316" end="00:01:57.117">HE SAID THAT!</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.117" end="00:01:59.820">I WAS JUST SITTING HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:01.154">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:01.154" end="00:02:03.657">&gt;&gt; ABOUT 61% OF THE IRANIANS ARE PERSIANS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.657" end="00:02:11.965">BUT THERE&apos;S UP TO SOME NUMBERS PUT THEM AT 40% THAT ARE TURKIC PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.965" end="00:02:16.803">AND HISTORICALLY THE PERSIANS AND THE TURKS DON&apos;T LIKE EACH OTHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.803" end="00:02:24.444">ALSO YOU HAVE THE ARAB MINORITY AND ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO OPPOSE THE PERSIAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.444" end="00:02:27.181">DOMINATION OF IRAN.�r </p>
<p begin="00:02:27.181" end="00:02:33.453">&gt;&gt; THE AS JANUARYIAN, THE TURKISH PEOPLE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT IRAN </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.453" end="00:02:35.656">AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE THE TWO BIG PLAYERS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.656" end="00:02:41.428">WHAT&apos;S TURKEY&apos;S ROLE IN ALL OF THIS AND IS IRAN NERVOUS ABOUT YOU ARE THE ECONOMY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.428" end="00:02:49.303">I WOULD THINK THAT THE AZERBAIJANIAN POPULATION WOULD HAVE SYMPATHY TOWARD TURKEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.303" end="00:02:51.705">&gt;&gt; WE SEE AN INCREASED ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.705" end="00:02:55.642">WE SEE IN THE SYRIA, WE SEE IN THE CENTRAL ASIA AND THAT&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.642" end="00:03:03.116">WHAT&apos;S SCARING IRAN BECAUSE IRAN IS SURROUNDED WITH MANY DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.116" end="00:03:08.255">MOST OF THEM ARE TURKIC AND ANY RISE IN ETHNIC NATIONALISM IN CENTRAL ASIA IS GOING TO BE </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.255" end="00:03:13.861">CONSIDERED AS A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO IRANIAN INFLUENCE IN THE REGION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.861" end="00:03:17.664">FOR EXAMPLE AZERBAIJAN IS MOSTLY SHI&apos;A.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.664" end="00:03:18.532">SHI&apos;A MUSLIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.532" end="00:03:20.133">IRAN IS 90% SEE YA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.133" end="00:03:23.337">IRAN CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE THE PROTECTORS OF SHI&apos;A AROUND THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.337" end="00:03:28.976">THERE IS A WAR THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE &apos;90s BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN,</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.976" end="00:03:34.181">SHI&apos;A MUSLIM COUNTRY, NEIGHBOR OF IRAN AND BETWEEN ARMENIA, AN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN COUNTRY OVER </p>
<p begin="00:03:34.181" end="00:03:38.085">A REGION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.085" end="00:03:44.358">DURING THAT WAR IRAN SUPPORTED ARMENIA AGAINST SHIITE AZERBAIJAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.358" end="00:03:45.826">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.826" end="00:03:52.432">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE, AGAIN 40,% OF THE IRANIAN POPULATION ARE ARAB AND IN CASE OF AZERBAIJAN WINNING A </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.432" end="00:04:00.440">WAR AND AZERBAIJAN IS A TURKIC COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY THEY </p>
<p begin="00:04:00.440" end="00:04:03.210">FEEL THEY&apos;RE GOING TO BE SURROUNDED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.210" end="00:04:05.045">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DID THIS WAR GET SNUCK BY US?</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.045" end="00:04:09.082">I DON&apos;T REMEMBER THIS WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.082" end="00:04:12.953">DO THEY NOT TELL US ABOUT WARS UNLESS WE&apos;RE DOING THE BOMBING?</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.953" end="00:04:14.521">DO WE NOT HEAR ABOUT THESE OTHER WARS?</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.521" end="00:04:18.392">&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS REGION WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.392" end="00:04:21.328">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.328" end="00:04:24.064">WHEN YOU SAID THAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY GOD GUESS THERE YOU BUT I DIDN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.064" end="00:04:24.665">I HELD BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.665" end="00:04:28.836">THE SITUATION IN SYRIA NOW IS WHAT&apos;S PERPLEXING ME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.836" end="00:04:35.442">IF THE U.N. CAN&apos;T FORMULATE A RESOLUTION TO CONDEMN WHAT&apos;S HAPPENING IN SYRIA, IS... THEN </p>
<p begin="00:04:35.442" end="00:04:40.347">THEY ARE BASICALLY... IT&apos;S LIKE NOT FORMULATE AGO RESOLUTION THAT CAPE UPTON IS KIND OF HOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.347" end="00:04:42.082">(LAUGHTER) IT&apos;S OBVIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.082" end="00:04:48.088">HOW DID CHINA AND... HOW DID THAT...</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.088" end="00:04:48.555">&gt;&gt; RUSSIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.555" end="00:04:50.991">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DID CHINA AND RUSSIA BLOCK THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.991" end="00:04:52.526">AND WHY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.526" end="00:04:58.232">&gt;&gt; WELL RUSSIA HAS HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.232" end="00:05:02.703">NOT JUST WITH BASHAR ASSAD BUT ALSO HIS FATHER HAFEZ.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.703" end="00:05:07.908">AND CHINA HAS BEEN RUSSIA&apos;S TOOL LET&apos;S CALL IT, IN THE MIDDLE EAST.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.908" end="00:05:15.582">BUT THE INTERESTING PART IS THE ROLE OF CHINA AND WHY CHINA DID THE VETO AND RUSSIA IS ALREADY </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.582" end="00:05:16.517">DOING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.517" end="00:05:20.821">CHINA NEVER DID VETOES BEFORE EXCEPT IF IT&apos;S CONNECTED TO THEIR OWN BACKYARD, LIKE NORTH </p>
<p begin="00:05:20.821" end="00:05:25.325">KOREA, FOR EXAMPLE.�� SO I THINK CHINA WAS SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:25.325" end="00:05:27.961">SITUATION IN SYRIA IS PART OF THEIR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.961" end="00:05:33.500">AND THE REASON IT&apos;S PART OF THEIR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST IS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.500" end="00:05:34.935">AGAIN, ROLE T ROLE OF TURKEY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.935" end="00:05:38.338">REMEMBER, TURKEY IS A NATO COUNTRY AND RUSSIA IS SURROUNDED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.338" end="00:05:42.576">RUSSIA IS ALREADY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF NATO IN EASTERN EUROPE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.576" end="00:05:49.750">SO NOW WE SEE TURKEY&apos;S INFLUENCE IN THE REGION COMING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF ETHNIC </p>
<p begin="00:05:49.750" end="00:05:52.653">NATIONALISM PROBABLY COMING IN COUNTRIES LIKE AZERBAIJAN,</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.653" end="00:05:54.254">COUNTRIES LIKE UZBEKISTAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.254" end="00:05:56.990">&gt;&gt; Jon: I CAN SEE RUSSIA BUT CHINA AS WELL?</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.990" end="00:05:59.526">&gt;&gt; CHINA HAS A LOT OF UIGHUR POPULATIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.526" end="00:06:05.232">THE MUSLIM POPULATION IN CHINA THAT&apos;S OPPOSING AND THEY WANT THEIR OWN... THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.232" end="00:06:07.100">THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO TURKIC PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.100" end="00:06:10.804">AND YOU&apos;RE DEALING WITH AN AREA....</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.804" end="00:06:11.271">&gt;&gt; Jon: TURKEY!</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.271" end="00:06:15.576">(LAUGHTER) SO THAT&apos;S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.576" end="00:06:17.044">IT&apos;S THE NEW POWER STRUGGLE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.044" end="00:06:19.146">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.146" end="00:06:26.119">AND RUSSIA IS... SORRY, TURKEY IS A NATO COUNTRY SO RUSSIA AND CHINA AND THERE&apos;S A LOT OF </p>
<p begin="00:06:26.119" end="00:06:32.726">RESOURCES IN CENTRAL ASIA AND IF PROBLEMS START HAPPENING AMONG TURKIC ETHNIC PEOPLE IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:32.726" end="00:06:35.495">REGION IT MIGHT, AFFECT THE INFLUENCE OF CHINA.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.495" end="00:06:37.264">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.264" end="00:06:43.904">IT&apos;S INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND SOMETHING WE DON&apos;T HEAR THAT MUCH IN THE STATES BECAUSE ON </p>
<p begin="00:06:43.904" end="00:06:49.076">OUR MAGAZINES WE&apos;RE CONCERNED WITH IF PETS ARE GOOD COMPANIONS THAT KIND OF THING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.076" end="00:06:52.479">(LAUGHTER) &quot;THE BLACK BANNER&quot; IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:55.082">WILL YOU COME BACK AND KEEP THE DIALOGUE GOING?</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.082" end="00:06:56.283">WE&apos;D APPRECIATE IT.</p>
