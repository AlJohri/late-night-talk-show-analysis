<p begin="00:00:27.628" end="00:00:29.363">SO NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.363" end="00:00:30.163">AND YOU TOO.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.163" end="00:00:31.498">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.498" end="00:00:34.968">I WAS READING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.968" end="00:00:39.173">IT&apos;S SO NICE TO READ THE INTERVIEWS THAT ARE COMPILED IN THIS BECAUSE IT REMINDS YOU OF </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.173" end="00:00:45.913">JUST WHAT A GREAT VOICE YOU ARE ON TELEVISION, AND IT&apos;S, YOU KNOW, PARDON ME, AND I KNOW THAT </p>

<p begin="00:00:49.616" end="00:00:52.953">YOUR INTERVIEWS IS THEY PROVIDE CONTEXT BUT NOT AMNESTY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.953" end="00:01:00.060">THEY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO BRING OUT THE LAYERS OF A STORY, BUT NOT TO EXCUSE </p>
<p begin="00:01:00.060" end="00:01:06.767">ANYTHING ELSEMENT AND YOU MAY JUST NOD IF YOU WANT.</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.941" end="00:01:17.077">YOUR... WHAT&apos;S YOUR PREPARATION LIKE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.077" end="00:01:25.385">&gt;&gt; WELL, FIRST MY FOLKS AND I TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPORTANT AND THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.385" end="00:01:29.089">IMMEDIATE BECAUSE THE IMMEDIATE IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.089" end="00:01:32.993">AND WHO CAN SPEAK TO WHAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.993" end="00:01:39.199">WE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH, A LOT OF READING, A LOT OF TALKING AND ALL OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.199" end="00:01:40.234">YOU KNOW...</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.234" end="00:01:42.536">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.536" end="00:01:45.138">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M GOING TO PUT STAR BY THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.138" end="00:01:48.709">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T THINK YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS HERE ABOUT THE FIRST INTERVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.709" end="00:01:51.378">BECAUSE I&apos;M A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.378" end="00:01:58.385">THE FIRST INTERVIEW IN THIS BOOK IS WHO BUT YOU AND I HAVING A i&gt;M9YTHAT&apos;S FIRST ONE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.789" end="00:02:05.325">&gt;&gt; WELL, WE STARTED NOT NECESSARILY WITH THE SMARTEST,</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.325" end="00:02:06.894">BUT WITH THE MOST...</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.894" end="00:02:07.594">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.594" end="00:02:09.062">THANK YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.764" end="00:02:11.465">HE&apos;S RIGHTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.465" end="00:02:13.066">LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.066" end="00:02:18.505">WHEN YOU SAY &quot;THE MOST IMPORTANT,&quot; THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT IS MISSING FROM TODAY&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.505" end="00:02:24.411">JOURNALISM INTERVIEWS, A SENSE OF EDITORIAL AUTHORITY AND THE COURAGE TO EXERCISE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.411" end="00:02:26.446">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&apos;S YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.446" end="00:02:28.916">YOU HAVE TO BRING THAT TO BEAR ON YOUR CHOICES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.916" end="00:02:34.188">YOU HAVE TO DECIDE, THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS GOOD, IS WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT, AND THEN STAND BY IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.188" end="00:02:35.189">YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.189" end="00:02:39.426">YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT YOUR AUTHORITY IS CREDIBLE, THAT IT&apos;S JUSTIFIED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.426" end="00:02:40.561">I LEARNED A LOT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.561" end="00:02:42.229">I DON&apos;T FOLLOW SPORTS VERY MUCH,</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.229" end="00:02:46.266">BUT I LEARNED A LOT FROM THE GREAT ONE OF HOCKEY, WAYNE GRETZKY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.266" end="00:02:51.271">YOU REMEMBER THAT HE SAID HIS STRATEGY WAS ALWAYS TO GO WHERE THE PUCK WAS HEADING, NOT WHERE </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.271" end="00:02:53.440">IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:55.976">HE READ THE GAME, AS SOMEBODY SAID, IN MAGNIFICENT WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.976" end="00:03:00.380">AND THAT&apos;S WHAT WE JOURNALISTS SHOULD TRY TO DO, TRY TO SEE WHERE THE PUCK, THE NEWS, THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.380" end="00:03:02.282">EVENTS ARE GOING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.282" end="00:03:05.485">AND TO BE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENS SO WE CAN PUT IT IN CONTEXT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.485" end="00:03:12.192">AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU GAIN A CERTAIN AUTHORITY FROM BEING RIGHT MORE OFTEN THAN WRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.192" end="00:03:15.529">&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK JOURNALISM IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE IT&apos;S LOST THAT AUTHORITY, THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:15.529" end="00:03:17.064">WILL TO EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY,</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.064" end="00:03:19.967">THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE THAT AUTHORITY?</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.967" end="00:03:23.604">WHAT&apos;S... WHERE WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST LAPSE THAT YOU SEE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.604" end="00:03:26.940">&gt;&gt; I THINK WE&apos;RE LOST IN WHAT...</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.940" end="00:03:32.179">I BELIEVE IT WAS WHITMAN OR THOROUGH CALLED THE MERE SMOKE OF OPINION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.179" end="00:03:34.715">THE NEWS IS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP HITTING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.715" end="00:03:36.383">EVERYTHING ELSE IS PUBLICITY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.383" end="00:03:38.352">PEOPLE DON&apos;T WANT TO KEEP THEIR OPINIONS HIDDEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.352" end="00:03:40.721">THEY WANT TO KEEP THE FACTS HIDDEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.721" end="00:03:45.759">IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY, A LOT OF TIME, A LOT OF EFFORT TO EXPLORE THE FACTS AND BRING THEM OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.759" end="00:03:48.729">SO A LOT OF NEWS ORGANIZATIONS NO LONGER DO MUCH REPORTING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.729" end="00:03:50.397">THEY SIMPLY RELY ON OPINION,</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.397" end="00:03:53.433">TALK, ALL OF, THAT AND THAT UNDERMINES JOURNALISM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.433" end="00:03:57.671">THE OTHER THING IS WE ARE ABUSING OURSELVES TO DEATH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.671" end="00:03:59.373">IT&apos;S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT TODAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.373" end="00:04:01.875">JON JON I SHOULD JUST GO.</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.348" end="00:04:09.583">&gt;&gt; Jon:, NO NOT REALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.583" end="00:04:10.584">EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.584" end="00:04:13.520">&gt;&gt; THE REASON YOU&apos;RE FIRST IN THE BOOK IS PEOPLE SAID, WHY DO </p>
<p begin="00:04:13.520" end="00:04:14.788">YOU HAVE JON STEWART ON THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.788" end="00:04:18.158">YOU WERE FIRST ON MY SHOW WHEN I CAME BACK TO PBS IN 2007.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.158" end="00:04:23.197">AND I SAID, WELL, BECAUSE MARK TWAIN WASN&apos;T AVAILABLE AND HE&apos;S NOT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.197" end="00:04:25.832">BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.832" end="00:04:32.105">YOUR PEOPLE HERE KNOW THAT THE TRUTH GOES DOWN BETTER IN A DEMOCRACY WHEN IT&apos;S IN HUMOR,</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.105" end="00:04:35.876">BUT YOU DO A SPLENDID JOB OF JUXTAPOSING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.876" end="00:04:37.611">YOU DON&apos;T ATTACK PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.611" end="00:04:40.848">YOU PUT WHAT THEY SAID TEN YEARS AGO AND WHAT THEY SAID LAST NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.848" end="00:04:42.516">THAT&apos;S WHAT GOOD JOURNALISM IS ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.516" end="00:04:43.517">IT&apos;S ABOUT COMPARING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.517" end="00:04:45.085">IT&apos;S NOT DECLARING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.085" end="00:04:46.987">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, THAT&apos;S VERY KIND OF YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.987" end="00:04:51.825">I FEEL LIKE WE&apos;RE NOT TO DYE THAT MAN&apos;S MUSTACHE, BUT THANK </p>
<p begin="00:04:51.825" end="00:04:55.696">YOU FOR PUTTING US IN THE SAME SENTENCE.</p>
