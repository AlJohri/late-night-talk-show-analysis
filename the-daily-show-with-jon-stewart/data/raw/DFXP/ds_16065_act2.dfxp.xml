<p begin="00:00:04.838" end="00:00:12.980">JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND, MY SON AND I ARE PLAYING OUR NEW FAVORITE GAME THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.980" end="00:00:19.319">WE PRETEND TO BE THE HEROIC NAVY SEALS WHO TOOK DOWN AMERICA&apos;S WORST ENEMY, A.K.A.,</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.319" end="00:00:20.621">OUR NEIGHBOR&apos;S LABRADOR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.621" end="00:00:23.757">THE NEXT THING I KNOW THERE&apos;S A LAWYER AT MY DOOR SERVING ME WITH PAPERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.757" end="00:00:28.128">&gt;&gt; WALT DISNEY COMPANY IS IS LOOKING TO CASH IN ON THE OSAMA BIN LADEN TAKEDOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.128" end="00:00:30.597">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE U.S. MILITARY RAID ON </p>
<p begin="00:00:30.597" end="00:00:35.602">OSAMA BIN LADEN&apos;S COMPOUND BUT IT TOOK DISNEY LESS THAN TWO DAYS TO REFLECT THE TRADEMARK </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.602" end="00:00:38.272">FOR THE NAME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.272" end="00:00:40.908">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CAN&apos;T DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.908" end="00:00:46.780">YOU CAN&apos;T JUST TAKE AMERICA&apos;S REAL-LIFE HEROES AND TURN THEM INTO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.780" end="00:00:52.853">ALTHOUGH... BUT THAT IS IS AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.853" end="00:00:55.622">I CAN&apos;T WAIT FOR THE HAPPY MEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.622" end="00:01:02.129">PUTTING A TRADEMARK IS LIKE TRYING TO COPYRIGHT THE GUYS WHO STORMED THE BEACHES OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:06.300">NORMANDY OR PUTTING A PATENT PATENT ON PATTON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.300" end="00:01:07.501">IT BELONGS TO ALL OF US.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.501" end="00:01:12.072">NOT TO MENTION DISNEY FILED ITS CLAIM ONLY TWO DAY AFTER THE STORY WAS RELEASED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.072" end="00:01:16.743">PART OF OUR NEW ONGOING SEGMENT, THAT WAS FAST.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.743" end="00:01:17.277">YOU KNOW WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.277" end="00:01:18.345">I HAVE AN IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.345" end="00:01:20.480">I&apos;M GOING TO TRADEMARK THE LION KING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.480" end="00:01:21.915">OH, IT&apos;S TRADEMARK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.915" end="00:01:24.952">THEN I&apos;LL JUST TRADEMARK THE TRADEMARK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.952" end="00:01:26.320">YOU USE THAT THING ALL THE TIME?</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:28.355">I&apos;M GOING TO MAKE A BOAT LOAD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.355" end="00:01:31.625">ALTHOUGH DISNEY ISN&apos;T THE ONLY BIG MEDIA COMPANY MAKING THE MOVES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.625" end="00:01:37.097">&gt;&gt; FEDERAL REGULATORS TODAY APPROVED THE PURCHASE BY COMCAST OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:37.097" end="00:01:39.466">NBC UNIVERSAL FROM GENERAL ELECTRIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.466" end="00:01:45.839">THIS MERGER WILL CREATE A $30 BILLION MEDIA COMPANY WITH CABLE, BROADCAST, INTERNET,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.839" end="00:01:48.709">MOTION PICTURE AND THEME PARK COMPONENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.709" end="00:01:49.710">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANKED GOD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:54.815">NOW IF I HAVE MY CABLE GO OUT AND I GO TO A THEME PARK AND CHOKE ON A GIANT FRIED TURKEY </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.815" end="00:02:01.421">LEG RIGHT BEFORE I FIND OUT MY FAVORITE SHOW GOT CANCELED I ONLY HAVE TO CALL ONE NUMBER </p>
<p begin="00:02:01.421" end="00:02:03.390">TO COMPLAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:04.925">THIS MONOPOLY IS AWESOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.925" end="00:02:07.127">I DON&apos;T KNOW WHY THIS DOESN&apos;T HAPPEN MORE OFTEN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.127" end="00:02:08.195">RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.195" end="00:02:10.230">BECAUSE IT&apos;S ILLEGAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.230" end="00:02:13.800">WHICH IS WHY IT HAD TO BE APPROVED BY THE FCC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.540">THE SAME PEOPLE WHO FREAK OUT WHEN BOOBS POP OUT OF A SUPER BOWL OR KEEP ME FROM SAYING </p>
<p begin="00:02:19.540" end="00:02:22.809">THINGS LIKE (BEEP) OR (BEEP BEEP (.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.809" end="00:02:30.184">IN FACT, IF I COVER MY MOUTH EVEN JUST SAY LIKE (BEEP) NO ONE KNOWS BUT THEY WILL GET IT </p>
<p begin="00:02:30.184" end="00:02:31.852">AND THEY WILL BLEEP IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.852" end="00:02:35.856">PART OF THE FCC&apos;S JOB IS MAKING SURE THAT THE MEDIA COMPANIES DON&apos;T GET TOO </p>
<p begin="00:02:35.856" end="00:02:39.993">POWERFUL OR THEY MIGHT START DOING STUFF LIKE TRADEMARKING THE NAMES OF HEROIC MILITARY </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.993" end="00:02:42.162">UNITS FOR THEIR OWN FINANCIAL GAMES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.162" end="00:02:43.363">THOSE (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.363" end="00:02:45.165">YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.165" end="00:02:49.903">&gt;&gt; THE MERGER WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE COMCAST&apos;S INCENTIVE AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.903" end="00:02:55.542">ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES, BLOCK COMPETITIVE ENTRY, FORCE BUNDLES ON OUR CABLE SYSTEMS </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.542" end="00:02:58.946">AND DISCRIMINATE COMPETING PROGRAMMING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.946" end="00:03:01.048">FOR CONSUMERS THIS WOULD SPELL EVEN HIGHER PRICES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:03.116">&gt;&gt; Jon: EVEN HIGHER PRICES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.116" end="00:03:03.717">SO WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.717" end="00:03:12.326">I ONLY PAY $150 A MONTH BUT I GET 80 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE STYLE CHANNEL EVEN THOUGH </p>
<p begin="00:03:12.326" end="00:03:15.662">THAT&apos;S ALL THERE IS ON EVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.662" end="00:03:20.834">EXCEPT OF COURSE MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AT 11:003 ON COMEDY CENTRAL WHERE TV </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.834" end="00:03:26.773">FUNNY MAN JOHN STEWART PUTS HIS OUTRAGEOUS TONIGHT ON TONIGHT&apos;S NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.773" end="00:03:29.643">TONIGHT&apos;S EPISODE JERK-OFF JOKES ABOUT BIN LADEN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.643" end="00:03:31.712">HOW HOW DID THIS DEAL HAPPEN?</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.712" end="00:03:36.316">WELL, THE FCC&apos;S FIVE-MEMBER REGULATORY BOARD WORKS KIND OF LIKE THE SUPREME COURT WITHOUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:36.316" end="00:03:40.087">THE ROBES OR THE LITTLE HAMMERS AND NOT AS MANY PEOPLE DIE WHILE IN OFFICE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.087" end="00:03:45.325">THEY VOTED 4-TO-1 TO APPROVE THE MERGER THANKS IN PART TO THE SUPPORT OF FCC </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.325" end="00:03:47.528">COMMISSIONER MEREDITH BAKER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.528" end="00:03:52.666">&gt;&gt; SHE VOTED FOR THE DEAL AND HAS SINCE BEEN OUTSPOKEN COMPLAINING THAT THE FCC&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:03:52.666" end="00:03:55.836">MERGER REVIEW PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND TAKES TOO LONG.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.836" end="00:03:57.838">&gt;&gt; Jon: GOOD FOR YOU, MADAM COMMISSIONER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.838" end="00:04:02.075">CUT TO THE RED TAPE TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY FOR THE AMERICAN TAX PAYOR.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.075" end="00:04:05.479">FINALLY SOMEONE IN GOVERNMENT WHO IS NOT JUST LOOKING OUT FOR NUMBER ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.479" end="00:04:09.116">&gt;&gt; FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSIONER MEREDITH BAKER ANNOUNCED SHE&apos;S RESIGNING NEXT </p>
