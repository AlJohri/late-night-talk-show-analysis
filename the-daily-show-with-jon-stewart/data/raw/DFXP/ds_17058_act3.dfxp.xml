<p begin="00:00:32.566" end="00:00:33.300">WITHOUT A DELAY.</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.202" end="00:00:35.769">THAT&apos;S WONDERFUL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.769" end="00:00:36.870">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S VERY NICE.</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.749" end="00:00:51.385">TO PROFIT FROM INSIDE INFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.385" end="00:00:52.886">&gt;&gt; AND THEIR STAFF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.886" end="00:00:54.788">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THEIR STAFFS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.788" end="00:00:57.191">WHEN DID YOU INTRODUCE THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.191" end="00:00:59.693">&gt;&gt; IN 2006.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.693" end="00:01:03.230">A YOUNG REPORTER AT THE &quot;WALL STREET JOURNAL,&quot; BRODIE MULLINS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.230" end="00:01:07.134">WAS DOING A WONDERFUL JOB ON IT AND THAT&apos;S HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.134" end="00:01:11.138">WE WERE NOT AWARE OF IT UNTIL SOMEONE IN TOM DELAY&apos;S OFFICE,</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.138" end="00:01:16.210">HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, HAD BEEN DOING DAY TRADING ON GOVERNMENT COMPUTERS ALL DAY LONG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:18.412">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE WAS DOING DAY TRADING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.412" end="00:01:19.079">&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.079" end="00:01:21.582">&gt;&gt; Jon: HE WAS WORKING IN CONGRESS WHILE DOING DAY TRADING?</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.582" end="00:01:24.084">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.084" end="00:01:24.351">YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.351" end="00:01:29.456">WE&apos;VE HEARD... THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE STORIES, MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.456" end="00:01:33.360">POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE WAS A PART OF OUR ORIGINAL BILL AND TO ME IT&apos;S REALLY THE MOST </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:34.328">IMPORTANT PART.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.328" end="00:01:40.734">IT&apos;S WORTH $402 MILLION A YEAR AND IT&apos;S TOTALLY UNREGULATED SO </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.734" end="00:01:45.706">SENATOR GRASSLEY AND I HAD BEEN SORT OF IN CAHOOTS ALONG WITH SENATOR LAHEY TO TRY TO GET THE </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.706" end="00:01:46.874">BILL INTO CONVERSATION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.874" end="00:01:49.243">WE THINK IT&apos;S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.243" end="00:01:49.810">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.810" end="00:01:52.012">&gt;&gt; NOW, THE HOUSE BILL WAS HIJACKED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.012" end="00:01:53.113">WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.113" end="00:01:59.119">WE HAD HAD A COMMITTEE MEETING ONCE WHICH CANTOR STOPPED AND SAID WE WOULD DO SOME MORE ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:01:59.119" end="00:01:59.887">THIS LATER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.887" end="00:02:04.725">AFTER THE SENATE PASSED THE BILL THERE WAS THIS GREAT TPHRURFULLY THE HOUSE TO DO SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.725" end="00:02:10.397">HE TOOK THE BILL AND MADE IT INTO A SUSPENSION, WHICH TAKES TWO-THIRDS VOTE BUT DOESN&apos;T GIVE </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.397" end="00:02:16.637">YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND IT WHICH CUT US OUT AGAIN FROM DOING ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.637" end="00:02:17.604">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW, CONGRESSWOMAN,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.604" end="00:02:19.473">I&apos;M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.473" end="00:02:23.977">EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED SOUNDS INSANE TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.977" end="00:02:26.480">&gt;&gt; IT IS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:27.214">YOU&apos;RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.214" end="00:02:28.315">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SOUNDS INSANE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.315" end="00:02:30.217">&gt;&gt; IT IS INSANE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.217" end="00:02:34.388">&gt;&gt; Jon: ENOUGH IDEA OF WE WOULD LIKE TO STOP CONGRESS PEOPLE FROM COMMITTING AN ACT </p>
<p begin="00:02:34.388" end="00:02:38.325">THAT IF YOU ARE NOT IN CONGRESS IS ILLEGAL TO COMMIT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.325" end="00:02:39.993">&gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.993" end="00:02:44.998">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR IT AND YET WHAT YOU&apos;RE SAYING TO ME IS SO THEY DID A </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.998" end="00:02:47.968">SUSPENSION, WE WENT TO COMMITTEE, THAT I DID TWO-THIRDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.968" end="00:02:49.770">IT STRIKES ME AS HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:53.373">&gt;&gt; I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD MORE SUPPORT FOR A BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.373" end="00:03:00.480">NOW, IT TOOK ME 13 YEARS TO PASS NONDISCRIMINATION SO I&apos;M PRETTY </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.518">ERSISTENT BUT I&apos;D NEVER SEENP ANYTHING LIKE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.518" end="00:03:06.954">WE HAD SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR GOODNESS SAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.954" end="00:03:11.191">WE HAD 288 COSPONSORS, 98 OF THEM WERE REPUBLICANS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.191" end="00:03:14.695">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S A BIPARTISAN BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.695" end="00:03:15.796">&gt;&gt; WELL, SO TO SPEAK.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.796" end="00:03:19.066">I&apos;M NOT SURE HOW SERIOUS THEY WERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.066" end="00:03:19.433">(LAUGHTER).</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.433" end="00:03:23.704">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT IT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE FACE-- </p>
<p begin="00:03:23.704" end="00:03:27.608">UNLESS YOU WORK IN CONGRESS AND THEN YOU&apos;RE ALLOWED TO PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.608" end="00:03:31.645">AND YOU SAY I&apos;D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A BILL SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULDN&apos;T PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.645" end="00:03:35.616">FACE AND THEY SAY &quot;WELL, WHAT DOES PUNCHING REALLY MEAN?&quot; (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:35.616" end="00:03:40.487">&quot;IF I HIT SOMEONE WITH AN OPEN HAND, IS THAT A PUNCH, I DON&apos;T KNOW.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:03:40.487" end="00:03:41.188">IT&apos;S FRUSTRATING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.188" end="00:03:44.091">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S AN ALLISS IF WONDER LAND WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.091" end="00:03:46.627">IT&apos;S THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.627" end="00:03:47.561">IT&apos;S GOTTEN WORSE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.561" end="00:03:51.765">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT&apos;S SO CRAZY IS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH WRITING LAWS WHO ARE NOW </p>
<p begin="00:03:51.765" end="00:03:54.601">SAYING WELL, GEEZ, LAWS, DO THEY REALLY MEAN ANYTHING?</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.601" end="00:03:57.804">&gt;&gt; WELL, I&apos;LL TELL YOU, RIGHT NOW WE ARE REALLY PUSHING FOR </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.804" end="00:04:02.142">THE SENATE TO HOLD A CONFERENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.142" end="00:04:06.046">TWO BILLS IN TWO HOUSES ARE NOT THE SAME SO THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY HAS NOTHING TO SIGN SO </p>
<p begin="00:04:06.046" end="00:04:10.417">IF EVERYBODY WILL JUST GET TO THEIR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND TELL THEM HOLD A </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.417" end="00:04:15.455">CONFERENCE FOR GOODNESS SAKE SO WE CAN PUT POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE BACK IN THIS BILL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.455" end="00:04:21.161">REMEMBER THAT $402 MILLION A YEAR, TOTALLY UNREGULATED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.161" end="00:04:22.896">&gt;&gt; Jon: FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.896" end="00:04:23.330">IT&apos;S ILLEGAL!</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.330" end="00:04:25.832">&gt;&gt; IT IS ILLEGAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.832" end="00:04:27.501">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SHOULDN&apos;T BE LEGAL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.501" end="00:04:29.069">&gt;&gt; WELL LET ME TELL YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.069" end="00:04:31.705">THE DIFFICULTY IS PEOPLE DON&apos;T KNOW THEY&apos;RE LOBBYISTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.705" end="00:04:33.473">THEY&apos;RE NOT REGISTERED ANYWHERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.473" end="00:04:39.179">AND SO WE HAVE LOTS OF REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT THEY WOULD DO WAS SET UP MEETINGS WITH MEMBERS </p>
<p begin="00:04:39.179" end="00:04:45.619">OF CONGRESS, PARTICULARLY CHAIRS OF COMMITTEES, AND THEN CHARGE THEIR CLIENTS $10,000 TO COME TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:45.619" end="00:04:49.756">HAVE THIS GREAT CONVERSATION WITH A GREAT ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.756" end="00:04:51.725">&gt;&gt; Jon: SENATOR HARKEN HAS THAT ISSUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.725" end="00:04:53.694">&gt;&gt; SENATOR HARKEN DIDN&apos;T GO,</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.694" end="00:04:54.094">HOWEVER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:55.996">WHEN HE WAS TOLD THEY WERE CHARGING, HE DIDN&apos;T GO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.996" end="00:05:00.200">&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY WERE CHARGING HEDGE FUND GUYS $10,000 TO MEET WITH CONGRESS PEOPLE, GET </p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:04.671">INFORMATION ABOUT BILLS, THEN THEY WOULD GO BACK TO THE HEDGE FUND AND MAKE STOCK DEALS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.671" end="00:05:05.772">&gt;&gt; INDEED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.772" end="00:05:06.907">AND IT AFFECTED THE MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.907" end="00:05:12.312">ONE OF THE BIGGEST CASES OF THAT IS ASBESTOS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ASBESTOS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.312" end="00:05:18.252">THE STOCK WENT UP OVERNIGHT WHEN PEOPLE LEARNED THAT THE SENATE BILL WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR </p>
<p begin="00:05:18.252" end="00:05:21.121">REPARATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ARMED BY ASBESTOS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.121" end="00:05:25.826">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND SO THEY MADE A TON OF MONEY ON THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE </p>
<p begin="00:05:25.826" end="00:05:30.264">WITH MESOTHELIOMA WOULD NOT GET COMPENSATED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.264" end="00:05:32.466">&gt;&gt; AND THE THING IS WE KNOW BETTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.466" end="00:05:36.436">I TELL YOU, I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES KNOW BETTER THAN WHAT THEY&apos;RE DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.436" end="00:05:39.706">I DON&apos;T KNOW HOW WIDESPREAD IT IS BECAUSE I DON&apos;T REALLY HAVE </p>
<p begin="00:05:39.706" end="00:05:43.510">ACCESS TO ALL THEIR FINANCIAL RECORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.510" end="00:05:47.214">BUT THE IDEA THAT IT HAPPENED AND WE KNOW IT HAPPENED AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES IT HAPPENED </p>
<p begin="00:05:47.214" end="00:05:52.719">AND TO THIS DAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF DOING IT HAVE NEVER SAID NO I DIDN&apos;T EXCEPT </p>
<p begin="00:05:52.719" end="00:05:57.991">MAYBE JUST THE MOST RECENT CASES WITH CONGRESSMAN BACHUS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.991" end="00:06:01.328">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, I CONGRATULATE YOU ON TRYING YOUR BEST TO GET THAT DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.328" end="00:06:02.396">&gt;&gt; WE&apos;LL DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.396" end="00:06:04.531">&gt;&gt; Jon: I&apos;M GLAD IT&apos;S A BIPARTISAN EFFORT AND I WOULD </p>
<p begin="00:06:04.531" end="00:06:08.168">JUST SAY TO PEOPLE IF YOU&apos;RE GOING TO CONTACT YOUR CONGRESS </p>
<p begin="00:06:08.168" end="00:06:11.438">PEOPLE WHILE YOU&apos;RE ON THE LINE WITH THEM, WHILE YOU STILL CAN,</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.438" end="00:06:14.074">I WOULD GET SOME STOCK TIPS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.074" end="00:06:14.474">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:06:14.474" end="00:06:15.642">&gt;&gt; NO!</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.642" end="00:06:16.043">NO!</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.043" end="00:06:18.178">&gt;&gt; Jon: SEE IF THERE&apos;S ANYTHING YOU CAN...</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.178" end="00:06:19.146">&gt;&gt; PLEASE, NO!</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.146" end="00:06:19.813">(LAUGHS).</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.813" end="00:06:21.381">&gt;&gt; Jon: CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR J </p>
