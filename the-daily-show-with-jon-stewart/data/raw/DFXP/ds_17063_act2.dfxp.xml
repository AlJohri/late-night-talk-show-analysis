<p begin="00:00:32.900" end="00:00:38.005">&gt;&gt; JON, RICK SANTORUM MIGHT BE FEELING GOOD ABOUT HIS RISE IN THE POLLS BUT HE&apos;S </p>
<p begin="00:00:38.005" end="00:00:40.908">ABOUT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN WHO IS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.908" end="00:00:42.743">&gt;&gt; SANTORUM IS NOT AN IDEAL CANDIDATE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.743" end="00:00:48.549">HE SEEMS TO ENJOY THOSE DEBATES, A LITTLE TOO MUCH T SCARES PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.549" end="00:00:50.918">&gt;&gt; THE POINTS HE IS BRING UP ARE HURTING THE PARTY.</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.355" end="00:00:59.426">NOW WHY, WHAT IS IT ABOUT SANTORUM THAT HAS REPUBLICANS SO ALARMED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.426" end="00:01:03.197">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE, JON, AS YOU SAW IN THE DEBATE HE&apos;S A LITTLE TOO OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT </p>
<p begin="00:01:03.197" end="00:01:07.601">HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.601" end="00:01:10.737">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE THOUGHTS AND CONSERVATIVE FEELINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.737" end="00:01:11.772">WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.772" end="00:01:15.509">&gt;&gt; BECAUSE, REPUBLICANS AREN&apos;T IDIOTS, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:22.583">THEY KNOW THAT AMERICA LOVES ITS CONSERVATISM CUT WITH PLENTY OF BAKING POWDER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.583" end="00:01:30.490">BECAUSE ONE HIT OF THE PURE STUFF AND YOU&apos;LL WAKE UP WITH ERIC STOLTZ STRANGLING </p>

<p begin="00:01:35.329" end="00:01:38.732">AND SANTORUM DOESN&apos;T GET THAT LOOK HOW HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF DON&apos;T ASK </p>
<p begin="00:01:38.732" end="00:01:39.399">DON&apos;T TELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.399" end="00:01:42.336">&gt;&gt; WHAT WE ARE DOING IS PLAYING SOCIAL EXPERIMENTATION WITH OUR MILITARY RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.336" end="00:01:43.504">AND THAT&apos;S TRAGIC.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.504" end="00:01:48.442">I WOULD JUST SAY THAT GOING FORWARD, WE WOULD REINSTITUTE THAT POLICY OF </p>
<p begin="00:01:48.442" end="00:01:51.378">RICK SANTORUM WAS PRESIDENT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.378" end="00:01:51.845">PERIOD.</p>

<p begin="00:02:03.957" end="00:02:07.361">BUT GIVEN THE FACT YOU ARE INSISTENT, THE ANSWER IS I BELIEVE THAT DON&apos;T ASK DON&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:02:07.361" end="00:02:13.467">TELL SHOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT IN PLACE UNTIL CONFLICT WAS OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.467" end="00:02:16.970">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO HE IS SAYING IT&apos;S OKAY THEN FOR GAYS TO BE IN THE MILITARY AS LONG AS WE </p>
<p begin="00:02:16.970" end="00:02:18.238">ARE NOT FIGHTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.238" end="00:02:18.939">IS THAT -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.939" end="00:02:20.307">&gt;&gt; IS HE SAYING THAT, JON?</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.307" end="00:02:21.708">IS THAT WHAT IS SAYING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.708" end="00:02:27.514">OR DO YOU THINK HE&apos;S SAYING SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD AGREE WITH EVEN MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.514" end="00:02:31.218">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.218" end="00:02:34.655">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU ARE SAYING SO HE&apos;S SAYING EVERY NOTHING.</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.957" end="00:02:37.691">&gt;&gt; Jon: I GET THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.691" end="00:02:43.964">&gt;&gt; JUST LIKE THE CONTRACEPTION DEBATE WHICH SANTORUM WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO MAKE ABOUT CON </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.964" end="00:02:44.831">EXTRA-- CONTRACEPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.831" end="00:02:46.900">&gt;&gt; MANY CHRISTIAN IN THE 235I9 SAID WELL, THAT&apos;S OKAY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.900" end="00:02:48.602">YOU KNOW, CONTRACEPTION IS OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.602" end="00:02:50.704">IT&apos;S NOT OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.704" end="00:03:00.848">IT&apos;S A LIFE SENTENCE TO DO THINGS IN A SEXUAL REALM THAT IS COUNTER TO WHAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.848" end="00:03:01.882">CATHOLICS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.882" end="00:03:04.451">&gt;&gt; IS THIS YOUR FIRST DAY IN POLITICS, RICK?</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.451" end="00:03:08.755">YOU JUST MADE THIS ABOUT CONTROLLING A WOMAN&apos;S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BASED ON </p>
<p begin="00:03:08.755" end="00:03:11.792">IMPOSING YOUR CODE OF MORALITY UPON OTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.792" end="00:03:13.493">&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.493" end="00:03:14.862">THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.862" end="00:03:18.265">&gt;&gt; RIGHT, BUT YOU DON&apos;T TELL THEM THAT!</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.265" end="00:03:20.367">JON, THIS IS WHAT YOU TELL THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.367" end="00:03:24.104">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S REALLY NOT ABOUT CONTRACEPTION, IT&apos;S ABOUT VIOLATING OUR FIRST </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.104" end="00:03:27.774">AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND CONSCIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.774" end="00:03:29.209">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M A RELIGIOUS MAN.</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.613" end="00:03:33.614">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:03:33.614" end="00:03:36.850">&gt;&gt; I JUST WISH TO PRAY IN PEACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.850" end="00:03:39.620">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO I GUESS IT&apos;S LIKE THE STATE&apos;S RIGHTS ARGUMENTS </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.620" end="00:03:40.854">DURING THE EARLY 60 ITSEE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.854" end="00:03:44.958">IT WAS REALLY ABOUT HE IS GROWGATION BUT YOU NEED SOME KIND OF AGREED UPON CODE TO -- </p>
<p begin="00:03:44.958" end="00:03:45.959">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:51.398">AND RICK, THE [BLEEP] JUST GAVE EVERYONE THE ENIGMA MACHINE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.398" end="00:03:53.133">JON, LOOK AT THE WEALTH GAP.</p>

<p begin="00:03:54.668" end="00:03:59.306">A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK THERE IS SOMETHING UNFAIR IN OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.306" end="00:04:03.043">BUT YOUR PLATFORM IS DARWINNIAN FREE MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.043" end="00:04:03.911">SELL IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.911" end="00:04:06.180">&gt;&gt; THERE IS INCOME INEQUALITY IN AMERICA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.180" end="00:04:07.147">THERE ALWAYS HAS BEEN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.147" end="00:04:10.884">AND HOPEFULLY, AND I DO SAY THAT, THERE ALWAYS WILL BE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.884" end="00:04:14.688">&gt;&gt; WE DO NOT ACCEPT THAT OURS WILL EVER BE A NATION OF HAVEs AND HAVE NOTS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.688" end="00:04:19.726">WE MUST ALWAYS BE A NATION OF HAVEs AND SOON TO HAVEs.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.726" end="00:04:21.495">&gt;&gt; YOU SEE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.495" end="00:04:23.530">&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.530" end="00:04:28.569">&gt;&gt; MITCH DANIELS IS USING A DOG WHISTLE WHERE SANTORUM IS USING ONE OF THESE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.569" end="00:04:30.671">OUT, JESUS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.671" end="00:04:32.072">&gt;&gt; DOW HEAR THAT, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.072" end="00:04:32.439">&gt;&gt; Jon: YES.</p>

<p begin="00:04:37.144" end="00:04:42.449">&gt;&gt;S SO HE&apos;S NOT AFRAID TO STATE EXPLICITLY REPUBLICAN DOGMA.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.449" end="00:04:45.719">IT&apos;S KIND OF REFRESHING THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IN DEBATES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.719" end="00:04:51.825">PUT IDEAS OUT THERE IN THE MARKETPLACE IN THEIR BARE FORM, AND LET THE VOTERS DECIDE, FREE MARKET.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.825" end="00:04:52.626">&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO.</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.294" end="00:04:55.429">AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.429" end="00:05:00.400">BECAUSE THEN VOTERS HAVE TO TAKE YOUR PLATFORM TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.404">FOR INSTANCE, RICK SANTORUM IS PRO-LIFE.</p>
