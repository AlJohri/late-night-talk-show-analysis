<p begin="00:01:41.768" end="00:01:45.205">PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND WITHOUT SHIRTS ON GETTING BEAT ON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.205" end="00:01:50.344">&gt;&gt; NO, IT&apos;S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CULTURE.</p>

<p begin="00:02:46.099" end="00:02:47.501">AND GO THEIR SEPARATE WAYS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.501" end="00:02:54.842">IT FEELS LIKE NOW WHAT ARE THE JOURNALISTS DOING AT THE CONVENTION OTHER THAN DECIDING </p>
<p begin="00:02:54.842" end="00:02:57.311">WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING HELPED ONE CANDIDATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.311" end="00:02:59.713">IT&apos;S NOT FACT CHECKING WHAT&apos;S YOUR JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.713" end="00:03:01.048">THEN YOU WILL JUST MC.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.048" end="00:03:06.220">&gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED IS EVERYTHING IS SO -- THEY WERE RESPONDING VERY QUICKLY.</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.254" end="00:03:43.290">THE CONVENTION IS OVER A THREE DAY PERIOD.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:45.792">IT&apos;S 24 HOUR COVERAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.792" end="00:03:55.469">IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH IT&apos;S WARPED SPEED AND WE BROUGHT THE LEVEL OF </p>

<p begin="00:03:58.405" end="00:03:59.573">&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&apos;S TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.573" end="00:04:05.045">I THINK PART OF THE REASON THAT WE HAVE KIND OF THE LOWER VIEWERSHIP, EVERYBODY </p>
<p begin="00:04:05.045" end="00:04:07.781">UNDERSTANDS THEY HAVE TO SANITIZE AND SCRUB AND BUTTON UP.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.781" end="00:04:12.653">THESE DELEGATES ARRIVED ON THE FLOOR FOR EXAMPLE, THEY&apos;RE TOLD WHEN TO SIT, HOW TO STAND, WHAT </p>

<p begin="00:04:33.273" end="00:04:40.180">&gt;&gt; Jon:  HAS OUR EFFORT TO DISCREDIT THEIR AUTHORITY BEEN EFFECTIVE IN HAVING THEM MAKE </p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:44.551">STATEMENTS OF FACT OR TRUTH OR BEING ABLE TO STATE THINGS MORE AUTHORITATIVELY.</p>
