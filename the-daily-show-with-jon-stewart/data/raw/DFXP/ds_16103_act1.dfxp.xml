<p begin="00:00:28.028" end="00:00:29.296">MY NAME IS JON STEWART.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.296" end="00:00:31.765">OUR GUEST MARK ADAMS WILL BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.765" end="00:00:35.769">A NEW BOOK ON MACHU PICCHU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.769" end="00:00:37.037">AWFULLY A LOT OF FUN TO SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.037" end="00:00:37.838">MACHU PICCHU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.838" end="00:00:42.676">WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A MORE MODERN CIVILIZATION AND ITS MYSTERIOUS DECLINE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.676" end="00:00:48.982">&gt;&gt; STANDARD AND POORS ONE OF THE AGENCY&apos;S, HAS DROPPED THE U.S. FROM A TRIPLE-A RATING </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.982" end="00:00:57.024">DOWN TO A DOUBLE-A-PLUS RATING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.024" end="00:00:59.359">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.359" end="00:01:03.931">I MEAN FROM TRIPLE-A TO DOUBLE-A -PLUS DOESN&apos;T SOUND THAT BAD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.931" end="00:01:09.069">IF YOU WERE GOING TO RENT THE TRIPLE-X MOVIE YOU GOT HOME AND FOUND OUT THAT THE MOVIE </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.069" end="00:01:14.474">WAS JUST DOUBLE-X-PLUS, ARE YOU GOING TO WORRY THAT THERE WAS NOT QUITE ENOUGH (BEEP) </p>
<p begin="00:01:14.474" end="00:01:18.712">AND SUCKING TO FILL UP THE APPROXIMATELY FOUR MINUTES YOU&apos;RE GOING TO WATCH IT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.712" end="00:01:21.915">I MEAN, SIX MINUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.915" end="00:01:24.618">LADIES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.618" end="00:01:28.255">AND BY THE WAY, THE RATINGS AGENCY IS STANDARD AND POORS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.255" end="00:01:33.994">WHO IS GOING TO LISTEN TO A COMPANY WHOSE NAME TRANSLATES TO AVERAGE AND BELOW AVERAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.994" end="00:01:36.163">THIS IS A BIG NOTHING BURGER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.163" end="00:01:38.131">&gt;&gt; GLOBAL MARKETS IN TURMOIL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.131" end="00:01:40.734">&gt;&gt; HIGH AND ANXIETY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.734" end="00:01:42.336">&gt;&gt; A MANIC MONDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.336" end="00:01:44.104">&gt;&gt; THE DOW PLUNGING THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.104" end="00:01:47.007">&gt;&gt; WE ARE DOWN MORE THAN 400 POINTS ON 500 POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.007" end="00:01:50.310">&gt;&gt; THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL CLOSING DOWN 634 POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:52.946">&gt;&gt; ANOTHER HORRENDOUS, RECHED,</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.946" end="00:01:57.918">YOU FILL IN THE ADJECTIVE DAY FOR STOCKS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.918" end="00:02:03.457">&gt;&gt; Jon: CRASH-A-TROCIOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.457" end="00:02:07.160">DIARRHEA-TASTICALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.160" end="00:02:08.562">THAT&apos;S AN ADD VERB.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.562" end="00:02:12.199">SO THEY DOWNGRADED AND THE STOCK MARKET TANKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.199" end="00:02:12.666">WAIT A MINUTE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.666" end="00:02:14.434">WHY WOULD THAT HAPPEN?</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.434" end="00:02:17.137">STANDARD AND POORS, THAT NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.137" end="00:02:21.675">&gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO GAVE THE CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH TO THE MORTGAGE SECURITIES THAT </p>
<p begin="00:02:21.675" end="00:02:22.209">WERE TOXIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.209" end="00:02:26.446">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO, THAT&apos;S NOT IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.446" end="00:02:27.414">STANDARD AND POORS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.414" end="00:02:29.650">I THINK IT WAS A COP SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.650" end="00:02:31.552">WASN&apos;T IT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.552" end="00:02:34.388">DETROIT CRIME JUST GOT DOWNGRADED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.388" end="00:02:36.323">PRETTY SURE THAT WAS STANDARD AND POORS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.323" end="00:02:41.929">&gt;&gt; THEY WERE GIVING TRIPLE-A RATINGS, GOLD RATINGS IN EFFECT TO MORTGAGE-BACKED </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.929" end="00:02:43.630">SECURITIES THAT WERE WORTHLESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.630" end="00:02:46.600">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO, I DON&apos;T THINK THAT&apos;S THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.600" end="00:02:49.636">I&apos;M GOING TO STICK WITH THE COP SHOW DUO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.636" end="00:02:51.104">THAT&apos;S MY FINAL ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.104" end="00:02:55.008">MEAN IF IT WAS THE SAME RATINGS COMPANY, SO CRUCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VERY </p>
<p begin="00:02:55.008" end="00:03:00.447">FINANCIAL PREDICAMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, THAT WOULD BE A REAL SLAP IN THE FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.447" end="00:03:04.384">I MEAN MAYBE STANDARD AND POORS ARE INCREDIBLY TOUGH GRADERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.384" end="00:03:08.055">ARE THERE OTHER COUNTRIES WITH TRIPLE-A RATINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.055" end="00:03:11.358">&gt;&gt; AUSTRALIA, DENMARK DENMARK,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.358" end="00:03:13.227">GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.227" end="00:03:28.942">SWEDEN, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EVEN THE ISLE OF MANN RIGHT OFF THE COAST OF THE U.K.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.942" end="00:03:31.178">&gt;&gt; Jon: OUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.178" end="00:03:34.648">WE&apos;RE BELOW ISLE OF MANN, THIS PLACE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.648" end="00:03:42.656">&#x266A; LET&apos;S GIVE THE BOY A HAND &#x266A;&#x266A; </p>
<p begin="00:03:42.656" end="00:03:45.192">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT PLACE HAS BETTER CREDIT THAN WE DO?</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.192" end="00:03:46.293">THERE&apos;S NO INDUSTRY THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.293" end="00:03:49.930">THEY JUST HORSE AROUND IN THE POOL ALL DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.930" end="00:03:53.367">I&apos;M BEING TOLD THAT MAN ISLAND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.367" end="00:03:54.835">NOT ISLE OF MANN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.835" end="00:03:58.639">WOW, ISLE OF MANN HAS A BETTER CREDIT RATING THAN WE DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.639" end="00:04:00.340">DID I SAY SLAP IN THE FACE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.340" end="00:04:03.877">I MEANT...</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.877" end="00:04:10.050">BY THE WAY, IN CALCULATING AND ANALYZING OUR DEBT SITUATION STANDARD AND POORS MADE A $2 </p>
<p begin="00:04:10.050" end="00:04:12.886">TRILLION MISTAKE BUT THEY&apos;RE STICKING WITH THE DOWNGRADE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.886" end="00:04:17.491">I CAN&apos;T WAIT TO SAY WHAT THESE MORE ONS SAID IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF OUR DEBT SITUATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.491" end="00:04:18.058">THIS SHOULD BE RICH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.058" end="00:04:23.130">&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE S&amp;P CITED WHEN MAKING THIS DOWNGRADE DECISION WAS ALL THE </p>
<p begin="00:04:23.130" end="00:04:27.734">POLITICAL PROBLEMS WE SAW IN CONGRESS AND GETTING EVERYONE TO AGREE TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.734" end="00:04:32.539">&gt;&gt; THE TEA PARTY WILL NOT BUDGE ON TAX CUTS AND RIGHT HERE S&amp;P IS SAYING THAT KIND </p>
<p begin="00:04:32.539" end="00:04:35.909">OF RIGID POSITION WAS A MAJOR REASON FOR THE DOWNGRADE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.909" end="00:04:38.245">&gt;&gt; ALSO YOU&apos;VE GOT THE EXTERNAL SITUATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.245" end="00:04:40.714">THE REST OF THE WORLD ALSO NOT IN GREAT SHAPE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.714" end="00:04:42.950">THE FINAL FACTOR WAS MONETARY POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.950" end="00:04:49.223">THAT&apos;S OF COURSE THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND ITS DECISION ON INTEREST RATES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.223" end="00:04:50.224">&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.224" end="00:04:52.960">YOUR NAME IS STILL STUPID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:54.094">STUPID NAME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:55.128">STANDARD AND POORS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.128" end="00:04:56.930">STUPID.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.930" end="00:05:01.635">YOU&apos;RE SUGGESTING OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS RECKLESS POPULATED BY IDEOLOGICAL CHILDREN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.635" end="00:05:04.338">WELL, YOU DON&apos;T WATCH THE SUNDAY MORNING NEWS SHOWS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.338" end="00:05:06.206">&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&apos;S FAILED PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.206" end="00:05:09.576">&gt;&gt; THIS IS WITHOUT QUESTION THE TEA PARTY DOWNGRADE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.576" end="00:05:13.914">&gt;&gt; THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAD BEEN UNWILLING TO REFORM THE PROGRAMS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.914" end="00:05:15.315">&gt;&gt; THE TEA PARTY DOWNGRADE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.315" end="00:05:17.217">&gt;&gt; EVERY SINGLE TIME...</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.217" end="00:05:19.319">SENATOR, YOU VOTED TO INCREASE THE DEBT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.319" end="00:05:20.587">&gt;&gt; THE DEBT ALREADY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.587" end="00:05:24.558">&gt;&gt; Jon: IF THIS IS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.558" end="00:05:25.926">&gt;&gt; THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER,</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.926" end="00:05:27.928">HOWEVER (TALKING STATEMENT).</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.928" end="00:05:28.929">&gt;&gt; GENTLEMEN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.929" end="00:05:31.198">&gt;&gt; Jon: SHUT UP, SHUT UP.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.198" end="00:05:42.209">I&apos;LL SPRAY YOU LIKE THE DOGS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HUMP FOR PLEASURE AND OF COURSE PROFIT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.209" end="00:05:44.111">IX-NAY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.111" end="00:05:48.549">ON THE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.549" end="00:05:50.284">ANDARDS AND ORES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.284" end="00:05:51.552">THIS IS HARD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.552" end="00:05:53.220">BY THE WAY STANDARD AND POORS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.220" end="00:05:58.125">BEFORE YOU BLAME ONE PARTY OVER THE OTHER, NOBODY WAS HAPPY WITH THE RECENT DEBT </p>
<p begin="00:05:58.125" end="00:06:03.764">CEILING DEAL THAT SEEMED TO INDICATE OUR POLITICAL PARTIES&apos; UNWILLINGNESS AND </p>
<p begin="00:06:03.764" end="00:06:05.799">INABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WAS TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.799" end="00:06:10.337">&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS FINAL AGREEMENT WE CAME TO AT THE WHITE HOUSE I GOT 98% OF WHAT </p>
<p begin="00:06:10.337" end="00:06:10.938">I WANTED.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.938" end="00:06:15.175">I&apos;M PRETTY HAPPY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.175" end="00:06:22.249">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU ARE THE WORLD&apos;S MOST MISGUIDED TANGERINE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.249" end="00:06:26.520">I&apos;LL TELL YOU, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BOEHNER SAYING HE PRETTY MUCH GOT EVERYTHING HE WANTED </p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:30.557">IN A DEAL THAT SEEMED TO DESTROY OUR FINANCIAL STANDING IN THE WORLD SEEMS LIKE A BIT </p>
<p begin="00:06:30.557" end="00:06:32.526">OF A SLAP IN THE FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.526" end="00:06:34.294">BUT MAYBE IT&apos;S A WAKE-UP CALL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.294" end="00:06:40.100">YOU KNOW, THE ALL KNOWING MARKET AND THE RATINGS AGENCY ENABLERS HELPED CREATE THIS </p>
<p begin="00:06:40.100" end="00:06:41.568">TERRIFYING RECESSION.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.568" end="00:06:45.372">WHICH COMBINED WITH OUR GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT&apos;S MASSIVE BAILOUT TO KEEP THESE </p>
<p begin="00:06:45.372" end="00:06:51.278">FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SOLVENT HAS BALLOONED OUR DEFICIT AND WEAKENED OUR ABILITY TO BATTLE </p>
<p begin="00:06:51.278" end="00:06:52.379">ITS EFFECTS.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.379" end="00:06:59.286">THE QUESTION IS, NOW THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED, OUR TREASURY MARKET IN RUINS,</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.286" end="00:07:00.854">WHERE DOES THIS SMART MONEY GO?</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.854" end="00:07:04.224">SHOW US THE WAY, OH, WIZARDS OF WALL STREET.</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.224" end="00:07:07.561">&gt;&gt; THE INTERESTING THING IS THE TREASURYS ARE UP.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.561" end="00:07:10.364">&gt;&gt; U.S. TREASURYS ARE NOT GETTING HURT BY THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.364" end="00:07:13.333">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S BEEN AN ENORMOUS FLIGHT TO U.S. TREASURYS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.333" end="00:07:18.739">&gt;&gt; MONEY IS SLOWING INTO WHAT ELSE, U.S. TREASURYS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.739" end="00:07:27.047">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU (BEEP) SERIOUS?</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.181" end="00:07:28.215">ARE YOU (BEEP) SERIOUS?</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.215" end="00:07:34.755">THE U.S. GETS DOWNGRADED SO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE FLUSHING THEIR MONEY OUT OF </p>
<p begin="00:07:34.755" end="00:07:42.462">STOCKS FROM A BOOEN GOOSE TO STASH IT IN THE SAFEST PLACE THEY CAN FIND, FRESHLY </p>
<p begin="00:07:42.462" end="00:07:44.331">DOWNGRADED U.S. TREASURYS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.331" end="00:07:48.902">BASICALLY YOU BURN UP THE (BEEP) HOUSE DOWN AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO COME OVER </p>
<p begin="00:07:48.902" end="00:07:55.275">AND GO, HEY, IS YOUR BASEMENT STILL STANDING?</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.275" end="00:08:00.280">YOU MIND IF I, YOU KNOW, PUT MY MONEY THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT?</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.280" end="00:08:03.450">JUST UNTIL I CAN FIND A NICER PLACE FOR IT TO LIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:07.421">BETWEEN YOU AND ME SINGAPORE IS LOOKING PRETTY NICE THIS TIME OF YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.421" end="00:08:08.755">FORGET, YOU GUYS.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.755" end="00:08:10.791">WE CAN GO OTHER PLACES FOR MONEY.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.791" end="00:08:12.392">YOU&apos;RE NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.392" end="00:08:16.730">HEY, WHAT&apos;S UP, ISLE OF MANN?</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.730" end="00:08:24.104">CAN I TALK TO YOU?</p>
