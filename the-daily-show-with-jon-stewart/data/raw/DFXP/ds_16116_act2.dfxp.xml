<p begin="00:00:31.732" end="00:00:35.602">&gt;&gt; PEOPLE CALL ME NAMES ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW, MEAT HEAD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.602" end="00:00:41.041">&gt;&gt; WHEN PEOPLE CALL YOU THE M WORD, HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.041" end="00:00:43.410">&gt;&gt; YOU GET USED TO IT AFTER A WHILE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.410" end="00:00:44.778">IT ROLLS OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.778" end="00:00:50.150">&gt;&gt; LUCKILY HIS SHOULDERS CAN TAKE IT BECAUSE MARK IS A MUSCLED AMERICAN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.150" end="00:00:56.490">A GROUP OF PEOPLE ROUTINELY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ALMOST EVERYWHERE THEY GO.</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.441" end="00:01:15.676">&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME?</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.676" end="00:01:17.878">WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?</p>

<p begin="00:01:27.988" end="00:01:29.489">WELL, GOD DAMMIT, I WAS WRONG.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.489" end="00:01:30.123">THEY THREW ME OUT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.123" end="00:01:35.963">&gt;&gt; THERE LAD TO BE A GOOD REASON FOR THIS NATIONAL CHAIN WITH NEARLY 500 LOCATIONS TO THROW </p>

<p begin="00:01:36.330" end="00:01:38.765">&gt;&gt; HE WAS GRUNTING IN THE GYM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.765" end="00:01:41.568">&gt;&gt; AND THAT&apos;S AGAINST THE GYM&apos;S POLICY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.568" end="00:01:42.936">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU&apos;VE SEEN IT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.936" end="00:01:45.739">HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A GYM MEMBER BEFORE?</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.739" end="00:01:46.106">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.106" end="00:01:51.178">&gt;&gt; WELL, WE HAVE SOMEONE PICK UP WEIGHTS AND GROWN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.178" end="00:01:52.846">THAT&apos;S WHAT WE&apos;RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.846" end="00:01:54.414">&gt;&gt; BUT IT IS A GYM, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.414" end="00:01:54.815">&gt;&gt; YES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.815" end="00:02:01.054">&gt;&gt; THE MO-GRUNTING POLICY IS PART OF THEIR HOLE LISTIC APPROACH TO THE GYM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.054" end="00:02:08.128">&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE AND NOT HAVE THE WILL U.K.S IN THE GYM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.128" end="00:02:10.063">&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE LUNGS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.063" end="00:02:12.833">&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MEAT HEADS, BODY BUILDERS, JERKS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.833" end="00:02:15.435">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S SOME PRETTY INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.435" end="00:02:17.538">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S HOW WE FEEL ACT THESE PEOPLE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.538" end="00:02:18.405">THEY&apos;RE JUST NOT WELCOME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.405" end="00:02:21.675">&gt;&gt; SO NO JUDGMENT EXCEPT YOU GET TO JUDGE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.675" end="00:02:22.509">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.509" end="00:02:23.677">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.677" end="00:02:29.616">SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS NON-JUDGMENTAL GYM JUDGE AS TOO MUCH GRUNTING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.616" end="00:02:31.818">HOW ABOUT THIS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.818" end="00:02:33.253">[INHALES DEEPLY]</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.363" end="00:02:45.399">&gt;&gt; THAT IS OUR LUNK ALARM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.399" end="00:02:50.938">IT GOES OFF ANY TIME SOMEONE DROPS WEIGHTS OR GRUPTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.938" end="00:02:52.172">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.172" end="00:02:56.710">THAT&apos;S A LOT LESS ANNOYING THAN GRUNTING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.710" end="00:02:58.946">AND IT&apos;S NOT JUST GRUNGTSING THAT&apos;S BEEN BANNED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.946" end="00:03:01.615">&gt;&gt; NO DO-RAGS ALLOWED.</p>

<p begin="00:03:04.251" end="00:03:09.790">&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY&apos;RE GESTAPO TACTICS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:13.060">&gt;&gt; YOU MUST NO LONGER WEAR DO-RAGS, EVER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:16.230">&gt;&gt; THERE&apos;S A LOT OF PLACES FOR LUNKS TO GO.</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.364" end="00:03:22.636">ALL THE ANIMALS CAN BE IN ONE CAGE, AND THEN YOU HAVE PLANET FITNESS WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE CAN GO.</p>

<p begin="00:03:26.406" end="00:03:27.074">&gt;&gt; HITLER?</p>

<p begin="00:03:53.800" end="00:03:56.003">DO YOU THINK I COULD DO YOGA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.003" end="00:04:03.777">&gt;&gt; MAYBE NOT, BUT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING I COULD DO TO HELP MARK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.777" end="00:04:06.046">SEE, THERE&apos;S OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE OUT HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.046" end="00:04:09.049">THAT&apos;S ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR ME.</p>
