<p begin="00:01:32.426" end="00:01:33.260">&gt;&gt; I DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.260" end="00:01:34.161">IT&apos;S WEIRD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.161" end="00:01:38.732">IN THE LONDON PREMIERE I WAS VERY EMOTIONAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.732" end="00:01:42.202">I WAS KIND OF... IT&apos;S BEEN A YEAR SINCE WE STARTED FILMING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.202" end="00:01:47.107">I GUESS I&apos;M KIND OF FOCUSED ON THE SHOW AT THE MOMENT AS WELL AS STILL DOING IT EIGHT TIMES </p>
<p begin="00:01:47.107" end="00:01:47.441">A WEEK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.441" end="00:01:48.609">I DON&apos;T KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.609" end="00:01:50.210">&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE YOU DOING THE SHOW TONIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.210" end="00:01:52.179">&gt;&gt; NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.179" end="00:01:53.847">MONDAY IS OUR NIGHT OFF.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.847" end="00:01:56.683">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU GET ONE NIGHT OFF IN EIGHT SHOWS A WEEK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.683" end="00:02:01.355">WELL, THAT IS THE LACYIEST THING I&apos;VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.355" end="00:02:07.728">TRY DOING FOUR 22 MINUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.728" end="00:02:13.166">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S KIND OF SAD AND WE&apos;VE ALL HAD OUR GRIEVING PERIOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.166" end="00:02:15.669">IT&apos;S VERY EXCITING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.669" end="00:02:23.377">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS IT HARD AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A PART OF IT FOR TEN YEARS, DO YOU GET JADED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.377" end="00:02:27.114">IS IT HARD... DOES PEOPLE&apos;S ENTHUSIASM, ARE YOU LIKE, OH,</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.114" end="00:02:27.548">THAT&apos;S NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.548" end="00:02:30.083">&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.083" end="00:02:32.920">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT&apos;S MAGIC.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.920" end="00:02:34.655">&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.655" end="00:02:36.256">THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S KIND OF COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.256" end="00:02:41.094">THAT&apos;S WHAT&apos;S BEEN GREAT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN&apos;T GOTTEN JADED.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.094" end="00:02:43.664">WE WERE EXCITED TO GO TO WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.664" end="00:02:47.968">WE ALL LOVED OUR JOBS AND HAVING DIFFERENT DIRECTORS COME IN AND KEEP THINGS FRESH </p>
<p begin="00:02:47.968" end="00:02:50.404">AND WORK WITH THE AMAZING ACTORS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.404" end="00:02:55.576">IT&apos;S HARD TO GET JADED WHEN YOU&apos;RE A 14-YEAR-OLD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.576" end="00:02:57.711">IT CAN&apos;T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.711" end="00:02:59.112">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT IS PART OF IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:04.818">AS A 14-YEAR-OLD BEING JADED IS IN MANY WAYS YOUR JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.818" end="00:03:08.188">LIKE, GARY IS COMING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.188" end="00:03:09.957">WOW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.957" end="00:03:10.891">YOU&apos;RE 14.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.891" end="00:03:16.763">&gt;&gt; I KNOW BUT I DON&apos;T KNOW I&apos;VE BEEN GOOD AT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.763" end="00:03:19.132">THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT PEOPLE MY AGE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.132" end="00:03:24.104">I THINK WHAT IS LOVELY IS THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.104" end="00:03:28.709">I&apos;M ALWAYS AMAZED WHEN I MEET A PERSON MY OWN AGE WHO IS ENTHUSIASTIC AND EXCITED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:29.977">I ALWAYS LATCH ON THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.977" end="00:03:30.444">COOL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.444" end="00:03:36.316">YOU DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT THIS RIDICULOUS PRETENDING THAT YOU DON&apos;T CARE ABOUT STUFF.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.316" end="00:03:38.185">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT REMINDS ME OF STAR WARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.185" end="00:03:40.721">I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I&apos;M A 4-YEAR-OLD MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.721" end="00:03:46.593">AT A CERTAIN POINT GOING TO THE STAR WARS CONVENTIONS, YOU KNOW, BUT AS LONG AS MY SON </p>
<p begin="00:03:46.593" end="00:03:53.834">WILL DRESS UP LIKE OBI-WAN AND PROVIDE SOME TYPE OF COVER FOR ME, I DON&apos;T MIND.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.834" end="00:03:55.536">I&apos;M NOT JADED ABOUT IT AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.536" end="00:04:00.841">I FIND THESE MOVIES TO BE WONDERFUL MORALITY TALES WITH GREAT CHARACTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.841" end="00:04:05.479">&gt;&gt; AND THEY&apos;RE A HUGE AMOUNT OF FUN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.479" end="00:04:16.456">AMY, MY... AND THE OTHER DAY I&apos;M I&apos;VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR WEEKS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.456" end="00:04:18.592">I NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.592" end="00:04:25.732">I&apos;VE GOT TO TELL YOU I&apos;M A MASSIVE FAN WHICH IS A CARTOON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.732" end="00:04:28.902">NOT ONE PERSON HERE KNOWS IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.902" end="00:04:33.473">I&apos;M SCARED TO ADMIT THAT&apos;S PERHAPS NOT THE ONE THING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED ME TO PICK </p>
<p begin="00:04:33.473" end="00:04:35.742">OUT OF HER CATALOGUE OF WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.742" end="00:04:41.648">I SPENT THREE HOURS WITH THE CARTOONS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.648" end="00:04:45.252">THIS GIRL I REMEMBER ASKING HER AT THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY,</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.252" end="00:04:47.421">HOW DID YOU PREPARE FOR THIS SHOW?</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.421" end="00:04:49.456">SHE WANTEDED ME TO SAY, WELL,</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.456" end="00:04:53.160">I SIT IN A STABLE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:58.966">I WAS LIKE WELL I WATCH A CERTAIN THING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.966" end="00:05:02.269">&gt;&gt; Jon: I CAN TELL MY CHILDREN THEY&apos;RE GOING TO BE ACTORS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.269" end="00:05:04.037">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S ALL THE PREP YOU NEED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.037" end="00:05:05.539">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.539" end="00:05:09.743">HERE ARE THE REAL WORLD IMPLICATIONS OF HARRY POTTER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.743" end="00:05:14.748">WHEN WE&apos;RE HERE ON THE VERY PRISTINE 11th AVENUE AND 52nd STREET STUDIOS WHICH IS NEW </p>
<p begin="00:05:14.748" end="00:05:22.189">YORK&apos;S FAMED CRACK CORE DISTRICT, THIS IS A TOURNAMENT JUST THREE DAYS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.189" end="00:05:25.893">IT&apos;S A TOURNAMENT, REAL PEOPLE PLAYING IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.893" end="00:05:29.396">WE ASKED THEM TO SUBMIT SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.396" end="00:05:32.699">I WANT YOU TO SEE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.699" end="00:05:52.319">LOOK AT THAT ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.619" end="00:05:55.622">&gt;&gt; DO YOU FEEL ANY GUILT FROM OUR ONGOING VIRGINITY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.622" end="00:05:58.725">DO YOU ANY ANTI-WEDGEY SPELLS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.725" end="00:06:05.566">&gt;&gt; DAN IN THE BOOK IT WAS MENTIONED BUT NOT THE OTHER MOVIES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.566" end="00:06:09.102">&gt;&gt; CAN YOU TELL MY MOM TO PICK ME UP AT 5:00.</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.102" end="00:06:11.438">&gt;&gt; DID YOU EVER DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.438" end="00:06:16.376">WHAT IS &quot;DO IT&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.376" end="00:06:18.478">&gt;&gt; LET ME THINK.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.478" end="00:06:22.082">YES, I FEEL VERY GUILTY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.082" end="00:06:25.252">YOUR MUM HAS PROBABLY LEFT YOU THERE BY NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.252" end="00:06:27.454">I CAN&apos;T REMEMBER WHAT THE OTHER ONES WERE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.454" end="00:06:29.923">BUT THAT POOR KID THEY WERE LIKE TACKLING HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.923" end="00:06:31.358">&gt;&gt; Jon: I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.358" end="00:06:31.758">HE&apos;S 10.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.758" end="00:06:34.261">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S THE SNITCH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.261" end="00:06:36.330">SOMEBODY RUNS AROUND AS THE SNITCH.</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.330" end="00:06:37.831">POUNCED ON.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.831" end="00:06:41.401">&gt;&gt; Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT IS THE KID IN YELLOW.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.401" end="00:06:45.906">THERE&apos;S A GUY BEHIND HIM WIELDING THE BROOM LIKE A CLUB.</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.906" end="00:06:46.907">&gt;&gt; I DIDN&apos;T SEE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.907" end="00:06:50.310">&gt;&gt; Jon: LIKE CAPONE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.310" end="00:06:54.214">THIS BROOM GIVES ME ENTHUSIASM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.214" end="00:07:03.323">HAVE YOU ACTUALLY GONE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.323" end="00:07:06.226">&gt;&gt; WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN?</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.226" end="00:07:09.730">IT WOULD BE CHAOS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.730" end="00:07:11.298">I FOUND THE REAL....</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.298" end="00:07:13.233">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE MADNESS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.233" end="00:07:14.401">&gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.401" end="00:07:17.037">I THINK I&apos;D BE REALLY GOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.037" end="00:07:20.440">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;D BE, IN FACT, THE CHOSEN ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.440" end="00:07:22.042">&gt;&gt; NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.042" end="00:07:25.679">&gt;&gt; Jon: HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.679" end="00:07:27.915">IF YOU DON&apos;T KNOW, IT IS IN THE THEATERS RIGHT NOW.</p>
