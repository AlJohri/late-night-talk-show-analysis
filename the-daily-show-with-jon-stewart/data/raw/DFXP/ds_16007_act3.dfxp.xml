<p begin="00:02:35.022" end="00:02:39.860">YOU NEED TO TONE THAT DOWN BECAUSE YOU WILL UNHINGE PEOPLE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.860" end="00:02:43.063">MY QUESTION IS MORE:  IS THAT REALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.063" end="00:02:45.632">IS THE RHETORIC OF THE PARTY MATCHING?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.632" end="00:02:50.737">HERE IS WHY:  THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT </p>

<p begin="00:02:53.974" end="00:03:05.452">BUT THE PANIC AND THE REACTION THAT IT HAS SET OFF DOES SEEM FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT TO SOME EXTENT.</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.706" end="00:04:06.446">WE HAVE RIGHT AND LEFT, A LOT OF VITRIOL BOTH WAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.446" end="00:04:09.183">ALL OF US COULD BENEFIT FROM A MORE INFORMED DEBATE.</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:20.641">IS IT ABOUT THROWING STONES AND TAKEN OVER BY FORCE?</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.641" end="00:07:23.777">MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE GETS NUDGED OUT OF THE WAY.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.777" end="00:07:26.013">YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT&apos;S A CONTINUUM.</p>
