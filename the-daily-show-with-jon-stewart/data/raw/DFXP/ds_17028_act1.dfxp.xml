<p begin="00:06:47.307" end="00:06:52.746">BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT WAS LENDING BANKS MONEY AT NO INTEREST, AND THEN BORROWING </p>
<p begin="00:06:52.746" end="00:06:57.784">IT BACK FROM THE BANKS AT INTEREST.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.784" end="00:07:01.188">OUR GOVERNMENT IS THE WORLD&apos;S DUMBEST LOAN SHARK.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.188" end="00:07:09.763">(LAUGHTER) THE GOVERNMENT WAS SELLING DOLLAR BILLS TO THE BANKS FOR 97 CENTS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.763" end="00:07:19.806">AND THE BANKS HAD THE BALLS TO BONUS THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR BEING SMART ENOUGH TO GO,</p>
