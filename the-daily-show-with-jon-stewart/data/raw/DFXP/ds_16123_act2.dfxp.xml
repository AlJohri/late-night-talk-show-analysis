<p begin="00:00:07.174" end="00:00:08.542">I&apos;M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.542" end="00:00:09.810">WE&apos;RE IN A RECESSION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.810" end="00:00:11.044">I&apos;M NOT GOING THE LIE TO YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.044" end="00:00:13.547">BUT THERE&apos;S ONE GROUP OF AMERICANS DOING QUITE WELL,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.547" end="00:00:16.416">CORPORATION, AND THERE&apos;S NO REASON YOU CAN&apos;T BE MORE LIKE THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.416" end="00:00:17.150">SAMANTHA BEE HAS MORE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.150" end="00:00:21.555">&gt;&gt; THESE ARE THE SARNACOLAS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.555" end="00:00:23.056">STACY IS A SCHOOLTEACHER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.056" end="00:00:24.191">RODNEY WAS LAID OFF FROM WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.191" end="00:00:29.263">LIKE SO MANY AMERICANS, THIS ECONOMY HAS LEFT THEM STRUGGLING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SEE </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.263" end="00:00:30.230">CORPORATIONS DOING THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.230" end="00:00:34.902">&gt;&gt; EXXON IS EXPECTED TO RING UP $114 BILLION IN REVENUE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.902" end="00:00:36.069">&gt;&gt; AND THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.069" end="00:00:38.906">&gt;&gt; G.E. PAID NO FEDERAL CORPORATE TAXES LAST YEAR.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.906" end="00:00:40.374">&gt;&gt; AND THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.374" end="00:00:45.379">&gt;&gt; CITIGROUP GOT THE LARGEST BANK BAILOUT, $45 BILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.379" end="00:00:51.018">&gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THE SARNACOLAS TO BE BITTER, BUT REMEMBER...</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.018" end="00:00:52.486">&gt;&gt; CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.486" end="00:00:56.323">&gt;&gt; SO IF CORPORATIONS CAN BE PEOPLE, WHY CAN&apos;T PEOPLE LIKE </p>
<p begin="00:00:56.323" end="00:01:00.260">THE SARNACOLAS BE CORPORATIONS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.260" end="00:01:02.062">I KNOW YOU&apos;VE BEEN HIT SO HARD,</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.062" end="00:01:07.768">BUT YOU&apos;RE ABOUT TO GET HIT EVEN HARDER WITH A HUGE CAN OF YOU&apos;RE WELCOME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.768" end="00:01:11.939">YOU&apos;RE NO LONGER THE SARNACOLAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:14.675">NOW YOU&apos;RE AMERIFAM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.675" end="00:01:20.414">WE ASKED CORPORATE EXPERT ROBERT WISEMAN TO HELP US GIVE THIS FAMILY THE ADVANTAGES OF CORPORATEHOOD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.414" end="00:01:24.985">&gt;&gt; WELL, ONE OF THE FIRST THING THAT CORPORATIONS LIKE TO DO IS LAY OFF SOME OF THEIR WORKERS </p>
<p begin="00:01:24.985" end="00:01:26.854">AND SQUEEZE THE ONES LEFT BEHIND.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.854" end="00:01:30.924">&gt;&gt; CISCO JUST RAISED PROFITS BY GETTING RID OF 7,000 WORKERS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.924" end="00:01:36.096">LOOKS LIKE IT&apos;S TIME FOR US TO TRIM THE AMERIFAM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.096" end="00:01:39.566">SO, CHILDREN, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELVES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.566" end="00:01:42.402">DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.402" end="00:01:43.437">&gt;&gt; RIDING MY BIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.437" end="00:01:47.708">&gt;&gt; ANDREW, DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.708" end="00:01:48.108">&gt;&gt; PLAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.108" end="00:01:50.777">&gt;&gt; OKAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.777" end="00:01:55.115">I&apos;M SORRY, ANDREW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.115" end="00:01:56.116">&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.116" end="00:01:56.416">ANDREW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.416" end="00:01:56.850">YOU&apos;RE FIRED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:01:59.786">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE FIRED.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.786" end="00:02:01.822">THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.822" end="00:02:03.524">SO WE&apos;VE STREAMLINED THE FAMILY,</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.524" end="00:02:05.626">BUT WE&apos;VE STILL GOT ALL THIS PESKY DEBT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.626" end="00:02:07.561">NO PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.561" end="00:02:15.068">&gt;&gt; ONE THING CORPORATIONS LIKE TO DO IS PUSH UP ALL THEIR DEBT ON OFF-THE-BOOK SUBSIDIARIES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.068" end="00:02:17.471">&gt;&gt; HAND NARCOTICS DO YOU DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOUR FAMILY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.471" end="00:02:17.871">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:28.415">GOOD-BYE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:30.250">OKAY.</p>

<p begin="00:02:50.137" end="00:02:56.977">&gt;&gt; PERHAPS AMERIFAM SHOULD OUTSOURCE TO FIND LABOR TO DO MORE FOR LESS.</p>
