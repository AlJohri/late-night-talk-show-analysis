<p begin="00:01:33.327" end="00:01:35.662">WE ARE GOING TO NEED A HERO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.662" end="00:01:40.801">&gt;&gt; MOST OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION WILL BE PROPOSED BY A SO-CALLED SUPER COMMITTEE.</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.425" end="00:03:15.662">SECOND, THE DEFICIT REDUCTION SUPER COMMITTEE IS GOING TO END UP LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.662" end="00:03:19.633">THERE WAS LAST YEAR&apos;S BOWLES-SIMPSON COMMISSION,</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.633" end="00:03:20.734">PROPOSALSED $4 TRILLION.</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.754" end="00:03:43.190">THIS TIME FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.190" end="00:03:47.895">&gt;&gt; IF THIS SUPER COMMITTEE FAILS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT CONGRESS PASSES INTO LAW, THAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:47.895" end="00:03:54.868">SET OFF A TRIGGER, AUTOMATICALLY CUTTING $1.2 TRILLION FROM THE PENTAGON, MEDICARE PROVIDERS AND </p>

<p begin="00:03:55.602" end="00:03:58.105">&gt;&gt; THIS PLAN CALLS FOR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.105" end="00:04:00.741">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S REALLY THE NEW DOOMSDAY SCENARIO.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.741" end="00:04:06.079">&gt;&gt; YOU CAN ALMOST SEE THE TRAIN WRECK COMING ON THIS.</p>

<p begin="00:05:02.336" end="00:05:09.610">AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS DEFICIT REDUCTION PROCESS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER PROCESSES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.610" end="00:05:15.616">CONGRESS ITSELF HAS CREATED A MECHANISM BY WHICH FAILURE TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL WOULD </p>
<p begin="00:05:15.616" end="00:05:18.886">TRIGGER CATASTROPHIC, AUTOMATIC CUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.886" end="00:05:23.290">IT IS IRONCLAD, A DECREE SENT DOWN FROM SINAI THEMSELVES.</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.170" end="00:05:38.138">TRIGGERS CAN&apos;T BE UNTRIGGERRED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.138" end="00:05:40.707">&gt;&gt; TRININGERS CAN BE UNTRIGGERRED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.707" end="00:05:44.378">&gt;&gt; LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID HE&apos;LL INTRODUCE A BILL TO REPEAL THE TRIGGER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.378" end="00:05:49.583">&gt;&gt; SENATOR TOOMEY IS SUGGESTING MAYBE THERE WILL NOT BE THOSE AUTOMATIC CUTS.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.583" end="00:05:51.118">&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU KNOW, CONGRESS,</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.118" end="00:05:53.320">THIS IS WHY PEOPLE DON&apos;T LIKE YOU.</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.843" end="00:06:18.278">WELL, WE&apos;RE ALREADY UNDER 55.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.278" end="00:06:20.514">ANOTHER HOW ABOUT 50 MILES AN HOUR?</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.514" end="00:06:22.683">( LAUGHTER ) CAN YOU MAKE IT 45?</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.683" end="00:06:27.955">SURE, WHATEVER, THERE&apos;S NO ( BLEEP ) BOMB, IS WHAT I&apos;M SAYING.</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.799" end="00:06:42.469">IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THESE FOLKS CAN ACTUALLY GET DONE?</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.469" end="00:06:47.407">&gt;&gt; CONGRESS RELEASED A NEW SPENDING BILL LAST NIGHT THAT CHANGES PRESIDENT OBAMA&apos;S PLANS </p>
<p begin="00:06:47.407" end="00:06:50.310">TO MAKE SCHOOL LUNCHES HEALTHIER.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.310" end="00:06:55.516">THE NEW BILL KEEPS FRENCH FRIES ON THE MENU AT SCHOOL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.516" end="00:07:04.324">IT ERIS RACES THE REQUIREMENT TO BOOST WHOLE GRAINS AND CALLS THE TOMATO PASTE ON PIZZAS A VEGETABLE.</p>
