<p begin="00:00:21.221" end="00:00:23.290">&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.290" end="00:00:24.925">MY NAME IS JON STEWART.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.925" end="00:00:26.627">WE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.627" end="00:00:28.095">I&apos;M EXCITED.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.095" end="00:00:31.465">MR. CLINT EASTWOOD IS GOING TO BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.465" end="00:00:33.066">WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.066" end="00:00:36.537">CLINT EASTWOOD WILL BE HERE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.537" end="00:00:41.441">WE&apos;LL SWAP STORIES ABOUT BEING ICONIC BAD ASSES OR AT LEAST ONE OF US.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.441" end="00:00:44.545">THEN I&apos;LL JUST SIT THERE AND GO, YOU&apos;RE SWELL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.545" end="00:00:50.484">AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS VIEW MITT ROMNEY AS THE GREAT WHITE </p>
<p begin="00:00:50.484" end="00:00:54.855">NOTE AND HAVE THEREFORE STRUGGLED DESPERATELY FOR VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO MITT </p>
<p begin="00:00:54.855" end="00:01:00.227">ROMNEY EVEN GOING SO FAR TO PRETEND IT MIGHT BE MICHELE BACHMANN.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.227" end="00:01:08.435">RECENTLY HERMAN CAIN EMERGED AS THE LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO THE SCHNOOK OF MORMON.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.435" end="00:01:13.373">TODAY SHARON BIALEK ACCUSED CAIN OF OFFERING HER A JOB IN RETURN FOR ORAL SEX BACK IN </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.373" end="00:01:14.374">THE &apos;90s.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.374" end="00:01:19.246">A SERIOUS CHARGE SOMEWHAT UNDERCUT BY HER UNFORTUNATELY CHOSEN LAWYER AND LOCATION,</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.246" end="00:01:21.682">THE FRIAR&apos;S CLUB.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.682" end="00:01:25.385">&gt;&gt; SHE REACHED OUT TO MR. CAIN FOR HELP IN FINDING ANOTHER JOB.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.385" end="00:01:31.525">INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THE HELP SHE HAD HOPED FOR, MR. CAIN INSTEAD DECIDED TO PROVIDE HER </p>
<p begin="00:01:31.525" end="00:01:44.872">WITH HIS IDEA OF A STIMULUS PACKAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.872" end="00:01:46.006">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.006" end="00:01:51.478">THEN HE ASKED HER IF SHE WANTED TO OCCUPY BALL STREET.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.478" end="00:01:55.816">OH, DOCTOR.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.816" end="00:02:01.588">NOW THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR CAIN WHO IS ALREADY TRYING TO MOVE ON FROM THE SCANDAL OVER THE </p>
<p begin="00:02:01.588" end="00:02:06.059">WEEKEND AS YOU SEE IN THIS HILARIOUSLY EYE RONIC VIDEO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.059" end="00:02:11.198">&gt;&gt; MR. CAIN, ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT....</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.198" end="00:02:12.099">&gt;&gt; DON&apos;T EVEN GO THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.099" end="00:02:13.500">&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK MY QUESTION?</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:14.168">&gt;&gt; NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.168" end="00:02:16.370">THE FACT THAT THESE WOMEN DO WANT TO....</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.370" end="00:02:17.371">&gt;&gt; WHAT DID I SAY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.371" end="00:02:18.805">&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT....</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.805" end="00:02:20.541">&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.541" end="00:02:22.843">EXCUSE ME.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.843" end="00:02:31.285">WHAT PART OF NO DON&apos;T SOME PEOPLE UNDERSTAND?</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.285" end="00:02:38.492">&gt;&gt; Jon: I BELIEVE WHAT HERMAN CAIN IS SAYING IS NO MEANS NO.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.492" end="00:02:40.093">AND I KNOW WHAT YOU&apos;RE GOING TO SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.093" end="00:02:42.462">YOU&apos;RE GOING TO GO, OH, LOOK AT THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.462" end="00:02:44.898">YOU&apos;RE GOING TO SAY LOOK AT HERMAN CAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.898" end="00:02:50.370">LOOK AT HOW HERMAN CAIN IS DRESSED WITH THAT SUIT SURROUNDED BY ALL THOSE MICROPHONES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:52.372">HE&apos;S ASKING FOR IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.372" end="00:02:55.909">IT, OF COURSE, BEING HEIGHTENED MEDIA SCRUTINY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.909" end="00:03:02.149">CAIN HAD HAD SOME SUCCESS IN CONTROLLING THE DAMAGE BY GOING ALL OUT AGAINST THE MEDIA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.149" end="00:03:07.721">&gt;&gt; THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA THAT ARE DOWNRIGHT DISHONEST.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.721" end="00:03:12.593">NOT ALL BUT TOO MANY OF THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.593" end="00:03:16.129">IF THERE IS A JOURNALISTIC STANDARD, A LOT OF THEM DON&apos;T FOLLOW IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.129" end="00:03:22.269">AND AS A RESULT TOO MANY PEOPLE GET MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.269" end="00:03:32.846">&gt;&gt; Jon: PEOPLE WHO GET DIRECTIONS TO A CIRCUMSTANCE SITUATION GET BRIS-INFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.846" end="00:03:40.721">PEOPLE WHO GET JEAN SIMMONS TOUR DATES GET KISS-INFORMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.721" end="00:03:47.928">THE ACID CONTENT OF YOUR BLADDER IS WELL, I THINK YOU GET THE IDEA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.928" end="00:03:52.132">BUT, SEE, HERE&apos;S THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.132" end="00:03:54.635">I OWE TIM MONEY IS WHAT I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.635" end="00:04:00.674">THE PROBLEM FOR CAIN EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL TYPICAL MEDIA (BEEP)....</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.674" end="00:04:05.312">&gt;&gt; JUST WHO IS HERMAN CAIN&apos;S WIFE AND WHY HASN&apos;T SHE SAID ANYTHING YET?</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.312" end="00:04:09.783">&gt;&gt; Jon: BRING US THE WIFE OF THE ACCUSED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.783" end="00:04:16.590">SO THAT WE MAY THROW TOMATOES AT HER AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:25.165">THE PROBLEM FOR CAIN IS THAT FOR THE MOST PART THE BIG GET OF THE POLITICAL STORY WAS TRUE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.165" end="00:04:29.636">THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION DID PAY A BUNCH OF MONEY TO TWO LADIES TO SETTLE </p>
<p begin="00:04:29.636" end="00:04:32.639">HARASSMENT CLAIMS AGAINST HERMAN CAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:37.344">WHICH BY THE WAY EVEN HERMAN CAIN SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT IN 2003.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.344" end="00:04:40.848">&gt;&gt; IN 2003 HERMAN CAIN RAN FOR THE SENATE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.848" end="00:04:43.183">HE HIRED A GENERAL CONSULTANT,</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.183" end="00:04:45.085">KURT ANDERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.085" end="00:04:49.423">MR. CAIN DIVULGED THE N.R.A.CLAIMS AT THAT TIME TO HIS GENERAL CONSULTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.423" end="00:04:50.858">&gt;&gt; THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.858" end="00:04:52.092">&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.092" end="00:04:52.492">MR. ANDERSON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.492" end="00:04:56.964">SO THE CAMPAIGN AT THAT POINT WOULD BE PREPARED IF THE ISSUE SURFACED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.964" end="00:05:05.839">&gt;&gt; Jon: BY 2011, HIS MEMORY HADï¿½r BECOME... ALL FADED.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.839" end="00:05:08.475">&gt;&gt; I AM UNAWARE OF ANY SORT OF SETTLEMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.475" end="00:05:11.411">I HOPE IT WASN&apos;T FOR MUCH BECAUSE I DIDN&apos;T DO ANYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.411" end="00:05:13.146">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, YOU DIDN&apos;T?</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.146" end="00:05:19.953">THAT&apos;S TOO BAD BECAUSE THEY PAID HER $482 MILLION.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.953" end="00:05:26.560">AND THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH HERMAN CAIN&apos;S BLAME THE MEDIA STORY LINE IS THAT THE FIRST </p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:29.196">PLACE CABLE NEWS NETWORK IS DOING THE BEST TO HELP HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.196" end="00:05:34.434">&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK OTHERS IN THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN GIVING TOO MUCH CREDENCE TO THESE RIGHT </p>
<p begin="00:05:34.434" end="00:05:36.069">NOW ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS?</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.069" end="00:05:41.542">POLITICO CHOSE NOT TO NAME THE WOMEN INVOLVED IN THESE TWO CASES WHICH I FOUND INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.542" end="00:05:44.077">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.077" end="00:05:49.516">ANYONE WHO USED ANONYMOUS SOURCES SHOULD BE DRUMMED OUT OF JUMBLISM UNLESS....</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.516" end="00:05:56.390">&gt;&gt; AN UNNAMED SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TELLS POLITICO THE UNION FLUSHED TEN MILLION </p>
<p begin="00:05:56.390" end="00:06:00.060">OF THEIR MEMBERS&apos; MONEY DOWN THE TOILET ON A POINTLESS EXERCISE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.060" end="00:06:00.727">THAT&apos;S A QUOTE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.727" end="00:06:03.397">MANY BELIEVE IT&apos;S FROM RAHM EMANUEL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.397" end="00:06:06.366">ALL POLITICO SAYS IS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.366" end="00:06:10.604">IS THE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND ORGANIZED LABOR OVER?</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.604" end="00:06:12.372">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU&apos;RE JUST GOING TO RUN WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.372" end="00:06:13.207">ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.207" end="00:06:17.044">TO BE FAIR THAT&apos;S NOT ANONYMOUS, OF COURSE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.044" end="00:06:19.479">MANY BELIEVE IT&apos;S RAHM EMANUEL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.479" end="00:06:21.048">THAT WAS KIND OF EASY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.048" end="00:06:24.184">A LOT OF POLITICAL STORIES USE ANONYMOUS SOURCING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.184" end="00:06:29.790">THE REAL TRICK FOR OUR CRACK RESEARCH TEAM WOULD BE TO USE ANONYMOUS SOURCES TO DISCREDIT </p>
<p begin="00:06:29.790" end="00:06:34.328">A REPORT YOU HAVE DISMISSED BECAUSE IT HAS USED ANONYMOUS SOURCES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.328" end="00:06:36.930">BUT TO FIND A CLIP LIKE THAT,</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.930" end="00:06:39.266">IT WOULD BE LIKE THE HOLY GRAIL.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.266" end="00:06:41.368">A PIPE DREAM.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.368" end="00:06:43.437">ROLL THAT CLIP.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.437" end="00:06:46.240">&gt;&gt; THE STORY CAME FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:51.411">SO IF THAT THEORY IS TRUE WE SHOULD GO BACK AND SAY WELL THEN HOW DID THIS STORY EVER </p>
<p begin="00:06:51.411" end="00:06:55.549">SURFACE BECAUSE DID IT COME FROM SOURCES WHO WILL GO ON THE RECORD?</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.549" end="00:06:55.816">NO.</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.816" end="00:06:59.386">I DON&apos;T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY WITH FINDING OUT WHO PLANTED THE </p>
<p begin="00:06:59.386" end="00:07:03.023">STORY AND HAPPY WITH THE PERSON WHO DID IT.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.023" end="00:07:06.793">&gt;&gt; THE WORD IS FROM THE WASHINGTON TIMES THAT ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WHOSE </p>
<p begin="00:07:06.793" end="00:07:11.031">FRIENDS WITH THE CAIN CAMP NOT ONLY IS RICK PERRY CAMPAIGN INVOLVED BUT THE MAYOR OF </p>
<p begin="00:07:11.031" end="00:07:17.204">CHICAGO, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF RAHM EMANUEL IS LIKELY INVOLVED WITH THE SEXUAL </p>
<p begin="00:07:17.204" end="00:07:23.377">HARASSMENT ACCUSER ATTACKS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.377" end="00:07:25.746">&gt;&gt; Jon: ANONYMOUS SOURCES ARE HORRIBLE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.746" end="00:07:26.180">I KNOW.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.180" end="00:07:31.885">THIS ANONYMOUS SOURCE SAYS THE CODE OF JOURNALISM IS SIMPLY THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.885" end="00:07:34.788">IT&apos;S NOT OKAY TO USE AN ANONYMOUS SOURCE.</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.788" end="00:07:38.425">UNLESS IT&apos;S ABOUT RAHM EMANUEL.</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.425" end="00:07:39.426">WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK.</p>
