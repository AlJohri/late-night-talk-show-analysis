<p begin="00:00:04.004" end="00:00:08.709">YOU KNOW, SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER REMINDED ME OF ONE OF THE INTERVIEWS WE DID IN A BOOK </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.709" end="00:00:09.810">WITH SUSAN JACOBI.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.810" end="00:00:16.783">YOU WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF KEEPING THINGS HIDDEN AND THE LANGUAGE OF DECEPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.783" end="00:00:22.456">IT SEEMS LIKE THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE IS NOW THE LANGUAGE OF DECEPTION, AND NEWS MEDIA, WHOSE </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.456" end="00:00:35.569">JOB IT WOULD BE TO DEFOG THE ROOM, ARE PRETENDING THAT THEY CAN JUST NOT EVEN REFEREE BUT I </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.569" end="00:00:38.405">DON&apos;T KNOW, MOD RATED WOULDN&apos;T BE THE RIGHT WORD, NARRATE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.405" end="00:00:44.077">IT SEEMS LIKE THE NEWS MEDIA TODAY JUST FAR -- NARRATES AS OPPOSED TO ANYTHING ELSE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.077" end="00:00:46.380">&gt;&gt; THEY&apos;RE NARRATING THEIR IMPRESSION.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.380" end="00:00:49.516">THEY&apos;RE NOT REPORTING ABOUT THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.516" end="00:00:54.821">SUSAN JACOBI IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTERVIEWS ABOUT HER BECAUSE SHE&apos;S THE AUTHOR OF A </p>
<p begin="00:00:54.821" end="00:00:57.457">BOOK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.457" end="00:00:59.326">THEY&apos;RE THE REBELS AND THE PROTESTERS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.326" end="00:01:01.061">AND SHE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.061" end="00:01:05.566">IN FACT, I DON&apos;T LIKE TO INTERVIEW... I ADMIRE WHAT POLITICIANS DORK BUT I DON&apos;T </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.566" end="00:01:08.802">LIKE TO INTERVIEW THEM BECAUSE THEIR LANGUAGE IS DESIGNED TO CONCEAL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.802" end="00:01:11.605">I LIKE TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE WHO WANT THE REVEAL THEIR THINKING,</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.605" end="00:01:14.074">AND I THINK THAT&apos;S WHAT WORKS WITH YOU AS WELL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.074" end="00:01:14.975">PEOPLE WANT TO TALK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.975" end="00:01:15.809">THEY WILL TALK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.809" end="00:01:23.417">THEY WON&apos;T TRY TO PUT IT IN THAT SMOKE AND FOG OF DECEPTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.417" end="00:01:27.087">POLITICS, NEWT GINGRICH, BLESS HIS HEART, GOT IN TROUBLE ON </p>
<p begin="00:01:27.087" end="00:01:28.488">&quot;MEET THE PRESS&quot; BY SPEAKING THE TRUTH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.488" end="00:01:32.125">YOU CAN&apos;T SPEAK THE TRUTH ON TELEVISION TODAY BECAUSE SOMEBODY WILL FIND A WAY TO TURN </p>
<p begin="00:01:32.125" end="00:01:37.130">IT AGAINST YOU, AND THAT&apos;S WHY PEOPLE ARE VERY CAUTIOUS, VERY </p>
<p begin="00:01:37.130" end="00:01:38.665">CAREFUL, THEY&apos;RE NOT WILLING TO ENGAGE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.665" end="00:01:40.901">WE&apos;RE NOT EVEN HERE TALKING ABOUT THE WORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.901" end="00:01:44.004">BOTH OF US ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE MEANING OF EACH OF US,</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.004" end="00:01:45.839">TRYING TO GET TO THE MEANING BEHIND THE WORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.839" end="00:01:50.477">THAT&apos;S WHERE THE INTERVIEW BECOMES A CONVERSATION, WHEN BOTH OF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE </p>
<p begin="00:01:50.477" end="00:01:51.211">COMFORTABLE IN EXPLORING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.211" end="00:01:54.248">&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU DO IN THAT SITUATION?</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.248" end="00:01:55.482">THIS IS&apos;DING AWAY AT ME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.482" end="00:01:59.653">WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY ON THERE THAT YOU WANT SO DESPERATELY TO ENGAGE IN THAT MANNER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.653" end="00:02:01.822">WE HAD DONALD RUMSFELD ON OUR SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.822" end="00:02:06.827">I CAN HONESTLY SAY I BELIEVE I LOST MORE SLEEP OVER THAT INTERVIEW THAN HE PROBABLY DID </p>
<p begin="00:02:06.827" end="00:02:08.962">OVER THE ENTIRE IRAQ WAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.962" end="00:02:09.363">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.363" end="00:02:10.597">DURING THE INTERVIEW, THOUGH,</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.597" end="00:02:12.266">IT&apos;S VERY EARLY ON, AND HE SAYS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.266" end="00:02:18.906">I SAY TO HIM, SO THE ADMINISTRATION SELLS US THIS IDEA OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.906" end="00:02:23.177">&quot;IF I MAY, NOT SOLD, PRESENTED.&quot; IT WAS EARLY ON.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.177" end="00:02:25.612">AND I JUST WENT PAST IT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.612" end="00:02:27.648">AND THAT NIGHT AROUND 2:00 A.M.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.648" end="00:02:31.185">WHERE I DO MY BEST WORK -- </p>
<p begin="00:02:31.185" end="00:02:31.685">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.685" end="00:02:36.690">I WAS THINKING, THAT WAS THE INTERCESSORY VIEW, IN THE SPACE BETWEEN OUR DEFINITIONS OF WHAT </p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:40.360">THEY DID, SOLD AND PRESENTED,</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.360" end="00:02:44.331">AND HOW DO YOU ACCOMPLISH THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.331" end="00:02:48.669">HOW DO YOU FIND THOSE SPACES AND CAN YOU AND HOW DO YOU LET IT GO?</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.669" end="00:02:52.873">&gt;&gt; WELL, MOST OF MY GUESTS ARE NOT ON THE SHOW TO MAKE NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.873" end="00:02:54.274">THEY&apos;RE ON THE EXPLAIN THE NEWS,</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.274" end="00:02:56.210">TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.210" end="00:02:59.112">SO THERE&apos;S IN GAME PLAN THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.112" end="00:03:02.049">THEY&apos;RE NOT TRYING TO FIND THAT EDGE THAT WILL CREATE A HEADLINE </p>
<p begin="00:03:02.049" end="00:03:03.884">IN TOMORROW MORNING&apos;S PAPER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.884" end="00:03:08.088">THEY&apos;RE REALLY TRYING TO HELP US PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.088" end="00:03:13.760">YOU KNOW, THE WORST HOUR THAT I EVER PUT ON WAS MANY YEARS AGO WITH HENRY KISSINGER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:14.461">HE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.461" end="00:03:16.263">HE GRANTED ME AN INTERVIEW.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.263" end="00:03:22.970">ALL HE DID [GRUMBLING]</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.970" end="00:03:24.938">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.938" end="00:03:28.308">IT WAS ELOQUENT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.308" end="00:03:28.709">[GRUMBLING]</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:30.477">I DIDN&apos;T UNDERSTAND A WORD HE WAS SAYING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.477" end="00:03:32.079">YES, MR. KISSINGER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.079" end="00:03:33.080">BUT I ALREADY ANNOUNCED IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:39.386">I HAD TO PUT IT ON THE AIRMENT I VOWED AFTER THAT NEVER TO DO AN HOUR WITH ANY OFFICIAL BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.386" end="00:03:41.355">THEY&apos;RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOU DON&apos;T UNDERSTAND WHAT </p>
<p begin="00:03:41.355" end="00:03:46.426">THEY SAY, EVEN THOUGH THEY USE SIMPLE WORDS TO EXPRESS IT SOMETIMES.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.426" end="00:03:53.634">WHAT YOU DO IS, WELL, HERE&apos;S MY TECHNIQUE, AND IN 40 YEARS, I&apos;VE NEVER BEEN CALLED ON IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.634" end="00:03:55.969">I INTERVIEW IN LECH, AND THEN I EDIT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.969" end="00:04:01.341">I MAKE SURE THAT WE IN THE EDITING GET TO THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THAT PERSON REALLY WANTED TO SAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.341" end="00:04:04.278">IT&apos;S MATTER OF JUDGMENT, BUT IN 40 YEARS, I&apos;VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY </p>
<p begin="00:04:04.278" end="00:04:08.749">COME BACK AND SAY, YOU TOOK ME OUT OF CONTEXT OR YOU DIDN&apos;T GET TO THE ESSENCE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.749" end="00:04:13.620">THEY ARE ACTUALLY THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE LISTENED IN A WAY THAT IS BEYOND THE WORDS AND THEN </p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:18.892">EDITED WHAT IS THEIR VIEW OF WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE SAID IF THEY WERE AS GOOD AS IT AS WE </p>
<p begin="00:04:18.892" end="00:04:23.230">ARE IN EDITING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.230" end="00:04:24.731">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.731" end="00:04:29.102">YOU LISTEN FOR THE MEANING, NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE WORDS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.102" end="00:04:30.704">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU SAID IT BEAUTIFULLY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.704" end="00:04:37.477">THAT&apos;S THE OTHER THING I SHOULD WRITE DOWN, &quot;EDIT TO NOT TAKE OUT OF CONTEXT.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:04:37.477" end="00:04:37.878">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.878" end="00:04:38.712">&gt;&gt; ALWAYS A PLEASURE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.712" end="00:04:41.181">&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
