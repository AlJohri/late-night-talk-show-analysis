<p begin="00:00:06.206" end="00:00:07.941">LAST FRIDAY WAS A VERY EXCITING DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.941" end="00:00:12.079">SAW THE RELEASE OF THE USA&apos;S MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT, A!  K </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.079" end="00:00:19.319">A, THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN&apos;S... HOW DID THAT GO?</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.319" end="00:00:23.257">&gt;&gt; ONLY 69,000 JOBS WERE ADDED TO AMERICA&apos;S WORK FORCE LAST MONTH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.257" end="00:00:27.294">THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSING DOWN ABOUT 270 POINTS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.294" end="00:00:30.297">&gt;&gt; THE NEWS HIT THE STOCK MARKET LIKE A PUNCH TO THE GUT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.297" end="00:00:31.765">&gt;&gt; NOWHERE TO HIDE ON THIS ONE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.765" end="00:00:33.233">A POLITICAL STOMACH PUNCH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.233" end="00:00:36.370">&gt;&gt; AND A BODY BLOW TO CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.370" end="00:00:39.740">&gt;&gt; Jon: A FISCAL KICK IN THE BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.740" end="00:00:44.645">ECONOMIC INDICATOR OF KICKED BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.645" end="00:00:51.685">A DOWNTURN IN EVERYTHING BUT THE AMOUNT OF PAIN OF AMERICA&apos;S RECENTLY KICKED BALLS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.685" end="00:00:52.819">BAD NEWS, CRAPPY NEWS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.819" end="00:00:54.321">YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.321" end="00:00:58.559">TIME FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO PLAY ANOTHER ROUND OF AMERICA&apos;S MOST FRAYING </p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:02.362">RESIDENT GAME SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.362" end="00:01:02.863">HEY, EVERYBODY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.863" end="00:01:06.900">YOU KNOW THE RULES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:12.072">THE OBAMA TEAM MUST FIND THE BEST WAYS TO SPIN THIS TURD INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.072" end="00:01:14.241">TOP SEVEN ANSWERS ON THE BOARD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.241" end="00:01:15.776">LET&apos;S PLAY THE TURD.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.776" end="00:01:19.947">&gt;&gt; THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE 27 MONTHS STRAIGHT OF JOB GROWTH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.947" end="00:01:20.380">&gt;&gt; Jon: NICE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.380" end="00:01:22.583">EVEN THOUGH JOB GROWTH FAILED TO KEEP UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH,</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.583" end="00:01:28.355">THERE WERE AGAIN TECHNICALLY MORE JOBS LAST MONTH THAN THE PREVIOUS MONTH.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.355" end="00:01:31.692">ONE OF THE GREATEST PURVEYORS OF THESE SORTS OF GAME SHOWS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.692" end="00:01:34.394">WE&apos;RE LOOKING FOR TRUE BUT STILL </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.394" end="00:01:34.728">[BLEEP]</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.728" end="00:01:38.332">&gt;&gt; THE SURVEY SAYS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.332" end="00:01:39.766">Jon: THE NUMBER THREE ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.766" end="00:01:41.235">TRUE BUT STILL [BLEEP].</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.235" end="00:01:45.138">THERE ARE TWO SHINIER WAYS TO POLISH THIS TURD UP.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.138" end="00:01:46.373">WHO IS NEXT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.373" end="00:01:49.710">&gt;&gt; THE NATIONAL NUMBERS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS ANY OF US WOULD LIKE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:52.346">THIS WILL NOT BE DECIDED IN CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK OR ILLINOIS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.346" end="00:01:54.982">IT WILL BE DECIDED IN FLORIDA,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.982" end="00:02:01.088">VIRGINIA, OHIO, IOWA AND IN STATES THAT REALLY HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN MANUFACTURING JOBS IN PARTICULAR.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.088" end="00:02:03.056">I THINK THERE&apos;S A POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.056" end="00:02:04.691">&gt;&gt; Jon: I SEE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.691" end="00:02:10.397">LESS OF A TURD POLICY AND MORE OF A [BLEEP], UNLESS YOU LIVE IN A SWING STATE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.397" end="00:02:10.764">RICHARD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.764" end="00:02:14.601">&gt;&gt; THE SURVEY SAYS...</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.601" end="00:02:16.403">Jon: OH, THE NUMBER 4 ANSWER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.403" end="00:02:18.138">NUMBER ONE ANSWER STILL ON THE BOARD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.138" end="00:02:18.906">NEXT CONTESTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.906" end="00:02:22.743">HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO POLISH THAT TURD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.743" end="00:02:25.746">&gt;&gt; IN THE ASS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.746" end="00:02:32.186">(BUZZER ).</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.186" end="00:02:35.722">&gt;&gt; Jon: I THINK THAT&apos;S THE WRONG ANSWER AND THE WRONG GAME SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.722" end="00:02:36.590">BUT BAD ECONOMY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.590" end="00:02:39.159">POLISH THAT TURD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.159" end="00:02:43.230">&gt;&gt; HAVE ANY CONVERSATION IN ALL OF THIS DEBATE ABOUT THE TWO WARS PRESIDENT BUSH FUNDED AND </p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:44.565">PUT THEM ON THE CREDIT CARD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.565" end="00:02:50.571">WHAT WAS STRIKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY WAS HOW QUICK THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS WERE OUT </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.571" end="00:02:51.538">THERE WRINGING THEIR HANDS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.538" end="00:02:53.774">THESE ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF OBSTRUCTION.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.774" end="00:02:56.677">&gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY ABOUT MASSACHUSETTS UNDER GOVERNOR ROMNEY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.677" end="00:03:01.448">IT DID FALL TO 47th OUT OF 50 IN JOB CREATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.448" end="00:03:02.182">&gt;&gt; Jon: INTERESTING STRATEGY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.182" end="00:03:07.921">OUR TURD STINKS BUT EVERYBODY ELSE SUCKS WORSE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.921" end="00:03:10.057">&gt;&gt; SURVEY SAYS... (BELL RINGING ).</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.057" end="00:03:11.358">&gt;&gt; Jon: JUST ONE MORE ANSWER TO GIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.358" end="00:03:17.397">IS THERE ANY SORT OF NONPARTISAN TURD-POLISHING IN PLAY HERE?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.397" end="00:03:25.205">&gt;&gt; WE DID HAVE A VERY WARM WINTER.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.205" end="00:03:26.907">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHERE DID THAT ANSWER COME FROM?</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.907" end="00:03:28.775">LET ME GUESS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.775" end="00:03:32.079">&gt;&gt; IN THE ASS?</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.079" end="00:03:34.181">Jon: YOU&apos;RE NOT EVEN TRYING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.181" end="00:03:36.483">I&apos;M AFRAID THAT&apos;S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.483" end="00:03:41.088">NO ONE EVER SAID OBAMA WOULDN&apos;T BE A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT IF HE </p>
<p begin="00:03:41.088" end="00:03:43.490">DIDN&apos;T FIX THE ENTIRE ECONOMY IN THREE YEARS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.490" end="00:03:48.095">&gt;&gt; A YEAR FROM NOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE WE&apos;RE STARTING TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.095" end="00:03:50.230">BUT THERE STILL WILL BE PAIN OUT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.230" end="00:03:55.602">IF I DON&apos;T HAVE THIS DONE IN THREE YEARS, THEN THIS WILL BE A ONE-TERM PROPOSITION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.602" end="00:03:57.204">&gt;&gt; Jon: NEVER END A SENTENCE ON THE PROPOSITION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.204" end="00:03:59.339">THAT&apos;S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR...</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.339" end="00:04:01.508">&gt;&gt; POLISH THAT TURD.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.508" end="00:04:02.442">Jon: WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT </p>
