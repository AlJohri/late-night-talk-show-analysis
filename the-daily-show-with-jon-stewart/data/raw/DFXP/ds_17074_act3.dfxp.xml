<p begin="00:01:37.431" end="00:01:38.966">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S NOT TRUE AT ALL.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.966" end="00:01:40.100">THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:41.735">HOW DO YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.735" end="00:01:43.403">BECAUSE THIS IS BASED ON PLAY,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.403" end="00:01:43.670">YES?</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.670" end="00:01:46.673">&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE &apos;50s, A BRITISH PLAY, WHICH I </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.673" end="00:01:48.575">NEVER READ, BUT YEAH, IT WAS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.575" end="00:01:51.778">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU HAD NOT BEEN IN THE PLAY, YOU HAD NOT SEEN THE PLAY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.778" end="00:01:54.381">&gt;&gt; I HAD NOT READ IT OR SEEN IT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.381" end="00:01:56.583">BUT IT WAS AN OLD BRITISH PLAY?</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.583" end="00:01:58.018">&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.018" end="00:01:59.720">&gt;&gt; IT WAS IN THE &apos;50s.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.720" end="00:02:03.090">IT&apos;S JUST BECOME FASHIONABLE AGAIN, THIS PLAYWRIGHT, RATIGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:06.460">&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES HE HAVE OTHER STUFF THAT&apos;S ABOUT TO BE PRODUCED?</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.460" end="00:02:08.262">THEY&apos;VE DISCOVERED A TREASURE TROVE OF HIS WORKS?</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.262" end="00:02:13.500">&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&apos;S THE CENTENARY OF ITS BIRTH, SO BRITAIN IS HAVING A BIG RATIGAN FESTIVAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:14.601">&gt;&gt; Jon: SURE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.601" end="00:02:15.302">LISTEN, I...</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.302" end="00:02:17.070">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M PUTTING YOU OFF HERE,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.070" end="00:02:18.071">AREN&apos;T ANY </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.071" end="00:02:23.110">&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO, FOR HIS 80th WE DID A BIG RATIGAN FESTIVAL.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.110" end="00:02:31.084">IT WAS MOSTLY HIS NON-WORLD WAR II MELODRAMAS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.084" end="00:02:34.154">THIS... HOW DO YOU EVEN BOUNCE AROUND FROM THESE PROJECTS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.154" end="00:02:37.758">YOU DID THIS AND THE NEXT ONE WAS THE BOURNE SERIES OR SOMETHING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.758" end="00:02:39.826">&gt;&gt; &quot;BOURNE LEGACY.&quot; </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.826" end="00:02:44.765">&gt;&gt; Jon: &quot;BOURNE LEGACY.&quot; SO ONE IS THIS VERY CLAUSTROPHOBIC WORLD WAR II IN </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.765" end="00:02:46.667">THE MIDDLE OF THE BLITZ, AND THEN...</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.667" end="00:02:48.702">&gt;&gt; IT&apos;S A VERY RARERY STORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.702" end="00:02:51.572">IT&apos;S ABOUT A WOMAN HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A MUCH YOUNGER MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.572" end="00:02:54.241">SHE LEAVES HER HUSBAND AND IT&apos;S INCREDIBLY SHOCKING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.241" end="00:02:56.143">I THINK EVEN TODAY IT WOULD BE QUITE SHOCKING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.143" end="00:03:01.515">IT&apos;S A RACY STORY ABOUT A WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS SEX AND LOVE AND PASSION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.515" end="00:03:05.319">I SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN THE CENTENARY OF RATIGAN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.319" end="00:03:06.553">IT&apos;S A LOT MORE INTERESTING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.553" end="00:03:12.059">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU WERE ON A MUCH BETTER TRACK TALKING ABOUT CELEBRATING A DEAD PLAYWRIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.059" end="00:03:12.626">I REALLY THINK...</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.626" end="00:03:14.228">&gt;&gt; THAT&apos;S GOING TO GET THEM IN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.228" end="00:03:15.863">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S GOING TO GET THEM IN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.863" end="00:03:17.231">THERE ARE MANY OF THESE...</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.231" end="00:03:22.669">PEOPLE ALWAYS IN WORLD WAR II, A LOT OF THESE AWAKENING TYPE STORIES, YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.669" end="00:03:29.076">OH, I&apos;M GOING THROUGH MY WORK-A-DAY LIFE, AND SUDDENLY I&apos;M OUT THERE, BABY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.076" end="00:03:33.380">THAT&apos;S WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I THINK OF WORLD WAR II, FOR THE MOST PART.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.380" end="00:03:35.349">THERE WERE SOME OTHER MINOR DETAILS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.349" end="00:03:39.586">&gt;&gt; A LOT OF WOMEN HAVING SEXUAL AWAKENINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.586" end="00:03:42.356">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS FOR AN ACTRESS, THESE TYPES OF FILMS,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.356" end="00:03:48.462">YOU KNOW, I WOULD THINK ARE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE TO TRANSLATE THE STAGE SO DEPENDS ON KIND OF </p>
<p begin="00:03:48.462" end="00:03:53.534">THE PHYSICAL PROXIMITY OF THE AUDIENCE AND THE FEEDBACK, FILM IS SUCH A DIFFERENT MEDIUM THAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:53.534" end="00:04:00.374">THAT, IS IT DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE WHAT YOU IMAGINE IS THE SPIRIT OF THIS THING WITHOUT THE LIVE ELEMENT?</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.374" end="00:04:02.209">&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN BECAUSE IT&apos;S BASED ON A PLAY?</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:04.778">&gt;&gt; OH, NO, IT&apos;S A FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.778" end="00:04:08.682">&gt;&gt; Jon: DIDN&apos;T THAT SOUND LIKE A PRETTY, PRETTY...</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.682" end="00:04:10.817">&gt;&gt; IT WAS A REALLY SMART QUESTION.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.817" end="00:04:12.653">&gt;&gt; Jon: IT SOUNDED LIKE, OH,</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.653" end="00:04:15.422">I&apos;VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.422" end="00:04:17.457">&gt;&gt; YOU&apos;RE COMPARING FILM AND THEATER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.457" end="00:04:23.063">BUT IF YOU SCREW IT UP, YOU GET TO DO IT AGAIN IF IT&apos;S FILM.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.063" end="00:04:25.132">&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU JUST BLEW MY </p>
<p begin="00:04:25.132" end="00:04:26.066">[BLEEPED] OUT OF THE WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.066" end="00:04:27.534">&gt;&gt; SORRY, JON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.534" end="00:04:29.369">&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.369" end="00:04:33.307">DOING TV, RATHER THAN FILM,</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.307" end="00:04:36.410">YOU&apos;RE MUCH SMALLER WHEN YOU GO INTO PEOPLE&apos;S HOMES.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.410" end="00:04:37.778">&gt;&gt; YEAH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.778" end="00:04:39.346">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.346" end="00:04:43.283">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS THE... DO PEOPLE SAY... PEOPLE THINK I&apos;M TALLER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.283" end="00:04:44.418">NOW YOU ARE MY HEIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.418" end="00:04:46.920">PEOPLE DON&apos;T REALIZE WHEN WE STOOD, YOU WERE THE SAME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:48.522">&gt;&gt; I HAVE HEELS ON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.522" end="00:04:51.425">JON JON YOU DON&apos;T THINK I HAVE HEELS ON?</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.425" end="00:04:51.892">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.892" end="00:04:54.094">DUDE, I HAVE FAKE LEGS ON.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.094" end="00:04:55.696">[LAUGHTER]</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.696" end="00:04:57.631">I&apos;M LIKE DORF ON GOLF.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.631" end="00:04:59.499">IF I WAS REALLY STANDING HERE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.499" end="00:05:02.035">YOU WOULD BE LIKE, HELLO, LITTLE MAN.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.035" end="00:05:09.309">BUT PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK I&apos;M MUCH TALLER, WHICH IS... WHAT DID YOU DO?</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.309" end="00:05:15.082">DID YOU DO ANYTHING FOR PORUM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.082" end="00:05:16.083">PEOPLE ASK WHAT I DO.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.083" end="00:05:17.451">I WAS LIKE, I HAD A SANDWICH.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.451" end="00:05:18.685">DID YOU DO ANYTHING FOR THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.685" end="00:05:21.722">&gt;&gt; IT WAS MY BIRTH DATE THE FIRST NIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.722" end="00:05:27.060">I HAD A FEW PEOPLE OVER FOR DINNER, ONE OF WHOM WAS A JEW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.060" end="00:05:29.496">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THAT HOW YOU INTRODUCED HER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.496" end="00:05:33.100">&gt;&gt; THIS IS MY FRIEND THE JEW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.100" end="00:05:40.240">SHE BROUGHT OVER A HAMMOND&apos;S EAR.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:41.341">&gt;&gt; Jon: OR HIS HAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.341" end="00:05:45.078">ALL I KNOW IS IT&apos;S GOT PRUNES IN IT OR FIGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.078" end="00:05:47.881">&gt;&gt; SO THAT WAS MY BIRTHDAY CAKE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.881" end="00:05:49.483">I STUCK A CANDLE IN THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.483" end="00:05:51.385">I HAD A LITTLE PORUM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.385" end="00:05:56.156">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A TRADITIONAL OR ORTHODOX PORUM.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.156" end="00:06:01.028">&gt;&gt; YEAH, LIKE A KIND OF HASIDIC ALMOST, RIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.028" end="00:06:04.131">&gt;&gt; Jon: I WONDER WHAT A WISH YOU WOULD MAKE ON THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.131" end="00:06:09.770">I WISH MY BACK DIDN&apos;T HURT.</p>
