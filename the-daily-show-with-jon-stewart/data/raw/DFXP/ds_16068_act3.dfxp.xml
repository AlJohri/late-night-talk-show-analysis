<p begin="00:00:06.740" end="00:00:07.841">&gt;&gt; Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT,</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.841" end="00:00:13.814">SHE IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, WELCOME BACK TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:00:13.814" end="00:00:16.517">PROGRAM LISA P JACKSON.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.517" end="00:00:19.253">WELCOME TO YOU AGAIN.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.253" end="00:00:21.688">HOW ARE YOU?</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.688" end="00:00:23.390">&gt;&gt; I&apos;M WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.390" end="00:00:24.758">&gt;&gt; Jon: VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.758" end="00:00:25.726">I GOT YOU SOME WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.726" end="00:00:26.793">I WANT YOU TO RELAX.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.793" end="00:00:34.368">THE EPA, YOU GUYS ARE IN A REAL DOGFIGHT NOW THAT THE NEW CONGRESS HAS TAKEN OVER.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.368" end="00:00:39.540">FOR SOME REASON THEY FEEL THAT THE EPA IS THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SET </p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:43.544">FOR GOVERNMENT OVERREACH, IF YOU WILL.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.544" end="00:00:45.579">&gt;&gt; YUP, I CERTAINLY HEARD THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.579" end="00:00:50.617">WE HEAR THINGS LIKE DEFUND THE EPA, THE SCARIEST AGENCY IN GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.617" end="00:00:52.052">WE WONDER WHERE SOME OF THAT IS COMING FROM.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.052" end="00:00:56.857">BUT IT&apos;S DEFINITELY AN INSIDE THE BELTWAY MIND OF REASONING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.857" end="00:00:58.492">&gt;&gt; Jon: I CAN TELL ARE YOU WHERE IT IS COMING FROM,</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.492" end="00:00:58.859">ACTUALLY.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:00.894">I ACTUALLY SEE THEM ON C PAC,</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.894" end="00:01:03.630">IT IS CALLED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.630" end="00:01:08.769">WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE, YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS, I DON&apos;T THINK ANYBODY </p>
<p begin="00:01:08.769" end="00:01:11.839">WOULD ARGUE THAT IT ISN&apos;T AT TIMES BUREAUCRATIC,</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.839" end="00:01:13.473">BURDENSOME, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.473" end="00:01:17.945">BUT THE EPA HAS, FOR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY, A RELATIVELY GOOD TRACK RECORD,</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.945" end="00:01:19.613">CLEAN AIR ACT, CLEAN WATER ACT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.613" end="00:01:22.983">THOSE SEEM TO BE UNASSAILABLE SUCCESSES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.983" end="00:01:25.719">ARE THERE PEOPLE THAT ARGUE THAT THOSE AREN&apos;T GOOD PROGRAMS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.719" end="00:01:26.386">&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.386" end="00:01:28.088">I THINK THAT HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.088" end="00:01:29.623">WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EPA,</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.623" end="00:01:32.459">FOUNDED IN 1970 UNDER A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.459" end="00:01:36.330">ACTS THAT CAME ALONG WITH T THE CLEAN AIR ACT YOU MENTIONED, THE CLEAN WATER </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.330" end="00:01:39.333">ACT, SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT,</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.333" end="00:01:42.469">SUPERFUND, ALL ALMOST ENTIRELY BIPARTISAN ACTS,</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.469" end="00:01:43.604">OFTENTIMES UNANIMOUS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.604" end="00:01:47.174">EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND I THINK IT&apos;S BECAUSE WE ARE DOING OUR JOB UNDER THIS </p>
<p begin="00:01:47.174" end="00:01:51.545">PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO REMIND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ENVIRONMENTALISM ISN&apos;T A </p>
<p begin="00:01:51.545" end="00:01:52.246">SPECTATOR SPORT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.246" end="00:01:57.684">YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO STAND UP AND DEMAND THAT WE BE VIGILANT IN PROTECTING OUR AIR AND WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.684" end="00:02:01.154">&gt;&gt; Jon: THE ARGUMENT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p>
<p begin="00:02:01.154" end="00:02:03.190">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT PEOPLE ENJOY AIR AND WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.190" end="00:02:10.330">THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT THE EPA CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT KILLING BUSINESS OR KILLING JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.330" end="00:02:15.969">THAT TO KEEP, LET&apos;S SAY DIOXIN FROM KILLING US, WE MUST KILL THE FACTORY.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.969" end="00:02:18.172">IS THERE A HAPPY MEDIUM?</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.172" end="00:02:20.207">CAN WE NOT DIE BUT ALSO THEY LIVE?</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.207" end="00:02:23.277">&gt;&gt; WE CAN--  (LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:23.277" end="00:02:27.247">&gt;&gt; WE CAN HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY AND A STRONG AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.247" end="00:02:29.082">WE CAN HAVE CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.082" end="00:02:31.151">AND IN FACT, AS EVIDENCE OF THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.151" end="00:02:37.090">THERE IS EVIDENCE IN THE LAST 40 YEARS THAT THE AIR IS 60% CLEANER WHILE OUR GDP </p>
<p begin="00:02:37.090" end="00:02:39.660">WAS UP 207% OVER THAT PERIOD.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:44.531">&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THIS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BECAUSE I DON&apos;T-- I-- I FIND THAT </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.531" end="00:02:49.503">THOSE TYPES OF FACTS ARE VERY UNPERSUASIVE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.503" end="00:02:50.137">(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.137" end="00:02:52.339">&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD PERSUADE YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.339" end="00:02:53.307">&gt;&gt; Jon: A FEELING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.307" end="00:02:59.279">(LAUGHTER) A FEELING THAT IT WASN&apos;T RIGHT OR WORKING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.279" end="00:02:59.746">&gt;&gt; WELL-- .</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.746" end="00:03:05.052">&gt;&gt; Jon: TO THE POINT, SO YOU&apos;RE TRYING TO REGULATE MERCURY.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.052" end="00:03:08.755">AND THEY SAY THIS COULD PREVENT THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.755" end="00:03:10.190">&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:13.060">&gt;&gt; Jon: AND WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT?</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.060" end="00:03:16.630">&gt;&gt; WELL, I&apos;VE HEARD ARGUMENTS THAT WE&apos;RE GOING TO KILL JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.630" end="00:03:20.667">AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MERCURY, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE MERCURY IN AIR, TOXIC </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.667" end="00:03:22.436">STANDARDS THAT WE ANNOUNCED TWO MONTHS AGO.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.436" end="00:03:24.538">FIRST OFF, 21 YEARS IN THE MAKING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.538" end="00:03:27.608">THESE ARE STANDARDS THAT WERE CALLED FOR IN 1990.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.608" end="00:03:28.075">&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.075" end="00:03:31.411">&gt;&gt; THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DID SOME, THEY WERE THROWN OUT BY THE COURT BECAUSE </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.411" end="00:03:35.449">THEY WERE TRADING MERCURY AND NO ONE WANTED TO BE ON THE LOSING END OF THAT TRADE,</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.449" end="00:03:35.782">RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.782" end="00:03:39.920">MERCURY IS A NEUROTOXIN, IT DESTROYS OUR CHILDREN&apos;S BRAINS, OFTENTIMES BEFORE </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:40.621">THEY&apos;RE BORN.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.621" end="00:03:46.393">THESE STANDARDS ARE ESTIMATED TO PREVENT 17,000 PREMATURE DEATHS EACH YEAR,</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.393" end="00:03:51.565">PREVENT 11,000 HEART ATTACKS EACH YEAR, AND HALF OF THE POWER PLANTS IN OUR COUNTRY </p>
<p begin="00:03:51.565" end="00:03:57.671">ALREADY HAVE CONTROLS FOR MERCURY AND ARSENIC AND THE DIOXINS IN PARTICULAR MATTER </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.671" end="00:03:59.306">THAT YOU GET TO CONTROL ALONG WITH IT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.306" end="00:04:02.376">THE ONLY THING WE HEAR IS IT CAN&apos;T BE DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.376" end="00:04:06.780">AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW AND EVERY MODEL THAT WE RUN SHOWS THAT IT ABSOLUTELY CAN BE DONE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:09.183">AND THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATE JOBS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.183" end="00:04:13.253">SOMEONE HAS TO BUILD ALL THOSE SCRUBBERS AND FILTERS THAT DEAL WITH MERCURY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.253" end="00:04:14.655">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO YOU GOT THAT ONE THROUGH.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.655" end="00:04:16.056">BUT THERE&apos;S ANOTHER ONE,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.056" end="00:04:18.692">MERCURY AND DIOXIN THAT YOU HAD TO PULL, WHAT IS THAT ONE?</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.692" end="00:04:22.129">&gt;&gt; SO THE MERCURY FOR THE UTILITY AND POWER PLANTS HAS BEEN PROPOSED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.129" end="00:04:25.065">IT&apos;S NOT THROUGH YET BUT WE INTEND TO FINALIZE IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.065" end="00:04:29.536">WE ALSO PROPOSED A MERCURY AND AIR TOXIC STANDARD FOR BOILERS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.536" end="00:04:37.144">THESE ARE EVERYTHING FROM SCHOOLS TO FACTORIES USE COAL AND BURN IT TO MAKE POWER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.144" end="00:04:41.582">THOSE STANDARDS ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE ARE YOU COVERING A SECRETARY </p>
<p begin="00:04:41.582" end="00:04:45.385">THEIR IS MUCH LARGER, IT IS NOT JUST POWER PLANTS, IT&apos;S EVERYTHING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.385" end="00:04:48.789">SO WE JUST RECENTLY WERE REQUESTED, WE PETITIONED TO RECONSIDER THE RULE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.789" end="00:04:52.526">WE AGREED TO DO THAT AND TO STAY IT FOR A VERY LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.526" end="00:04:55.596">WE&apos;LL BE ANNOUNCING A SCHEDULE SOON BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE RULE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.596" end="00:04:56.964">I KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.964" end="00:04:59.333">WE WILL FINALIZE THAT RULE BECAUSE IT&apos;S IMPORTANT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.333" end="00:05:03.470">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT IS THE POLITICAL PRESSURE LIKE IN WASHINGTON TO NOT HAVE THESE RULES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.470" end="00:05:09.943">BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS, THERE IS AN EPIC BATTLE OCCURRING BENEATH THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:09.943" end="00:05:15.048">SURFACE, ONE OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CORPORATE MONEY,</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.048" end="00:05:17.751">PREVENTING THESE TYPES OF RULES FROM GOING INTO EFFECT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.751" end="00:05:21.154">WHAT THE IS THE TYPE OF PRESSURE THAT YOU FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.154" end="00:05:28.328">LOBBYISTS, PHONE CALLSES, AT NIGHT YOU GET, LET&apos;S SAY, A TUNA HEAD IN YOUR BED BECAUSE -- </p>
<p begin="00:05:28.328" end="00:05:30.063">&gt;&gt; FULL OF MERCURY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.063" end="00:05:31.765">&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT&apos;S WHAT I&apos;M TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.765" end="00:05:33.066">WHAT IS THE ISSUES THAT YOU FACE.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.066" end="00:05:37.538">&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, FIRST I WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE A PARKING PLACE ON CAPITOL HILL.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.538" end="00:05:42.276">AND I HAVE TESTIFIED MORE TIMES IN THIS CONGRESS THAN ANY OTHER CABINET MEMBER.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.276" end="00:05:48.115">INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE KATHLEEN SEBELIUS WHO IS IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE FOR THIS COUNTRY OR JANET </p>
<p begin="00:05:48.115" end="00:05:49.850">NAPOLITANO WHO DOES HOMELAND SECURITY.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.850" end="00:05:53.220">SO THERE IS A LOT OF-- AROUND IT.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.220" end="00:05:56.290">SOME OF THESE HEARINGS HAVE PRETTY INTIMIDATING NAMES.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.290" end="00:05:59.393">I DON&apos;T MIND GOING UP THERE BECAUSE I THINK IT&apos;S IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN TO THE </p>
<p begin="00:05:59.393" end="00:06:01.728">AMERICAN PEOPLE, THIS SHOULDN&apos;T BE HAPPENING UNDER THE SURFACE.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.728" end="00:06:06.834">YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOUR CONGRESS PUT MORE RIDERS ON THE EPA THAN ANY OTHER AGENCY.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.834" end="00:06:11.371">&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DO YOU NOT-- THE ABILITY OF, YOU KNOW, WE&apos;RE </p>
<p begin="00:06:11.371" end="00:06:12.673">WE&apos;RE-- YOU CAN STAY FOR TWO MINUTES.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.673" end="00:06:13.640">&gt;&gt; YES, I CAN.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.640" end="00:06:16.043">&gt;&gt; Jon: WE&apos;RE GOING TO THROW TO COMMERCIAL AND WE&apos;LL KEEP </p>
<p begin="00:06:16.043" end="00:06:19.813">YOU FOR FIVE MINUTES BECAUSE I KNOW OBVIOUSLY I SAW ON THE BACK YOU HAVE A HUGE TUB </p>
<p begin="00:06:19.813" end="00:06:22.216">OF MERCURY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTING.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.216" end="00:06:23.283">LISA P JACKSON,</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.283" end="00:06:25.552">ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK.</p>
