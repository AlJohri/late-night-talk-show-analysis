<p begin="00:00:04.438" end="00:00:05.873">WELCOME BACK.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.873" end="00:00:10.511">AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED, AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED WHILE YOU WERE EATING THE TURKEY FIVE </p>
<p begin="00:00:10.511" end="00:00:15.349">DAYS AGO NEXT TO YOUR DRUNK UNCLE, LAST THURSDAY WAS THANKSGIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.349" end="00:00:19.920">A HOLIDAY THAT BRINGS WITH IT ALL SORTS OF TRADITION INCLUDING THE GREETING FROM </p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:21.154">OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.154" end="00:00:22.990">&gt;&gt; I&apos;D LIKE TO WISH YOU A HAPPY THANKSGIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.990" end="00:00:25.058">LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS,</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.058" end="00:00:31.064">MICHELLE, MALIA, SASH A AND I WILL SPEND THE DAY EATING GREAT FOOD, WATCHING A LITTLE </p>
<p begin="00:00:31.064" end="00:00:33.200">FOOTBALL AND REFLECTING ON HOW TRULY LUCKY WE ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:34.535">&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, YES.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.535" end="00:00:36.003">VERY INSPIRING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.003" end="00:00:37.771">PERFECTLY FINE BLAND.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.771" end="00:00:42.743">IT USUALLY GETS ABOUT 40,000 HITS ON YOU-TUBE OR AROUND 100,000 FEWER THAN THIS VIDEO </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.743" end="00:00:48.849">OF BABY PANDA SLEEPING.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.849" end="00:00:57.357">AND TO ANSWER YOUR NEXT QUESTION, NO, WE CAN&apos;T JUST WATCH THAT FOR THE REST OF THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.357" end="00:01:04.765">SO ANYWAY THANKSGIVING YOU-TUBE ADDRESS ONE OF THOSE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESSS THAT ARE DONE BY ROTE.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.765" end="00:01:07.201">SPEAKING OF ROTE, UNTHINKING BUSY WORK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.201" end="00:01:07.968">THE REACTION.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.968" end="00:01:11.839">&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OBAMA RUFFLED QUITE A FEW FEATHERS ON TURKEY DAY.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.839" end="00:01:13.473">&gt;&gt; LEAVING GOD OUT OF THANKSGIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.473" end="00:01:16.076">&gt;&gt; HE LEFT GOD OUT OF HIS THANKSGIVING DAY ADDRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.076" end="00:01:18.612">&gt;&gt; WAS THAT A RELIGIOUS SLIGHT OR OVERSIGHT?</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.612" end="00:01:20.080">&gt;&gt; HE&apos;S A PRODUCT OF THE SECULAR LEFT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.080" end="00:01:23.317">&gt;&gt; FORGET ABOUT HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS, HE REPRESENTS THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.317" end="00:01:28.322">&gt;&gt; SOMEONE SHOULD REMIND HIM THE PILGRIMS CAME OVER TO HERE TO CELEBRATE TO BE ABLE TO </p>
<p begin="00:01:28.322" end="00:01:31.091">RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY TO WORSHIP GOD, RIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.091" end="00:01:37.197">&gt;&gt; Jon: SOMEONE SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT IF I RECALL MY GRADE SCHOOL PAGEANTS CORRECTLY </p>
<p begin="00:01:37.197" end="00:01:42.870">THANKSGIVING WAS A BUNCH OF PAGANS TEACHING RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS OUT TO FARM.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.870" end="00:01:50.444">IF WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE THANKING ANYBODY, YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY FAILING TO MENTION GOD IN YOUR </p>
<p begin="00:01:50.444" end="00:01:51.912">THANKSGIVING ADDRESS?</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.912" end="00:01:55.849">NOT A HUGE THANKSGIVING FOE PASS.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.849" end="00:02:01.221">I MEAN, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IF INSTEAD OF PARDONING TWO MALE TURKEYS HE HAD MARRIED THEM.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.221" end="00:02:03.790">OKAY?</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.790" end="00:02:06.493">AND THEN I COULD UNDERSTAND FOX GETTING BENT OUT OF SHAPE.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.493" end="00:02:10.097">I MEAN I GUESS IT&apos;S A LITTLE WEIRD THAT OBAMA IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER NOT TO MENTION </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.097" end="00:02:11.598">GOD IN HIS THANKSGIVING ADDRESS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.598" end="00:02:15.802">&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OBAMA ISN&apos;T THE ONLY COMMANDER IN CHIEF IN RECENT HISTORY TO LEAVE GOD </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.802" end="00:02:18.238">OUT OF THANKSGIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.238" end="00:02:21.775">&gt;&gt; Jon: SO, WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.775" end="00:02:23.877">&gt;&gt; TO BE FAIR LET&apos;S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.877" end="00:02:29.183">PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH MENTIONED GOD IN SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT ADDRESSES.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.183" end="00:02:39.092">FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON ONLY MENTIONED GOD IN FOUR OUT OF EIGHT.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.092" end="00:02:46.867">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHO DID YOU MAKE LOOK THAT (BEEP) ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND?</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.867" end="00:02:50.971">WHO DO YOU DO THAT TO?</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.971" end="00:02:55.642">PRESIDENTS CLINTON AND BUSH BOTH HAD YEARS WHEN THEY DIDN&apos;T MENTION GOD EITHER.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.642" end="00:03:02.115">&gt;&gt; WERB MENTION THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID MENTION GOD IN HIS WRITTEN THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.115" end="00:03:06.787">&gt;&gt; Jon: NOT ONLY IS OBAMA NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO LEAVE GOD OUT OF HIS THANKSGIVING </p>
<p begin="00:03:06.787" end="00:03:08.422">ADDRESS, HE DIDN&apos;T EVEN DO THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.422" end="00:03:14.261">HE LEFT IT IN HIS THANKSGIVING ADDRESS JUST NOT THE ONE ON YOU-TUBE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.261" end="00:03:18.398">AND FOR SOME REASON THAT DIDN&apos;T STOP FOX FROM DISSECTING IT ON NO FEWER THAN </p>
<p begin="00:03:18.398" end="00:03:24.304">THREE OF ITS SHOWS INCLUDING AT ONE POINT BRINGING IN A PRIEST SO YOU COULD FIND OUT </p>
<p begin="00:03:24.304" end="00:03:26.807">WHAT GOD THINKS ABOUT ALL THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.807" end="00:03:32.779">&gt;&gt; HE SAYS THAT LIKE MUCH OF AMERICA, HE&apos;S GOING TO SPEND HIS THANKSGIVING DAY EATING </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.779" end="00:03:42.089">LOTS OF GOOD FOOD, WATCHING SOME FOOTBALL, AND REFLECTING ON HOW LUCKY WE ARE.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.089" end="00:03:47.828">IT&apos;S TAKING TIME TO REFLECT ABOUT THE WONDERFUL BLESSINGS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO US.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.828" end="00:03:50.898">&gt;&gt; Jon: JOKE&apos;S ON YOU.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.898" end="00:03:53.867">PRESIDENT DOESN&apos;T HAVE TO DO WHAT A PRIEST TELLS HIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.867" end="00:03:56.370">HE&apos;S A MUSLIM.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:03:59.239">( APPLAUSE ) LOOK, I SEE WHAT YOU&apos;RE DOING.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:04.745">THIS IS ABOUT TURNING THANKSGIVING INTO ANOTHER CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION CULTURE WAR TYPE THINGS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.745" end="00:04:06.280">DON&apos;T YOU DO IT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.280" end="00:04:08.348">DON&apos;T YOU DO THAT TO THANKSGIVING.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.348" end="00:04:11.852">I&apos;LL GIVE YOU THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.852" end="00:04:12.853">WE ARE (BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.853" end="00:04:14.454">I&apos;LL GIVE YOU THAT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.454" end="00:04:18.292">THIS IS ALL JEWS HAVE LEFT.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.292" end="00:04:19.826">THANKSGIVING IS MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.826" end="00:04:24.164">NAME ANOTHER HOLIDAY WHERE YOU CAN GET DRUNK AROUND YOUR KIDS BY 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.164" end="00:04:25.499">YOU CAN&apos;T.</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.499" end="00:04:28.068">FOURTH OF JULY, YOU CAN&apos;T DO IT THERE.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.068" end="00:04:30.137">YOU HAVE TO PACE YOURSELF FOR THE FIREWORKS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.137" end="00:04:32.639">THANKSGIVING THE WHOLE THING IS OVER BY 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:38.545">YOU PASS OUT ON THE COUCH TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN OF THE LINEBACKER.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.545" end="00:04:44.084">THAT&apos;S THE THANKSGIVING WE IT&apos;S THE ONE HOLIDAY WHERE EVERYONE CAN JUST RELAX UNTIL NOW.</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.084" end="00:04:46.453">TURNS IT INTO A EXCUSE AN OF (BEEP) LIKE THIS.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.453" end="00:04:51.291">&gt;&gt; I LIKE TO START OFF BY MAY... IF I MAY, UNLIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO FAILED TO </p>
<p begin="00:04:51.291" end="00:04:53.861">MENTION GOD DURING HIS THANKSGIVING DAY PROCLAMATION,</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.861" end="00:04:59.099">I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SAY I THANK MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST FOR ANOTHER DAY OF </p>
<p begin="00:04:59.099" end="00:05:02.069">FREEDOM IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.069" end="00:05:05.472">&gt;&gt; Jon: WHEN DID FOX BECOME THE 700 CLUB?</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.472" end="00:05:06.940">YOU KNOW WHAT?</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.940" end="00:05:07.541">(BEEP).</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.541" end="00:05:11.078">LET&apos;S JUST WATCH THE PANDAS FOR THE REST OF THE SHOW.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.078" end="00:05:11.945">WE&apos;LL BE RIGHT BACK.</p>
