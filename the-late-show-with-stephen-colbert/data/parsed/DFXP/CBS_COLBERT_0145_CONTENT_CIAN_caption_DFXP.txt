Stephen: HEY, JON, MAN I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.
Stephen: HEY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I GOT SOME BAD NEWS. OOUM LEAVING THE BAND.
Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE IN THE BAND.
Stephen, OF COURSE, I'M IN THE BAND, JON. I PLAY THE DRUMS.
Jon: JOE PLAYS THE DRUM S.
Stephen:  LOOK, JOE HAS COVEREDDED FOR ME ON A FEW NIGHTS, BUT I AM IN THE BAND-- OR I WAS, BECAUSE I'M OUT.
Jon: OKAY, WELL, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY TO GET ME TO STAY? SEE THIS IS THE KIND OF DISRESPECT I HAVE BEEN GETTING. THIS IS WHY I'M LEAVING THE BAND.
Jon: STEPHEN, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO DISRESPECT YOU LIKE THAT. SORRY.
Stephen: THANKS, MAN, THAT'S-- THAT'S ALL I EVER REALLY WANTED TO HEAR. OKAY, I'M BACK IN THE BAND.
Jon: AWESOME.
Stephen: JOE, CAN YOU COVER FOR ME TONIGHT?
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES. JOSH GAD GILLIAN JACOBS AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY BAND OF HORSES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HELLO! HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK YOU, MARK. THANK YOU, JON. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. THAT IS AWFULLY NICE. THANK YOU OF COURSE SO MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU UP THERE. THANK YOU DOWN HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOW, I HAVEN'T HEARD MY NAME CHANTED IN A LONG TIME. THAT MAKES ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND I'VE BEEN TALKING FOR ALMOST 10 SECONDS, SO DONALD TRUMP. LIKE I JUST DOUBLED CNN'S RECORD. A NEW POLL HAS 87% OF REPUBLICANS SUPPORTING TRUMP. IT CAME OUT YESTERDAY. THE OTHER 13% ARE CURRENTLY STANDING ON BRIDGES LOOKING VACANTLY INTO THE DISTANCE. 87% IS PRETTY AMAZING. HE IS SLOWLY UNIFYING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. ALL IT TOOK WAS NO OTHER OPTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN A FEW MORE WEEKS TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE REALLY NO OTHER OPTIONS? DID WE CHECK THE COUCH CUSHIONS? TRUMP IS FOCUSED ON THE GENERAL, AND A NEW POLL SAYS THE MAJORITY OF NEW JERSEY VOTERS DON'T WANT TO SEE CHRIS CHRISTIE BE TRUMP'S VICE PRESIDENT. ACTUALLY, A MAJORITY OF NEW JERSEY VOTERS DON'T WANT TO SEE CHRIS CHRISTIE. JUST GET HIM-- JUST GET HIM-- ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE BIG STORY TODAY IS LAST NIGHT'S DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN OREGON AND KENTUCKY. BERNIE WON OREGON. NO SURPRISE THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. NO SURPRISE THERE. IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON A MAP, OREGON IS PRETTY MUCH AS FAR LEFT AS YOU CAN GET. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, IN KENTUCKY, HILLARY CLINTON DECLARED VICTORY AFTER WINNING BY LESS THAN 1%. SO THERE'S ANOTHER 1% FOR BERNIE TO BE MAD AT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THOUGH IN THE GREAT STATE OF KENTUCKY, BERNIE DID PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT. IT WAS A REAL LOUISVILLE SLUGGER-FEST. A KENTUCKY FRIED BRAWL. A TOTAL... THIRD THING ABOUT KENTUCKY. DERBY! DERBY! DERBY! THEY'RE LIKE HORSES, AND ONE OF THEM WON. I STILL GOT IT! AND DESPITE BERNIE'S WIN LAST NIGHT, HILLARY ONLY NEEDS 90 MORE DELEGATES TO CLINCH THE NOMINATION, WHEREAS BERNIE NEEDS MORE THAN 800. MORE DELEGATES. SO IF YOU DO THE ARITHMETIC, YOU DON'T WORK FOR THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. WE GOTTA GIVE IT TO HIM. YOU GOTTA GIVE IT TO THEM. THEY'RE FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING, AND BERNIE'S STAYING IN THE RACE. HE HAS GREAT, GREAT ENERGY. AT HIS CALIFORNIA RALLY LAST NIGHT, HE DREW OVER 20,000 PEOPLE. HE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO CAN FILL A BASEBALL STADIUM. ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN-- EVEN BASEBALL CAN'T FILL A BASEBALL STADIUM. HILLARY FEELS LIKE-- HILLARY FOLLOWERS THINK HE SHOULD DROP OUT, AND THE BERNIE PEOPLE FEEL THEY SHOULD STAY IN THEIR FOR OWN BELIEFS AND THINGS ARE GETTING TENSE OUT THERE. ANGRY BERNIE SUPPORTERS SHUT DOWN LAST SATURDAY'S NEVADA STATE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. THEY FELT HE WAS ROBBED OF TWO DELEGATES AND HIS FOLLOWERS STARTING CHANTING "RECOUNT," AND THROWING CHAIRS. OR AS THEY PUT IT "REDISTRIBUTING THE CHAIRS EQUALLY TO EVERYONE'S SKULLS." ( APPLAUSE ) IS IT NE-VAUD-A. OR NE-VAD-A. NEVADA. THEY STAYED FOR THREE HOURS HIS FOLLOWERS, AFTER THE CONVENTION, AND THE VENUE HAD TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS TO GET BERNIE'S SUPPORTERS TO LEAVE. HERE'S HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THAT.
(BLEEP)! (BLEEP)! (BLEEP)!
Stephen: NOW, TO BE CLEAR, THAT WAS NOT A TRUCK BACKING UP. ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAD TO BLEEP WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY CHANTING. HOW CAN I DESCRIBE THIS? LET'S JUST SAY THE INITIALS WERE "B.S." AND THEY DIDN'T STAND FOR BERNIE SANDERS. HERE'S THE THING: BERNIE'S PEOPLE HAVE DEEPLY HELD LIBERAL BELIEFS, AND THEY'RE FEELING SO SHAFTED, THAT SOME HAVE BEGUN TO PUSH BERNIE TO RUN AS A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE. HE'S NOW BEING COURTED BY THE GREEN PARTY TO JOIN THEIR TICKET, WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE NOTHING'S MORE GREEN THAN RECYCLING AN OLD CANDIDATE. IT'S IN THE SPIRIT. IT'S IN THE SPIRIT. IT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF THE THING. SO NOW THOUSANDS OF DISAFFECTED BERNIE SUPPORTERS MAY BE FACED WITH A CHOICE: GO TO THE GREEN PARTY OR BEGRUDGINGLY VOTE FOR HILLARY. JUST LIKE HILLARY SUPPORTERS DO. ( LAUGHTER ) EITHER WAY, THIS COULD SPLIT THE DEMOCRATIC VOTE, WHICH HAS HAPPENED BEFORE WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. NOW, TO YOU YOUNGER SANDERS SUPPORTERS OUT THERE, I'D LIKE TO READ YOU THE STORY OF A MAN NAMED RALPH NADER. CAN I HAVE THAT PLEASE. THIS IS OUR NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED, "SEE RALPH RUN." ( APPLAUSE ) AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY, IF YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW THE STORY, THIS IS FOR YOU. THIS IS A TALE YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER. IT BEGAN IN 2000, THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER. YOUNG VOTERS DON'T KNOW ABOUT "BUSH VERSUS GORE." BUT TRUST ME, THIS HAS ALL HAPPENED BEFORE. HIS NAME WAS RALPH NADER, HE SPOKE FOR THE TREES. HE PUT SEATBELTS IN CARS TO PREVENT SHATTERED KNEES. HE LED THE GREEN PARTY. HIS SPEECHES WERE SOARING. AND HE TOOK VOTES FROM GORE. MY GOD, GORE WAS BORING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE TOOK VOTES FROM FLORIDA! HE TOOK VOTES FROM OHIO! HE TOOK VOTES FROM SNEEDLE, AND WUMBUS, AND XYLO! I KNOW THOSE AREN'T ACTUAL STATES. BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF VOTING MACHINE IRREGULARITIES THAT YEAR. OKAY. HE EVEN BAGGED THE ODD FLORIDA RESIDENT, AND THAT'S HOW GEORGE W. BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT. THANKS TO RALPH NADER, WHO GAVE IT HIS ALL, WE GOT CHENEY, WHOSE HEART WAS THREE SIZES TOO SMALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO ONCE IN THAT BOOTH, VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE AND HEART. GO WITH THE PERSON YOU'VE BACKED FROM THE START. BUT THINK IT THROUGH CAREFULLY, DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK. BECAUSE, TRUST ME, 2000 WAS A REAL CLUSTER-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) UNFORTUNATE EVENT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG SALER. THIS IS GOING TO BE A NUMBER-ONE BIG SALER. ALREADY, THIS ELECTION HAS BEEN UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN. THE ANGER, THE FIGHTING, THE ALL-AROUND TRUMPINESS OF THIS RACE, HAS CREATED AND INTERESTING PROBLEMS FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS WHO WANT TO EDUCATE KIDS ABOUT DEMOCRACY. IN FACT, ONE TEACHER EVEN SAID, "SHE WORRIES ABOUT THE SCHOOL'S MOCK-DEBATE SEASON, WHEN SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO PLAY MR. TRUMP, A CANDIDATE WHO, IF HE WERE A STUDENT, WOULD BE SENT STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S TRUE. THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR HIS PLAN TO BUILD A WALL THROUGH MRS. GREEN'S HOMEROOM AND MAKE SPANISH CLASS PAY FOR IT. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT I BELIEVE KIDS MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO TEACH US ALL ABOUT THIS ELECTION, BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO INNOCENT TO UNDERSTAND ADULT BEHAVIORS LIKE MEAN NICKNAMES AND THROWING TANTRUMS, AND NOT JUST ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THEY CAN ALSO TEACH US ABOUT THE GIRL WHO GETS STRAIGHT A's AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE'S NOT MORE POPULAR. ( LAUGHTER ) OR THE OLDER GUY WHO GRADUATED YEARS AGO BUT JUST KEEPS HANGING AROUND WITH COLLEGE KIDS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOT TO MENTION ALL THE KIDS WHO WERE BULLIED SO BADLY THEY JUST WENT HOME.  ( APPLAUSE ) SO RECENTLY I DECIDED TO SIT DOWN AND GET THE THOUGHTS OF THE KEY UNDER-SEVEN VOTING DEMOGRAPHIC. THIS IS "ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE."
IT'S LIKE WE'RE A BUNCH OF BABIES, LIKE WE'RE A BUNCH OF STUPID, STUPID BABIES.
Stephen: HI. HI.
HI.
Stephen: HI, I'M STEPHEN. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU GUY KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT DOES? WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT DO?
THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEONE WHO MAKES THE CITY A BETTER PLACE.
Stephen: MAKES THE CITY A BETTER PLACE. JOHN CARLO.
THE PRESIDENT MAKES THE RULES FOR EVERYBODY SO PEOPLE DON'T DO THE BAD THINGS.
Stephen: YES?
RUNS AMERICA.
Stephen: RUNS AMERICA. YES?
HE HELPS THE WORLD.
Stephen: YUP.
MAKES LAW S.
Stephen:  A PRESIDENT IS LIKE A MOMMY OR A DADDY THAT KEEPS PEOPLE SAFE AND HELPS MAKE THE LAWS AND ALSO HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. HERE ARE SOME PICTURES OF CANDIDATES WHO HAVE ALREADY DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE. NOW, THIS YEAR, ORIGINALLY, THERE WERE 24 PEOPLE RUNNING. DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THESE PEOPLE'S NAMES? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO LEARN THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO THIS MAN IS?
UUMM. >>?
Stephen: NO, IT'S NOT ME, IT'S NOT ME. BUT THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE MY GLASSES OFF, DO I KIND OF LOOK LIKE HIM?
YES.
YES.
Stephen: I FORGIVE YOU. I FORGIVE YOU ALL. WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL-- IF HE WAS AN ANIMAL, WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL DO YOU THINK HE WOULD LOOK LIKE?
I DON'T KNOW.
A SNAKE.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT LIKE MAYBE A SNAKE WEARING A MAN-SKIN? YEAH.
BERNIE SANDERS!
BERNIE SANDERS!
BERNIE SANDERS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S BERNIE SANDERS. BERNIE BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE DON'T SHARE ENOUGH. IS IT IMPORTANT TO SHARE.
YES!
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SHARE.
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SHARE.
Stephen: YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO SHARE.
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SHARE, TOO.
Stephen: HOW DOES BERNIE MAKE YOU FEEL? WHEN YOU LOOK AT BERNIE HOW DO YOU FEEL? RAISE YOUR HAND.
HAPPY.
HAPPY.
Stephen: WAIT, HOW DO YOU FEEL-- ONE SECOND?
CONFUSED.
Stephen: CONFUSED? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS HILLARY CLINTON. AND SHE KIND OF SEEMS LIKE A GRANDMA WHO GIVES YOU CANDY BUT IT'S NOT THE KIND OF CANDY THAT YOU LIKE, BUT YOU EAT IT ANYWAY BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE CANDY THAT THERE IS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUTTERSCOTCH. DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT BUTTERSCOTCH IS? ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WEUTHER'S ORIGINALS? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE? THAT'S ALL SHE HAS. THAT'S ONLY KIND OF CANDY SHE HAS. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO THIS IS? YES?
DONALD TRUMP.
Stephen: THAT'S DONALD TRUMP. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HAIR? BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I CAN ANSWER THOSE, BUT I'LL TRY. YES?
IT KIND OF LOOKS YELLOW.
Stephen: IT DOES KIND OF LOOK YELLOW. DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S REALLY HIS HAIR?
IT'S A CREEPY CREATURE THAT CRAWLED ON TOP OF HIM.
Stephen: IT'S A CREEPY CREATURE THAT CRAWLED ON TOP OF HIM? IT COULD BE, OR IT COULD JUST BE HIS HAIR. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?
THAT HE WANTS -- THAT HE WANTS TO PUT A WALL THROUGH THE MEXICANS IN AMERICA.
Stephen: HE WANTS TO PUT A WALL THROUGH THE MEXICANS IN AMERICA. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MR. TRUMP?
IS HE YELLING.
Stephen: HE'S YELLING RIGHT NOW. YES. HE'S YELLING ALMOST ALL THE TIME. YOU CAN GUYS TRY TO MAKE THIS FACE? ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GREAT. OKAY, DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME PICK WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE.
YES!
YES.
Stephen: AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS SAY WHO YOU THINK THE NEW PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE. ONE, TWO, THREE--... THERE YOU HAVE IT. THEY DON'T KNOW EITHER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JOSH GAD.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A VERY FUNNY ACTOR FUNNY ACTOR YOU KNOW FROM "THE BOOK OF MORMON" AND "FROZEN." NOW HE STARS IN "THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE."
I AM THE LAST GUY WHO SHOULD BE HERE, SIMPLE SPEEDING TICKET. JUDGE TELLS ME I WAS GOING TOO FAST. SO I SAY, "YOUR HONOR, TO BE HONEST, I WAS."
MY ONE PROBLEM, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY THAN YOU TOLD LAST TIME. ♪ THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE POLICE THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE POLICE ♪ THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE POLICE POLICE.
DRINKS ON ME, GUYS! ♪ THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE POLICE POLICE.
CHUCK?
OKAY, MAYBE IT WASN'T ICE CREAM.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME, JOSH GAD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
YOU KNOW, I HAD NO CHOICE. MY PUBLICIST TOLD ME I HAD TO DO IT, AND I WAS LIKE IT FEELS RIGHT.
Stephen: I HAVE NO CHOICE, EITHER. THEY SAID I HAVE TO COME OUT HERE AND DO A SHOW EVERY NIGHT. AND I LOVE HAVING A GUEST LIKE YOU. YOU'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIC ACTORS. YOU WERE FANTASTIC IN "THE BOOK OF MORMON."
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND WE HAVE SIMILAR D.N.A.
WE DO. BY THE WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, COLBERT IS ACTUALLY A MUSICAL THEATER PERFORMER AT HEART. I'VE SEEN YOU. YOU'RE AMAZING.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, JOSH, I REALLY JUST COTHIS FOR MONEY. I'VE A HOOVER AT HEART. I'M REALLY MORE OF A DANCER.
I SMELL THAT ON YOU.
Stephen: YOU SMELL THAT ON ME?
YOU NEVER WORE ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN YOU HOSTED "COLBERT SHOW." YOU USED TO WEAR DRAKU, NOIR. AND NOW YOU WEAR MONEY COLOGNE.
Stephen: MONEY COLOGNE. YOU'RE HUGE?
I AM.
Stephen: WE BOTH WORKED FOR MR. JON STEWART AT "THE DALY SHOW."
HE WAS GREAT.
Stephen: I MISS HIM. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE HIM OUT HERE DURING THE ELECTION?
I FEEL LIKE HE MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS THAT IS HAPPENING, OR NOT.
Stephen: HOW MANY PIECES DID YOU DO OVER THERE? WERE YOU THERE FOR A LONG TIME?
WHAT WAS AMAZING IS JON GAVE ME THE THE MOST AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO DO "THE DAILY SHOW" AND I SAID NO. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. I AUDITIONED, AND I WAS SO EXCITED, BUT MY WIFE AND I WERE LIVING IN L.A., AND IT WAS REALLY HARD TO MAKE THE DECISION TO MOVE TO NEW YORK. SO HE WAS LIKE, "DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'LL DO WHAT WE DO WITH LARRY WILMORE. YOU CAN COME IN, GUEST CORRESPONDENT WHENEVER YOU WANT." SO HE WOULD FLY ME IN. SIX MONTHS LATER I GOT "THE BOOK OF MORMON." HE SAID THAT WAS A REALLY DOUCHE THING TO DO TO TELL ME YOU WOULDN'T MOVE TO NEW YORK FOR ME BUT YOU WOULD FOR A BROADWAY SHOW. IT WAS AMAZING. I DID ABOUT, LIKE, EIGHT PIECES AND HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE. I DID ONE WHILE I WAS DOING "THE BOOK OF MORMON" --
THAT'S INSANE. YOU DO EIGHT SHOWS I WEEK.
I SAID I CAN'T DO BOTH.
Stephen: YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE FROM HOLLYWOOD, HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA.
HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, AND HOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA, IF ANYTHING?
THEY WEAR THE SAME SORT OF SKIMPY SORT OF OUTPI OUTFITS BUT THERE'S AN 80-YEAR DIFFERENTIAL.
Stephen: NOT ALL OF THAT IS A BIKINI. IT'S FLAPS OF SKIN.
I JUST ASSUMED THAT ONLY 80-YEAR-OLDS WOULD WEAR THAT ATTIRE. AND THEN I WENT TO CALIFORNIA AND IT WAS LIKE A BENJAMIN BUTTON EFFECT. AND I WAS LIKE, WAIT, THEY START OUT YOUNG AND HOT AND THEN START LOOKING LIKE SENATOR PALPATINE, WEARING A DIEP GLER THAT'S A GREAT IMAGE. IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO EXPUNCH THAT OUT OF MY BRAIN BONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. DID YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD IN FLORIDA?
I DID, UNFORTUNATELY.
Stephen: FLORIDA HAS A BAD-- FLORIDA HAS THIS BAD RAP LIKE "FLORIDA MAN," ALL THE THINGS THAT IN FLORIDA AND NOWHERE ELSE. IS THAT A STEREOTYPE OR IS IT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN FLORIDA?
NO OFFENSE TO MY FELLOW FLORIDAIANS BUT IT'S NOT A STEREOTYPE. HERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE, WHEN I GREW UP-- ONLY IN FLORIDA WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN. THERE WAS A GIRL WHO WENT TO MY SCHOOL WHO LIVED DOWN THE BLOCK FROM ME AND SHE CAME OVER SOBBING, "GAIDAR, GAIDAR." I SAID WAS THERE A GATOR OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE. AND SHE SAID, "GATOR IN." I SAID, "A GATOR IN YOUR HOUSE." THERE WAS A SMALL, BUT DEFINEDIGATE GATOR IN HER HOUSE WHEN SHE OPENED HER TOILET SEAT. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN NEW YORK CITY, I CAN GUARANTEE THAT. THAT HAPPENS IN FLORIDA.
Stephen: I WOULD NEVER GO TO THE BATHROOM AGAIN.
I KNOW.
Stephen: I WOULD GO TO GEORGIA TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. I WOULD GET, LIKE OJETBLUE SHUTTLE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM IF I EVER FOUND THAT.
BY THE WAY, THIS IS CONSTIPATION. I HAVEN'T GONE SINCE I HEARD THAT STORY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL, NOW YOU'RE IN "ANGRY BIRDS." WHY ARE THE BIRDS ANGRY, JOSH?
THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING A LOT OF CNN COVERAGE LATELY.
Stephen: THAT WILL DO IT. THAT WILL DO IT, YEAH. >>UN, THEY'RE ANGRY BECAUSE THEIR EGGS ARE BEING STOLEN BY GREEN PIGS, YOU KNOW,.
Stephen: IT'S A UNIVERSAL STORY.
IF YOU HAD-- STEPHEN, IF YOU HAD AN OMELET THAT YOU WERE VERY FOND OF.
Stephen: YES
AND A GREEN PIG WALKED IN AND TOOK THAT OMELET.
Stephen: YEAH.
THAT WOULD PISS YOU OFF.
Stephen: BUT THESE ARE BIRDS. THIS IS ISN'T LIKE A GREEN PIG-- THIS IS LIKE A GREEN PIG COMING TO STEAL YOUR CHILDREN.
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE PEASE, RIGHT? SOMEONE HAS TOLD YOU.
NO!
Stephen: REALLY?
ALL I KNOW IS THEY INTERMIX WITH EACH OTHER BUT --
IT'S LIKE THAT.
NO!
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
STEPHEN! NOT HERE! BIRDS AND BEES DO THAT! DON'T THE BEES-- DON'T THE BIRDS GET STUNG WHEN THIS HAPPENS?
Stephen: NO, THE BIRDS JUST DO IT WITH THE BIRDS AND THE BEES DO IT WITH THE BEES. DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN, JOSH?
I DO HAVE TWO KIDS.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS, HOW OLD ARE THEY?
I HAVE A FIVE-YEAR-OLD AND TWO-YEAR-OLD.
Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC. GIRLS, BOYS?
BOTH GIRLS.
Stephen: AND HOW OFTEN HAVE THEY SUNG "LET IT GO?"
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS, MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD WAS SO INTO IT, BECAUSE SHE WAS TWO WHEN THE MOVIE CAME OUT SO SHE KIND OF RODE THAT WAVE. NOW SHE HATES IT. SHE'S JUST OVER IT.
Stephen: DAD, ENOUGH, ENOUGH.
"WE GET IT. WE GET IT. OH, YOU'RE THE SNOWMAN, HOW CUTE, DADDY."
Stephen: DO YOU LET THE KIDS WATCH WHAT YOU DO? OR WAS THAT THE FIRST THING YOU COULD LET THEM SEE.
I DIDN'T SHOW THEM "THE WEDDING RINGER." I LET THEM WATCH. MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW THE PREVIEW FOR FROZEN IT WAS LITERALLY JUST OLAF LAUGHING, AND SHE LOOKS AT IT AND GOES, "DADA, MORE DADA." BUT WITH "ANGRY BIRDS" SHE SAW THE TRAILER, AND SHE LITERALLY, LIKE, TROLLED ME. BECAUSE I, LIKE, SAY TO HER, "SLOW DOWN." SHE TALKS FAST SOMETIMES. I SAID,"SLOW DOWN, REALLY USE YOUR WORDS." AND SHE SAID, "WHY DO YOU SPEAK SO FASTALS THE YELLOW BIRD, DADDY?" AND I WAS LIKE, "BECAUSE DADDY GETS PAID TO DO IT, SWEEPTY. NOW GO DO YOUR HOMEWORK." DO FIVE-YEAR-OLDS HAVE HOMEWORK? I'M A TERRIBLE FATHER.
Stephen: DOESN'T MATTER. DOESN'T MATTER. DAD SAID, GDO YOUR HOMEWORK." GO FIND YOUR HOLLANDE WORK.
GO PLAY WITH PLAY-DOH FOR SCHOOL.
Stephen: DID YOUR FAMILY WANT YOU TO BE A PERFORMER? WERE THEY OKAY WITH THAT HAPPENING?
THREE YEARS OUT OF COLLEGE I WAS READY TO GIVE IT ALL UP. MY CAREER SORT OF STALLED. I WENT TO CARNEGIE MELLON DRAMA AND HAD THESE GRAND IDEAS OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO BECOME.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT SCHOOL.
GREAT SCHOOL. AND I WENT THERE AND IT JUST WASN'T HAPPENING SO I WAS GOING TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. AND I CALLED UP MY MOM AND I SAID TO HER, "I'M GOING TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL." AND SHE STARTED CRYING. I SAID, "YOU'RE A JEWISH MOTHER. WHY ARE YOU CRYING THE FACT I'M GOING TO LAW SCHOOL?" SHE SAID,"I'M DISAPPOINTED, YOU SPENT 15 YEARS DREAMING OF DOING THIS AND ONLY THREE WEEKS TRYING TO DO IT," AND A WEEK LATER I GOT MY BIG BREAK ON BROADWAY IN SCITUATE SPELLING BEES."
Stephen: HERE'S TO MOMS. JOSH, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. JOSH GAD, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS AND I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS: AMERICA HAS TOO MUCH CHEESE. THE BAD NEWS: WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE.
EXPERTS SAY AN OVERABUNDANCE OF CHEESE HERE IN THE U.S. HAS CREATED THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST STOCKPILE OF THE STUFF IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS.
AMERICAN DAIRY FARMERS ARE FACING AN ACTUAL OVERSUPPLY OF THE PRODUCT, ADDING UP TO BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF CHEESE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF CHEESE. OR JUST SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ROMANO'S MACARONI GRILL PUTS ON A SINGLE ENTREE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN FACT, WE HAVE SO MUCH CHEESE THAT IN ORDER TO GET RID OF IT, "EVERY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WOULD NEED TO EAT AN EXTRA THREE POUND OF CHEESE THIS YEAR. WELL, I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL AMERICANS WHEN I SAY, CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. COME ON, THREE POUNDS. THREE? IS THAT ALL YOU GOT! I'M YELLING AT THE CHEESE GOD. WE CAN EAT THREE POUNDS OF CHEESE IN OUR SLEEP. MORE, IF WE'RE ON AMBIEN. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGET RIO. THIS IS OUR OLYMPICS. AMERICA, WE HAVE BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS FOR YEARS. WE CONSUME SO MUCH CHEESE, WE SMUGGLE EXTRA SERVINGS INSIDE OUR CRUSTS. WE USE IT TO SPACKLE OVER THE HOLES IN OUR PRETZELS. BY GOD, WE'RE THE COUNTRY THAT LOOKED AT NACHO CHEESE DORITOS, AND SAID, "WE CAN MAKE THOSE NACHOS CHEESIER." THERE COMES A TIME WHEN EVERY GENERATION IS ASKED TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY. SO I'M CALLING ON ALL AMERICANS TO FIGHT THE GOUDA FIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) WE DON'T DO THIS BECAUSE IT IS EASY CHEEZE, BUT BECAUSE IT IS HAVARTI. WE MUST WALK SOFTLY AND CARRY A BIG MOZZERELLA STICK. WE MUST BOLDLY ASIAGO WHERE NO MANCHEGO HAS GONE "BRIEFORE" AND ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IF WE DO, AND IF WE DO, WE WILL BECOME CHEDDAR THAN ALL THE REST. SO DIG DEEP AND FIND THAT EXTRA GRUYERE, GET IN THE CALZONE AND JOIN ME, BECAUSE I'M FETA-UP TO HERE, AND IF YOU THINK I CAN DO THIS PROVALONE, YOU RICOTTA BE KIDDING ME. WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND SLAY THE MUENSTER. JUST FONDUE IT! JARLSBURG READY FOR SWISS? ♪ ♪ ♪ WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GILLIAN JACOBS!

I LOVE YOUR PERFORMANCE. YOU'RE BOTH FUNNY AND SELFISH AND SWEET AT THE SAME TIME. SELFISH AND SWEET IS A HARD COMBINATION TO STRIKE AS A PERFORMER.
YOU HAVE TO VACILLATE VERY QUICKLY BETWEEN THE TWO.
Stephen: SO SIX YEARS OF "COMMUNITY."
SIX.
Stephen: AND NOW YOU'RE DOING "LOVE" ON NETFLIX. WHAT'S THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOING, LIKE, THE COMEDY YOU WERE DOING BEFORE AND THE COMEDY YOU'RE DOING NOW.
THE COMKEY, NOT SO MUCH, BUT THE PRODUCTION IS DIFFERENT. THEY ACTUALLY LET US GO OUTSIDE ON "LOVE," WHICH IS A BIG CHANGE.
Stephen: IN "COMMUNITY" YOU COULDN'T COTHAT? THEY KEPT YOU IN THE HYPERBARIC CHAMBER?
VERY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT AND SOUND AND SO BROKE THEY WOULDN'T LET US OFF THE PARAMOUNT LOT.
Stephen: OH, EXPENSIVE TO GO OUTSIDE.
YES.
Stephen: I DON'T GO OUTSIDE.
VERY CHEAP SHOW HERE, VERY CHEAP.
Stephen: BACKSTAGE IS JUST A HABITTRAIL AND THEY PUT FOOD PELLETS OUT FOR ME. HERE GUON LOCATION. IF YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT, IT'S A REAL RESTAURANT.
YEAH, IT BLOWS MY MIND. AND ALL THE OTHER ACTORS ARE LIKE, "WHY ARE YOU SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS? THIS IS NORMAL." I SAID, "NO, GUYS, THEY WROTE IT IN THE SCRIPT AND WE WENT THERE."
Stephen: DO YOU GET TO EAT THE FOOD.
SURE! THIS IS A JUDD APATOW PRODUCTION. VERY CLASSY.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR CHARACTER'S NAME?
HER NAME IS MICKEY DOBBS.
Stephen: AND MICKEY AGAIN IS SORT OF A HURT PERSON, LOOKING FOR LOVE.

KILL SHELTER, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

Stephen: NOW, YOU ALSO HAVE A-- A FILM CALLED "DON'T THINK TWICE."
YES.
Stephen:s THAT'S ABOUT AN IMPROV GROUP. DID YOU START OFF AS AN IMPROVISOR? I STARTED OFF AS AN IMPROV GUY.
I DID NOT, SIR. AND THEY MADE US DO REAL IMPROV IN THE FILM, AND I WAS VERY SCARED.
Stephen: LIKE AN IMPROV GROUP GOING UP AND DOING SETS ON STAGE.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE YOU SHOT IT IN THE FILM?
NO.
Stephen: IS IT REAL IN THE FILM?
YES, THERE'S SOME SCRIPTED, MIKE DOESN'T LIKE US TO SAY WHICH IS WHICH BUT HE HAD A TWO-WEEK BOOTCAMP FOR US BECAUSE I HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE AND I WAS HAVING TO NOT ONLY DO IT IN THE FILM BUT BE THE BEST AT IT SO IT'S A TALL ORDER.
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER IS WRITTEN AS BEING THE BEST IMPROVISER.
YEAH, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE PRODIGY.
Stephen: NO PRESSURE.
NO PRESSURE AT ALL.
Stephen: WOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: DID IT TERRIFY YOU?
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DO IT.
Stephen: YOU ENJOY BEING SCARED?
NOT PHYSICALLY. I'M A PHYSICAL COWARD, BUT EMOTIONALLY VERY BRAVE.
Stephen: UH-HUH. DID YOU-- DID YOU-- LIKE, SO YOU DIDN'T DO ROLLER COASTERS AND STUFF WHEN YOU WERE A KID? YOU DON'T LIKE ANY OF THAT STUFF GIUSED TO HIDE THE SIGN-UP SHEETS FOR SPORTS IN THE MAIL SO I MOM WOULD NOT SIGN ME UP FOR SOCCER.
Stephen: YOU WOULD STAND BY THE MAILBOX WHEN YOU KNEW THEY WOULD BE COMING OUT AND HIDE THEM?
YES. AND MY DAD GOT ME A SKI LESSON WHEN I WAS SEVEN, AND HE LEFT FOR AN HOUR AND CAME BACK AND SAID TO THE INSTRUCTOR, "HOW DID IT GO?" THE WOMAN SAID, "SHE WOULDN'T MOVE. SHE SAID IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO SLIDE DOWN A HILL COVERED IN SNOW AND ICE."

Stephen: WHY DID YOU HAVE FUNERAL HOME-- WAS YOUR FAMILY IN THE BIZ?
NO, I THINK MY GREAT-AUNT HAD JUST DIED, SADLY, AND MAYBE THAT INSPIRED ME TO START THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE.
Stephen: MAYBE, MAYBE. WOULD YOU MIND READING TO THE GOOD PEOPLE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE THINKI THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD. AND, AGAIN, THIS IS A CHILD TERRIFIED OF LIFE.
EVERYTHING, YEAH. OKAY. GILLIAN JACOBS' WILL. ONE, EVERYTHING I OWN NO ONE WILL GET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
