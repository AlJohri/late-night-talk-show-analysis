WE TALK ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS ALL THE TIME. WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE WORLD IMPLODING DUE TO THE BREXIT VOTE IN A MINUTE, BUT FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT: THE "GAME OF THRONES" FINALE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY WHICH, OF COURSE, I MEAN THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EVERYONE EXCITED FOR THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION? ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, THEN YOU ARE NOT A REPUBLICAN. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE POLITICO CALLED OVER 50 PROMINENT REPUBLICANS, AND IT TURNS OUT, HARDLY ANYBODY WANTS TO SPEAK AT TRUMP'S CONVENTION. (LAUGHTER) FINALLY ANSWERING THE OLD QUESTION, "WHAT IF YOU DESTROYED A PARTY AND NOBODY CAME?" (LAUGHTER) AND ONE PERSON DEFINITELY NOT COMING IS GEORGE WILL, THE LEGENDARY CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST, AND BOWTIE HOST ORGANISM, WHO THIS PAST WEEKEND SAID HE IS LEAVING THE G.O.P. OVER TRUMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH. THAT'S KIND OF SURPRISING NEWS. GEORGE WILL IS OFFICIALLY NOW GEORGE WON'T! (LAUGHTER) WITH TRUMP AS THE NOMINEE, WILL SAYS HE NO LONGER BELIEVES THE G.O.P. IS HIS PARTY. AND TO SHOW THAT HE MEANS BUSINESS, HE'S EVEN CHANGED HIS MARYLAND VOTER REGISTRATION TO... "UNAFFILLIATED," WHICH MEANS, OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES... HE'S SINGLE!!! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES! (SEXY MUSIC) HI. ARE YOU A POLITICAL PARTY ON THE PROWL FOR A NEW STANDARD-BEARER? WELL THEN LOOK NO FURTHER THAN...
JON: ♪ GEORGE WILL!
STEPHEN: THIS ULTIMATE PIECE OF POLITICAL MAN MEAT IS A PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING COLUMNIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. HE'S FAR RIGHT IN THE STREETS, AND "ALL WRONG" IN THE SHEETS.
JON: ♪ GEORGE WILL!
STEPHEN: TURN ON'S INCLUDE BASEBALL METAPHORS, ABOLISHING THE MINIMUM WAGE, AND CREATING VOLUNTARY PERSONAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL COST OF SOCIAL SECURITY...DADDY LIKE!
JON: ♪ GEORGE WILL!
STEPHEN: HE'S ON THE REBOUND AFTER A  LOOONG  RELATIONSHIP, SO GIVE GEORGIE A CALL TODAY. BECAUSE IF YOU THINK THAT BOWTIE LOOKS GOOD ON HIM, YOU SHOULD SEE HOW IT LOOKS ON YOUR FLOOR.
JON: ♪ GEORGE WILL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I LIKE THIS LIFE. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE HOSTING MATCH GAME WITH THIS MIC. YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF SEXY -- (LAUGHTER) -- KANYE WEST IS IN THE NEWS BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUTRIENT BATH HE LIVES IN. THIS TIME, THE RAPPER/FASHION-DESIGNER/ ENTREPRENEUR/SOMEHOW-NOT ACTOR RELEASED THE VIDEO FOR HIS SINGLE "FAMOUS," WHICH FEATURES SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS CELEBRITIES IN THE WORLD IN BED TOGETHER, LIKE CAITLYN JENNER, TAYLOR SWIFT, RIHANNA, DONALD TRUMP-- ALL SWEATY AND NAKED. WOW! IF THAT'S MEMORY FOAM, THAT BED IS GOING TO HAVE P.T.S.D. (LAUGHTER) THEY ALL LOOK A LITTLE SWEATY AND CLAMMY. (LAUGHTER) NOW, THERE'S SOME CONFLICTING REPORTS ABOUT THIS, BUT THE CONSENSUS IS THAT MOST OF THE CELEBRITIES IN THAT VIDEO AREN'T REAL, JUST WAX OR SILICONE IMITATIONS. SO, CELEBRITIES. (LAUGHTER) IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE CELEBRITIES AGREED TO HAVE THEIR LIKENESSES IN THE VIDEO. BUT THIS WEEKEND, KANYE TWEETED: "CAN SOMEBODY SUE ME ALREADY? #I'LL WAIT." (LAUGHTER) WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT, KANYE-- I'M GOING TO SUE YOU RIGHT NOW FOR CUTTING ME OUT OF THAT VIDEO. LUCKILY, I KEPT THE FOOTAGE OF MY TAKE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YEAH. WE JUST HAD SEX. ALL OF US. AT THE SAME TIME. I WISH YOU COULD SMELL IT IN HERE. IT IS LIKE A CAGE AT A ZOO. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BURN THIS BED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. ANYWAY, WHO WANTS A CRACKER? ANYBODY WANT ONE? YOU WANT ONE? THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU. AS YOU CAN SEE, I REALLY BULKED UP FOR THAT ROLE. I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT, KANYE. BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT BUSH REALLY NEEDS TO CLIP HIS TOENAILS. (LAUGHTER) NOW, SAY HI JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! YEAH. I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU PEOPLE. I AM GENUINELY FREAKED OUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE BREXIT THING. AFTER WE DID OUR FRIDAY SHOW, I WENT HOME, AND I WAS PRETTY TIRED, I WENT TO BED. I'M LYING IN BED AND IT'S NEARLY MIDNIGHT EAST COAST TIME AND MY WIFE IS ALREADY ASLEEP NEXT TO ME AND I'M GOING THROUGH THE IPad, AND IT SAYS CHAOS IN EUROPE, BRITAIN FALLS. WEIVED TOLD IT WAS GOING AWAY FROM BREXITING. I HAD BEDROCK BELIEF AND FRIENDS WHO SAID, DON'T WORRY, WE'RE VERY SENSIBLE PEOPLE. IT'S A LOT OF TALK, WE DON'T DO THAT SORT OF STUFF HERE. THEY WERE WRONG. AND IT REALLY KIND OF CRUSH MISVIEW OF, LIKE, WHAT CAN HAPPEN THAT IS BAD THAT WE DON'T THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN. LIKE, IT'S JUST NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. JEB'S SUPPOSED TO GET THE NOMINATION! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND IT JUST KIND OF PROVES PEOPLE OVER THERE ANT LIKELY SMART, BUT APPARENTLY IT'S JUST THE ACCENT MAKES THEM SEEM SMART. IT'S REALLY JUST A LIE. ( BRITISH ACCENT ) "EVERYONE IS JUMPING OFF A BRIDGE, SO SHALL I AS WELL." (LAUGHTER) "YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT IF I STILL HAVE A PEANUT ALLERGY." (LAUGHTER) "SAY, IS THIS ELECTRICAL SOCKET STILL WORKING? I WILL FIND OUT BY PLACING MY TALLYWACKER IN THERE. AW, MY WORD." OH! OH! ZOUNDS! (LAUGHTER) YOU IDIOTS. WELL, YOU'VE HAD YOUR LITTLE VOTE AND NOW THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS TANKING. THE POUND HAS PLUNGED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 1985. RIGHT NOW, THE MOST STABLE CURRENCY IN THE U.K. IS THE CADBURY CREME EGG. (LAUGHTER) OKAY? THAT'S BEFORE THE VOTE. THIS IS AFTER THE VOTE. AND IT AIN'T JUST OVER THERE. HERE IN AMERICA, ON FRIDAY THE DOW LOST 611 AND THEN ALMOST 300 MORE TODAY. DOW POINTS. WHATEVER THAT IS. IT WAS SO SHOCKING, YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED ME OVER WITH WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR 401K. (LAUGHTER) ALL IN ALL, ON FRIDAY, GLOBAL MARKETS SUFFERED LOSSES OF OVER $2 TRILLION, THE WORST SINGLE DAY LOSS IN HISTORY. THAT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE HAD TO SAY THOSE WORDS IN LAST EIGHT YEARS. WHICH MEANS I GET TO PUNCH MY GLOBAL ECONOMIC MELTDOWN CARD. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THERE YOU GO. AND THERE YOU GO. I GOT TWO. I GOT ONE, TWO. JUST ONE MORE AND I GET A FREE -- EVERYTHING, BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO MORE CURRENCY. WE WILL BARTERING WITH BABY TEETH. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. (LAUGHTER) YOU PUT THE BABY TEETH IN A GOURD AND IT KEEPS AWAY THE EVIL SPIRITS! (LAUGHTER) I HOPE THAT'S A JOKE. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S THE MADNESS. HERE'S THE CRAZY PART: IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST TWO YEARS FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. THAT'S LIKE SAYING TO YOUR WIFE, "THINGS ARE NOT WORKING OUT, I NEVER LOVED YOU, I WANT A DIVORCE. BUT I AM GOING TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH FOR TWO YEARS. YOU'RE COOL IF SHEILA CRASHES HERE TOO, RIGHT? YOU WOULD LIKE EACH OTHER." (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S ALL THE FAULT OF BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON. HE KNEW THE BREXIT WOULD BE A DISASTER, BUT HE PROMISED A VOTE JUST TO GET ELECTED. AND WHEN THE DISASTER HE PREDICTED CAME ABOUT, HE ADDRESSED A PANICKED BRITISH PUBLIC.
I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS PRIME MINISTER TO STEADY THE SHIP OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS, BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR ME TO TRY TO BE THE CAPTAIN THAT STEERS OUR COUNTRY TO ITS NEXT DESTINATION.
STEPHEN: BOLD LEADERSHIP. IT REMINDS ME OF THIS COURAGEOUS MOMENT FROM THE TITANIC:
"THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING. I'VE STEERED THE SHIP INTO AN ICEBERG. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BEST IF SOMEONE ELSE TOOK OVER AND STEERED IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ATLANTIC!" (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: MM-HMM. OF COURSE. (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, NOT ALL BRITS ARE SITTING AROUND ASKING "WHAT HAVE WE DONE?" MOST OF THEM GOOGLED IT. THE SEARCH: "WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LEAVE THE E.U.?" SPIKED BY OVER 250% "AFTER" POLLS CLOSED. WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE GOOGLING "WHAT HAPPENS AFTER UNPROTECTED SEX?" ON YOUR WAY TO THE BABY SHOWER. IN FACT, THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH BREXIT REMORSE THAT PEOPLE ALL OVER WERE TWEETING WITH #REGREXIT. VERY CUTE. BUT I GOT TO SAY, NO DISREPEXIT, BUT YOUR BREXIT REFER-EXIT COULD CAUSE A GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEPREXIT. WHAT THE FEXIT, REGREXIT!? YOU CAN SUCK MY DEXIT! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL LEGAL! ALL LEGAL! OF COURSE, MANY BRITS ARE TAKING THIS WITH THEIR TRADEMARK STIFF UPPER LIP. JOINING US NOW, LIVE VIA SATELLITE, IS ONE BRITISH VOTER WHO HAS STAYED CHEERFUL. SHE'S A CHILD CARE WORKER, AND SHE'S ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. PLEASE WELCOME, MARY P. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HELLO, MARY.

OH, PRACTICALLY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY! ♪ JUST A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR HELPS THE MEDICINE GO DOWN... MMM. OH, MUMMY'S SUGAR BURNS. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WOW, MARY, SEEMS LIKE THIS BREXIT VOTE HAS REALLY FREAKED YOU OUT.
NO, STEPHEN! NOT AT ALL. YES, I VOTED TO LEAVE, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN. I JUST WANTED POLISH IMMIGRANTS TO STOP STEALING ALL THE NANNY JOBS!
STEPHEN: SO YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANY PANIC OVER THERE?
NO, NO. NOT A WHIT.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, LOVE. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!
HE'S RIGHT. GAME OVER, MAN! I'M OUT OF HERE!

STEPHEN: HEY EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK! KEVIN LOVE FROM THE CHAMPION CLEVELAND CAVALIERS IS COMING UP NEXT, WILL BE SITTING RIGHT OVER THERE. BUT AS A CATHOLIC, FIRST, I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE POPE. I'VE NEVER MADE A SECRET OF THE FACT THAT I LOVE POPE FRANCIS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S THE MAN. EVERYBODY LOVES FRANKIE. HE'S ACKNOWLEDGED CLIMATE CHANGE. AND BEFORE THAT, HE SAID EVERYONE'S WELCOME INTO HEAVEN, EVEN ATHEISTS, NOT TO MENTION THE TIME HE DID THE CINNAMON CHALLENGE. HE GOT OVER A MILLION VIEWS! HE'S INCREDIBLE. HE'S NOT YOUR FATHER'S POPE! ALTHOUGH, TECHNICALLY, HE IS "OUR FATHER'S" POPE. AND THIS WEEKEND, IL PAPA DROPPED ANOTHER BOMBSHELL. WHEN ASKED IF HE AGREED WITH A GERMAN CARDINAL, WHO SAID IN THE WAKE OF THE ORLANDO TRAGEDY THAT GAYS DESERVE AN APOLOGY FROM THE CHURCH, FRANCIS SAID, "I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE PERSON WHO IS GAY WHOM IT HAS OFFENDED." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL JOIN IN. I'LL JOIN IN. A BIG STEP TO ADMIT THAT THE CHURCH SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO "THE PERSON WHO IS GAY." NEXT STEP: ADMITTING THERE'S MORE THAN ONE OF THEM. (LAUGHTER) THIS APOLOGY IS HUGE MOMENT FOR THE CHURCH IN TERMS OF ACCEPTING HOMOSEXUALITY. IN FACT, IT WAS SUCH BIG NEWS THAT IT OVERSHADOWED SOME OF THE LESSER APOLOGIES THE POPE MADE ON BEHALF OF THE CHURCH. WELL, AS THE POPE OF LATE NIGHT, I'VE GOT THEM HERE. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE LATE SHOW'S LESSER POPE-POLOGIES." (LAUGHTER) FIRST, THE POPE WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE... WAIT, THIS FEELS OFF. I'LL HAVE TO POPE THIS UP A LITTLE BIT. HOLD ON A SECOND. (APPLAUSE) MAYBE THIS WILL HELP. (ORGAN MUSIC) (IN ACCENT) I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE HOLY WATER IN THAT BOWL WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN -- THAT  THING IS A PETRI DISH. IT'S LESS SANITARY THAN A BOWL OF MINTS AT A DINER. HOW OFTEN DO THEY CHANGE THAT? WOULD IT KILL US TO PUT A LITTLE CHLORINE IN THERE? IT'S GOING TO PASS AROUND DISEASE LIKE HERPES AT SUMMER CAMP. THE HOLY SEE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS REGRET FOR THE CHURCH'S OBSESSION WITH GOLD LEAF. OKAY. IT'S A BIT OSTENTATIOUS. TRULY THAT MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO FEED ORPHANS, CLOTHE THE POOR, ETC... I JUST REALIZED IT MAKES THE VATICAN LOOK LIKE TRUMP PLAZA. IT'S TACKY. (LAUGHTER) NO MORE. (APPLAUSE) SPEAKING OF WHICH, I GOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE STANDING AND KNEELING DURING MASS. OKAY. IT'S HARD ON THE JOINTS. YOU KNOW, FRANKLY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE SITTING, STANDING OR KNEELING OR LYING DOWN. YOU SHOWED UP. OKAY, GOD CAN SEE YOU. (LAUGHTER) ALSO, CATHOLIC WEDDINGS ARE WAY TOO LONG! OKAY. THERE IS NO NEED TO HAVE A TWO HOUR MASS DURING THE CEREMONY. WE GET IT, YOU LOVE EACH OTHER THROUGH SICKNESS AND HEALTH? YOU PROBABLY ALREADY DID IT. AFTER ALL, YOU KNOW... (LAUGHTER) RINGS, KISS. LET'S HIT THE OPEN BAR, BABY. I GOT MY EYE ON THE MAID OF HONOR. SHE'S GOING TO CATCH MORE THAN THE BOUQUET TONIGHT. AM I RIGHT? (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, I AM. I'M INFALLIBLE. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS ALSO VERY SORRY FOR SAVING OLD PIECES OF SAINTS LIKE ST. PETER'S PINKIE, ST. ANTHONY'S TONGUE, ST. WHAT'S-HIS-NAME'S FEMUR AND SAYING THEY'RE MAGIC. WE'RE NOT A TRAVELING CARNIVAL, THEY'RE JUST GROSS. THERE'S A NAME FOR OLD BODY PARTS, IT'S MEDICAL WASTE. (LAUGHTER) PERSONALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT CHURCH DINNERS AND THE ABOMINATION THAT IS "MACARONI SALAD." THAT'S NOT A SALAD. IT'S BASICALLY MACARONI AND MAYONNAISE. CALL IT "MACARONI MAYONNAISE." THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AND SPEAKING OF APOLOGIES, UM, SORRY ABOUT THE CRUSADES, THE INQUISITION, AND FOR NOT TAKING SIDES IN WORLD WAR II. OKAY. WE REALLY BLEW THAT ONE. IT WAS SORT OF A GIMME. YOU KNOW? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KEVIN LOVE. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A THREE-TIME N.B.A. ALL-STAR WHO JUST HELPED CLEVELAND WIN ITS FIRST TITLE IN 52 YEARS! PLEASE WELCOME WORLD CHAMPION, KEVIN LOVE! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NICE. NOW, WHAT IS THE FEEDING SCHEDULE BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET OVERHUNGRY. THIS REALLY FEELS LIKE A BABY WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING IT.
IT'S NICE AND SHINY, TOO.
Stephen: PUT IT IN THE SEAT NEXT TO YOU. THAT'S FANTASTIC. THAT'S THE ACTUAL TROPHY. WAS IT OKAY FOR ME TO HOLD IT? I KNOW THERE IS SOME SPORTS THINGS YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO TOUCH. IF YOU TOUCH THE MASTERS GREEN JACKET, THEY KILL YOU. IS IT OKAY THAT I HOLD IT?
NO, YOU'RE OKAY.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU.
Stephen: THIS WAS YOUR FIRST FINALS. WHEN CLEVELAND MADE IT LAST YEAR, YOU WERE ON THE D.L. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO BE IN YOUR FIRST FINALS.
IT WAS PRETTY SURREAL. I SAID LAST YEAR AFTER GETTING MY SHOULDER HURT IN THE EASTERN CONFERENCE QUARTER FINALS IN GAME FOUR AGAINST THE CELTICS, WE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO FINALS GAME SIX AND LOST. THEY DID THE CHAMPAGNE SHOWERS. WE LOST ON OUR FLOOR. I REMEMBER GAME ONE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE OAKLAND AGAINST THE WARRIORS. ING HAVING SEEN THE GAME AND FELT THE ENERGY THERE, I HAD NEVER WANTED TO BE IN A GAME SO BAD, SO TO BE BACK WAS SURREAL. TO WIN IN GAME 7, ALL THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST US, BE BEING DOWN 3-1, MAJOR COMEBACK, NO MAJOR TEAM HAS EVER DONE IT.
Stephen: DOWN 3 TO ONE. YES.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO SAY TO EACH OTHER? WAS IT SOMETHING YOU WERE OVERTLY SAYING TO EACH OTHER IN THE LOCKY ROOM BECAUSE NO ONE'S COME BACK.
IN THE LAST YEARS, WE THRIVED UNDER CHAOS. WE LOOKED AT IT AS IF OUR BACKS WERE AGAINST THE ROPES, WE COULD GET IT DONE. EVERYONE SAID WE COULDN'T DO IT.
Stephen: UP AGAINST THE TEAM WITH THE GREATEST SEASON RECORD.
HISTORICALLY GREAT ON THEIR HOME FLOOR, SO WE KNEW WE HAD TO BEAT OAKLAND THERE, TAKE IT BACK TO OUR PLACE FOR GAME SIX IN CLEVELAND AT QUICKEN LOANS REIN  NARKS WHICH WE WEREN'T GOING TO LOSE THAT GAME, AND GAME SEVEN, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. CAME DOWN TO A TWO-MINUTE GAME. WE MADE THE PLAYS AND GOT THE WIN.
Stephen: WITH 40 SECONDS LEFT YOU A BIG PLAY. YOU STOPPED STEPH CURRY FROM PUTTING UP 3. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AND YOU TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD, 40 SECONDS LEFT.
I HAD TO PUT ON MY DANCING SHOES WITH HIM BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO THROW EVERYTHING AT ME. HE GAVE THE BALL UP TO GREEN, GOT IT BACK. IT WAS A TWO-TIME M.V.P. I HAD TO DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO STAY IN FRONT OF HIM, AND LUCKILY I WAS THERE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE? BECAUSE HE GOT THE SHOT OFF. YOU'RE ALL OVER HIM LIKE A SPIDER MONKEY. BUT HE GOT AROUND YOU. HE GOT A SHOT OFF. WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE CAN HIT IT FROM DETROIT.
IT'S THREE STEPS MIND THE THREE-POINT LINE. I KNEW I HAD TO GUARD HIM. HE HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE WITH THE BALL, HE THREW EVERYTHING AT ME. WHEN HE THREW IT UP, HE USUALLY SHOOTS IT AND LOOKS AT ME. I THOUGHT, HE HASN'T LOOKED AT ME. THAT WAS IT.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE LOOK HE GIVES YOU WHEN HE HAS MADE THE SHOT?
IT'S NOT SO GREAT.
Stephen: PAIN SNFL. YEAH (LAUGHTER) AND THROUGHOUT THE SERIES, IT WASN'T GREAT. HE DID A LOT OF THOSE.
Stephen: HE LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS, WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME? THE BALL IS GOING THROUGH HOOP OVER THERE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: HE TOSSES TO DRAYMON GREEN.
RIGHT.
Stephen: THIS WHOLE SEASON, GREEN'S BEEN RACKING, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, THE NUT SACKS OF OPPONENTS.
RIGHT (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WAS THERE EVER A FEAR IF YOU WERE UP AGAINST HIM, HE'S GOING TO WORK MY BALLS LIKE A SPEED BAG? DID THAT GO THROUGH YOUR MIND AT ALL?
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HAVE YOU HAD YOUR CHILDREN YET?
NO.
Stephen: STAY AWAY FROM HIM, THEN.
OKAY. I MEAN, I DID MY BEST JOB TO, I GUESS, PROTECT MYSELF FORKS LACK OF BETTER TERM.
Stephen: EXCELLENT BALL HANDLING. (LAUGHTER) TELL ME ABOUT THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE. THERE IS YOU AND LeBRON ON THE FLOOR RIGHT AFTER THEN. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE. TWO MEN SHOWING EMOTION TO EACH OTHER. WHAT'S THIS MOMENT LIKE? WHAT DID IT GLIERN?
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE GUY THAT, YOU KNOW, AFTER WE SAW THE BALL GO UP, THREE SECONDS LEFT, WE KNEW IT WAS ALL OVER, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE GUY ESEARCHING FOR SOMEONE TO HUG, SO I TRIED TO FIND THE PERSON EVERYONE WAS MOST LIKELY TO HUG, HAPPENED TO BE LEBRON. ALL THE CAMERAS WERE THERE. HE DROPPED TO HIS KNEES. A SPECIAL MOMENTLY ALWAYS REMEMBER. YEAH, BUT THAT WAS A WARM, CUDDLY EMBRACE AT THE END (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHY WAS THIS A BIG PART OF YOUR CELEBRATIONS HERE?
WELL, WE KIND OF HAD -- I LOVE THIS, BY THE WAY, IF YOU CAN ZOOM IN ON THE CAVALIERS, N.B.A. CHAMPIONS 2016. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WOW. LET ME HOLD IT OVER HERE. SO THE W.W.E. HAD THIS CHAMPIONSHIP BELT MADE FOR YOU?
THEY DID, YES. SO WE HAD A BIG -- I MEAN, WE ALL WERE REALLY INTO '90s WRESTLING AND EARLY 2000s WRESTLING. SO THE STONE COLD STEVE AUSTINS AND UNDERTAKERS, AND ALL THE GUYS WORE THE VINTAGE T-SHIRTS BECAUSE IN THE FINALS, THAT KIND OF SERIES, IT WAS GOING TO BE A WRESTLING MATCH AND GO THE DYSTHE ANSWER.
Stephen: THERE IS FOOT AN OF YOU DOING YOUR BEST STEVE AUSTIN IN THE LOCKER ROOM. DO WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE.
Stephen: THIS IS YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. I UNDERSTAND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING TO HAVE THE REFRESHMENTS.
WELL, A LOT OF SHAM PAIN WAS POURED ON MANY PEOPLE, AND I THINK THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHERE J.R. SMITH TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT AND HASN'T PUT IT ON SINCE.
Stephen: HERE'S A SHOT OF HIM WHEN THAT YOU WILL ARE GETTING OFF THE PLANE, I BELIEVE.
NO SHIRT.
Stephen: THERE YOU ARE, NO SHIRTS. (LAUGHTER) I UNDERSTAND THAT J.R. SMITH TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT, WOULDN'T PUT IT BACK ON. I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY CALLED SOMEONE IN THE CAVALIERS' ORGANIZATION.
OUR HEAD COACH, HE CALLED HIM AND SAID, CAN WE GET J.R. TO PUT HIS SHIRT BACK ON? AND RIGHTFULLY SO. THAT WAS GETTING THE MOST ATTENTION. I MEAN, J.R. --
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
-- I LIVE VICARIOUSLY THROUGH HIM. HE'S ONE OF THE KIND.
Stephen: WHEN THE PRESIDENT CALLS IN AND SAYS THOSE GUNS ARE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, NEED TO COVER THOSE UP.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS REPEAT NEXT YEAR? GO AHEAD.
THAT'S THE PLAN, YEAH. WE GET EVERYBODY BACK, WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN.
Stephen: THAT'S BALLSY. (APPLAUSE) WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.

Stephen: I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT AN ACTUAL PET BECAUSE I SAW THIS PHOTO. I DON'T KNOW IF WE GOT IT FROM YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE.
THAT IS FROM ME.
Stephen: WHO IS THIS YOU'RE HOLDING RIGHT HERE?
THAT'S MY DOG REGGIE. HE'S VERY OLD. HE HAS ONLY SEVEN TEETH.
Stephen: ONLY SEVEN TEETH. AND HE STARTED OFF WITH THE NORMAL NUMBER OF TEETH.
IS THIS I BELIEVE SO.
Stephen: OKAY. HOW DID YOU MEET REGGIE?
SO REGGIE, I KNOW THAT REALLY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ADOPT DOGS, AND WE SHOULD, BUT I FOUND REGGIE ON WHAT WAS MAYBE ONE OF THE WORST DAYS OF MY LIFE. I WAS -- I REALLY WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS. I JUST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE. I DID NOT KNOW ANY PERFORMERS OR HOW TO BECOME AN ACTRESS SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE AN ASSISTANT TO A PERFORMER. I WENT ON CRAIGSLIST AND THERE WAS AN OPERA SINGER AND I THOUGHT, THIS IS LIKELY FANCY.
Stephen: YOU MIGHT AS WELL START WITH THE CLASSIEST PERFORMER YOU CAN? NEW YORK?
YES. I WENT TO THIS MAN'S ASSISTANT, MET HIM IN A PUBLIC PLACE, HE SEEMED FINE.
Stephen: AN OPERA SINGER. YES.
Stephen: WOULD I KNOW HIM? ONLY I KNOW HIM.
Stephen: THIS IS NOT A PAVAROTTI?
OH, NO. NO, NOBODY KNOWS HIM EXCEPT FOR ME. (LAUGHTER) AND HE SEEMS PRETTY NORMAL, I GUESS. AND HE WAS, LIKE, WELL, WE NEED HELP DECORATING THE APARTMENT, WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT? AND I WAS, LIKE, OH, I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU, YOU KNOW, MAKE YOUR HOME MORE BEAUTIFUL. HE GAVE ME AN ADDRESS AND SAID, COME HERE. IT'S, LIKE, A FANCY APARTMENT IN THE WEST VEG. I WAS, LIKE, THAT'S GREAT. AND I GOT THERE. THE LOBBY WAS NICE. THE STAIRS WERE REALLY PRETTY. I WENT UP THE STAIRS. I WALKED -- THE APARTMENT DOOR WAS, LIKE, OPEN A CRACK, WHICH IS TRULY FROM A HORROR MOVIE. YOU KNOW --
Stephen: IS HE WITH YOU AT THIS POINT?
NO, H HE IS IN THE HOME. THE HOME, RIGHT?
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ARE THE LIGHTS ON?
OH, EVERYTHING IS BLASTING. LIKE, THE DOOR WAS OPEN A CRACK. I WAS, LIKE, HELLO... AND NO RESPONSE. SO I PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN. I STEPPED IN, AND IT WAS, LIKE -- AND I STEPPED AND I WAS, LIKE, WHAT? AND I HAD STEPPED ON, LIKE, A FULL BURRITO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A EUPHEMISM FOR SOMETHING?
NO.
Stephen: IT WAS ACTUALLY A FULL BURRITO?
YES, IT WAS A COMPLETE BURRITO.
Stephen: UH-HUH. AND I WAS, LIKE, WHAT... AND LOOKED UP AND IT WAS, LIKE -- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WALKING DOWN THE BEACH AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TIME AND YOU STEP ON A DEAD FISH AND YOU'RE, LIKE, OOH AND YOU LOOK UP AND IT'S, LIKE, A RED TIDE SITUATION EVERYWHERE, DEAD FISH AND YOU'RE, LIKE, HOW DID I GET THIS FAR INTO IT?!
Stephen: AND WILL I GET OUT?
AND WILL I EVER GET OUT. AND THE ANSWER IS, CERTAINLY NOT, IS WHAT I WAS THINKING. I HAVE THAT KIND OF PERSONALITY WHERE MY MOM WOULD NEVER PUT MY NAME ON MY SHIRTS. NO "JENNY" SHIRTS OR ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M VERY FRIENDLY AND SHE WAS AFRAID SOME WEIRDO IN A VAN WOULD BE, LIKE, JENNY! I'M SUPPOSED TO PICK YOU UP FROM SCHOOL TODAY, AND I'M JUST LIKE, BOOP, BOOP, BOOP, BOOP! (LAUGHTER) YEAH, I'M STEPPING ON THIS WALL STREET O. I LOOK IN THE APARTMENT, IT'S FILLED WITH GARBAGE, A TOTAL CRACK DEN. AND THE DUDE IS IN THERE AND HE'S, LIKE, WELCOME!
Stephen: ANY IDEAS? THIS IS HOW FAR I'VE GOTTEN!
YEAH, AND I WAS LOOKING AROUND, AND I THOUGHT, BE POSITIVE.
Stephen: VERY SWEET. YEAH, JUST TRYING TO LIVE A LIFE. AND, SO, THERE WERE JARS -- EVERYTHING IN ME WERE, LIKE, JENNY, THOSE ARE JARS OF PEE, JUST JARS OF A LIQUID. ARE YOU GUYS OKAY? (LAUGHTER) AND I THOUGHT, WELL, HE'S AN OPERA SINGER, MAYBE IT'S A FANCY TEA BECAUSE HE HAS TO BE LIKE, LALALALALA!
Stephen: VERY NICE, YEAH. O I WAS, LIKE, MAYBE IT'S A DRINK. AND I LOOKED AND ONE WAS A SMUCKER'S JAM JAR WITH JAM STILL IN IT. I'M OKAY, IT'S URINE FROM A HUME NOON AND HE WAS A DRUG ADDICT?
THERE WERE DRUGS EVERYWHERE.
Stephen: IT'S SO POOR PLANNING FOR A DRUG USER TO SAVE THEIR URINE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WELL, CONGRATULATIONS. BUT THEN YOU WENT AND GOT THE DOG, I UNDERSTAND?
WELL, YES.
Stephen: THIS WAS ONE QUESTION, BY THE WAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: I'VE MANAGED TO GET OUT ONE QUESTION, AND I'VE LOVED IT.
RIGHT. SO IT WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE APARTMENT. I EVENTUALLY GOT ON MY CELL PHONE AND PRETENDED TO BE ON THE CALL.
Stephen: YEAH. I SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT? I'VE GOT KIDNEY FAILURE? I'VE GOT TO GO.
RIGHT. I WAS, LIKE, IT'S AN EMERGENCY! AND TRIED TO MAKE A LOT OF SPACE AROUND ME SO I COULD LEAVE. AND THEN I WENT TO A PET STORE TO CHEER MYSELF UP AND LOOK AT THE PUPPIES. SO I WAS, LIKE, WOW, THEY'RE SWEET. THERE WERE ALL THESE PUPPIES AND THERE WAS ONE DOG UP IN THE CORNER AND I GREW UP WITH A DOG LIKE REGGIE, AND HE WAS UP IN THE CORNER AND I WAS, LIKE, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT DOG? AND THEY WERE, LIKE, HE'S NOT A PUPPY AND NOBODY REALLY WANTS HIM AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM. I TOOK IT SO PERSONALLY, I JUST CONTINUED TO PROJECT MYSELF ON TO THIS DOG, ALSO.
