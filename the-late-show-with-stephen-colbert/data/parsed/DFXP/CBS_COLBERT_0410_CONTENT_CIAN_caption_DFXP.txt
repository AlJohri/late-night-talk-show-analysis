TOM PRICE, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN, WE'LL BE LANDING IN ARLINGTON IN JUST A FEW MINUTES FOR YOUR NEPHEW'S SOCCER PRACTICE. TOM PRICE, WE'LL BE ARRIVING AT YOUR LOCAL COSTCO IN 15 MINUTES.

Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES JIM PARSONS, PAMELA ADLON AND MUSICAL GUEST THE KILLERS, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR! HEY! HOW'S IT GOING? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) NOW, FOLKS, RIGHT OFF THE BEAN HERE, I'D LIKE TO WISH MY JEWISH VIEWERS A HAPPY ROSH HASHANAH. I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY. I DON'T KNOW, NONE OF MY JEWISH WRITERS ARE HERE TODAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) OF COURSE, ROSH HASHANAH IS THE JEWISH NEW YEAR. SO HAPPY 5778, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SO GLAD. I'M SO GLAD IT'S 5778. 5777 SUCKED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP, ESPECIALLY WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. AS YOU KNOW, SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER HAS BEEN UNEARTHING ALL SORTS OF DIRT ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S TIES TO RUSSIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUGE. HUGE RUSSIA FANS HERE TONIGHT. AND IT JUST CAME OUT THAT MUELLER REQUESTED DOCUMENTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE RELATED TO "13 DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING INFORMATION." INCLUDING SOME OF THE BIGGEST STORIES SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. CLASSICS LIKE "THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN LAWYER," "SALLY YATES WARNING THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNN," "THE OVAL OFFICE MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR," "MY HOUSE BY FLO RIDA," "THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY," "FLYNN'S FBI INTERVIEW," "LITERALLY ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH PAUL MANAFORT," AND SO MUCH MORE. IT'S ALL COLLECTED ON "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL COLLUSION: VOLUME 45." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT!
Stephen: AVAILABLE WHEREVER C.D.s ARE STILL SOLD. SO I'M GONNA SAY STARBUCKS. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT NUN OF YOU AT HOME COULD SEE IS MY STAGE MANAGER HAS THIS -- A SHOT OF MARK OVER HERE -- MY STAGE MANAGER HAD THIS IN HIS POCKET AND HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF HIS POCKET THE ENTIRE TIME AND I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE DIDN'T HAVE THE PROP OR WHETHER THE MAN WAS HAVING A STROKE. YOU'RE OKAY? YOU'RE FINE. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, NOW, THAT'S FUNNIER THAN ANY JOKE I WILL TELL TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) MULLER SEEMS TO BE CLOSING IN ON FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND DRACULA'S FUN UNCLE, PAUL MANAFORT. AND WELL HE SHOULD BECAUSE, YESTERDAY, WE FOUND OUT THAT, EVEN THOUGH HE REPEATEDLY SAID, "NO CONTACT WITH RUSSIANS," HIS EMAILS NOW REVEAL THAT, WHILE HE WAS TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, MANAFORT OFFERED TO GIVE A RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE "PRIVATE BRIEFINGS" ON THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. THE BILLIONAIRE? OLEG DERIPASKA, WHO'S "AMONG THE TWO TO THREE OLIGARCHS PUTIN TURNS TO ON A REGULAR BASIS." IT'S TWO TO THREE, DEPENDING ON WHO'S BEEN POISONED THIS WEEK. NOW, WHILE MANAFORT MADE THE -- I LIKE PRIVATE BRIEFINGS, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET IN THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM AT MAN FORT'S HOUSE. NOW, WHILE MANAFORT MADE THE OFFER, WE DON'T KNOW IF THESE BRIEFINGS EVER HAPPENED, AND MANAFORT'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THESE EMAILS JUST "REFLECTED AN INNOCUOUS EFFORT TO COLLECT PAST DEBTS." YOU KNOW, AN INNOCUOUS EFFORT TO TRADE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SECRETS FOR CASH. HE WAS JUST GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE MAN WHO HE WORKED FOR AND THE MAN HE SECRETLY WORKED FOR LIKE A MESSENGER ON A BIKE. HE WAS JUST PEDALING BACK AND FORTH. HE WAS -- WHAT'S THE WORD -- HE WAS INFLUENCE PEDDLING. HE DID TRY TO HIDE IT. ONE OF THE EMAILS CONTAINS CRYPTIC MENTIONS OF "BLACK CAVIAR," WHICH INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE IS A VEILED REFERENCE TO PAYMENTS MANAFORT HOPED TO RECEIVE. EITHER THAT, OR BLACK CAVIAR DESCRIBES HOW STEVE BANNON REPRODUCES. ( LAUGHTER ) JON, WASN'T THAT YOUR STRIPPER NAME? BLACK CAVIAR?
Jon: YEAH, BACK IN THE DAY, GOING THROUGH JUILLIARD.
Stephen: YOU WERE YOUNGER.
Jon: YEAH. NEEDED THE MONEY.
Stephen: PIANOS AREN'T CHEAP.
Jon: LESSONS EITHER.
Stephen: NO PHOTOS OR ANYTHING?
Stephen:.
Jon: NO.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD. AND MANAFORT'S EMAILS ARE NOT EXACTLY SUBTLE ABOUT THESE PAYMENTS. ONE REFERS TO THE PERSON "WHO GAVE YOU THE BIGGEST BLACK CAVIAR JAR SEVERAL YEARS AGO." COME ON, YOU CAN'T USE A TERM FOR SOMETHING VERY EXPENSIVE AS A STAND-IN FOR MONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) "YEAH, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT THING WE TALKED ABOUT, IT'S GOING TO COST YOU 10,000 'DIAMONDS,' IF YOU CATCH MY MEANING." ( LAUGHTER ) A WHOLE LOT OF "GOLD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT I'M SURE MANAFORT WILL EXPLAIN THIS AWAY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S TIES TO RUSSIA, HE ALWAYS HAS A SMOOTH ANSWER.
SO TO BE CLEAR, MR. TRUMP HAS NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS?
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY.... OUR POSITION IS...
STEPHEN: YOU SILVER-TONGUED DEVIL. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. THAT'S WHY HE GETS PAID THE LONG CAVIAR.
Jon: HEY, HEY!
Stephen: THERE'S GOOD NEWS IN HEALTHCARE, YOU STILL HAVE IT BUT NOT FOR LONG. REPUBLICANS SAY THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE ON THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO REPLACE OBAMACARE NEXT WEEK. THE NEW BILL IS CALLED GRAHAM-CASSIDY-- STILLS AND NASH WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT-- AND IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF CRITICISM. LIKE FROM THESE PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STANDING BY THE BILL'S AUTHORS, TWEETING "SENATOR, DOCTOR, BILL CASSIDY IS A CLASS ACT WHO REALLY CARES ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEIR HEALTH CARE, HE DOESN'T LIE, JUST WANTS TO HELP PEOPLE!" OF COURSE, HE'S REFERENCING THE CLASSIC CBS SITCOM, SENATOR DOCTOR. IN SEASON 2, HE SOLVES CRIME ON "SENATOR DOCTOR, PRIVATE EYE." AND YOU CAN TRUST TRUMP'S OPINION WHEN IT COMES TO DOCTORS. REMEMBER, HIS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IS THIS GUY. ( LAUGHTER ) HELLO! OKAY! ( PIANO RIFF ) ALL RIGHT, TRY TO RELAX. ( LAUGHTER ) PRACTICALLY EVERY MEDICAL ORGANIZATION OPPOSES THIS BILL, SO WHY ARE REPUBLICANS PUSHING SO HARD TO GET IT THROUGH? THE ANSWER COMES FROM IOWA SENATOR AND "BARGAINING YOU DOWN ON THAT BUTTER CHURN" CHUCK GRASSLEY, WHO EXPLAINED, "YOU KNOW, I COULD MAYBE GIVE YOU TEN REASONS WHY THIS BILL SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED, BUT REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGNED ON THIS SO OFTEN THAT YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CARRY OUT WHAT YOU SAID IN THE CAMPAIGN." "HONEY, I CAN GIVE YOU TEN REASONS WHY I SHOULDN'T GIVE YOU THIS PONY, BUT I PROMISED YOU ONE, SO ENJOY YOUR ALLIGATOR. SADDLE UP!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW. ARE YOU OKAY? OLD SHELDON HIMSELF, JIM PARSONS IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL BE DIGGING INTO YOUR PRIVACY. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, I'M REALLY EXCITED. WE'VE GOT, COMING UP HERE, FROM "YOUNG SHELDON," WE HAVE OLD SHELDON JIM PARSONS COMING UP HERE IN A BIT.
Jon: YOUNG SHELDON, OLD SHELDON.
Stephen: HE PLAYS THE YOUNG VERSION OF HIMSELF. I TOTALLY BELIEVE HE'S NINE YEARS OLD. RAW TALENT. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, ALREADY, WE HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE AT "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT IS A STEAL. IT'S CHEAP. SO FANTASTIC. IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO CONFESSION YOU WILL LEARN WHAT CONFESSION IS LIKE. IT'S MORE FUN THAN ACTUAL CONFESSION. YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS MAKES A GREAT ROSH  HASHANNAH PRESENT. IF NONE OF YOUR JEWISH FRIENDS KNOW WHAT TO ATONE FOR, IT'S MADE TO ORDER, A TIME SAVER, YOU'RE LOSING MONEY IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS THING.
Jon: RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) I SPEND SO MUCH TIME UPSET ABOUT POLITICS THAT SOMETIMES IT'S NICE TO JUST TAKE A BREAK, RELAX FOR A SECOND, AND BE HYSTERICALLY DEPRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. TODAY THAT SOMETHING IS EQUIFAX. YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT EQUIFAX? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, GOOD. BECAUSE THEY KNOW ABOUT YOU. THE MASSIVE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY WAS HACKED, WHICH HAS EXPOSED 143 MILLION PEOPLE TO IDENTITY THEFT. THAT MEANS HALF THE U.S. POPULATION COULD HAVE THEIR IDENTITY STOLEN! WHICH MEANS, IF YOU TURN TO THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU... THAT MIGHT BE YOU AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, THIS IS BIG. AS ONE FRAUD ANALYST SAID, "ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10 IN TERMS OF RISK TO CONSUMERS, THIS IS A 10." A 10! WHICH IS ALSO YOUR CREDIT SCORE AFTER THIS HACK. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHAT EXACTLY WAS COMPROMISED? ONLY EVERYONE'S CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AS WELL AS NAMES, BIRTHDATES, AND ADDRESSES. SO CHANGING YOUR PASSWORDS WON'T HELP AND IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN CHANGE MY BIRTH DATE! IT IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE MAY 13TH... 1985. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) AT LEAST ONCE THEY REALIZED THEY'D BEEN HACKED, EQUIFAX RUSHED TO GET THE WORD OUT ON SEPTEMBER 7TH... AFTER THEY DISCOVERED IT ON JULY 29TH. THEY WAITED FIVE WEEKS! "HELLO, 911, I'D LIKE TO REPORT A CAR ACCIDENT! THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE. YEAH, IT WAS ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO. SOMEONE SHOULD REALLY DO SOMETHING. BY THE WAY, HOW DO I GET DRIED BLOOD OUT OF YOUR UPHOLSTERY?" SO THAT'S HORRENDOUS, "ALMOST" AS HORRENDOUS AS NEVER SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THEY SUFFERED ANOTHER HACK FIVE MONTHS EARLIER, WHICH INVOLVED THE SAME INTRUDERS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) NO, COME ON, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- "FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. FOOL ME TWICE, I AM YOU BECAUSE I JUST STOLE YOUR IDENTITY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND IT GETS WORSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IDENTITY THEFT. AND IT GETS WORSE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. THE SENATE IS NOW CALLING ON THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE FACT THAT "THREE EQUIFAX MANAGERS SOLD COMPANY STOCK RIGHT "BEFORE" THE CYBERHACK WAS REVEALED." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) OH, THERE IS LEADERSHIP. THANK GOD THESE PEOPLE AREN'T PILOTS. "AH, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, PAY NO ATTENTION TO THOSE MOUNTAINS WE'RE APPROACHING. THE COPILOT AND I ARE GOING TO KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE BY STEPPING OUTSIDE AND MAKING SURE THESE PARACHUTES ARE WORKING." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF. LIKE SET A FREEZE ON YOUR CREDIT SO THIEVES CAN'T MESS WITH IT. BUT LAST WEEK, PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO SET UP THOSE FREEZES THROUGH EQUIFAX "DISCOVERED THEY HAD TO PAY EQUIFAX FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF PROTECTING THEMSELVES." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) SO THEY MADE YOU PAY THEM TO PROTECT YOU... FROM THEM? THAT'S NOT A CREDIT RATING AGENCY, THAT'S THE MAFIA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) IT EXPLAINS THEIR NEW SLOGAN, "EQUIFAX: NICE CREDIT RATING YOU GOT HERE. IT'D BE A REAL SHAME IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO IT." ( LAUGHTER ) EQUIFAX TRIED TO FIX THINGS BY SETTING UP A WEBSITE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE HACK CALLED "EQUIFAX-SECURITY-2017-DOT-COM" BECAUSE "WE-SUCK-AT-OUR-JOBS-DOT-BIZ" WAS TAKEN. UNFORTUNATELY, BY SETTING IT UP ON A SEPARATE DOMAIN INSTEAD OF HOSTING IT ON EQUIFAX.COM, EQUIFAX MADE IT SUPER EASY FOR BAD GUYS TO SET UP FAKE SITES THAT "SEEM" LIKE "EQUIFAXSECURITY-2017-DOT-COM," WHICH SOMEONE DID, CALLING IT: "SECURITY-EQUIFAX-2017-DOT-COM," AND EQUIFAX DIRECTED THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS TO THE FAKE SITE! ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) SO THEN EQUIFAX ISSUED AN APOLOGY, SAYING, "WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONFUSION, PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS OF VISITING OTHER WEBSITES CLAIMING TO BE OPERATED BY EQUIFAX." ALSO, PLEASE BE REALLY CAUTIOUS OF VISITING WEBSITES THAT ARE OPERATED BY EQUIFAX. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE DEAL -- WELL, AT LEAST YOU STILL HAVE LITIGATION AS THE LAST LINE OF PROTECTION. MAYBE. BECAUSE EQUIFAX IS WAGING A CONCERTED CAMPAIGN TO REPEAL FEDERAL REGULATIONS UPHOLDING CONSUMERS' RIGHTS TO SUE. UH! UH! NO! OUR RIGHT TO SUE IS WHAT MAKES US AMERICAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S UP THERE WITH FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE RIGHT TO SUBSTITUTE ONION RINGS FOR SALAD. ( APPLAUSE ) FOR WHAT ARE ONION RINGS BUT FRIED SALAD? ( LAUGHTER ) THE PROBLEM IS CREDIT RATING COMPANIES HAVE A MONOPOLY ON HARVESTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SO THEY CAN SELL IT TO COMPANIES WHO WANT TO SELL YOU STUFF. YOU AREN'T EQUIFAX'S CUSTOMER. YOU ARE EQUIFAX'S PRODUCT. WE'RE ALL LIKE FACTORY FARM CHICKENS GOING, "I LOVE THE FREE BIRD SEED. THIS PLACE HAS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! GOTTA SAY THOSE WHIRLING BLADES COMING UP SEEM AWFULLY LOW." MANAGER! MANAGER! ( APPLAUSE ) IS THAT A HOOK?
Jon: BETTER WATCH THAT HOOK! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WITH SO MANY CORPORATIONS SELLING, LEAKING, OR ALLOWING YOUR PRIVATE DATE TO BE STOLEN, IT SEEMS THERE'S NO WAY TO PRESERVE YOUR PRIVACY. UNTIL NOW. ♪
WELCOME TO IDENTI-VAULT. I'M THOMAS MURPHY. OR AM I? MAYBE I STOLE THAT. WE'RE THE ONLY COMPANY GUARANTEED TO KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE. NO PHONES, NO INTERNET, NO CONTACT.
BEFORE IDENTITY FAULT I WAS HAVING TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD AND CHANGE MY I.D.
WITH THE PLAN, IT WAS EASY TO MOVE US TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WHERE, FRANKLY, DATA PRIVACY IS THE LEAST OF OUR CONCERNS.
I GO TOILET IN A HOLE. GIT! GIT OFF MY LAND! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY NAME IS! MY NAME IS BUCKSHOT IN YOUR AS! ( GUNFIRE BRRKT
IDENTITY FAULT, NO ONE CAN STEAL EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS NOTHING
IDENTITY FAULT HAS JUST BEEN HACKED. BACK WITH JIM PARSONS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST AS SHELDON FROM "THE BIG BANG THEORY." STARTING MONDAY, YOU CAN ALSO HEAR HIM ON "YOUNG SHELDON."
WHEN I FIGURED OUT THAT TRAINS ALLOWED ME TO PROVE NEWTON'S FIRST LAW, AN OBJECT IN MOTION STAYS IN MOTION WITH THE SAME SPEED AND IN THE SAME DIRECTION UNLESS ACTED UPON BY AN UNBALANCED FORCE, I FELT LIKE NEIL ARMSTRONG ON THE MOON -- ALONE AND HAPPY.
SHELDON, DINNER'S READY! ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T CARE HOW DIM WITTED YOU ARE, SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES HAVE TO MAKE YOU SMILE.
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME JIM PARSONS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HI YA! HOW SWEET IS HE? ISN'T HE CUTE?
Stephen: I HAVE MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES. HE IS AN ABSOLUTELY DOORBELL. HE IS SO CUTE.
HE REALLY IS.
Stephen: HE'S SO SELF-POSSESSED, SO ENGAGING, HE COULD BE A TV STAR OR THE MAYOR OF SOMEPLACE. I.
I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY BACKSTAGE, IS HE NOT NICE? FIRST OF ALL, HE'S NINE.
Stephen: SOMEBODY ASKED YOU IF THIS CHILD WAS NICE?
FIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY! NO, IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. FUNNY YOU ASK BECAUSE HE AND HIS MOTHER HAVE AN AGREEMENT. SHE SAID, WHAT'S OUR AGREEMENT? HE SAID, AS LONG AS I'M A NICE PERSON, I CAN KEEP DOING THIS.
Stephen: WOW! DO WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW ANY MORE THAN THAT?
Stephen: I SHOULD MAKE THE SAME AGREEMENT WITH MY MOM. THAT'S REALLY NICE. LISTEN, SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GOT MARRIED.
YES.
Stephen: MAZEL TOV. THANK YOU.
Stephen: FANTASTIC. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP?
WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER 15 YEARS IN NOVEMBER.
Stephen: WOW! YEAH.
Stephen: OTHER THAN LEGAL REASONS, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WELL, HONEST, I REALLY DIDN'T THINK WE CARED ABOUT THE ACT OF IT THAT MUCH, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. AND THAT SOUNDS COLD IN A WAY, BUT I FINALLY THOUGHT, WELL, LET'S HAVE A PARTY, THEN, FOR THE CELEBRATION OF AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND LEGALIZE THIS THING.
Stephen: RIGHT. I REALLY THOUGHT IT ENDED THAT KIND OF A PARTY FEEL, BUT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL IN THE MOMENT TO ME THAN I PREDICTED AND IT'S BEEN RESONANTLY MORE MEANINGFUL AFTERWARD THAN I EVER SAW COMING. I HAVE BEEN AN ADULT GAY PERSON FOR SO LONG IN A TIME WHERE THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE THAT LIFE WAS "FINE." YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I GOT ALONG FINE, AND OUR RELATIONSHIP DID.
Reporter: YOU WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT GETTING MARRIED. WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU, NOW THAT YOU AND TODD ARE MARRIED? WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP?
I DON'T KNOW ON A SPECIFIC DAY-TO-DAY SENSE WHAT IT IS. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANYTHING. THERE IS AN UNDERLYING THING, A LITTLE BUZZ OF SOMETHING THAT I KNOW. I KEEP REMINDING MYSELF OF IT AND I KIND OF FORGET, AND THEN, WE'RE A LEGAL THING, JUST LIKE MOM AND DAD WERE! WHATEVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU FEEL DIFFERENT BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED?
Stephen: WE WERE ONLY TOGETHER TWO AND A HALF YEARS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH, IT FEELS DIFFERENT. I HAVE BEEN MARRIED 24 YEARS NOW.
PRETTY DAMN GOOD.
Stephen: ( CHEERING )
Stephen: AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THAT BETTER OR WORSE THING IS FANTASTIC.
YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE THERE ARE WORSTS. NOBODY'S THEIR BEST ALL THE TIME. YOU WANT TO BE THE BERT BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUR WORST AND YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY WHO SAID I KNEW THIS COULD BE BAD BUT I'M HERE WITH YOU FOREVER, THE SENSE OF ETERNITY IS VERY COMFORTING.
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. THERE IS SOMETHING -- AND I FELT THIS EVEN BEFORE GETTING MARRIED -- THIS IS GETTING REALLY DEEP FOR A SECOND -- IS THAT THESE PEOPLE CAN TAKE IT.
YOU CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH. THERE IS THIS SENSE OF DIVINITY, TO BE -- I FELT LIKE THIS, I STILL FEEL LIKE THIS -- TO BE IN LOVE, TO FIND LOVE IN THAT WAY IS AS CLOSE AS ANYTHING ELSE I CAN IMAGINE IN DOING IN LIFE THAT GIVES ME THE FEELING OF BEING CLOSE TO GOD OR WHATEVER THAT IS FOR YOU, THE SENSATION. I REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST -- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO GO INTO THIS. WHEN WE FIRST GOT TOGETHER I CAN REMEMBER LYING IN BED, CLOSING MY EYES BUT NOT BEING ASLEEP AND THAT SENSATION OF LIGHT, LIGHT, LIGHT! AND I WAS, LIKE, OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY, BUT IT FEELS LIKE CLOSE TO SOMETHING IMPORTANT, ETERNAL, YOU KNOW. MY DAD HAD PASSED BEFORE A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE I MET TODD, AND I REMEMBER VERY EARLY ON THE SENSATION I WOULD HAVE WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES AND I FELT THAT LIGHT AND I THOUGHT, THAT'S HIM! HE'S GOING I SEE YOU, ALL GOOD, THIS IS A GREAT THING! IT BOTH WAS AND WASN'T, OBVIOUSLY, BUT IF I THINK IT, BUT I STILL FEEL THAT NOW, MAYBE NOT AS OFTEN BECAUSE LIFE GETS IN THE WAY, BUT SOMETIMES THAT SENSATION IN CLOSING THE EYES AND GOING THIS IS SO CLOSE TO GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER WORD TO USE FOR IT.
Stephen: LOVE. THERE. ( APPLAUSE ) WAS ANY OF THIS ON THE CARD?
Stephen: THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS. UH-HUH.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
Stephen: NOW, MONDAY -- EASON PREMIERE.
Stephen: OF "YOUNG SHELDON."
YES.
Stephen: THIS WAS YOUR IDEA, YOU SAID WE SHOULD HAVE A YOUNG SHELDON.
TODD AND I WERE TALKING, WE RUN A PRODUCTION COMPANY, ERIC WAS, LIKE, PERSONAL IDEAS FROM YOUR LIFE ARE SO MUCH EASIER TO SELL BECAUSE THEY'RE MEANINGFUL AND YOU CAN PITCH THEM AND GET A GOOD WRITER TEAM BECAUSE NONE OF US WRITE AND WE WERE, LIKE, LET'S GO THROUGH THE FAMILY. WE WENT THROUGH MY MOTHER AND SISTER, IT WOULD BE GOOD COMEDY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD LIKE IT. THEN WHO'S THE BIGGEST CHARACTER IN MY FAMILY? 10-YEAR-OLD MICHAEL -- IS HE 11 NOW? SORRY, MICHAEL.
Stephen: YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE'S NOT ALL RIGHT.
NO, THAT WAS THE WRONG GESTURE AND NOISE, THEN. HE'S BRIGHTER THAN THE REST OF THE FAMILY.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT ALSO, IN TEXAS, AND WE STARTED TOYING WITH IT AND IT WAS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS VERGING VERY CLOSE TO WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A YOUNG SHELDON. SO I WROTE CHUCK, LAURIE, AND I WAS, LIKE, I JUST WANT TO PUT THIS OUT HERE, IF YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA WE SHOULD RUN WITH, LET'S GO. BUT IF YOU DON'T, AND I SENSE YOU MAY NOT, BECAUSE SOMEBODY MAY HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS ALREADY, THEN WE'LL GO OUR OWN WAY AND STEER CLEAR WITH IF SHELDON THEORY AND GO WITH THE NEPHEW. AND HE WROTE BACK AND SAID I LOVE THIS.
Stephen: CBS SAID THIS IS THE QUICKEST ANYTHING HAD EVER BEEN GREEN LIT.
WHAT'S FUNNY IS I HAD THE SENSATION THAT THE REASON THEY'RE GOING TO SAY NO WHEN I BRING IT UP IS OF COURSE THEY'VE THOUGHT OF THIS. IT'S REALLY THE MOST SIMPLISTIC OF IDEAS THAT END UP BEING, OH, GREAT! WELL, ANY DODO BIRD COULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. A YOUNG VERSION OF HIM. I TALKED CEASELESSLY ABOUT WHAT BEING A YOUNG BOY IN TEXAS WAS LIKE AS SHELDON AND IT WAS SITTING THERE, A TREASURE TROVE.
Stephen: HOW ARE THE FAMILY DEALING WITH HARVEY?
THEY'RE GOOD. THEY SUFFERED NO PERSONAL HOME DAMAGE OR ANYTHING. IT WAS THE STRANGEST AND MOST TENSE 72 HOURS OR. SO I'VE NEVER GONE THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE IT, IT WAS VERY SINGULAR IN FOCUS. IT'S SO FUNNY IN THIS DAY OF THE INTERNET AND YOU CAN STREAM EVERYTHING. I HAD LOCAL HOUSTON NEWS STREAMING EVERYTHING ON MY COMPUTER BECAUSE THEY WERE GIVING THE MOST PERTAINING TO STREETS. MY SISTER'S HOUSE WAS ALWAYS FINE. MY MOTHER IS ALONE AND IN A ONE-STORY HOUSE, SO SHE WAS FINE, FINE, AND THEN THE STREETS FILLED UP AND THEN IT GOT TO HER SIDEWALK, AND THERE WAS THIS DEBATE GOING ON, SHALL WE TAKE HER WITH US? AND WE'RE, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE THINKING? TAKE HER WITH YOU BECAUSE HOPEFULLY NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
Stephen: YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CHOPPERED OFF YOUR ROOF.
NO, AND MY SISTER'S FRIENDS, PEOPLE WE KNOW HAD TO CLIMB UP ON THEIR ROOF. I WAS, LIKE, I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF MY 69-YEAR-OLD MOTHER CRAWLING UP ON THE ROOF.
Stephen: MM-HMM. FOR ANY REASON.
FOR ANY REASON.
Stephen: TO CLEAR THE GUTTERS.
NO MORE CLEANING GUTTERS, HANGING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, DOWN, WOMAN, DOWN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "YOUNG SHELDON" APPEARS MONDAY 8:30 ON CBS RIGHT AFTER THE SEASON PREMIERE OF "THE BIG BANG THEORY." JIM PARSONS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE BACK WITH PAMELA ADLON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM CALIFORNICATION, LOUIE, AND VOICE OF BOBBY ON KING OF THE HILL AND "BETTER THINGS."
WHERE YOU GOING? PITCH, TO THE MOON. THAT'S SO OFFENSIVE. I'M SO FAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
SUZY. MOM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO THE MOON, PITCH. SHUT UP, FRANKIE. WE DON'T NEED SUZY, I CAN WATCH EVERYONE.
DON'T LEAVE US WITH SUZY OR MAX, SHE'S SO MUCH WORSE.
FINE, THEN NO ONE'S COMING, I DON'T CARE.
CAN I HAVE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OVER? I'LL HAVE A PARTY.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. THERE IS NOTHING WORTH ANYTHING TO ME EXCEPT THE ART, DON'T MESS WITH MY PAINTING.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME PAMELA ADLON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HI, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HI, FALSE START.
Stephen: WE MET BRIEFLY AT THE EMMYS THE OTHER NIGHT. I WAS OUT DOING A BIT WITH JIMMY KIMMEL AND YOU WERE SITTING WITH LOUIE THE CO-CREATOR OF THE SHOW.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE STRANGE THING, I KNOW YOU WERE NOMINATED AND I WAS THE HOST.
YES.
Stephen: BUT I WAS BACKSTAGE DEALING WITH BUSINESS. I DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE EVERY CATEGORY. I KNOW THIS IS A CRAZY QUESTION BUT --
I DIDN'T WIN.
Stephen: OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WON OR NOT.
STILL LOVELY TO BE NOMINATED.
Stephen: YES. THAT'S LOVELY.
IT WAS KIND OF WEIRD AND THEN I WAS JUST READING OFF THIS STUFF, WHO WILL UNSEAT JULIA LOUIE DREYFUS? I SAID, CAN'T EVERYONE BE NOMINATED NORMALLY? SHE HAD WON FIVE TIMES.
Stephen: THE HIGHLANDER CAN ONLY BE --
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU GOT A PEABODY THIS YEAR.
YES.
Stephen: MUCH COOLER THAN AN EMMY.
YES. ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S, LIKE, SMART PEOPLE THINK MY SHOW IS IMPORTANT.
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT. MUCH MORE EXCLUSIVE CLUB.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING, I FOUND OUT, SINCE UH YOU WERE 1 YEARS OLD IN SHOW BUSINESS.
YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU ONE OF THE PEOPLE LUCKY ENOUGH WHERE THEY STARTED WORKING AND JUST DID SHOW BUSINESS OR DID YOU HAVE TO DO --
NO, I DIDN'T JUST DO SHOW BUSINESS.
Stephen: OKAY. MY DAD AND MOM WERE ALWAYS WORKERS AND INSTILLED A WORK ETHIC IN US. MY FATHER WAS A WRITER AND PRODUCER. MY MOTHER DID EVERY OTHER KIND OF JOB, YOU KNOW, TO SUPPORT US.
Stephen: BRICKLAYER? HE WAS A TRAVEL AGENT, SHE WORKED FOR A COMPOSER AND A PUBLISHING COMPANY, AND MY FATHER WOULD GET ODD JOBS WRITING, LIKE, SOFT CORE PORN AND DIME STORE NOVELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: REALLY? ANYTHING I WOULD KNOW?
LIKE SUPER DOLL AND TURN THE OTHER CHIC, THINGS LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUE STORY.
Stephen: TURN THE OTHER CHIC, IS THAT SOFT CORE PORN WITH AN ARAB SHEIK?
YES! DID YOU READ IT?
Stephen: NO! ( APPLAUSE )
HOW DO YOU KNOW? ( PIANO RIFF ) DO YOU HAVE A COPY? ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: VERY GOOD. I HAVE A FIRST EDITION.
OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO WHAT DID YOU DO TO GET BY?
WELL, YOU KNOW, VERY YOUNG, I STARTED WORKING AND THEN I, YOU KNOW, THE JOBS STOPPED HAPPENING, SO I JUST TOOK ANY JOB. I WORKED IN RETAIL. I WORKED AT CLOTHING STORES, I HANDED OUT FLYERS FOR THE NEW YORK POPS, I WORKED IN A FLOWER STORE, ANYTHING. I LIKED TO MAKE MONEY. IT WAS IMPORTANT.
Stephen: YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM RAISING THREE KIDS.
I HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS.
Stephen: THIS IS THE SECOND SEASON.
YES.
Stephen: YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOUR KIDS' BEHAVIORS SHOW UP IN THE SHOW? I HAVE THREE CHILDREN AND I WORK HARD NOT TO PUT THEM IN THE SHOW FOR FEAR THEY WILL HATE ME.
YES ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T CANNIBALIZE EVERY ASPECT. SEASON ONE IS CERTAINLY MORE EXPOSITIONAL AND I'M TELLING THE STORY, LIKE THE BONES OF MY LIFE, BUT IT'S FLUSHED OUT BEYOND, BUT, I MEAN, THEY LOOK AT IT, THEY'RE, LIKE, MOM, THAT'S ME. I'M, LIKE, DUDE, IT'S NOT YOU. THAT'S A STORY THAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. NO, MOM! REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU I WENT INTO THE BOYS' ROOM? I'M, LIKE, NO, DUDE! THAT IS MY LIFE. SO ANYWAY.
Stephen: YOU SAY, MY WORK IS UNIVERSAL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IS THE SHOW ALL CONSUMING? YOU CREATE IT, DIRECT IT, WRITE IT. DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE. IS IT LIKE EVERYTHING OUT OF MY LIFE, ONLY THIS?
I KIND OF PUT IT OFF FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I'M RAISING MY DAUGHTERS AND I WAS WORKING ON CALIFORNICATION AND LOUIE AT THE TIME I WAS TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE CONCEPT FOR THE SHOW AND I HAD TO STOP WATCHING BREAKING BAD BECAUSE I WAS BINGE WATCHING IT AND IT WAS KILLING ME AND THE FINALE WAS COMING AND I WAS, LIKE, I CAN'T OPEN MY COMPUTER BECAUSE THE INTERNET IS GOING TO RUIN IT FOR ME SO, I MEAN, I WAS GOING CROSS-EYED, I WASN'T WRITING OR TAKING CARE OF MY CHILDREN, I WAS TRYING TO FINISH WATCHING BREAKING BAD. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DID YOU MAKE IT BEFORE --
NO.
Stephen: -- SOMEBODY SPOILED IT?
I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SPOIL THINGS, EVEN IF THINGS ARE KNOWN.
Stephen: EVENTUALLY WALTER WHITE THROWS THE RING INTO THE CRACKS OF DOOM. ( LAUGHTER ) DID SOMEBODY SPOIL IT FOR YOU?
NO, I OPENED THE COMPUTER, THERE WAS A PICTURE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THE INTERNET AND I WENT, OOH!
Stephen: THAT'S TERRIBLE. BUT NOW I STARTED WORKING ON MY SHOW, SO NOW I HAVE A SHOW.
Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW THE BIBLE ENDS, RIGHT?
I DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL ME! I SWEAR TO GOD!
Stephen: IT'S GOT A VERY HAPPY ENDING.
BUT WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME STORIES OF THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT, LIKE THE BIBLE, AND THEY SAY, OH, HE GOT KILLED BY HER, AND I'M, LIKE, DON'T TELL ME! YOU'RE RUINING IT.
Stephen: AT THE END OF IT WHEN THE ROMANS COME JESUS HAS A MACHINE GUN IN THE TRUNK AND WIPES THEM ALL OUT.
AND THROWS THE RINGS --
Stephen: EXACTLY. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SECOND SERIES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
