Stephen: HEY, PAUL. DID YOU HEAR ELON MUSK SAYS OUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE MIGHT JUST BE A SIMULATION INSIDE SOME ALIEN CIVILIZATION'S VIDEO GAME?
THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? (ALL YEN MUSIC)
Announcer: TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES PATRICK WILSON! GAYLE KING! GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON AND GOVERNOR WILLIAM WELD. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  Captioning sponsored by CBS ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON! GOOD TO SEE YA! HEY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANKS, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I'M INCREDIBLY HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU FOLKS TONIGHT. I'M GOING TO START THE SHOW TONIGHT GUNS BLAZING. SPECIFICALLY, J.K. SIMMONS' GUNS. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PHOTO? HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIPPED. APPARENTLY "J.K." STANDS FOR "JESUS KRISPIE KREME, LOOK AT HIS BICEPS!" JIMMY, CAN WE PUT THAT BACK UP THERE? THAT MAN IS 61 YEARS OLD. UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS A RELIEF TO KNOW I CAN WAIT TEN MORE YEARS UNTIL I START EXERCISING. I WAS GOING TO GO TOMORROW, BUT I THOUGHT, I'VE GOT TEN MORE YEARS. I'LL HAVE THE PIE, THANK YOU. BUT HERE'S WHAT'S BOTHERING ME ABOUT THIS. SIMMONS IS TRAINING FOR HIS ROLE AS COMMISSIONER GORDON IN THE NEW JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE. SO NOW EVEN THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS IN SUPERHERO MOVIES NEED TO GET RIPPED? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE AUNT MAE WITH A 20 INCH NECK. I THINK THIS IS FOR COMMISSIONER GORDON. THOUGH THIS MIGHT BE BAD INTEL. MAYBE IT'S NOT FOR COMMISSIONER GORDON. HE COULD BE PREPARING FOR HIS NEXT MOVIE "JACKED SANTA." YES, COMIC THIS CHRISTMAS, JACK SANTA! THIS HOLIDAY SEASON ALL SANTA'S GOT IN HIS SACK IS A CAN OF WHUPASS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WOULD GO SEE JACK SANTA. WHATEVER THE REASON, DELIVERS TOYS, FIGHTS CRIME. (LAUGHTER) WHATEVER THE REASON, THAT BOY FROM WHIPLASH HAD BETTER LOCK HIS DOORS. "AM I RUSHING OR DRAGGING? GOD HELP ME, I WILL SLAP THE "HEAD" OFF YOUR SHOULDERS!" IN OTHER J.K NEWS, J.K. ROWLING HAS PREMIERED A  NEW PLAY IN LONDON -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- CALLED "HARRY POTTER AND  THE CURSED CHILD." THE STORY TAKES PLACE 19 YEARS AFTER THE LAST BOOK AND FOLLOWS HARRY'S SON WHO IS CURSED WITH MAKING CASH APPEAR IN J.K. ROWLING'S BANK ACCOUNT. EXPECTO PAY-DAYUM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, I LOVE HARRY POTTER, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE PLAY. IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE THE FIRST THING ON MY LIST THE NEXT TIME I APPARATE TO LONDON -- I MEAN FLY TO LONDON. I'VE SAID TOO MUCH. MEANWHILE... BACK ON THIS SIDE OF THE POND, THE 2016 GENERAL ELECTION MATCH-UP IS SET. IT WILL BE HILLARY CLINTON VERSUS DONALD TRUMP VERSUS AMERICA'S GAG REFLEX. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHO WILL WIN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHO? SO NOW THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHO WILL THEY PICK AS THEIR RUNNING MATES? A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT HILLARY TO PICK ELIZABETH WARREN. AND THESE PEOPLE LIKE HER, ALREADY. AND WARREN IS ALREADY OUT THERE ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP. JUST TODAY SHE TOLD A CROW, "DONALD TRUMP IS A LOUD, NASTY, THIN-SKINNED FRAUD." THAT IS JUST WRONG. THERE'S NO WAY THAT STUFF COVERING HIS FACE IS SKIN. (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO SAY, PRESSURE-TREATED ADOBE? MEANWHILE, TRUMP SAYS THAT HE'S NARROWED HIS LIST OF CANDIDATES DOWN TO FOUR OR FIVE. THOUGH, IF IT'S A WOMAN, SHE'LL DEFINITELY BE A TEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SOMEHOW THAT EXCITED SOME PEOPLE. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHY. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP SAYS HE'LL SAVE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE CONVENTION, BUT SOME ADVISERS ARE REPORTEDLY WORRIED THAT HE'LL POST IT ON TWITTER WITHOUT WARNING, OR THAT A WHITE SUPREMACIST WILL POST IT, AND HE'LL JUST RETWEET IT.
Jon: OH, MAN!
Stephen: BUT IT'S HAPPENED.
Jon: IT WOULD HAPPEN. HE MIGHT DO IT. I GUESS. MAYBE.
Stephen: BUT IT'S NOT JUST TRUMP AND CLINTON.    BERNIE SANDERS HAS REFUSED TO DROP OUT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND TODAY HE HAD A PRIVATE -- APPARENTLY EVERYONE IN MY AUDIENCE SUPPORTS EVERY CANDIDATE. THAT'S VERY NICE OF THEM. (APPLAUSE) AND TODAY HE HAD A PRIVATE MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE  WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHICH WAS FITTING SINCE THEY'RE BOTH BELOVED POLITICAL FIGURES WHO ARE JUST A FEW MONTHS AWAY FROM NOT BEING PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S A NICE, CLEAN JOKE.
Stephen: NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WILL WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE, ALTHOUGH, I ASSUME, OBAMA DID. SOMETHING TO CONVINCE BERNIE TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE. "ALL RIGHT, BERNIE, YOU CAN SIT BEHIND THE DESK. TAKE A SELFIE. AND NOW GET OUT." (LAUGHTER) AFTER MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND CHECKING UNDER THE WHITE HOUSE DOORMAT FOR A SPARE KEY, BERNIE TOLD REPORTERS THAT HE'S WILLING TO WORK WITH HILLARY CLINTON TO FIGHT A COMMON ENEMY.
I SPOKE BRIEFLY TO SECRETARY CLINTON ON TUESDAY NIGHT, AND I CONGRATULATED HER ON HER VERY STRONG CAMPAIGN. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH HER IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO SEE HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP.
STEPHEN: YES, THEY WILL WORK TOGETHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THEY WILL WORK TOGETHER. HE WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH HER THE WHOLE TIME, AT EVERY DEBATE, ANDING IN THE WINGS, NO MOUTHING ALONG WITH ALL HER LINES. (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, OBAMA LEFT THE MEETING AND IMMEDIATELY ENDORSED HILLARY, SAYING, "I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN SOMEONE SO QUALIFIED TO HOLD THIS OFFICE."
Stephen: SUCK IT, THIRD TERM F.D.R. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE TO BE HONEST, THOSE ARE WORDS I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. SUCK IT, F.D.R.! (LAUGHTER) AFTER THE ENDORSEMENT, TRUMP TWEETED, "OBAMA JUST ENDORSED CROOKED HILLARY. HE WANTS FOUR MORE YEARS OF OBAMA -- BUT NOBODY ELSE DOES!" THEN HILLARY IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED, "DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S PRETTY STRONG! I TELL YA, IF HE NEEDS HELP DELETING COMPUTER RECORDS, SHE KNOWS A GUY. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: SUCK IT, F.D.R.! (LAUGHTER) BUT BERNIE'S SHOWING NO SIGNS OF ENDING HIS CAMPAIGN. WITH ONLY ONE PRIMARY LEFT TO GO, BERNIE HAS CHANGED HIS SLOGAN FROM -- AND THIS IS TRUE -- "FEEL THE BERN" TO "THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES." IT'S A GREAT SLOGAN. CLEARLY, HE GOT IT FROM A HIGH-PRICED POLITICAL CONSULTANT. OR READ IT OFF A CAN OF PRUNES. SAY HI TO JOHN BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH! YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING OVER THERE A SECOND AGO -- REMEMBER WHEN I WAS STANDING OVER THERE? THOSE WERE GOOD TIMES. ANYWAY, WHEN I WAS OVER THERE TALKING IN THE OTHER CAMERA, I WAS SAYING THAT BERNIE SANDERS HAS NOT DROPPED OUT YET. BUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS ALREADY STARTED REACHING OUT TO HIS SUPPORTERS. AND, SHOCKINGLY, SO HAS DONALD TRUMP.
TO ALL OF THOSE BERNIE SANDERS VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD BY A RIGGED SYSTEM OF SUPERDELEGATES, WE WELCOME YOU WITH OPEN ARMS.
STEPHEN: YEAH, BERNIE SUPPORTERS, DONALD TRUMP WELCOMES YOU WITH OPEN ARMS. IF YOU CAN'T HAVE WHAT YOU WANT, HOW ABOUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY'RE ALL OUT OF CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM SO INSTEAD YOU GET SOMEONE TO CALL YOU FAT AND DEPORT YOUR FAMILY. (LAUGHTER) MM-MM-MM -- THAT SOUNDS GOOD. AND TRUMP IS MAKING HIS APPEAL TO BERNIE SUPPORTERS BY TRYING TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE.
BERNIE SANDERS HAS A MESSAGE THAT'S INTERESTING. I'M GOING TO BE TAKING A LOT OF THE THINGS BERNIE SAID AND USING THEM.
Stephen: OKAY. HE'S GOING TO USE A LOT OF THINGS BERNIE SAID. BERNIE, THAT WORKS BOTH WAYS. SO FEEL FREE TO START TALKING ABOUT HOW HOT TRUMP'S. DAUGHTER IS. STILL, NO MATTER HOW HARD TRUMP TRIES, THE IDEA THAT BERNIE VOTERS WOULD SUPPORT HIM JUST SEEMS OUTLANDISH, CARTOONISH EVEN. HERE TO EXPLAIN THIS STRATEGY IS CARTOON DONALD TRUMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MR. CARTOON TRUMP, WELCOME BACK.
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK, STEPHEN, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I'M THE PARTY'S UNDISPUTED HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION NOMINEE. WOO! HAIL TO THE ME.
Stephen: WOO, INDEED. YOU SEEM PRETTY CONFIDENT. BUT DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK YOU CAN WIN OVER BERNIE SUPPORTERS?
MY ARMS ARE WIDE OPEN, STEPHEN. COME ON OVER HERE, GIMME A HUG. COME ON, AT LEAST A HIGH FIVE. UP TOP, DOWN LOW, TOO SLOW. YOU MISSED THE HAND. IT'S YUGE. IT'S FANTASTIC.
Stephen: THAT'S ON ME. THAT'S ON ME. I APOLOGIZE.
YEAH, AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS EVERYBODY ELSE' FAULT.
STEPHEN: MR. CARTOON TRUMP, YOU DO REALIZE THAT BERNIE SUPPORTERS DON'T LIKE YOU.
PERFECT. I DO VERY WELL WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE ME. I'M TELLING YOU, THE PEOPLE WHO HATE ME, THEY LOVE ME.
STEPHEN: OKAY, BUT YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN -- BERNIE SUPPORTERS TEND TO BE VERY YOUNG AND VERY LIBERAL.
STEPHEN, I'M KNOWN FOR LIKING 'EM YOUNG. COME ON! I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. PLUS, I'M VERY LIBERAL. CHECK OUT MY NEW "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" HAT. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK. LOOK, I'M A TRUMP-STAFARIAN. GET MELLOW WITH ME, MON. COME ON, GET MELLOW!
Stephen: THANK YOU, THAT'S A FRIGHTENING SIGHT. THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL DREADLOCKS.
FIFTH AVENUE.
STEPHEN: BUT YOU AND BERNIE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON. HE'S A SOCIALIST.
ME TOO! MY DAUGHTER'S A SOCIALITE. I GO TO ALL THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONS. WE'RE TOTAL SOCIALISTS.
STEPHEN: SO ARE YOU JUST ABANDONING YOUR PLATFORM TO WIN OVER BERNIE VOTERS?
NO WAY, JOSE. I'M STILL BUILDING THAT WALL WITH MEXICO. BUT NOW IT'S GONNA BE COVERED IN PHISH POSTERS. NOW, JOIN MY DRUM CIRCLE, BERNIE VOTERS! FIGHT THE POWER! JAM BANDS! KOMBUCHA! C'MON, JOIN IN! BONGO, BONGO. BANG, BANG, BANG.
STEPHEN: CARTOON DONALD TRUMP, EVERYONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH PATRICK WILSON.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS PLAYED JUST ABOUT  EVERY KIND OF ROLE AN ACTOR CAN PLAY, FROM MUSICALS, TO SUPERHERO MOVIES, TO JUST SOME  REALLY CREEPY DUDES. NOW HE'S BACK, PLAYING GHOST HUNTER ED WARREN IN "THE CONJURING 2."
WHAT'S THAT? ED -- THERE'S -- THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND YOU.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME PATRICK WILSON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
AH, SO FESTIVE. LOVE THEM.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW YOU DOING? THAT MOVIE SCARES ME.
LOOKS LIKE I TAKE TEN MINUTES ON A WRENCH.
Stephen: LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT ON CBS. (LAUGHTER) I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS. I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOURS WHEN I HEARD YOU SINGING SEE THERE'S A BRIGHT GOLDEN HAZE ON THE MEADOW "IN" OKLAHOMA. YOUR FIRST BREAKOUT WAS FULL MONTE ON BROADWAY. YOU'VE DONE COMEDY, DRAMA, HORROR. IS THERE A PATRICK WILSON ROLE? IF SOMEONE SAID GET ME A PATRICK WILSON TYPE, WHAT DO THEY SAY?
USUALLY A VERY CONFLICTED ALL-AMERICAN LOOKING GUY.
Stephen: ARE WE CONFLICTED ABOUT HIM OR IS HE CONFLICTED ABOUT BEING ALL AMERICAN?
WELL, THERE IS THAT. THERE IS AN ELECTION YEAR.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU KNOW, I THINK BECAUSE MY FIRST THING OUT TO HAVE THE GATE WAS ANGELS IN AMERICA ON HBO, THE MINI SERIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO WHEN THAT'S SORT OF YOUR CALLING CARD, HONESTLY, EVEN IF YOU CAN'T ACT, IT CERTAINLY SAYS, WOW, YOU CAN HOLD YOUR OWN WITH OTHER BIG PEOPLE.
Stephen: BUT YOU ALSO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SINGING VOICE. YOU SING A LITTLE BIT IN THIS MOVIE.
YES, IT WAS THE FIRST SCENE JAMES OUR DIRECTOR WROTE WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE MOVIE TO DIRECT IT. HE TEXTED ME ONE NIGHT AND SAID, DO YOU PLAY GUITAR? I SAID, YEAH, WHY? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IN A HORROR MOVIE THAT REQUIRES A GUITAR? AND I ENDED UP SINGING ELVIS IN THE MOVIE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU SING. ♪ WISE MEN SAY ♪ A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT, BUT NOT MUCH (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S A PERFECT SONG FOR A HORROR MOVIE BECAUSE THE NEXT LINE IS "ONLY FOOLS RUSH IN." ELVIS MIGHT AS WELL BE SINGING. ♪ GET OUT TO HAVE THE BASEMENT NOW ♪ ♪ A GUY BEHIND YOU WITH A KNIFE ♪ (LAUGHTER) "THE CONJURING 2" WAS AN ENORMOUS HIT. DID YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE?
I KNEW IT WOULD BE GOOD. THIS IS MY FOURTH MOVIE WITH JAMES. I KNEW WHEY KNOWS WHAT TO DO IN THIS GENRE. THE FIRST ONE REACHED SUCH A WIDER AUDIENCE. WHAT'S COOL ABOUT THESE MOVIES IS UNLIKE SOME RANDOM SCARE, A LOT OF BLOOD AND GUTS, IT'S YOU HAVE A HUSBAND AND WIFE, VERY DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER.
Stephen: BASED ON A TRUE STORY.
YES, THEY WERE PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS, THE BIGGEST IN THIS GENRE, HE PASSED AWAY TEN YEARS AGO AND SHE'S STILL WITH US. SO AT THE CORE, OFF LOVING RELATIONSHIP. SO UNLIKE MOST HORROR FRANCHISES FROM YOU'RE -- WHERE YOU'RE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VILLAINS, YOU HAVE THE GOOD GUYS DOING IT.
Stephen: DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE PARANORMAL?
I'M OPEN TO IT.
Stephen: AT LEAST UNTIL THE POOVY -- MOVIE OPENS, TOTALLY OPEN TO IT.
I'VE HAD A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A LOT OF OLD HOUSES, CRAZY STUFF GOES ON.
Stephen: SURE. I HAVE HAD A FEW OF THOSE. PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE HAVE HEARD THE SAME STRANGE NOISES FROM SPIRITS OF, LIKE, CHILDREN, NOT MY OWN, THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SPIRITS OF CHILDREN IN YOUR HOUSE?
I MEAN, I DID.
Stephen: GET OUT RIGHT NOW! EE, HERE'S THE THING, WHETHER -- MAYBE JUST BECAUSE I'M AN IDIOT, I FEEL LIKE NOW I'VE PLAYED THIS ROLE, LIKE IF THERE ARE SPIRITS, I'VE GOT IT, IT'S ALL GOOD.
Stephen: THAT'S RIDICULOUS! THAT'S LIKE SAYING ONCE YOU'VE PLAYED A DOCTOR YOU CAN DO SURGERY.
WELL, I CAN!
Stephen: DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S DANGEROUS. I'M A CATHOLIC SO I KIND OF HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GHOSTS. FATHER, SON AND HOLY GHOST. WAS THERE A MOVIE THAT SCARED YOU LIKE THE EXORCIST.
SALEM'S LOT FREAKED ME OUT BECAUSE OF THE GUY SCRAPING ON THE WINDOW.
Stephen: VAMPIRES. THEY DON'T SCARE ME TOO MUCH.
Stephen: GHOSTS, VAMPIRES. YEAH.
Stephen: ARE THERE ANY TRICKS TO ACTING IN A SCARY MOVIE? I CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT SCARES ME ABOUT A SCARY MOVIE BECAUSE I CAN NEVER PREDICT THE MOMENT I'M GOING TO JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN. AS AN ACTOR, WHAT DO YOU HAVE DO DO TO BE IN A SCARY MOVIE?
AS MY GRANDFATHER WOULD HAVE TO SAY, YOU CAN'T HALF-ASS IT. YOU HAVE TO WHOLE-ASS IT. YOU HAVE TO DIVE IN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HALF AND WHOLE. THAT'S WITH THE W AT THE FRONT.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH LARGER THAN LIFE --
Stephen: WHAT DID HE DO FOR A LIVING?
HE WAS THE BEST. MY GRANDFATHER WAS AWESOME. HE RAN A GOLF COURSE TO A TAXIDERMIST. HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY.
Stephen: THAT'S KIND OF SPOOKY, TOO. (LAUGHTER) AS I SAID BEFORE, YOU HAD YOUR BREAKOUT ROLE ON BROADWAY WAS THE FULL MONTY, BUT YOU GOT A CHANCE TO DIRECT IT.
I WENT BACK TO MY ALMA MATER CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY, GO TARTANS, AND I GOT TO DIRECT IT. IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO SO I WAS APPROACHING IT FROM A FRESH ANGLE.
Stephen: COLLEGE KIDS? YEAH.
Stephen: AT THE END THE MEN ARE TOTALLY NAKED. IS THAT APPROPRIATE?
HERE'S THE THING. I THOUGHT, YOU'RE COLLEGE KIDS. OF COURSE YOU WANT TO GET NAKED ON STAGE. I THOUGHT COLLEGE KIDS WERE DOWN WITH THAT.
Stephen: THEY WARN US ABOUT MEN LIKE YOU.
I PLAY THAT GUY, TOO.
Stephen: YES, EXACTLY. A DIRECTOR IS GOING TO COME IN FROM NEW YORK AND GOING TO WANT TO SEE YOU NAKED.
SO SAD.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. BRUTAL.
Stephen: WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE NAKED ON STAGE?
FULL MONTY.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU? 27, 28, SOMETHING.
Stephen: OKAY. AND THE WAY THE SHOW WAS ON BROADWAY IS THAT YOU'RE BACK LIT AT THE END OF THE SHOW. IT'S DARK THE ENTIRE TIME. THEN AS SOON AS YOU GET NAKED, THE LIGHTS GO ON IN THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: SO IT'S A VERY STRANGE THING. YOU CAN SEE THEM, BUT THEY CAN'T SEE -- DOWNTOWN.
WHERE YOUR BATHING SUIT GOES! WITH WE HAD A SIMILAR VIBE WHERE YOU HAD THE LIGHTS AT THE BACK.
Stephen: SO YOU REALLY GET NAKED.
YOU DO. BUT IT'S A CLASSY SHOW. IT'S NOT JUST --
Stephen: IT'S VERY TASTEFUL. LET'S LOSE THE PANTS, IT'S GOING TO BE VERY TASTEFUL. (LAUGHTER) WHAT WAS YOUR ADVICE TO THEM?
I SAID YOU CAN SCREW UP EVERY SINGLE OTHER LIGHT CUE IN THE SHOW. DO NOT BLOW THE LAST LIGHT CUE.
Stephen: DID IT EVER HAPPEN FOR YOU?
THEY WERE 0 FOR 3 GOING INTO THE WEEKEND, BY THE WAY. YOU GUYS GOT IT. IT DID HAPPEN TO ME, YEAH, AND I LOCKED EYES WITH AN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL, AND IT STILL SCARS ME. (LAUGHTER)

Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I LIKE THE INTRODUCTION WHEN YOU SAID "SOON TO BE THE MORNING SHOW --
Stephen: YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
WE'VE HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBERS THE NETWORK HAS HAD IN 28 YEARS. SO THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND -- WE HAVEN'T BEEN NUMBER ONE SINCE CAPTAIN KANGAROO. SO WHEN WE STARTED IN 2012, WE WERE 2.5 MILLION BEHIND THE "TODAY SHOW." NOW 600,000 BEHIND VIEWERS. THAT'S REALLY BIG.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. WE'RE WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. WE'RE PSYCHED ABOUT IT. WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LISTEN, THIS IS BROADCASTING TECHNICALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT.
I KNOW.
Stephen: SO AM I OFFICIALLY ON YOUR SHOW RIGHT NOW, "CBS THIS MORNING," BECAUSE IT IS THE MORNING OFFICIALLY NOW.
YOU ARE SO RIGHT. MY ALARM GOES OFF AT 3:20 IN THE MORNING. BUT I WAS UP LATE LAST NIGHT.
Stephen: YOU DID SOMETHING ON A SCHOOL NIGHT?
IT'S CALLED BEYONCE.
Stephen: DID YOU GO TO A CONCERT OR HANG OUT WITH BEYONCE?
NO, I WAS ONE OF 45,000 PEOPLE AT THE CONCERT. I DID GO BACKSTAGE. I'M THE DORK THAT WALKS AROUND. THE THINGS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CUT OFF.
Stephen: IS THIS IT? JUNE 8, 2016, THE FORMATION TOUR, I WAS THERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WOW! THAT MAKES YOU LOOK REALLY COOL, OR LIKE YOU JUST ESCAPED FROM A HOSPITAL. (LAUGHTER)
I FIGURE I'LL CUT IT OFF IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, I FIRST COVERED HER WHEN SHE WAS 18 AS DESTINY'S CHILD, SO TO SEE HER GO FROM THAT TO THE WOMAN SHE IS AMAZING.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE JAY-Z, TOO?
I LOVE HIM.
Stephen: WE DON'T HAVE TO PICK?
NO, YOU CAN LIKE THEM BOTH. THIS IS HOW I DOES COVERED JAY-Z. MY SON WHO IS NOW 29, WHEN HE WAS EIGHT, HE WAS PLAYING A JAY-Z SONG, AND I SAID YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT VULGARITY, TAKE THAT OFF! WHO IS THIS? IT'S VERY DISCONCERTING THING TO HEAR AN 8-YEAR-OLD SAYING GIVE ME THE SWEET, THAT GUSHY STUFF, THAT NASTY STUFF. HE SAYS, IT'S THE BEAT. FAST FORWARD TO A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER. WILL WAS LIVING IN SHANGHAI. I WENT FROM NEW YORK AND HE WENT FROM SHANGHAI AND WE WENT TO PARIS TO SEE JAY-Z. AND WE WANTED TO BE NEGROES IN PARIS SEEING NEGROES IN PARIS SINGING IN PARIS. SO IT'S -- (SINGING JAY-Z SONG) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT'S LANGUAGE LIKE THAT THAT MAKES YOU CATCHING UP ON THE MORNING SHOWS.
I KNOW THIS AUDIENCE CAN HANDLE IT.
Stephen: THEY CAN. I WOULD NEVER TALK LIKE THAT ON "CBS THIS MORNING."
Stephen: OUR FRIEND CORY BOOKER, SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, HE SAYS NOT ONLY YOU ARE A GREAT HOST BUT THAT YOU HAVE A TALK SHOW EVERYWHERE YOU GO. HE SAYS THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS UP FOR A CHAT. WHAT DO YOU TRIBUTE THAT TO?
I THINK IT'S IRONIC. WHEN I WAS A KID, WE LIVED IN TURKEY AND I DIDN'T HAVE TELEVISION BUT I WAS A VORACIOUS READER. WHEN I CAME TO THE STATES AND DISCOVERED TELEVISION, I WAS FASCINATED. AS A KID, WE HAD TO WATCH WALTER CRONKITE.
Stephen: WALTER WONDERFUL. YEAH, WALTER WONDERFUL. YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD. NOW I HAVE A TALK SHOW IN THE STUDIO WHERE WALTER CRONKITE DELIVERED THE NEWS. MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE AND NEVER GOT TO SEE IT, BUT I HAVE A NATURAL CURIOSITY. WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE, THE TEACHER SAID DEAR MR. AND MRS. KING, GAYLE KING IS BRIGHT BUT TENDS TO TALK A LOT IN CLASS AND IS DISRUPTIVE. I BROUGHT IT TO HER ATTENTION AND NOW AM BRINGING IT TO YOURS. I LIVED IN A HOUSE WHERE IF YOU GOT A NOTE FROM THE TEACHER YOU GOT IN BIG TROUBLE. SO IT'S IRONIC I MAKE MY LIVING TALKING. I LIKE YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I LIKE YOU, TOO. YOU HAVE BEEN ON OUR SHOW.
Stephen: I LIKED IT. WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT "CBS THIS MORNING"?
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN ON ALL THE MORNING SHOWS AND YOURS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE AN INSANE CIRCUS. THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL, BUT THE OTHER ONES FEELS LIKE YOU'RE IN AN INDUSTRIAL DRYER THAT PEOPLE HAVE FLOWN FLUORESCENT TUBES IN AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND YOU. IT'S SO HE CA HECTIC. YOURS IS A CALM TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DAY IS ABOUT.
WE START WITH HAVING A CIRCLE OF A TABLE, SO THERE'S A REAL CONVERSATION AND WE GIVE TIME FOR A CONVERSATION TO BREATHE.
Stephen: I ENJOYED YOUR INTERVIEW YOU DID WITH THE OBAMAs FOR THE SUPER BOWL. TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS NOMINATED EIGHT YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A SENSE OF THE HISTORY OF THE MOMENT.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, YOU KNOW, WE ARE RIGHTLY INFORMED OF THE HISTORY OF THE MOMENT FOR MRS. CLINTON BEING NOMINATED.
YES.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS NOT THE SAME FEELING OF THE HISTORY OF THE MOMENT AS BROADLY.
I THINK WHEN BARACK OBAMA BECAME IN DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, THERE WASN'T THE WORD "PRESUMPTIVE" SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY A DONE DEAL. NOW YOU STILL HAVE BERNIE SANDERS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS A DONE DEAL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE MATH, IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO WIN, BUT HE STILL THINKS AND IS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO THINK THAT HE THE DOES. SO IT'S NOT AS CLEAN AS IT WAS WITH BARACK OBAMA. BUT REALLY, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, AS A WOMAN PERSON SITTING HERE TODAY TO HAVE A WOMAN AS A DEMOCRATIC PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.
Stephen: YES. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, DON'T LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, YOU THINK SHE'S POLERRIZING, WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT HER, WHAT SHE HAS ACCOMPLISHED IS AMAZING AND I DO CELEBRATE THAT AS A WOMAN PERSON. (APPLAUSE) SO WE WILL GET TO THE FACT -- THE PARTY IS STILL A LITTLE FRACTURED, SO TO SPEAK. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO BERNIE SANDERS TODAY, SO THERE IS STILL HEALING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT I THINK AT THE END YOU WILL HAVE A REPUBLICAN CAPT. , WE ALREADY HAVE, AND WE'LL HAVE A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE AND WE CAN GO TO FOLLOWS AND DECIDE WHO WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR IN NOVEMBER.
Stephen: I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE OVER. (LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY, IT IS THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS ELECTION. I LOVE THAT.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. IT'S LIKE H H HERPES, THERE'S NO GETTING RID OF IT. WANT PURELLE? THERE YOU GO. "CBS THIS MORNING" 7:00 TO 9:00 A.M. ONLY CBS. GAYLE KING, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: HEY, NOW WE'RE BACK. WELL, IT'S A HUGE TIME OF THE YEAR FOR SPORTS -- BASEBALL'S IN FULL SWING, THE PITTSBURGH  PENGUINS COULD WIN THE STANLEY CUP TONIGHT, AND I'VE HEARD RUMORS THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE  AN OLYMPICS. BUT OF COURSE, WHAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IS THE N.B.A. FINALS. IT'S A HUGE REMATCH: THE RECORD-BREAKING GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS LED BY UNANIMOUS M.V.P. STEPH CURRY GOING UP AGAINST THE LEGENDARY LEBRON JAMES, WHO'S FIGHTING TO GIVE THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS THEIR FIRST EVER CHAMPIONSHIP. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SERIES IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING-- EXCEPT FOR THE GAMES, WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPLETE BLOWOUTS. IN GAMES ONE AND TWO, GOLDEN STATE DID THE IMPOSSIBLE -- MAKE THE PEOPLE OF CLEVELAND EVEN SADDER. BUT LAST NIGHT IN GAME 3 THE CAVS CAME BACK WITH A FURY. INCLUDING THIS FEROCIOUS ALLEYOOP FROM KYRIE IRVING TO LEBRON JAMES.
GET OVER. JAMES PEAKS HIS DRIBBLE SOMEHOW. IRVING BACK TO JAMES!
Stephen: OH! SOMEONE GIVE THAT MAN COMPLEMENTARY CHECKED LUGGAGE BECAUSE HE'S ELIGIBLE FOR BUSINESS PLUS AFTER ACCRUING ALL THOSE SKY MILES!! (APPLAUSE) BLACKOUT DATES APPLY. (LAUGHTER) BUT OF COURSE, AS INCREDIBLE AS THAT DUNK WAS, THE BIG SPORTS HIGHLIGHT YESTERDAY CAME FROM BASEBALL, WHERE MY FRIEND SNOOP DOGG THREW OUT THE FIRST PITCH AT THE PADRES GAME, AND IT WENT A BIT OFF. HERE'S THE WIND UP. AND BALL ONE. OH! WIDE TO THE RIGHT AND A LITTLE HIGH. WHICH IS SURPRISING-- I EXPECTED SNOOP TO BE VERY HIGH. IT'S TOO BAD LEBRON WASN'T THERE. PRETTY SURE HE COULD'VE GRABBED IT OUT OF THE AIR AND SLAMMED IT DOWN RIGHT OVER HOME PLATE. WHICH BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF MY SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE BASEBALL. ALSO, METAL BATS WITH SPIKES, EXPLODING BALLS, AND HEAR ME OUT: JUST TWO INNINGS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU CAN STILL DRINK ALL YOU WANT. (LAUGHTER) BUT LET'S NOT BE TOO HARD ON SNOOP. THIS IS HOW WE SAW IT. BUT THIS IS WHAT SNOOP SAW.
I'M OVER HERE, SNOOP. THROW IT TO MEEEEE! ♪ FO SHIZZLE! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IT'S A TRUE STORY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GOVERNORS GARY JOHNSON AND GOVERNOR WILLIAM WELD.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE FIRST FULL PRESIDENTIAL TICKET I HAVE EVER INTERVIEWED. PLEASE WELCOME THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES, GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON AND GOVERNOR WILLIAM WELD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WELL, GOVERNOR GARY, IF I MAY CALL YOU GOVERNOR GARY.
PLEASE DO.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I INTERVIEWED YOU THREE TIMES TON TOLD SHOW. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
Stephen: GOVERNOR WELD, FIRST TIME WE'VE MET. TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF MEXICO, TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS. BOTH REPUBLICANS, NOW YOU'RE RUNNING AS A LIBERTARIAN. WHY LIBERTARIAN AND WHY SELL PEOPLE ON THE LIBERTARIAN IDEA?
WE WERE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS IN HEMI-LY BLUE STATES. WE WERE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE. WE WERE SOCIALLY LIBERAL. THE NOTION THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES IN THEIR OWN LIVES, ALWAYS COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF CHOICE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND, HEY, FROM A MILITARY INTERVENTION STANDPOINT, I THINK THE FACT THAT WE PUT TROOPS ON THE GROUND, I THINK THE FACT THAT WE DROP BOMBS, I THINK THE FACT THAT WE THROW OR WE FLY DRONES AND KILL THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, HAS A CONSEQUENCE THAT'S WORSE NOT BETTER. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF MAKING THE WORLD LESS SAFE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I WANT THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF YOUR POCKETBOOK AND OUT OF YOUR YOUR BEDROOM. I TOLD THAT TO THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN 1992. THIS YEAR IT SEEMS TO ME, YOU PAY YOUR MONEY AND TAKE YOUR CHOICE. WITH THE DEMOCRATS YOU GET THE GOVERNMENT IN YOUR POCKETBOOK AND WITH THE REPUBLICANS IT'S MUCH WORSE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE GOVERNMENT IN YOUR BEDROOM, SO THAT'S THE CHOICE.
Stephen: DID YOU LEAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OR DID THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LEAVE YOU? WHY AREN'T YOU REPUBLICANS ANYMORE?
I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT FIRST AND FOREMOST, THAT IT'S BEEN ABOUT SMALLER GOVERNMENT, AND BY THAT I MEAN GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF YOUR LIVES, MORE FREEDOM, MORE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. BUT THEN THERE IS THE SOCIAL SIDE, YOU KNOW, A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, MARRIAGE EQUALITY, LEGALIZING MANNER. COME ON, LET PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES IN THEIR OWN LIVES THAT ONLY PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: GOVERNOR, I'M LEGALLY REQUIRED TO ASK YOU THE FOLLOWING QUESTION -- ARE YOU HIGH?
BEING ON THIS SHOW RIGHT NOW -- YES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: TRUMP CALLS YOU GUYS FRINGE CANDIDATES. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT?
TOTALLY FRINGE.
Stephen: YOU ENJOY BEING A FRINGE CANDIDATE?
ABSOLUTELY. IN 1999, I'M THE HIGHEST ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE COUNTRY TO CALL FOR LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. BILL WELD DENIED AMBASSADOR IN 1997 BECAUSE HE WAS PRO GAY, PRO WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND PRO MEDICAL MARIJUANA. BY FRINGE, I THINK HE'S SAYING THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE FRINGE AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU GUYS ARE NOW POLLING AT 10% IN SOME NATIONAL POLLS. IF YOU GET TO 15%, THEY'VE GOT TO LET YOU IN THE DEBATES IN THE FALL.
YEAH, THE KEY IS BEING IN THE POLLS. LOOK, YOU'RE HAVING US ON THE SHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT YOU START OFF THE SHOW BY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THERE ARE ONLY TWO CANDIDATES IN THE RAIRKS AND THAT'S TRUMP AND HILLARY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US ON THE SHOW, BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT --
Stephen: I'M PART OF THE PROBLEM.
WELL, KIND OF SORT OF. BUT YOU'VE COME OUT OF THE CLOSET AND I APPRECIATE YOU LET US GIVE A PITCH HERE.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. (LAUGHTER) YOU BOTH HAD STRONG STATEMENTS ABOUT MR. TRUMP. YOU'VE CALLED DONALD TRUMP A (BLEEP). OKAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IN YOUR CAREER, I KNOW YOU'VE HAD MISFIRES WHEN IT COMES TO HUMOR AND THAT WAS A REALLY MISFIRE WHEN IT CAME TO HUMOR. TOTAL MISFIRE.
Stephen: BUT YOU REPEATED IT MULTIPLE TIMES. (LAUGHTER) YOU MISFIRED REPEATEDLY.
TO EXPLAIN DR. . LET ME INTERJECT HERE. I'VE SAID A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT MR. TRUMP'S FOREIGN POLICY. I THINK IT'S A BASKET CASE. HE WANTS TO BUILD ANOTHER BERLIN WALL. THAT DIDN'T GO WELL IN THE 20th CENTURY. HE WANTS THE ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION, PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS THREAT TO THE WORLD TODAY BY GIVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO SOUTH KOREA JUST TO PROVOKE THE NORTH MORE AND TO JAPAN TO ENSURE THE CHINESE. THAT'S INCOHERENT.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO GO, BUT ONE LAST QUESTION IS THAT LET'S JUST IMAGINE THAT WE LIVE IN A CRAZY WORLD WHERE THE TWO OF YOU ARE NOT THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THIS COULD HAPPEN, THOUGH, AS A RESULT OF THIS, YOU UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF THE COLBERT BUMP.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: BUT WHO DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD DRAW VOTES AWAY FROM THE MOST, HILLARY OR DONALD?
I THINK MORE FROM THE Rs. THERE'S A LOT OF Rs THAT HAVEN'T SIGNED ON FOR TRUMP YET. WE HAVE TO BE WHAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR, MY VIEW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I SEE IT, IN ALL THE POLLS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN TO THIS POINT, WHICH HAVE BEEN ABOUT SIX NATIONAL POLLS, ACTUALLY THEY'VE DONE THIS LITTLE BIT OF ANALYSIS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN MORE VOTES TO HILLARY AT THIS POINT.
Stephen: OKAY. I THINK WHEN ALL SAID AND DONE IT WOULD BE EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WE WOULDN'T BE DOING IF THE THERE WERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN BUT WE HAVE TO BE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THE COLBERT BUMP.
Stephen: HOPE IT WORKS. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE ISSUES. GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR. GARY JOHNSON AND WILLIAM WELD, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE DAVID DUCHOVNY, AARON TVEIT, AND A PERFORMANCE BY WORLD JUGGLING CHAMPION ALEXANDER KOBLIKOV. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, TOM HIDDLESTON AND THOMAS MIDDLEDITCH. GOODNIGHT!
