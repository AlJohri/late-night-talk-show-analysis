FOR WEEKS, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN RAMPING UP THE PRESSURE, CALLING FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK INTO HILLARY CLINTON, AND THIS MORNING AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HEADS TO THE HILL THE DEPARTMENT IS NOW WEIGH WEIGHING A NEW INVESTIGATION.
ALL RIGHT, QUIET DOWN. QUIET DOWN. I WANT TO PUT AN END TO THE RUMORS THAT THIS INQUIRY IS A WITCH HUNT INTENDED MERELY TO PLEASE THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS ABSURD! WE WILL ONLY BE INVESTIGATING HARD, LEGITIMATE ISSUES, SUCH AS DID THE CLINTONS COLLUDE WITH THE RUSSIANS? WOULDN'T THAT BE A COOL TWIST? SECOND, IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION OPERATING AN ORPHAN TODDLER CAGE-FIGHTING RING OUT OF THE BACK OF A RAYMORAND FLANAGANS IN ROANOKE, VIRGINIA? WE WILL GET TO THE TRUTH. NEXT, IS HILLARY REALLY JUST A SCOOBY DOO VILLAIN WEARING A MASK? WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL WE PULL OFF HER FACE? AND FINALLY, IS HILLARY SECRETLY DOING THE BIDDING OF THE "STRANGER THINGS 2" SHADOW MONSTER THAT POSSESSES HER. SPOILER AALERT. ANY QUESTIONS? OH, AND ANYBODY THAT ASKS A QUESTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. I'M WATCHING YOU.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, SESSIONS IN THE HOT SEAT. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES: TYLER PERRY ANTHONY ATAMANUIK AND JOHN AVLON FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HOW ARE YOU?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE TOO KIND. NOW, INFORMATION, NOW, FOLKS. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN GONE FOR 12 DAYS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A LOT OF DONALD TRUMP FANS HERE TONIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: "WHILE THE CAT'S AWAY, THE MICE HAVE TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN THIS CASE, IT WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SECRETARY OF MISCHIEF, JEFF SESSIONS. SESSIONS' TESTIMONY TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES, AND SESSIONS HAD THE SAME ANSWER FOR A LOT OF THEM.
I DON'T RECALL. I DON'T RECALL. I DON'T RECALL IT. I DO NOT RECALL. I DON'T RECALL IT. I HAD NOT RECALLED.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: NOT A GREAT MEMORY. IN FACT, JUST TO REMEMBER THOSE ANSWERS, HE HAD TO WRITE THEM ON HIS HAND.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) SO NO SURPRISE, SESSIONS' MEMORY WAS A HOT TOPIC AT THE HEARING.
IN YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY, YOU HAVE STATED "I DON'T RECALL" AT LEAST 20 TIMES. IS THAT FAIR TO SAY?
I HAVE NO IDEA.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT'S A FAIR ANSWER, I GUESS. I GUESS IT'S-- I'M-- I'M STARTING TO GET A LITTLE WORRIED HERE. IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH JEFF SESSIONS? DID HE GET HIT BY A BIG COCONUT ON HIS WAY INTO THE CHAMBER? AND EVEN WHEN SESSIONS COULD REMEMBER SOMETHING, HE COULDN'T ACTUALLY REMEMBER IT, LIKE THE MEETING HE ATTENDED WHERE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER AND GUY WHO "KNOWS A GUY," GEORGE PAPADOPOULOUS, PRESENTED A PLAN TO COLLUDE WITH THE RUSSIANS.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS RECENT NEWS REPORTS REGARDING MEETINGS DURING THE CAMPAIGN ATTENDED BY GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS AND CARTER PAGE, AMONG OTHERS. FRANKLY, I HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF THIS MEETING UNTIL I SAW THESE NEWS REPORTS.
Stephen: "AND ONCE SOMEONE REPORTS ON WHAT I SAID, I WILL RECALL THAT AS WELL."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "I THINK. I DO BELIEVE." NOW, NOW--  (  LAUGHTER  ) SO NOW SESSIONS DOES REMEMBER THE MEETING, SORT OF.
I DO NOW RECALL THAT THE MARCH 2016 MEETING AT THE TRUMP HOTEL THAT MR. PAPADOPOULOS ATTENDED, BUT I HAVE NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT HE SAID AT THAT MEETING.
Stephen: "I DO NOW RECALL-- OOPS, AND NOW I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AGAIN. POOF, IT'S GONE. ED WHERE YOU GO! ED WHERE YOU GO! THERE WERE SO MANY MEETINGS ABOUT COLLUSION, I'VE GOT THE COLLUSION CONFUSION."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "IT'S LIKE BRAIN FEVER WITH THE VAPORS AT THE SAME TIME. I DO BELIEVE. IS THIS ON? IS THIS-- I HOPE IT'S NOT." BUT THEN, THE MEMORIES CAME FLOODING BACK.
AFTER READING HIS ACCOUNT, AND TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION, I BELIEVE THAT I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO REPRESENT THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, FOR THAT MATTER.
Stephen: SO SESSIONS HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF MEETING HIM, NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HE SAID OR WHO ELSE WAS THERE WITH HIM. ALL HE REMEMBERS IS THAT SESSIONS DID THE RIGHT THING. "I'M SORRY, FELLAS, THE OLE DOG'S MEMORY IS KINDA HAZY-- WAIT! IT'S COMIN' BACK TO ME. I LOOKED HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAID THE THING WITH THE LEAST LEGAL LIABILITY. GOOD DAY, SIR! GOOD DAY, SIR!"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO KEEP TESTIFYING? I DID NOT REALIZE THAT. I APOLOGIZE TO THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE." SO, THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RUSSIA. THEY DID TALK ABOUT RUSSIA. HONEST PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE-- ALSO, JEFF SESSIONS. BUT ONE THING THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND ADAMANT ABOUT: THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONTACT WITH WIKILEAKS. IT'S AN INSULTING QUESTION. AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THEY MET WITH WIKILEAKS. BECAUSE YOU SEE, WE JUST FOUND OUT THERE WAS SECRET CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP JR. AND WIKILEAKS. NOW, TO BE FAIR, DON JR. MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS ON WIKIPEDIA.  (  LAUGHTER  ) "DO THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHEESECAKES AT THE FACTORY, OR WHAT? AND, SEND."  (  LAUGHTER  ) APPARENTLY, TRUMP JR. "EXCHANGED DIRECT MESSAGES ON TWITTER WITH WIKILEAKS DURING THE COURSE OF THE 2016 RACE." THE DAMNING D.M. COMES FROM OCTOBER 2016, WHEN WIKILEAKS WROTE, "HEY, DONALD, GREAT TO SEE YOU AND YOUR DAD TALKING ABOUT OUR PUBLICATIONS. THERE'S MANY GREAT STORIES THE PRESS ARE MISSING, AND WE'RE SURE SOME OF YOUR FOLLOWS WILL FIND IT. BY THE WAY, WE JUST RELEASED PODESTA EMAILS PART 4." DON JR. DID NOT RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE, BUT JUST 15 MINUTES AFTER RECEIVING IT, HIS DAD TWEETED, "VERY LITTLE PICK-UP BY THE DISHONEST MEDIA OF INCREDIBLE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY WIKILEAKS. SO DISHONEST! RIGGED SYSTEM!"  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) "NOW, I CAN'T-- I-- I-- I-- I I." I CAN'T PROVE THAT DONALD TRUMP JR. CALLED HIS FATHER, BUT LIKE THEY SAY, "IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK AND TALKS LIKE A DUCK, THE DUCK IS COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) AND WIKILEAKS EVEN CONTACTED DON JR. TWICE ON ELECTION NIGHT. FIRST, WHEN HILLARY WAS STILL EXPECTED TO WIN, THEY WROTE, "HI, DON, IF YOUR FATHER LOSES, WE THINK IT IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING IF HE DOES NOT CONCEDE AND SPENDS TIME CHALLENGING THE MEDIA." THEN AFTER MIDNIGHT, WHEN IT WAS CLEAR TRUMP WON, THEY JUST WROTE, "WOW."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S RIGHT. NOT "CONGRATULATIONS." JUST "WOW."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S LIKE TELLING THE BRIDE AT THE WEDDING, "HOLY CRAP, DERRICK, HUH? WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS." DOB JR. IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IMPLICATED BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT THEIR VERY FIRST MESSAGE HE E-MAILED STEVE BANNON, KELLYANNE CONWAY, JARED KUSHNER THAT WIKILEAKS MADE CONTACT. "DEAR EVERYONE: WIKILEAKS IS GOING TO HELP US TAKE DOWN HILLARY. MAKE SURE TO KEEP IT SECRET, DON'T PUT IT IN AN EMAIL LIKE THIS ONE. AND, SEND. OH, SHOOT-- I FORGOT TO ASK ABOUT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY." TOO RISKY. TOO RISKY.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IN KEEPING WITH DON JR.'S STRATEGY OF NOT KNOWING WHEN TO SHUT UP, YESTERDAY, AFTER THE STORY BROKE, HE TWEETED OUT THE FULL CONVERSATIONS, SAYING, "HERE IS THE ENTIRE CHAIN OF MESSAGES WITH @WIKILEAKS, WITH MY WHOPPING THREE RESPONSES, WHICH ONE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES HAS CHOSEN TO SELECTIVELY LEAK. HOW IRONIC!" THAT DEFENSE DOESN'T WORK. "YOUR HONOR, HERE'S THE PHOTOS OF MY VICTIM'S BODY WITH A WHOPPING THREE STAB WOUNDS. I REST MY CASE." HOW IRONIC.  ( APPLAUSE ) MEANWHILE--
Jon: GOT NO CASE.
Stephen: MEANWHILE, FOR EVERYBODY IN THE TRUMP CAMP, DADDY'S HOME. BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FINALLY BACK FROM HIS 12-DAY TRIP TO ASIA, AND ACCORDING TO HIM, THE TRIP WAS A HUGE SUCCESS, BRAGGING TO REPORTERS, "A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT'S ALMOST PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO GO THROUGH 12 DAYS." LAYOFF LAU(  LAUGHTER  ) REALLY? YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN ASIA FOREVER, RIGHT?  (  LAUGHTER  ) WELL, THAT'S BIGGER THAN 12. 12-- 12 IS MORE-- 12 IS MORE OR LESS. 12 IS LESS THAN FOREVER. AND TRUMP ISN'T THE ONLY ONE GIVING HIM RAVE REVIEWS. SO IS HIS STAFF, NOTING THAT THE PRESIDENT REMAINED ATTENTIVE DURING LENGTHY DIPLOMATIC RITUALS, INCLUDING AN HOUR-PLUS TOUR OF A MUSEUM IN BEIJING'S FORBIDDEN CITY." YES, OUR PRESIDENT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE RIGORS OF A FOURTH-GRADE FIELD TRIP.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) YES, HE DID SO WELL--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID SO WELL-- GENERAL KELLEY-- GENERAL KELLEY ACTUALLY GAVE HIM 20 MINUTES OF iPAD TIME ON THE RIDE HOME. NOW, THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN HIS ENERGY DIPPED, "INCLUDING DURING A LENGTHY INTERPRETIVE HIP-HOP PERFORMANCE IN MANILA." I CANNOT BLAME HIM FOR THAT. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT SENTENCE. ALSO, I JUST WANT OT SAY IF THAT HIP-HOP PERFORMANCE IN MANILA WAS NOT CALLED "MANILA ICE," WE SHOULD BOMB THEM. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TYLER PERRY IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, ROY MOORE IS TOO CREEPY FOR CINNABON. STICK AROUND.  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY, RIGHT THERE. JON, GOOD TO SEE YOU. OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHAT A LOVELY EVENING WE HAVE IN STORE FOR YOU TONIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE SO NICE. FOLKS, I JUST WANT YOU-- IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE NEWS, IF YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE NEWS, IF I'M THE ONE BREAKING THIS NEWS TO YOU, I WANT TO YOU BRACE YOURSELVES, ALABAMA LOVERS. BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MORE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SCANDAL SURROUNDING ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE AND MAN DEMONSTRATING HOW TALL YOU MUST BE TO DATE HIM, ROY MOORE. ♪ ♪ ♪  (  LAUGHTER  ) IF YOU LIKE THAT ONE, THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG FOUR MINUTES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) FIVE-- FIVE NOW-- FIVE WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED MOORE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AGAINST THEM WHEN THEY WERE TOONS. AND NOW WE'VE LEARNED THAT IN THE 80s, WHEN HE WAS A LOCAL ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, MOORE WAS BANNED FROM AN ALABAMA SHOPPING MALL FOR BOTHERING TEENAGE GIRLS. THE ONLY PLACE IN THE MALL THAT GIRLS WERE SAFE WAS THE FOREVER 21, BECAUSE THAT IS WAY TOO OLD FOR RAY MOORE.
Jon: OH, MY GOODNESS!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, ONE-- ONE ALABAMA ARE THE RECALLS, "IT'D SEEM LIKE EVERY FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT, YOU'D SEE HIM WALKING AROUND THE MALL, LIKE THE KIDS DID." WELL, HE WASN'T WALKING AROUND EXACTLY LIKE THE KIDS DID, BECAUSE HE WASN'T LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER FOR ROY MOORE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) "HEY, MR. D.A." ACCORDING TO REPORTS, WHEN AT THE MALL, MOORE WAS "USUALLY ALONE," AND "WELL-DRESSED IN SLACKS AND A BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT." WELL, THAT'S JUST ROY MOORE'S APPROACH TO ROMANCE:  PUT ON YOUR FINEST SLACKS AND GO A-FOOD-COURTIN'.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Jon: OH! OH! OH!
Stephen: MOORE EVEN WENT TO THE MALL TO GET INTO THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT. ONE WOMAN RECALLS THAT "SHE WAS 14 AND WORKING AS SANTA'S HELPER AT THE GADSDEN MALL IN 1977 WHEN MOORE FIRST SPOKE WITH HER AND TOLD HER SHE LOOKED PRETTY. TWO YEARS LATER, WHEN SHE WAS 16, HE ASKED HER OUT ON DATES." HE HIT ON ONE OF SANTA'S ELVES? WELL, A TRUE EVANGELICAL, HE'S PUTTING THE "CHRIST!" BACK IN CHRISTMAS.
Jon: WOW! WOW!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ I HEAR THE SLEIGH BELLS RINGING ♪ AND IT WASN'T JUST THE MALL. ONE ALABAMA JOURNALIST CLAIMS THAT MOORE WAS ALSO BANNED FROM THE Y.M.C.A. FOR HIS INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR OF SOLICITING SEX FROM YOUNG GIRLS. AND DON'T FORGET, HE DID THAT WHILE HE WAS ASSISSSSSTANT D.A. ♪ THE ASSISSSSTANT D.A...A. ♪ I'M UP THERE SING. I DON'T HEAR ANY BACK TRACK OVER THERE. I KNOW WE DIDN'T REHEARSE IT, BUT COME ON! I DON'T WANT TO DISTRACT FROM THE MAIN STORY HERE, WHICH IS THAT SENATE CANDIDATE ROY MOORE WAS BANNED FROM A SHOPPING MALL FOR SLEAZING ON YOUNG GIRLS. THAT'S NUTS, BUT IT DOES KIND OF EXPLAIN THIS COMMERCIAL I FOUND. TAKE A LOOK.
LOOKING FOR A MALL THAT HAS IT ALL? THEN COME ON DOWN TO THE GADSDEN MALL. YOU'LL FIND APPLIANCES, HOUSEWEARS, MEN'S AND WOMEN'S FASHIONS AND NOW ROW ROY MOORE! NOW THE ONLY THING THAT IS GOING TO SNEAK UP AND GRAB YOU IS SAVINGS. COME VISIT CHRISTMAS VILLAGE TO SEE SANTA AND HIS ELVES WHO ARE ARMED WITH TASERS. PLEASE, TEENAGERS, JUST COME BACK. THERE'S PLENTY OF PARKING. AND IN THE CASE OF ROY MOORE SIGHTINGS, PLENTY OF ROY MOORE ALERT STATIONS.
ROY MOORE! ROY MOORE! ROY MOORE!
THE GADSDEN MALL. JUST OFF ROUTE 759. THE ONLY PLACE YOU HAVE TO YOU WORRY ABOUT ROY MOORE IS THE REST OF ALABAMA.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TYLER PERRY. STICK AROUND  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

6'6".
Stephen: WHAT?
6'6".
Stephen: YOU DON'T SEEM THAT TALL.
THANKS A LOT. I APPRECIATE THAT. WHICH MEANS MADEA IS A BIG, UGLY WOMAN. THAT'S A BIG, TALL, SCARY, UGLY WOMAN.
Stephen: JUST A LOT OF WOMAN TO LOVE, THAT'S ALL. JUST A LOT OF WOMAN TO LOVE.
OKAY, COOL, OKAY.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER-- AND WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER AT SOME FUN THINGS-- THE "HAND IN HAND" BENEFIT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AFTER HARVEY HIT HOUSTON, AND BEFORE THE OTHER HURRICANES EVEN HIT.
YEAH.
Stephen: WE DID A BENEFIT. AND THIS WAS-- WE GOT THIS PICTURE HERE. DID WE GET THIS FROM YOU OR DID WE HAVE THIS IN HOUSE?
I DON'T THINK I HAD THAT PICTURE. SO MAYBE IT'S IN HOUSE.
Stephen: YOU AND I WERE-- EVERYBODY WAS THERE, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: AND THIS WAS OUR LITTLE GROUP.
OUR ROW.
Stephen: OUR LITTLE ROW THERE. IT WAS CHER. BILLIE CRYSTAL, BARBRA STREISAND, ME AND YOU RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YUP. BUT-- BUT-- BUT NOTICE HOW I'M TRYING TO LEAN IN TO GET INTO THE PICTURE. IT'S LIKE, "LOOK AT ME! I'M HERE, TOO!"
Stephen: THESE ARE OWL PROS. LOOK AT THIS. NO TEETH. LOOK, NO ONE IS SMILING WITH THEIR TEETH SHOWING. THAT'S HOW THE PROS DO IT.
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT. THAT WAS A PRETTY INTIMIDATING ROW.
Stephen: IT WAS. DID YOU TALK TO BARBRA STREISAND AT ALL?
I I DID NOT. I WAS SCARED.
Stephen: I TALKED TO HER A LITTLE BIT BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY. KNOW WHAT SHE NOTICED? SHE TURNED TO ME AND SAID, "NOTICE WHICH STARS LEAVE FIRST." AFTER THE CAMERAS WENT OFF, WE ANSWERED THE PHONES FOR ANOTHER 15 MINUTES. AND SHE SAID, "SOME WILL LEAVE BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE."
WHO LEFT.
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO SAY, BECAUSE HE MIGHT COME BACK ON THE SHOW. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT-- THIS IS-- WHEN WE WERE SITTING THERE, I WAS SO FASCINATED AND SO HAPPY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN ATLANTA. AND YOU WERE LIKE HOW CAN I STAY IN ATLANTA BECAUSE I'M GROWING MY COMPANY SO FAST AND YOU TOLD ME SOME REALLY GREAT NEWS. YOU CREATED YOUR WHOLE WORLD OUT IN ATLANTA. YOU TOOK OVER A WHOLE ARMY BASE.
THAT'S MY NEW STUDIO, AND WE HAVE 12 SOUND STAGES THERE AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WORKING. IT'S VERY FANTASTIC. I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WOW. WELL, WHAT DO THEY CALL IT "TYLER TOWN?"
TYLER TOWN. YEAH. YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN AND SEE IT.
Stephen: I'D LOVE TO.
BRING THE SHOW DOWN AND COME DO IT LIVE THERE FROM ATLANTA. WE'D LOVE THAT.
Stephen: DONE!
CONDITION, DONE, DONE.
Stephen: THEY'RE TELLING ME IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN?
Stephen: BUT I'LL SAY, "ABSOLUTELY, YOU BETCHA. THAT'S A TV YES."
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT IT WHICH MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
Stephen: NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU PRESENTED AT THE C.M.A., THE COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS. YOI DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE A COUNTRY MUSIC FAN.
I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC. TIM AND FAITH AND I WERE FRIENDS AND WE WOULD SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME DOWN IN THE BAHAMAS. AND SOMEBODY SAID, "YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE COUNTRY MUSIC. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY GREAT IF YOU SIT THERE AND YOU'LL LOVE IT. "I DON'T RECALL, I DON'T RECALL, I DON'T RECALL--" THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO ME YOU.
Stephen:  HAVE A PERFECT BAHAMIAN ACCENT BY THE WAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: SO YOU GOT HOOKED ON TIM McGRAW AND FAITH HILL.
I LISTEN TO COUNTRY AND I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.
Stephen: WOW.
WHY DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN--
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
Stephen: COUNTRY MUSIC FANS.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THERE ARE NOT A LOT-- GROWING UP WHEN I WAS A KID, CHARLIE PRIDE WAS THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN COUNTRY MUSIC ARTIST. GREAT ARTIST, BUT NOT A TON OF AFRICAN AMERICAN COUNTRY MUSIC FANS.
AT THE C.M.A., IT WAS ME AND HOOTIE FROM THE BLOW FISH.
Stephen: A GOOD MAN, FROM MY HOME TOWN, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE.
NEW BOOK.
Stephen: YOU'RE SUCH A BUSY MAN. WHERE DO YOU-- IT'S EXHAUSTING TO EVEN IMAGINE THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING AT ONCE. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "HIGHER IS WAITING." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT'S NOT ABOUT DRUGS. IT'S ABOUT--  (  LAUGHTER  ) NO, NO, IT'S-- IT'S AN INSPIRATIONAL BOOK, A SPIRITUAL BOOK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH IN LIFE. IT'S VERY PERSONAL. AND AS PEOPLE READ IT, I WANT THEM TO REALIZE THAT HIGHER IS WAITING FOR EVERYBODY. IF YOU WANT TO GO HIGHER IN LIFE, IF YOU WANT TO DO BETTER, IF YOU WANT TO DO BETTER IF BUSINESS OR LOVE-- WHATEVER-- IN FAITH. I WANTED TO PUT IN THE BOOK THE THINGS THAT WORKED FOR ME AND I THINK IT WILL INSPIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO, FOR SURE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, IT'S GOT-- IT'S GOT, LIKE, EVERY CHAPTER-- PRETTY MUCH EVERY CHAPTER ENDS WITH A PASSAGE FROM THE BIBLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THERE ONE THAT IS MOST MEANINGFUL OR INSPIRATIONAL TO YOU.
I LOVE A LOT OF THEM, BUT PSALMS 91 IS THE MOST POWERFUL.
Stephen: I'M A LITTLE RUSTY ON MY PSALMS.
JUST BEING UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE AWL MIGHTY AND HIM BEING THERE FOR YOU AND PROTECTING YOU, AND THE THOUSAND MAY FALL AT YOUR RIGHT HAND, AND 10,000 MAY FALL AT YOUR SIDE, BUT IT WON'T COME NEAR YOU. IT IS ENCOURAGING TO ME AND I HOPE IT WILL BE ENCOURAGING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY COMFORTING TO KNOW.
YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ).
ESPECIALLY AND --
Stephen: HAS WORKED? HAS THAT WORKED IN YOUR LIFE? DO YOU REALLY FEEL 10,000 FALL TO ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER?
IT HASN'T BEEN 10,000 OR 1,000. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FROM WHERE I COME FROM. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD OR IN JAIL, JUST FROM WHERE I CAME FROM IN NEW ORLEANS.
Stephen: SO VERY-- SOME ROUGH CHILDHOOD.
ROUGH CHILDHOOD.
SO TO MAKE IT OUT AND THEN TO HAVE A STORY AND TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE STORY IN THE BOOK AND MAYBE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE PICK IT UP AND KNOW THEY CAN MAKE IT, TOO, MAN, THAT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS DID YOU-- AND I'M CURIOUS HOW THIS CAME ABOUT-- IS THAT YOU BUILT THIS IN YOUR BACKYARD. WHY CAN YOU BUILD THIS IN YOUR BACKYARD?
THAT WAS FOR MY SON'S CHRISTENING. IT LOOKS LIKE I BUILT A CHURCH BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A SET PIECE THAT WE USED. AND WE HAD-- I WANTED HIM KRISTENTHE WAY I WAS AND THE WAY MY MOTHER WAS IN RURAL LOUISIANA SO WE BUILT A CHURCH THAT LOOKED LIKE THOSE CHURCHES WITH HARDWOOD FLOORS AND GREAT SINGING AND HIS GODPARNS THERE AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND A CHURCH? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THAT ONE IF YOU HUFF AND PUFF IT WILL BLOW RIGHT OVER. NO, IT WAS TOWNT NEXT DAY. IT WAS ACTUALLY A TENT THAT WAS MADE INTO A CHURCH.
Stephen: REALLY. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK WHO THE GOD PARENTS ARE?
OPRAH AND SICILY TYSON.
Stephen: NOT BAD.
HE'S GOT GOOD GODPARENTS, LOTS TO LIVE UP TO.
Stephen: A LOT OF GOOD PRESENTS ON THE BIRTHDAY THERE.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT, BIG ONES.
Stephen: I GREW UP IN A FAMILY GODPARENTS DID NOTHING FOR YOU. I'M SUCH A BIG FAMILY THAT MY OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE MY GODPARENTS. THEY WERE LIKE, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANYTHING FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY."
"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL?" FOR SURE.
Stephen: THIS IS KIND OF AN AMAZING PART TO PLAY. YOU'RE PLAYING COLIN POWELL.
YEAH.
Stephen: IN-- WHAT'S THE MOVIE?
IT'S CALLED "CHENEY."
Stephen: OH, "CHENEY." THIS IS THE ONE WHO--
CHRISTIAN BALE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE PLAYING COLIN POWELL. HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT PLAYING THIS PART?
I TRIED TO REACH OUT TO HIM. HE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK YET. I'VE GOT A CALL IN TO HIM. BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT I DON'T THINK IF HE WANTS TO TALK.
Stephen: HE PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE DAYS MUCH.
NO, BUT WHY WOULD HE?
Stephen: RIGHT.
YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE HE SAID, "I PROMISE YOU, THERE ARE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND I STAKE MY REPUTATION ON IT."
YEAH, YEAH, WELL, SEE HOW THAT WORKED OUT.
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HIS-- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOUNDING LIKE HIM AND TRYING TO GET INTO CHARACTER.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU COULD SHARE WITH US?
I PROMISE YOU THAT MY REPUTATION IS ON THE LINE, AND THIS IS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION!  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I DID NOT REALIZ REALIZE-- I DID NOT REALIZE THAT COLIN POWELL WAS FROM THE BAHAMAS.  ( LAUGHTER )
NO, I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT I'M GOING TO BE MADEA AS COLIN. BUT, NO, I'M --
Stephen: IT WOULD BE FUN.
NO, IT WOULD NOT BE FUN. IT WOULD NOT BE FUN. IT WOULD NOT BE FUN.
Stephen: I HAVE THA THE ANTHRAX. IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

Stephen: YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I HAVEN'T SEEN OTHERS WHO PORTRAIT PRESIDENT FOR A LIVING, YOU GO OUT INTO THE FIELD AS THE PRESIDENT. DOES THAT CONFUSE PEOPLE? LET ME GIVE A SENSE OF THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT. IT'S A PRETTY DAMN GOOD IMPRESSION OF THE PRESIDENT.
YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT HAPPENS-- WHAT HAPPENS-- OOPS. (BLEEP).
THAT'S OKAY.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO OUTSIDE-- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE? DO PEOPLE EVER MISTAKE YOU FOR HIM?
OH,-- YEAH, I MEAN, ONE THING I'LL SAY BEING HIM IS THAT TO BE IN HIM WOULD BE THAT MOST PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU AND POINT. THAT'S, LIKE, HIS EXPERIENCE, I'M PRESUMING. BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM AFAR ARE JUST LIKE, "HA-HA-HA! BOO! THAT'S HIS WHOLE LIFE, I THINK.
Stephen: AND THEY BOO.
PEOPLE BOO.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE BOOING HIM OR DO THEY NOT ENJOY YOUR SHOW?
OH, I THINK A MIX OF BOTH.
Stephen: A MIX OF BOTH? OKAY?
WE'RE VERY POPULAR. WE WERE AT THE QUEENS CENTER MALL-- WE WERE AT A MALL FILMING ON FRIDAY, THIS PIECE. AND SO I'M DRESSED AS TRUMP, AND IT WAS OUT IN THE FIELD. WE HAVE SECURITY, AND THE SECURITY'S SORT OF LIKE SECRET SERVICE. AND I'M WALKING AROUND, AND IN A MOMENT, THIS-- I FEEL THIS, LIKE, IMPACT INTO I MY HEAD. IT'S VERY STRONG.

Stephen: LIKE A CANDY, A BIG CANDY?
A BIG CANDY. AND I HAVE A VERY LUMPY HEAD, SO ONE OF THE LUMPS IS LEGIT, FROM THAT.
Stephen: WHY-- DID THIS PERSON THINK YOU WERE--
THEY THOUGHT I WAS TRUMP. OR I PROVIDE A SENSE OF CATHARSIS FOR PEOPLE, AND I ACCEPT THAT. IF YOU SEE THIS PERSON WHO YOU SORT OF CAN'T STAND OR THEY REPRESENT OPPRESSION OR WHITE SUPREMACY OR ALL THE OTHER DRACONIAN AWFUL THINGS HE REPRESENTS, THEN YOU'RE MOST LIKELY-- YOU CAN CLAP MORE FOR THAT.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HUGE FANS OF WHITE SUPREMACY HERE.
YEAH, CLAP MORE FOR WHITE SUPREMACY. COME ON! GIVE IT UP!
Stephen: IT'S OUR TURN!
GIVE IT UP! BUT, YEAH, I THINK THAT PEOPLE SORT OF SEE THAT, AND EVEN IF IT'S THE ICON OF IT, IT'S A WAY FOR THEM TO LET IT OUT. THAT'S LIKE THE INTERVIEWS ON OUR SHOW ARE VERY SIMILAR. THEY'RE PEOPLE HAVING CATHARSIS. I ALWAYS TELL THE GUESTS I'M A THERAPY DUMMY. SO, LIKE, AT THE BEGINNING, HAVE AT ME.
Stephen: YES, SURE.
GET OUT WHAT YOU WANT.

OH, IT'S A MIX OF HOPE, CROSBY-- BING CROSBY SPECIALS, DEAN MARTIN SPECIAL S.

YES, YES, PETER GROSS IS MIKE PENCE.
Stephen: USED TO BE A WRITER FOR ME, GREAT GUY.
HE'S AN INCREDIBLE MIKE PENCE, AND THIS IS PART OF ONE OF OUR REMOTE PIECES WHERE TRUMP HAS DECIDE HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT SANTA GETS SO MUCH ATTENTION, AND HE WANTS TO BE THE FOCUS.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OKAY. JIM.
THAT'S ENOUGH, FAT BAN. I'M THE ONE EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO LIKE! AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME!
SHOULD WE GO OR.
SHUT UP, MIKE! YOU'RE GOING TO GET NAKED.
YOU'RE BEING VERY NAUGHTY.
I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
VERY, VERY NAUGHTY.
YOU WANT TO SEE NAUGHTY?
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE--
SENT HIM TO GUANTANAMO.
TAKE HIM.
TAKE IT OFF. NICE AND SLOW SO I CAN SEE EVERYTHING.
THAT DOESN'T-- THAT'S NOT PART OF IT THOUGH. THE SLOW PART--
IT IS FOR ME, MIKE. IT IS FOR ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO IT'S FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY?
OH, IT'S FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
Stephen: IT'S FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. ANTHONY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SHOW. "I CAME UP WITH CHRISTMAS: A PRESIDENT SHOW  CHRISTMAS" PREMIERES NOVEMBER 30 ON COMEDY CENTRAL. ANTHONY ATAMANUIK, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JOURNALIST JOHN AVALON. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, THERE YOU GO! I WAS WONDERING WHERE THE CAMERA WAS. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE DAILY BEAST. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN AVLON! ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NOW, GOOD TO SEE YOU. NOW, I KNOW IT'S JOHN AVALON. I ALWAYS WANT TO THROW THE EXTRA "A" IN THERE. EVERYBODY MUST WANT TO DO THAT. IT'S ALL GOOD. IT DOESN'T FREAK ME OUT.
Stephen: PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. WE MET THROUGH PARENTS.
CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.
Stephen: CHARLESTON BOY. NOW YOU RUN THE DAILY BEAST WHICH HAS THIS ODD DISTINCTION THAT-- I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST ORGANIZATION THAT WAS PLACED ON TRUMP'S BLACK LIST. HOW DID YOU GET ON-- BEFORE HE WAS EVER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW DID-- HOW DID YOU-- HOW DID YOU GET THIS SINGULAR HONOR?
WELL, IT IS A BADGE OF HONOR. IT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAD A REPORTER WHO WAS DOING A GREAT STORY CALLED UP AND ASKED QUESTIONS OF HIS SENIOR COUNSEL AND GOT A TORRENT OF THREATS, YOU KNOW. "I'M GOING TO BANKRUPT YOU. I'M GOING TO PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS."
Stephen: FROM MR. TRUMP?
FROM THE AIDE TO MR. TRUMP.
Stephen: OH, FROM THE AIDE, OKAY.
AND WE PUBLISHED THE THREATS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT!
OH, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S FREE CONTENT.
EXACTLY! BUT I THINK THAT SPEAKS A LOT ABOUT SORT OF THE STAKES OF JOURNALISM IN THE AGE OF TRUMP. I MEAN, THESE FOLKS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE HOLDING POWER TO ACCOUNT. BUT THAT'S OUR JOB. OUR JOB IS TO CALL A LIE A LIE, TO SAY A FACT IS A FACT.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND I DO-- I THINK THAT IS, HONEST TO GOD, WHY I THINK WE'LL LACK BACK ON THIS AS THE BEST TIME TO BE A JOURNALIST. NOT BECAUSE IT WAS EASY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS HARD AND OUR MISSION WAS CLEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO EVERY DAY IS WAKE UP, AND WE NEED TO CALL OUT THE B.S., AND WE NEED TO MAKE THE IMPORTANT STORIES INTERESTING. AND WE NEED TO BE THE HAPPY WARRIORS WHO LOVE CONFRONTING BULLIES, BIGOTS, AND HYPOCRITES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, NOW, YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK ABOUT OUR FIRST PRESIDENT.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED "WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL." AND IT'S ABOUT WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS, WHICH IS JUST ABOUT THE ONLY REALLY FAMOUS ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH WASHINGTON, EXCEPT MAYBE CHRISTMAS DAY, WHEN HE WON, OR VALLEY FORGE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WE TALK ABOUT.
AND WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH. IT WAS THE MOST FAMOUS SPEECH IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT WAS MORE WIDELY REPRINTED THAN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THEN IT FELL ENTIRELY OUT OF FAVOR. BUT WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THIS FAREWELL ADDRESS IS THAT HE WROTE IT AS A MEMO TO FUTURE GENERATIONS, TO US, ABOUT THE FORCES HE FEARED COULD DESTROY OUR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.
Stephen: AND THEY ARE? HYPERPARTISANSHIP.
YUP.
Stephen: EXCESSIVE DEBT.
YUP.
Stephen: AND FOREIGN POWERS INFLUENCING OUR ELECTION.
YEAH. SO IT'S TIMELY AND TIMELESS, PEOPLE. IT'S RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES.
Stephen: WHY-- WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS SO TIMELY? HOW COULD WASHINGTON, 200-PLUS YEARS AGO, SEE THAT AS A THREAT THAT WOULD STILL BE DELIVERED TODAY?
WELL, I THINK WHAT WE-- YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM THE LARGER CYCLES OF HISTORY. WE SIMES FORGET THAT, AND I THINK WE RUN INTO TROUBLE WHEN WE TAKE OUR DEMOCRACY FOR GRANT GLD THAT'S ONE OF THE TENETS OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
WASHINGTON, THE FIRST FOUND FATHER, DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT. HE BELIEVED WE NEEDED TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY. REMEMBER, DEMOCRACY WAS SEEN AS A SUCKER'S BET. NO DEMOCRACY HAD SURVIVED. IT WAS OUR JOB, HE SAID, TO LEARN FROM EXPHFT LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE. THE REASON HE WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT HYPERPARTISANSHIP IS, ONE, HE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF A POLITICAL PARTY AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. THE CONSTITUTION BY THE WAY DOESN'T MENTION POLITICAL PARTIES. IT MENTIONED FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND FREE PRESS AND JOURNALISTS BUT NOT POLITICAL PARTIES. BUT HE FORESAW THAT THEY WOULD BECOME SO SELF-INTERESTED THAT THESE FACTIONS WOULD FIGHT ALL THE TIME, CREATE A DEADLOCKED AND DYSFUNCTIONAL DEMOCRACY, AND THAT COULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A DEMAGOGUE WITH AUTHORITARIAN AMBITIONS. THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANY-- ANY ONE ERA WE MAY LIVE IN. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE GOT TO LEARN OUR HISTORY. CIVIC EDUCATION MATTERS AND WE HAVE TO APPLY IT WITH A SENSE OF REAL RESPONSIBILITY. SAME THING WITH FOREIGN POWERS MEDDLING IN OUR ELECTIONS. WASHINGTON HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT, WITH THE FRENCH WHO KEPT TRYING TO UNDERMINE HIS GOVERNMENT WHEN HE REFUSED TO THROW IN WITH THEM. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD ALREADY REVEALED ITSELF TO BE THIS MONSTROUS NEW TYPE OF TYRANNY, AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY, WE'RE WITH THEM." JEFFERSON AND MADISON DISAGREE. IT'S A FIGHT BETWEEN THE FIRST FOUNDING FATHERS, BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNDERMINE HIS GOVERNMENT. SO VLADIMIR PUTIN DIDN'T MAKE UP THIS PLAYBOOK ALL BY HIMSELF BUT WE HAVE TO BE SMART AND WISE ABOUT IT AND CONFRONT IT CLEAR-EYED.
Stephen: WASHINGTON ESTABLISHED WHAT OUR MODERN PERCEPTION OF THE PRESIDENCY IS.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND ONE OF NOT JUST POLITICAL BUT OF MORAL LEADERSHIP. IS THERE-- IS THERE SOME ASPECT OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY THAT IS WASHINGTONIAN. TO BE CHARITABLE?
TO BE CHARITABLE. IN THE SPIRIT OF CHARITY, I'LL SAY THAT BOTH MEN PROBABLY BELIEVE IN PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. I THINK THAT IS A VIRTUE THAT PROBABLY BRIDGES THEM. BUT LOOK AT THE PERSONAL VIRTUES THAT WASHINGTON BROUGHT TO THE OFFICE INTENTIONALLY:  HONESTY, INTEGRITY, HUMILITY, A LIFETIME OF COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE, A BELIEF IN PRINCIPLED COMPROMISE AND MODERATION AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND A GOVERNING VIRTUE. THESE AREN'T ANYWHERE ON THE MENU RIGHT NOW, FOLKS.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT'S A PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THE BULLY PULPIT LITERALRY AND THEN RUN OFF AND DO YOUR OWN THING. HE WAS SUCH ESSENTIALLY A MOST MAN. I THINK IN SOME WAYS WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS, IS SORT OF A NIGHTMARE IMAGE OF WHAT DEMOCRACY COULD HAVE BECOME AS OPPOSED TO FOLKS --
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR CHARITABLE--  (  LAUGHTER  ) THIS IS THE CHARITABLE PART INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW. A NIGHTMARE IMAGE OF WHAT DEMOCRACY-- I'M ON BOARD! I BOUGHT A TICKET IN FIRST CLASS ON THE TRAIN YOU'RE ON RIGHT NOW. BUT I WOULD JUST--  ( APPLAUSE )
LOOK, I DO THINK SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE COMING IN AND TRYING TO DIVIDE PEOPLE, RIGHT. THE CALLING CARD OF THE DEMAGOGUE IS ALWAYS "US AGAINST THEM." AND WASHINGTON WARNED AGAINST THOSE FOLKS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO DO. YOU CAN DESTROY IN A MINUTE. BUILDING TAKES TIME AND IT TAKES COMMITMENT AND THAT'S PART OF WASHINGTON'S WARNING TO US IS WHENEVER THE SIREN SONG OF FOLKS HE CALLED "PRETEND PATRIOTS" WOULD TRY TO DIVIDE AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, HE SAID, "DON'T TRUST THEM. WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS ETERNAL TRUTH-- OUR INDEPENDENCE AS A NATION IS INSEPARABLE FROM OUR INTERDEPENDENCE AS A PEOPLE. THAT WAS HIS CORE BIT OF WISDOM. WHEN ANY PARTY TRIES TO SAY THEY REPRESENT THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN FLAG, LOOK SIDEWAYS AT THAT BECAUSE THOSE THINGS BELONG TO ALL OF US AND WE NEED TO STAY UNITED ON WHAT UNITES US NOT DIVIDES US.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALSO NEED? SORRY. WE NEED A NEW GENERATION OF WASHINGTONIANS TO FOLLOW THAT MODEL. WE NEED FOLKS WHO PUT COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY AND REALLY FOCUS ON THESE ETERNAL VIRTUE S.
Stephen:  WE GOT TO KNOW YOU.
YEAH.
Stephen: THOSE OF US-- THOSE OF US WHO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN POLITICS, WE GOT TO KNOW YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE A SPEECHWRITER FOR JAWL OFTENY. REPUBLICAN?
INDEPENDENT.
Stephen: THAT IS A MODERN WORD FOR "USED TIEB REPUBLICAN."
I'M AN INDEPENDENT. I'M A CENTRIST. I DO NOT THROW IN FOR THIS "MY TEAM VERSUS YOUR TEAM" TRIBALISM STUFF AT ALL.
Stephen: WELL, I HOPE THAT TEAM WINS. "WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL" IS IN STORES NOW. JOHN AVLON, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE JORDAN PEELE, NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, EMMY ROSSUM AND JANUARY JONES. GOOD NIGHT!
