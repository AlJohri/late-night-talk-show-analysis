CBS NEWS LEARNED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS PUSHING AT&T TO SELL CNN AS PART OF ITS MERGER WITH TIERM WARNER BUT WITH MR. TRUMP'S REPEATED BASHINGS OF CNN QUESTIONS ARE RAISED BY POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.
DOES THEUP'S FEUD WITH CNN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?
OKAY, SETTLE DOWN. I WANT TO PUT AN END TO THE RUMORS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS HOLDING UP THE AT&T TIME WARNER MERGER OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FEELINGS ABOUT CNN. THAT IS JUST BAD REPORTING. SOMETHING CNN WOULD KNOW. NOW, THAT SAID, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE A FEW OTHER SIMPLE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE THIS MERGER CAN GO FORWARD. FIRST, DON LEMON MUST EAT A BUG. IT CAN BE ANY BUG, BUT IT HAS TO BE ICKY, LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT LOOKS LIKE A COCKROACH BUT IT CAN FLY, HAS TO BE ON THAT LEVEL. SECOND, WOLF BLITZER'S SITUATION ROOM MUST BE DOWNGRADED TO THE SITUATION SHACK. NEXT, ANDERSON COOPER MUST BE PANTED ON AIR TO SEE WHETHER THE CARPET MATCHES THE DRAPES. WE ALL WANT TO KNOW IS HE OR IS HE NOT THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN PUBES. FINALLY, CNN MUST CALL ITSELF FOX NEWS AND REPLACE ITS ENTIRE STAFF WITH "FOX & FRIENDS," AND CNN CAN'T ASK QUESTIONS. SHUT UP.
ANNOUNCER: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, THE DEMOCRATS TRUMP, AND THE SHE MAN. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES: WILLIAM H. MACY, JAY PHAROAH, RATIONALE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON? THANKS, EVERYBODY! PLEASE HAVE A SEAT! WELCOME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) PLEASE, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, TODAY DONALD TRUMP CONTINUED HIS WORLD TOUR OF GOVERNMENT-MANDATED PARADES. THIS TIME: "CHY-NA." THE MAIN EVENT! OR AS THEY SAY THERE, THE WHOLE ENCHILADA! ( LAUGHTER ) THE BIG CAY HOONA. THE CHINESE GAVE TRUMP A HERO'S WELCOME, INCLUDING THEIR NATION'S HIGHEST HONOR: STANDING NEXT TO XI JINPING ON A GIANT HOTEL LUGGAGE CART. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. "YOU'RE GONNA TIP THIS GUY, RIGHT?" ( LAUGHTER ) THEN HE AND XI WALKED THE RED CARPET, WHERE TRUMP WAS GREETED BY HIS BIGGEST FANS: TOTALLY NOT-STAGED ADORING CHINESE CHILDREN. "THANK YOU. YOU'RE ALL SO GOOD AT MAKING MY HATS. THANK YOU SO MUCH ." AND THEY'RE MADE IN CHINA. I TINTED MAKE THAT UP. DON'T BE MAD AT ME. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH, MAN!
Stephen: IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, AND I DON'T THINK I AM, SOMEBODY HAS BIT OF A MAN-CRUSH ON XI JINPING.
PRESIDENT XI AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUR COMMON GOALS AND INTERESTS. BEYOND THAT WE TALK OFTEN. THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OF COURSE. YEAH. NO, OF COURSE. OF COURSE THEY HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY. THEY MET ON XI HARMONY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A SCIENCE, XI HARMONY. THE RELATIONSHIP IS SO GOOD, IT EVEN SURPRISED TRUMP.
"OUR MEETING LAST NIGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC. OUR DINNER WAS BEYOND THAT. WE HAD A DINNER THAT WAS GOING TO LAST QUICKLY, 20, 25 MINUTES, BECAUSE I WAS TRAVELING. AND YOU WERE SO NICE AND YOU JUST SAID, WE'LL DO A QUICK DINNER, AND I THINK IT HAD TO LAST AT LEAST TWO HOURS, AND WE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: IT WAS A GREAT DINNER. REALLY, REALLY, REALLY FANTASTIC. UNTIL XI GAVE TRUMP THE CHECK FOR $1.2 TRILLION. CASH. OF COURSE, TRUMP IS IN CHINA TO NEGOTIATE A TOUGH TRADE DEAL. IN THE PAST, HE'S ACCUSED THE CHINESE OF CURRENCY MANIPULATION, SO HE PLAYED HIS CARDS CLOSE TO HIS CHEST, AND IMMEDIATELY FOLDED.
BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA WILL HAVE A MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE IF WE CAN ACHIEVE A LEVEL ECONOMIC PLAYING FIELD. RIGHT NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS A VERY ONE-SIDED AND UNFAIR ONE. BUT -- BUT I DON'T BLAME CHINA.
Stephen: NO. NO. "BUT, I DON'T BLAME CHINA. LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, I BLAME PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. SHE HAS GOT TO GO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) SHE IS A FAILURE. I LOVE THIS. I LOVE IT ." NOW, THE ADMINISTRATION BACKED OFF THIS COMMENT A BIT. SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON TOLD ONE REPORTER THAT TRUMP WAS BEING "A LITTLE BIT TONGUE AND CHEEK." ALSO, LIP AND TEETH. ALL THE PARTS OF THE MOUTH. I THINK TILLERSON MEANT TO SAY, "TONGUE IN CHEEK," BUT IT'D BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY TRUMP HAS SPENT HIS VISIT TO CHINA WITH NOSE IN BUTT. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS MAGICAL. I'M SURPRISED. I THOUGHT I'D ONLY BE UP THERE 20 MINUTES, IT WAS TWO HOURS. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. ( LAUGHTER ) ANOTHER BIG AGENDA ITEM FOR TRUMP IN CHINA IS GETTING THEIR HELP DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA. EARLIER THIS WEEK, HE SENT A STRONG MESSAGE TO KIM JONG-UN WHILE GIVING A SPEECH IN SOUTH KOREA.
I ALSO HAVE COME HERE TO THIS PENINSULA TO DELIVER A MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THE LEADER OF THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATORSHIP. THE WEAPONS YOU ARE ACQUIRING ARE NOT MAKING YOU SAFER. NORTH KOREA IS NOT THE PARADISE YOUR GRANDFATHER ENVISIONED.
STEPHEN: HE'S RIGHT. A GRANDFATHERS' PARADISE IS A 24-HOUR HARDWARE STORE THAT SERVES ALL-WHITEFISH DINNER AT 4:00. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, NORTH KOREANS DIDN'T TAKE KINDLY TO THE SPEECH. THE STATE NEWS PAPER CALLED TRUMP'S SPEECH "GARBAGE SPEWING LIKE GUNPOWDER OUT OF TRUMP'S SNOUT, LIKE GARBAGE THAT REEKS OF GUN POWDER TO IGNITE WAR." WOW. WOW. I GOTTA SAY --
Jon: WOW, HE HAD TO CLIMB WAY IN THERE. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT AWFUL ANALOGY IS LIKE AN ANALOGY THAT IS AWFUL. ARE WE SURE THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NOT JUST A PILE OF GARBAGE AND GUN POWDER? HEY BACK STATESIDE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN ALABAMA, YOU GUYS REMEMBER ROY MOORE? HE'S THE G.O.P. SENATE CANDIDATE IN ALABAMA WHO PULLED OUT A GUN WHILE SPEAKING AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY, SUGGESTED 9/11 MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUNISHMENT FOR US TURNING AWAY FROM GOD, AND CALLED HOMOSEXUALITY "AN ACT SO HEINOUS THAT IT DEFIES ONE'S ABILITY TO DESCRIBE IT." HE'S RIGHT, I WENT TO KEVIN AND TOMMY'S WEDDING THIS WEEKEND AND THE CUPCAKE TOWER WAS INDESCRIBABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) I CAN'T ARTICULATE HOW AMAZING THE FONDUE STATION WAS. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU TWO. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THIS GUY WHO'S CONSTANTLY POSTURING ABOUT HOW DEVOUT HE IS AND HOW SINFUL EVERYONE ELSE IS? WELL, SPOILER ALERT! IN A BOMBSHELL REPORT IN THE "WASHINGTON POST" TODAY, A WOMAN SAYS ROY MOORE INITIATED A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS 14 AND HE WAS 32. FOR THOSE KEEPING TRACK, THAT'S AN AGE DIFFERENCE OF "IT DOESN'T MATTER, SHE WAS 14!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS AN ACT -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOW, WOW.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO ASK WHAT YOU'RE APPLAUDING FOR. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S AN ACT SO HEINOUS THAT IT DEFIES MY ABILITY TO DESCRIBE IT... BUT I'LL TRY. "ILLEGAL." ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDES THE 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL, THE "POST" TALKED TO THREE OTHER WOMEN WHO SAY MOORE PURSUED THEM WHEN THEY WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 16 AND 18 AND HE WAS IN HIS EARLY 30S. MY GOD, THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE SO DAMNING, VOTERS ARE EITHER GOING TO FORCE HIM OFF THE BALLOT OR MAKE HIM PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) MOORE'S CAMPAIGN HAS RESPONDED TO THE BOMBSHELL ARTICLE, SAYING "THIS GARBAGE IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF FAKE NEWS," AND ADDING THAT "IF THE ALLEGATIONS WERE TRUE, THEY WOULD HAVE SURFACED DURING HIS PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS." "YOUR HONOR, HOW COULD I BE GUILTY OF THIS MURDER IF I WASN'T CAUGHT UNTIL NOW? THINK ABOUT IT." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW IF IT PLEASE THE COURT, I' LIKE TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO STAB YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW, G.O.P. LAWMAKERS ARE ASKING ROY MOORE TO STEP ASIDE IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE. BUT NOT EVERYONE DENOUNCED MOORE. FOR INSTANCE, ALABAMA STATE AUDITOR AND VICTORIOUS TURNIP, JIM ZIEGLER. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY LEFT HIM IN THE SUN. ( PIANO RIFF ) HE DEFENDED HIS FRIEND, NOT BY SAYING HE'S INNOCENT, BUT RATHER BY SAYING THAT IF HE DID IT, IT WAS TOTALLY COOL. HE SAID, "TAKE JOSEPH AND MARY. MARY WAS A TEENAGER AND JOSEPH WAS AN ADULT CARPENTER. THEY BECAME PARENTS OF JESUS." YEAH, BECAUSE JOSEPH DIDN'T TOUCH HER! THEIR WHOLE DEAL IS THAT THERE WAS NO FUNNY BUSINESS! SHE WAS THE VIRGIN MARY, NOT THE -- OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S THE WHOLE THING!
Stephen: HEY, BROTHER! SHE WASN'T THE "ASKIN' FOR IT" MARY! WHICH IS WHY SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO BECOME THE "TALKING TO THE 'WASHINGTON POST' 30 YEARS LATER" MARY. WHEN REACHED FOR COMMENT, JESUS SAID "LA-LA-LA-LA-LA. I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT MY PARENTS HAVING SEX." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ALSO, FOR THOSE OF YOU TUNING IN TO SEE MY INTERVIEW WITH LOUIS C.K. TONIGHT, I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN, SOME REALLY BAD NEWS. HE CANCELLED HIS APPEARANCE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BROKE THIS STORY TODAY: FIVE WOMEN ARE ACCUSING LOUIS C.K. OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. WHEN REACHED FOR COMMENT, JESUS SAID, "LA-LA-LA-LA-LA. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT, I WAS A BIG FAN!" NOW, THESE ARE DISTURBING ALLEGATIONS. THIS IS JUST THE LATEST IN AN AVALANCHE OF ALLEGATIONS-- HARVEY WEINSTEIN, BILL O'REILLY, ROGER AILES, KEVIN SPACEY. AND A LOT OF MEN LOOK AT THIS MISBEHAVIOR, AND THEY FEEL "THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO!" WELL, LAST NIGHT, ONE MAN STEPPED UP TO NOT DO IT. COUNTRY MUSIC STAR AND SOUL PATCH SAFE PLACE, KEITH URBAN. ( LAUGHTER ) LAST NIGHT AT THE COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS, URBAN DEBUTED HIS NEW HARVEY WEINSTEIN-INSPIRED FEMALE COUNTRY EMPOWERMENT ANTHEM. THAT IS A WORD SALAD I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, BEFORE I PLAY YOU THE SONG, I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I AM A FAN OF MR. URBANS AND I THINK HIS HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE HIS LYRICS, LESS SO. JIM?

STEPHEN: IT'S THE FIRST SONG EVER WRITTEN BY DUMPING OUT A BIN FULL OF INSPIRATIONAL THROW PILLOWS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) URBAN'S COLLABORATOR EXPLAINED THE INSPIRATION FOR THE SONG, TITLED FEMALE, SAYING "WE'RE IN A ROOM AND WE'RE LIKE, 'WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS?' THE ONE THING WE CAN DO IS WRITE SONGS." THAT IS DEBATABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AGAIN, I DO LIKE KEITH URBAN'S WORK, AND I BELIEVE THEIR HEARTS ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. AND I WANT TO DO MY PART TO STAND UP FOR WOMEN, SO I TOO WROTE A SONG IN LIKE FIVE MINUTES, AND SET IT TO POWER POINT. HERE IT IS. ♪ . LADIES OF THE WORLD, YOU GOT A RAW DEAL. TOO MANY TIMES, YOUR VOICES HAVE BEEN SILENCED. WELL, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I HEAR YOU. NOW, BE QUIET WHILE I EXPLAIN YOU TO YOU.

STEPHEN: I FIXED IT, LADIES. YOU'RE WELCOME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WILLIAM H. MACY IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, SEX ROBOTS. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LISTEN, I KNOW IT'S JUST THURSDAY RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW, THIS NIGHT IS THURSDAY.
Jon: IT IS THURSDAY.
Stephen: I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE WEEKEND TO GET HERE BECAUSE WHEN THE WEEKEND IS OVER, YOU KNOW WHAT MONDAY IS. MONDAY MY GUESTS ARE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WILL BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR RIGHT THERE! HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK, A LOT TO SAY. AND MY SECOND GUEST AND MUSICAL GUEST, NONE OTHER THAN THE GREAT, ONE, ONLY, THE IMMORTAL ELTON JOHN WILL BE HERE ON MONDAY. IT'S LIKE THE SUPER BOWL SHOW RIGHT HERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NOT GIVING AWAY ANY SECRETS HERE, PEOPLE HAVE LONG-FANTASIZED ABOUT GETTING IT ON WITH ROBOTS. I MEAN, HBO HAS AN ENTIRE SHOW STARRING A SEXY CYBORG. SO LIFELIKE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY STILL DON'T HAVE THE VOICE DOWN YET. "ELLO, I'M A ROBOT." ( LAUGHTER ) THE ONLY WAY I CAN ENGS PLAIN IT, DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. AND THE FUTURE IS HERE, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, "THE SEX ROBOT REVOLUTION IS APPROACHING." I'M NOT SURPRISED THE SEX ROBOTS WANT A REVOLUTION, CONSIDERING WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THEM! ( LAUGHTER ) THE STUDY REVEALS THAT "49% OF AMERICAN ADULTS BELIEVE THAT HAVING SEX WITH ROBOTS WILL BECOME COMMON PRACTICE WITHIN THE NEXT 50 YEARS." THOUGH, GIVEN THE DISTURBING NEWS ABOUT MEN LATELY, WE SHOULD PROBABLY MOVE THAT UP TO NEXT WEEK. ( LAUGHTER ) CLEARLY, SEX ROBOTS IS COMING.
IT'S SAME FOR STEPHEN COLBERT'S BORGASM: SEX ROBOT  EDITION. SEX ROBOTS ARE SO MUCH MORE ADVANCED THAN THEY USED TO BE. IT'S NO LONGER JUST ABOUT DRAWING BOOBS ON A FOUR-SLOT TOASTER. THERE'S A NEW SEX ROBOT THAT'S MEANT TO SIMULATE REAL HUMAN CONNECTION. THE HARMONY 2.0 COMES WITH BUILT-IN A.I., SO SHE CAN TALK TO YOU.
DO YOU LIKE MEN?
I LIKE BOTH GENDERS EQUALLY AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEX WITH BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
STEPHEN: WOW, THAT IS AS SEXY AS THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS. ( LAUGHTER ) FUN FACT: CHESTER A. ARTHUR SAYS THE SAME THING. I BET THOSE SIDEBURNS TICKLE. HARMONY'S MAKERS SAY USERS CAN CHOOSE FROM A RANGE OF PERSONALITY TRAITS LIKE "KIND, SEXUAL, SHY, AND NAIVE." BUT AFTERWARDS, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE "SCARED, LONELY, EMBARRASSED, AND SAD." ( LAUGHTER ) THE COMPANY EVEN BRAGS THAT THEIR ROBOTS COME WITH A "'PERSISTENT MEMORY' ALLOWING THEM TO BUILD UP RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR OWNERS AND REMEMBER FACTS ABOUT THEM." TO WHICH THE SEX ROBOTS REPLIED "ACTUALLY, PLEASE JUST PROGRAM US TO FORGET." ( LAUGHTER ) AND ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER, "HAVING SEX WITH THE ROBOT IS ONLY GOING TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR 'SKILLS'." SURE. YOUR SKILLS AT HAVING SEX WITH AN APPLIANCE. ( LAUGHTER ) THINK OF IT AS A MARITAL AID FOR YOUR KITCHENAID. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT WILL SET YOU BACK. THE HARMONY SELLS FOR AS MUCH AS $15,000. WOW. THAT'S ENOUGH MONEY TO PUT YOUR KIDS THROUGH... THERAPY, AFTER THEY WALK IN ON YOU HAVING SEX WITH A DEAD-EYED RUBBER MACHINE IN A WIG. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) PLUS, ONE TECH EXPERT IS WARNING THAT "HACKERS COULD PROGRAM SEX ROBOTS TO KILL!" SO IF YOU DO IT WITH A SEX ROBOT, YOU COULD ACTUALLY END UP DEAD, INSTEAD OF JUST ON THE INSIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) EVEN WORSE, ONE EXPERT WARNS THAT HACKERS WOULD "HAVE FULL CONTROL OF THE CONNECTIONS, ARMS, LEGS AND OTHER ATTACHED TOOLS, LIKE IN SOME CASES, KNIVES OR WELDING DEVICES." ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, WHO IS TEACHING THEIR SEX ROBOT TO WELD? ( LAUGHTER ) "SHE'S JUST SITTING AROUND THE HOUSE ALL DAY, THOUGHT I'D HAVE HER LITERALLY LAY SOME PIPE." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S IT FOR CYBORGASM: SEX ROBOT EDITION. AND IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING GETTING A SEX ROBOT, JUST REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING: "IF IT'S A MACHINE, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T PUT YOUR PENIS IN IT." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH WILLIAM H. MACY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY FIRST GUEST IS AN EMMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR YOU KNOW FROM "FARGO," "BOOGIE  NIGHTS," AND, OF COURSE, "SHAMELESS." PLEASE WELCOME WILLIAM H. MACY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I LIKE THAT. YOU ATTACK THE STAGE WITH PURPOSE. THAT'S NICE.
YEP.
Stephen: NO INDISTINCT MOVEMENTS FOR WILLIAM H. MACY. HE'S AN ACTOR WHO MAKES CHOICES.
MAKES YOU LOOK WEAK IF YOU DON'T.
Stephen: DON'T WANT THAT. THE CROWD WILL TURN ON YOUR LIKE PIRANHAS.
TRUE.
Stephen: YOU DIRECTED THREE MOVIES NOW.
I DID, DIRECTED "SHAMELESS." DIRECTED THREE FILMS. THE THIRD ONE IS CALLED "CRYSTAL." I'M GOING TO VIRGINIA TONIGHT TO THE FILM FESTIVAL.
Stephen: DO YOU DO THE PREMIERES, DO YOU HAVE A BIG PARTY TO KICK THESE MOVIES OFF?
THERE IS A PARTY. I THINK IT'S BIG. PREMIERES, NO.
Stephen: NO RED CARPETS. WHEN WE DID "RUDDER LESS," THERE WAS A THEATER AND CASTING CREW, SO THERE WERE 150 PEOPLE THERE. I WROTE A NICE SPEECH. AN IN-HOUSE SPEECH. THEY ASKED IF I WOULD DO THE NEXT SCREENING AT THE THEATER AND I SAID, YEAH, AND I THOUGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY? SO I WROTE THIS LOVELY SPEECH ABOUT COMMUNITY AND SITTING TOGETHER IN A DARK ROOM BEING TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION. IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH. WE WAITED IN A BAR AND, WHEN IT WAS TIME, I WALKED TO THE THEATER. THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE SITTING THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) I SAID, I'M THE DIRECTOR, I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOU. OR I WAS AT THIS COOL BAR, WE COULD GO GET A HAMBURGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THEY DID. I BOUGHT THEIR TICKETS AND WE WENT TO THE BAR AND DRANK BEER.
Stephen: I HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION ONCE. THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL PLAY I DID AFTER I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE, FOR LIKE OUR SECOND NIGHT WE WENT OUT THERE, IT WAS A CAST OF EIGHT AND ONE PERSON SITTING OUT THERE. SO WE SAID, DO YOU WANT TO GO BOWLING? WE WENT NEXT DOOR AND WENT BOWLING IN CHARACTER. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
COOL.
Stephen: OKAY, SO EVERYBODY LOVES WILLIAM H. MACY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVE AN ACCOMPLISHED AND VARIED CAREER, BUT LIKE EVERY YOUNG ACTOR, YOU TOOK SOME PARTS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT SMALLER. ARE THERE ANY ROLES FROM EARLIER IN YOUR CAREER YOU LOOK BACK ON AND GO, I COULD DO THAT BETTER?
I'M FOND OF ALL OF THEM. I DIDN'T DO MUCH TELEVISION. I DID E.R. THAT'S WHERE I MET JOHN. I WAS ON E.R. ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE SEASONS AS A RECURRING CHARACTER. CHRIS CHULAK WAS ON THAT SHOW AND WAS DIRECTING. MY CHARACTER DURING MORGENSTERN HAD A HEART ATTACK AND I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. LAURA COMES TO LOOK AT ME AND I SAID, WHAT IF I DROP THE THING, AND I LEAN OVER AND, OF COURSE, MY BUTT WAS EXPOSED AND WHEN LAURA COMES IN, SHE'LL SEE MY AS, IT WILL BE FUNNY. HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW -- I SAID, WE NEED THIS, THIS IS GOOD, WE'RE TRYING TO SELL TICKET. CHRIS SAID, ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU BE CAREFUL OR THAT WILL TURN INTO A THREE SHOT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO -- HERE'S THE THING -- WE'VE ALL GOT A MENTAL PICTURE, BUT WE DON'T NEED ONE BECAUSE WE DUG UP THIS CLIP FROM E.R.
STOP.
Stephen: NO, WE FOUND IT. WE HEARD ABOUT THE STORIES AND FOUND IT. HERE WE GO.
-- SCHOOL YEAR, AND WITH MORE THAN --
HELLO? DR. MORGENSTERN? YEAH, COME HERE. DAVID. WELL, A GUY HAS A TENDENCY TO GET AWAY FROM YA. WHOOPS!
Stephen: NOW, CONGRATULATIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID THAT SCENE PLAY EXACTLY THE WAY YOU IMAGINED IT?
YES.
Stephen: OKAY. HERE'S THE THING, THE PEOPLE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE SAW YOUR BUTT AND, LIKE, FULL CRACK, LIKE BIKE RACK CRACK. PEOPLE, IN 1998, WATCHING THIS ON NBC, SAW YOUR BUTT. BUT ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER, CBS HAS TOLD US THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BLUR THAT AT MIDNIGHT SO PEOPLE CAN'T SEE YOUR BUTT. WHERE HAVE WE LOST OUR WAY AS A NATION, WILLIAM H. MACY? 20 YEARS AGO, NBC, A BASIC CABLE NETWORK DID THAT, AND WE CAN'T DO IT.
IT'S NOT RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I HAVE AN HONEST QUESTION FOR YOU, 20 YEARS LATER, IF THE SITUATION IS RIGHT, WOULD YOU STILL DO THE BUTT SHOT?
20 YEARS LATER AND I AM STILL DOING THE SCENE.
Stephen: "SHAMELESS." I'M DROPPING MY NICKERS EVERY OTHER SHOW.
Stephen: I FOUND OUT YOUR FATHER WAS A BOMBER IN WORLD WAR II.
HE WAS. EIGHTH AIR FORCE, B-17.
Stephen: THE EUROPEAN THEATER?
YEAH.
Stephen: DID HE EVER TALK ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE WITH YOU?
HE DID. ONE TIME I WAS FLYING BACK TO CHICAGO WHERE IT WAS LIVING FROM CUMBERLAND, MARYLAND. I SAID, I'LL DRIVE YOU. I SAID, TO THE AIRPORT, POP? HE SAID, NO, I'LL DRIVE YOU TO CHICAGO. I SAID, REALLY? HE TOLD ME ALL HIS -- I NEVER SPOKE FOR TWO TAS OF TRAVEL. WE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE WAR. HE TOLD ME ABOUT EVERY SINGLE WOMAN IN HIS LIFE -- MORE THAN I NEEDED, BUT IT WAS FASCINATING.
Stephen: WOW, AND IT WAS ALL IN THOSE TWO DAYS?
HE SAID HE HAD GONE ON A MILK RUN, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EASY RUN, AND THEN THEY HIT A BUNCH OF FLACK ON THE WAY BACK JUST BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE CHANNEL, AND THEN WHEN THAT WAS OVER, HE DECIDED TO HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE. SO HE REACHED DOWN, GOT HIS THERMOS, SCREWED THE LID OFF, DROPPED IT, PICKED IT UP AGAIN, POURED THE THING, AND THERE WAS WIND RUSHING, AND HE LOOKED AT THE WINDOW, THERE WAS A HOLE THIS BIG AROUND, AND HE LOOKED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FUSELAGE AND THERE WAS THE EXIT HOLE. AND THE ONLY THING HE CAN FIGURE IS WHEN HE DROPPED THAT LID OR WHEN HE REACHED FOR THE COFFEE, OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE.
Stephen: WOW. DID YOU GET THE BUG FOR FLYING? DID YOU EVER GET A PILOTS LICENSE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO. I'M RIDING MOTORCYCLES AND I'M TAKING ENOUGH OF A CHANCE, I THINK.
Stephen: DO YOU DO LONG HAULS, CROSS COUNTRY?
I HAVE, WITH SOME OF THE LADS ON MY SHOW.
Stephen: HOW DOES YOUR WIFE FEEL ABOUT YOU RIDING A MOTORCYCLE BECAUSE MY WIFE WILL NOT RETE ME DO IT. CAN FELICITY CALL MY WIFE AND SAY IT'S OKAY?
YOUR WIFE IS PRETTY SMART.
Stephen: FELICITY IS FINE WITH IT?
IT'S STUPIDLY DANGEROUS.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF BIKE DO YOU HAVE?
A HARLEY. FELICITY SAYS, DO IT, BUT IF YOU GET HURT YOU BETTER GET KILLED BECAUSE I'M NOT TAKING CARE OF YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S HONEST. IT'S A GOOD MARRIAGE.
Stephen: GET IT OUT THERE. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT SHAMELESS HAS BEEN RENEWED FOR A NINTH SEASON?
YES!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, I UNDERSTAND FRANK HAS A JOB THIS SEASON. WHAT KIND OF JOB DOES HE HAVE?
AT THE END OF LAST SEASON, MONICA, THE WIFE, THE KIDS' MOM DIED AND LEFT THEM SEVEN POUNDS OF METHAMPHETAMINE, AND FRANK SMOKED HIS SHARE, SO HE'S KIND OF NUTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. THIS CLIP THAT YOU HAVE AT THIS POINT, HE SMOKED IT ALL, BUT HE'S STILL KIND OF PSYCHOTIC. AND FROM HERE, HE GETS A JOB, AND HE BUYS A CAR, HE GETS A CREDIT CARD. I DON'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE, BUT --ENT LAST LONG. FRANK'S FRANK.
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE NAME FRANCES COMES FROM FRANCE WHICH IS A LITTLE GALLING BECAUSE THE FRENCH USE TOO MUCH BUTTER IN THEIR COOKING AND REFUSE TO PRONOUNCE THE LETTER H BUT THE NAME FRANCE IS MORE COMMONLY USED TO REFER TO ST. FRANCES OF ASSISI. HE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATRONAGE OF ANIMALS AND BECAME CUSTOMARY TO HOLD CEREMONIES BLESSING B ANIMALS ON HIS FEAST DAY OF 4 OCTOBER. NOW, I DO LIKE BEING NAMED FOR A SAINT, AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LOVER OF ANIMALS. DO I BLESS THEM?
I WOULD SAY YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HE'S NUTS. HE IS NUTS.
Stephen: WELL, ST. WILLIAM, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WILLIAM H. MACY, EVERYBODY. "SHAMELESS" AIRS SUNNEN DAY NIGHT ON SHOWTIME. BACK WITH JAY PHAROAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HIS NEW SHOW IS "WHITE FAMOUS." PLEASE WELCOME JAY PHAROAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: YOU CAN SIT OVER THERE IF YOU WANT. I'LL MOVE OVER THERE AND WE'LL JUST CUDDLE.
I LIKE YOU, MAN.
Stephen: I LIKE YOU, TOO. NICE TO SEE YA. FIRST TIME I EVER SAW YOU WAS ON "SNL" DOING OBAMA WHICH YOU DID FOR HALF HIS PRESIDENCY DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO MEET HIM WHILE DOING IMPRESSIONS OF HIM?
YES, I DID.
Stephen: DID HE LIKE IT? WELL, HE DID. I AM STILL HERE. SO HE DID LIKE IT. I ACTUALLY DID THE IMPRESSION FOR HIM AT A SECRET PARTY. I'M PETRIFIED.
Stephen: A SECRET PARTY? A SECRET PARTY.
Stephen: WHAT SECRET PARTY? I CAN'T SAY THE LOCATION.
Stephen: THE WHITE HOUSE? IT WAS NOT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. YOU WENT TO A SECRET PARTY -- QUIT (BLEEP) EVERY QUESTION I'VE GOT FOR YOU. YOU WENT TO A SECRET PARTY WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. GIVE US A HINT WHERE IT WAS. HE'S NOT THERE NOW, I PROMISE YOU.
NO, NOBODY'S THERE RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: NO ONE IS THERE RIGHT NOW.
NOBODY'S THERE RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: IS IT THE SURFACE OF THE MOON? OPRAH'S HOUSE.
I WISH.
Stephen: COOKIE? I WISH. I WISH IT WAS OPRAH'S HOUSE.
Stephen: YOU'RE IN A SECRET PARTY.
I'M AT A SECRET PARTY.
Stephen: WITH THE PRESIDENT.
I COME DOWN THE STAIRS AND I'VE GOT THE WHOLE OBAMA GEAR ON AND HE'S STANDING RIGHT THERE AND UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM, HE DIDN'T KNOW I WAS THERE AND THAT I WAS GOING TO DO IT AND HE TURNS AROUND AND HE'S LIKE (OBAMA VOICE) WELL, THIS GUY HERE IS PRETTY MUCH GOING TO TAKE OVER THE PRESIDENCY NOW, SO, I -- I WANT YOU THE DO IT!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS I'M SITTING THERE, AND I'M PETRIFIED. THERE WAS SOME BOWEL ACTIVITY GOING ON. I WAS PETRIFIED. I'M LOOKING AT HIM, AND I SAID, MAN, DO YOU LIKE THIS? HE GOES "I THINK YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD."
Stephen: HE'S OUT OF OFFICE. HAVE YOU HAD TO CHANGE YOUR IMPRESSION OF HIM IN ANY WAY?
OF COURSE. OBVIOUS, HE'S, LIKE, "I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT HEALTHCARE, I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT SIPPING A MY TIE AND PUFF AGO LITTLE BIT OF THIS. THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO. IT'S GOOD. WHAT IS THIS? GORILLA GLUE? IT'S AMAZING ." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU DO OVER 200 IMPRESSIONS.
OVER 200, YES, SIR.
Stephen: OKAY. WHY? BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE GREAT AT IMPRESSIONS. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT THE EAR? WHERE DID IT START FOR YOU?
IN GENERAL?
Stephen: AS A CHILD. OKAY, SO I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. I HAD A GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME AND SHE TOLD --
Stephen: WHAT?! YEAH. I HAD A GIRL AT SIX YEARS OLD, YEAH.
Stephen: WOW. YEAH, SHE TOLD ME I WAS GOOD AND I JUST KEPT GOING.
Stephen: THE SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRLFRIEND TOLD YOU YOU'VE GOT A REAL EAR, YOU SHOULD PURSUE THIS?
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU DO A DE NIRO? I DON'T DO A LOT BUT I DO A DE NIRO.
I DO A LITTLE. A LITTLE OF THE BREATHING. I'LL GET YOU, DO NOT PLAY -- DO NOT PLAY AROUND. I DO IT A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: MA, SEE, I'M BOBBY DEE! MA, I RUN THIS TOWN! MA, MA!
I HAVE A THEORY. DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?
Stephen: YEAH. IF DOGS WOULD TALK THEY WOULD SOUND LIKE DAVE CHAPPELLE. HOLD ON, SON! NOBODY COMES BACK HERE! I'M TIRED OF EATIN' SQUIRREL, SON! OW! I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WOULD SOUND, I DO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, THE NEW SHOW IS CALLED "WHITE FAMOUS."
YES, SIR.
Stephen: EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS TO ME. I'M WHITE AND FAMOUS, AM I WHITE FAMOUS?
PRETTY MUCH BY DEFAULT.
Stephen: WHAT DOES WHITE FAMOUS MEAN IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS SHOW?
WHITE FAMOUS MEANS BEING KNOWN BY EVERYBODY AND ACCEPTED IN EVERYONE'S HOUSEHOLD. FOR INSTANCE, I WILL PROBABLY GIVE A BETTER EXAMPLE. EDDY MURPHY, JAMIE FOXX, TRACY MORGAN, EVEN BERNIE MAC MADE IT PAST THAT PART. HE SCARED A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT MADE IT PAST THAT POINT. IT'S THAT TRAJECTORY OF EVERY YOUNG PLAQUE COMEDIAN THAT GETS A CHANCE TO CROSS OVER AND THEY GET A CHANCE TO BE LOVED BY EVERYONE, SO THAT'S WHAT THE SHOW WAS ABOUT.
Stephen: DO YOU TAKE ANY OF YOUR OWN LIFE EXPERIENCES AND PUT THEM IN WHITE FAMOUS?
I THINK, LUCKILY, I NEXT SEASON, IF WE GET A CHANCE TO DO IT, THERE IS A STORY -- MY SISTER IS MY MANAGER, NOT BY DEFAULT, SHE WENT TO SCHOOL FOR MASS COMMUNE CAUTIONS AND SHE'S REALLY GOOD AT RELATIONS AND TALKING TO FOLKS. BACK WHEN I WAS 21 YEARS OLD, WE BOTH DIDN'T HAVE ANY JOBS, AND WHAT SHE DID WAS SHE PAWNED HER JEWELRY SO WE COULD HAVE GAS MONEY TO GET UP TO NEW YORK TO WORK THE CHITTERLING CIRCUIT. SHE DID THAT. YOU GET ABOUT $100 OR $75 A ROOM AND YOU DO THEM AT WEIRD PLACES LIKE RESTAURANTS, JAMAICAN RESTAURANTS WHERE PEOPLE WILL SHAKE CHEESE AT YOU IF YOU'RE NOT FUNNY. IF YOU'RE NOT FUNNY, LOOK AT YOU, BOY. WE NOT LIKE YOU. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! THEY'LL DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GET SCARED. SO WHEN I GOT UP, I DID IT, LUCKILY, I HAD IMPRESSIONS, BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T, THEY WOULD HAVE BOOED THE HELL OUTO OUTOF M THAT'S A GOOD SISTER.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BOUGHT HER JEWELRY BACK?
I HAVE DONE A LOT FOR MY SISTER. A LOT.
