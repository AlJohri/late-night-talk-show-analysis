AS OUR STORY CONTINUES, WE FIND OUR POKEÉMON FRIENDS   PREPARING TO TAKE ON THEIR GREATEST CHALLENGE.
HAVE YOU HEARD? PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ARRIVED IN JAPAN.
OH, NO, HE WANTS TO START WORLD WAR III WITH NORTH KOREA.
AND HE WANTS TO STEAL OUR POKE MON SO OUR SONS WITH HUNT THEM.
DID SOMEONE MENTION MY NAME? OH, NO! I CANNOT BE STOPPED! I HAVE THE BEST, MOST LUXURIOUS POKEÉMON!
NOT SO FAST! I HAVE A POKEÉMON, TOO! YOUR TOUPEE ARTIST IS NO MATCH FOR MY ROBERT MUELLER. HE KNOWS AN UNSTOPPABLE MOVE, F.B.I. INVESTIGATION!
AAAHHH! AHHH!
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RUNNING AWAY!
DON'T WORRY, I'LL GO AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS CRONIES, I'VE GOT TO CATCH 'EM ALL! ♪ GOT TO CATCH THEM ALL, POKEÉMON!♪
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. STEPHEN WELCOMES JOSH GAD, LAWRENCE O'DONNELL AND DEREK DELGAUDIO, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: WHOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BE GENTLE! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THERE YOU GO. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. I'M SO GLAD TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. SO WONDERFUL TO BE HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE I'VE BEEN FEELING AN EMPTINESS, A GREAT VOID, BUT IT LEFT THE COUNTRY ON FRIDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DONALD TRUMP IS ON A 13-DAY TRIP THROUGH ASIA. FOX AND FRIENDS HAS ONE LESS VIEWER. ( LAUGHTER ) ON HIS WAY TO ASIA, HE STOPPED OFF IN HAWAII. OF COURSE, THAT'S OBAMA'S HOME STATE. HE'S VERY POPULAR THERE, SO PEOPLE THERE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY TO TRUMP, "ALOHA." THEY WANTED TO SAY, "ALOHA." ( LAUGHTER ) LOOK IT UP. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP FLEW TO A U.S. AIRBASE OUTSIDE TOKYO TO DELIVER A STRONG MESSAGE TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES:
NO ONE, NO DICTATOR, NO REGIME AND NO NATION SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE EVER AMERICAN RESOLVE. EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE IN THE PAST THEY UNDERESTIMATED US. IT WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR THEM, WAS IT? ( CHEERING ) IT WAS NOT PLEASANT.
STEPHEN: "ANYONE WHO MESSES WITH US GETS WHAT'S COMING TO THEM. JUST ASK JAPAN. WHAT'S THAT? WHERE AM I RIGHT NOW?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SORRY. OOPSY DAISY. AFTER THAT, IT WAS TIME FOR TRUMP TO MEET WITH JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER AND GUY WHO REALLY THOUGHT HE'D BE TALKING TO HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT NOW, SHINZO ABE. NOW, WITH THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION HEATING UP, JAPAN REALLY NEEDS THE U.S. ON ITS SIDE. SO ABE LAUNCHED A FULL FRIENDSHIP OFFENSIVE. FIRST, HE MADE THEIR B.F.F. STATUS OFFICIAL BY SPEAKING TRUMP'S NATIVE LANGUAGE-- HAT! ( LAUGHTER ) IT SAYS, "DONALD AND SHINZO MAKE ALLIANCE EVEN GREATER." ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. THAT'S PERFECT. WE ALL KNOW, HISTORIANS KNOW ALL THE BEST DIPLOMACY WAS ACCOMPLISHED VIA HEAD GEAR. DON'T FORGET THE GREAT GEAR ROOSEVELT GAVE OUT AT YALTA. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN THE TWO BEST FRIENDS FED THE COY FISH AT THE ROYAL PALACE. FEEDING THE KOI IS A TIME HONORED TRADITION, MUCH LIKE THE TEA SERVICE, WHEREIN THE MEDITATION OF THE MOVEMENT IS RESONANT WITH THE SHINTO-- OKAY, SUCK ON IT, YOU FAT FISH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. PRETTY GOOD. THEN ABE REALLY TURNED ON THE CHARM OFFENSIVE, TREATING TRUMP TO A ROUND OF GOLF THEN REMINDING DONALD ABOUT IT AT THAT NIGHT'S RECEPTION.
WHEN YOU PLAY GOLF WITH SOMEONE NOT JUST ONCE BUT FOR TWO TIMES, THE PERSON MUST BE YOUR FAVORITE GUY.
STEPHEN: ALRIGHT, SHINZO, LEAVE SOME OF THE "STROKES" ON THE GOLF COURSE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH! CLARENCE THOMAS. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND TRUMP HAS SHOWN CONCERN OVER JAPAN'S NATIONAL SECURITY. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE MISSILES THAT NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN FIRING OVER JAPAN, TRUMP SAID HE DIDN'T GET "WHY A COUNTRY OF SAMURAI WARRIORS DID NOT SHOOT DOWN THE MISSILES." "DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SAMURAI, COULD BE A NINJA, A POWER RANGER, GODZILLA... MR. MIYAGI. ( LAUGHTER ) WAX ON, WAX OFF." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) MEANWHILE, REMEMBER WHEN WE THOUGHT GEORGE W. BUSH WAS A BAD PRESIDENT? (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) GOOD TIMES. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, YOU CAN RELIVE THEM NOW, BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW BOOK ABOUT "W" AND "H.W.," CALLED "THE LAST REPUBLICANS." SEEN HERE LOOKING LOVINGLY AT DONALD TRUMP'S POLL NUMBERS. ( LAUGHTER ) THESE TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS HAS HARSH WORDS FOR OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. "H.W." SAYS, "I DON'T LIKE HIM. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM, BUT I KNOW HE'S A BLOWHARD." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, THEN YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) BUSH, THE SON, WAS NO KINDER, SAYING OF TRUMP, "THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE PRESIDENT." YES, TRUMP'S ALWAYS OUT THERE SAYING DUMB STUFF, WHILE GEORGE BUSH IS A STATESMAN WHO GAVE THE NATION STIRRING AND DIGNIFIED WORDS:
I KNOW THE HUMAN BEING AND FISH CAN COEXIST PEACEFULLY. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: SAY WHAT YOU WILL, SAY WHAT YOU WILL.
Jon: THAT WAS A REAL THING, THOUGH. HE WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH.
Stephen: THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE WAR WITH TROUT SINCE HIS PRESIDENCY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, THE WHITE HOUSE FIRED BACK AT THE BUSHES, DECLARING, "IF ONE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CAN DISASSEMBLE A POLITICAL PARTY, IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT HOW STRONG A LEGACY ITS PAST TWO PRESIDENTS REALLY HAD." WHAT? THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "HEY, IF ONE AFFAIR WITH A SECRETARY CAN DESTROY THIS MARRIAGE, YOU MUST NOT HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD WIFE." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, SINCE TRUMP WAS OVERSEAS -- AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS -- HE WAS MORE RESTRAINED, SAYING, "I'LL COMMENT AFTER WE COME BACK. I DON'T NEED HEADLINES." ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED HEADLINES LIKE YOU NEED OXYGEN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I'M SURPRISED HE'S NOT FIRING BACK. NO TWEETS FOR 13 DAYS? HE'S GOING TO GET BLUEBIRDS. DANGEROUS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S TRUE. IT'S REAL. IT'S DANGEROUS. ( APPLAUSE ) NONE OF THIS IS HELPING TRUMP'S POPULARITY. HE NOW HAS THE LOWEST APPROVAL RATING IN MODERN TIMES. VERY IMPORTANT. MODERN TIMES. IN ANCIENT TIMES, THINGS WERE MUCH WORSE. JULIUS CAESAR'S APPROVAL RATING WAS STAB, STAB, STAB. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NO ONE -- NO ONE -- NO ONE HAS SUMMED UP THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY BETTER THAN A CYCLIST WHO WENT VIRAL LAST WEEK FOR GIVING THE PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE THE FINGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LONG MAY SHE WAVE. HER NAME IS JULI BRISKMAN, AND SHE JUST GOT FIRED FOR FLIPPING OFF TRUMP'S MOTORCADE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) BUT IF YOU CAN'T GIVE PEOPLE THE FINGER IN TRAFFIC, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF DRIVING? ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S HOW WE SAY "HELLO" IN NEW YORK -- ( LAUGHTER ) ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE FROM OUT OF TOWN. HEY, WELCOME TO MANHATTAN! ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, AFTER THIS PHOTO WENT VIRAL, JULI REPOSTED IT TO HER OWN FACEBOOK AND TOLD HER EMPLOYER, A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR NAMED AKIMA, L.L.C., THAT SHE WAS THE WOMAN IN THE PICTURE. IN RESPONSE, "THEY SAID, 'WE'RE SEPARATING FROM YOU. BASICALLY, YOU CANNOT HAVE 'LEWD' OR 'OBSCENE' THINGS IN YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA.'" HEY, IF YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LEWD ON SOCIAL MEDIA, HOW COME THE MIDDLE FINGER EMOJI COMES IN FIVE DIFFERENT COLORS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRULY, WE'RE LIVING DR. KING'S DREAM. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JOSH GAD IS HERE! BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, IS MICHAEL FLYNN HEADED TO JAIL? THE ANSWER WON'T SURPRISE YOU. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, GOOD TO SEE YA! THANKS, EVERYBODY! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. JON, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YA. HOUSE OF YOUR WEEKEND?
Jon: OH, IT WAS NICE AND EASY, MAN. I WAS IN L.A. CHILLING AND THEN I FLEW OVER HERE, AND NOW WE'RE HERE AND DOING THE SHOW.
Stephen: IT'S NICE TO BE HERE AND DOING THE SHOW AND WONDERFUL TO BE WITH THESE PEOPLE AND THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE, TOO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YES. YES, GOOD TO BE TOGETHER IN THESE TIMES.
Stephen: IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE TOGETHER. THE WORLD IS A HARROWING PLACE AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT. FOR INSTANCE, I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST IDEA HOW TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE ATTACK IN SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, TEXAS YESTERDAY. PEOPLE ON A SUNDAY GOING TO LOVE AND SERVE THE LORD GUNNED DOWN BY A MAD MAN WITH A SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON AND BODY ARMOR. WE ARE 35 DAYS AWAY FROM THE LARGEST MASS KILLING IN AMERICAN HISTORY IN THA LAS VEGAS. STILL DON'T KNOW WHY THAT HAPPENED IF WE'LL EVER KNOW, OR IF ANYONE CAN EVER EXPLAIN WHY ANY OF THIS HAPPENS. EVERYONE IS HEART BROKEN WHEN THIS HAPPENS, AND YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING BUT NOTHING GETS DONE. NO ONE DOES ANYTHING. AND THAT SEEMS INSANE. AND IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL HOPELESS. NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, BUT I KNOW HOPELESSNESS IS NOT THE ANSWER.
Jon: NO, NO.
Stephen: YOU CANNOT GIVE UP IN THE FACE -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- OF EVIL. NOTHING GETS DONE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN LAS VEGAS, THEY CAN'T EVEN PASS A RESTRICTION ON GUN STOCKS, THOSE BUMP STOCKS THAT TURN A SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON INTO AN ALMOST FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPON, THAT DIED, NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT. NOTHING GETS DONE TO CONTROL GUNS THAT KILL 10,000 PEOPLE AROUND AMERICA, NOT JUST IN THESE MASS KILLINGS. DOING NOTHING, AS I SAID BEFORE, IS UNACCEPTABLE, BUT IT'S UNNATURAL. IT'S INHUMAN.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: IT JUST GOES AGAINST OUR NATURE. WE WANT TO FIX THINGS. YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING TERRIBLE LIKE THIS, NOT JUST KNOW BUT AT ANYTIME IN HUMAN HISTORY. 5,000 YEARS AGO, IF YOUR VILLAGE HAD A TIGER COMING INTO IT EVERY DAY AND WAS EATING PEOPLE, YOU WOULD DO NOTHING. YOU WOULD MOVE THE VILLAGE, BUILD A FENCE OR KILL THE TIGER. YOU WOULDN'T SAY, WELL, I GUESS, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET EATEN EVERY DAY BECAUSE THE PRICE OF LIBERTY IS TIGERS.
Jon: NO.
Stephen: YOU TAKE SOME ACTION. THIS HOPELESSNESS, THIS POWERFULNESS YOU FEEL WHEN NOTHING GETS DONE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN'T GIVE INTO BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SOME TRULY EVIL PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT YOU TO FEEL POURLESS JUST FOR A BUCK BECAUSE IF YOU FEEL POWERLESS ENOUGH, YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL MORE POWERFUL? BUYING A GUN. IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE. VIOLENCE HAPPENS, NOTHING IS DONE TO GET RID OF THE GUNS, PEOPLE BUY GUNS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND MORE VIOLENCE OUT ON THE STREET. THIS GUY WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO BUY A GUN BUT A BUT HE DID, BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT THERE ON THE MARKET, THESE SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFING. THERE'S ONE POWER YOU MUST NEVER FORGET AND THAT IS YOU CAN GO VOTE IN 2018. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL DO SOMETHING! BECAUSE THIS IS AN ACTIVE EVIL AND THE ONLY THING NECESSARY FOR EVIL TO SUCCEED IS FOR GOOD MEN TO DO NOTHING. ( APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: MEANWHILE, IN LIGHTER NEWS, ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS IN TROUBLE FOR TIES TO RUSSIA. THIS TIME, IT'S FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND GUY WHO JUST CAN'T GET THOSE REPORTERS OFF HIS LAWN, MICHAEL FLYNN. ( LAUGHTER ) REPORTEDLY, SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ROBERT MUELLER NOW HAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST FLYNN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HONESTLY, HE SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS COMING. I MEAN, WE ALL REMEMBER WHAT FLYNN SAID ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AT THE R.N.C. LAST YEAR.
IF I -- A GUY WHO KNOWS THIS BUSINESS -- IF I DID A TENTH, A TENTH OF WHAT SHE DID, I WOULD BE IN JAIL TODAY.
STEPHEN: HE JUST GOT THE DATE WRONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ABOUT 14, 15 MONTHS OFF. NOW, THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION HASN'T JUST ENSNARED MICHAEL FLYNN. THE NOOSE IS ALSO TIGHTENING AROUND FLYNN'S SON AND HIP HOP FAN WHO HAS NEVER LISTENED TO THE LYRICS, MICHAEL FLYNN, JR. AFTER IT CAME OUT THAT MUELLER COULD CHARGE HIM AND HIS DAD, THIS WEEKEND FLYNN, JR. TWEETED, THE SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS ARE OUT IN FULL THIS MORNING. THE DISAPPOINTMENT ON YOUR FACES WHEN I DON'T GO TO JAIL WILL BE WORTH ALL YOUR HARASSMENT." AH, GOOD OLD UNCHECKED HUBRIS, THAT ALWAYS WORKS OUT. IT'S LIKE THE OLD STORY OF ICARUS: HE AND HIS FATHER FLEW TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN... AND THEN JUST KEPT ON FLYING WITH THEIR COOL NEW SUN TANS. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS HAD A BAD WEEK? PAPA JOHN'S C.E.O. AND OSMOND BROTHER WHO CAN'T SING, JOHN SCHNATTER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LAST WEEK, DADDY SCHNATTER BLAMED HIS COMPANY'S DECLINING SALES ON THE N.F.L.'S NATIONAL ANTHEM PROTESTS, SAYING THE CONTROVERSY IS POLARIZING THE CUSTOMER, POLARIZING THE COUNTRY. THE N.F.L. HAS HURT PAPA JOHN'S SHAREHOLDERS. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. PEOPLE STARTED THROWING PIZZA SHADE AT SCHNATTER, INCLUDING DIGIORNO'S, WHICH POSTED TWEETS LIKE, US: @PAPA JOHN'S LET US KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE NEW PIZZA, AND PIZZA SLICE, UPWARDS CHART. THEM: PIZZA SLICE, DOWNWARDS CHART. DAMN! OH! THAT TWEET'S NOT DELIVERY, IT'S DUHEVASTATING! ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: I LIKE THAT! YEAH!
Stephen: BY THE WAY, THIS CHART RIGHT HERE, THIS IS HOW THEY EXPLAIN ECONOMICS TO DONALD TRUMP RIGHT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE HASN'T BEEN A DIGIORNO BURN THAT BAD SINCE EVERY TIME A STONER FORGOT THEY PUT ONE IN THE OVEN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THERE IS ONE GROWTH DEMOGRAPHIC FOR PAPA JOHN'S PIZZA SALES: ALT-RIGHT WHITE SUPREMACISTS! WHO HAVE CLAIMED PAPA JOHN'S AS THEIR OFFICIAL PIZZA. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I'M SURPRISED. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE UNCLE ADOLF'S MASTER RACE PIZZA. "YOU WILL 'NAZI' A BETTER SLICE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) DELICIOUS. BUT PAPA JOHN DOESN'T WANT THAT KIND OF SUPPORT, SAYING, "WE CONDEMN RACISM IN ALL FORMS AND ANY AND ALL HATE GROUPS THAT SUPPORT IT. WE DO NOT WANT THESE INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS TO BUY OUR PIZZA." ALL RIGHT. NO, PIZZA FOR YOU, RACISTS. GARLIC CHEDDAR KNOTS, HOWEVER, ARE UP FOR GRABS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JOSH GAD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JOIN US! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- THANK YOU, JOHN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, JOHN! THANK YOU, LOUIS! WHAT WAS THAT SONG?
Jon: A COMPOSITION I WROTE.
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOES, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM "FROZEN," "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," AND "THE BOOK OF MORMON." HE DOES A LITTLE LESS SINGING IN "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS."
YOU STOLE FROM ME! THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE FOUND OUT, THAT IS WHY YOU KILLED HIM! YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I STOLE FROM HIM. THOUSANDS. I KNEW HIS MONEY WASN'T HONEST. WHAT DID IT MATTER IF I SKIMMED SOME OFF THE TOP? BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION -- WHY WOULD I SLAUGHTER MY CASH COW? I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T KILL HIM!
Stephen: I THINK HE DID (WHISPERING). PLEASE WELCOME JOSH GAD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) YOU TOTALLY KILLED HIM.
CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING BEFORE WE BEGIN IN ALL THIS? YOU ARE SO BRILLIANT. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR SPEECH BACKSTAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
Stephen: NICE OF YOU TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S BRILLIANT?
NO, TELL ME.
Stephen: OLAF FROM "FROZEN."
THERE HE IS, FLYING! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS IS A MILESTONE IN AN ARTIST'S CAREER. SO FEW -- MORE PEOPLE LANDED ON THEIR MOON THAN HAVE THEIR OWN MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE BALLOON.
IS THAT TRUE?
Stephen: WE LOOKED IT UP. MORE PEOPLE HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON THAN HAVE THEIR OWN BALLOON. YOU'RE THENAUT.
I'M SO SORRY TO N.A.S.A. ABOUT THIS FACT. I FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE A STEPHEN COLBERT BALLOON AS WELL! WOULD THAT BE WEIRD?
Stephen: I'M WORKING ON IT. YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS YEAR IS THE FIRST TIME?
THIS IS GOING TO BE THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, OLAF WILL BE FLYING IN THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE. AS A KID, I WOULD WATCH THIS ALL THE TIME, AND I WAS NEVER, LIKE, ONE DAY, I'LL BE A SNOWMAN, AND THAT SNOWMAN WILL HAVE HIS OWN BALLOON! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH, IF THIS HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE PARADE BEFORE, WHAT ARE WE SEEING?
I THINK OLAF WAS JUST, LIKE, I'M NOT GONNA WAIT ANY LONGER, I'M GONNA GO FLY!
Stephen: YOU GET TO RIDE IN IT THE WHOLE WAY.
IS THIS THE ENTIRE TIME. I'M UP THERE PILOTING IT. THIS IS CRAZY! WOW!
Stephen: LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY. WHO WANTS TO GET KNOCKED OUT OF THE PARADE, BULLWINKLE, POKEÉMON --
POKEÉMON, AFTER PLAYING THE GAME RELENTLESSLY LAST YEAR AND WATCHING YOUR COLD OPENING, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH, PROBABLY, PROBABLY. SO HERE'S THE DEAL, YOU'RE OLAF'S VOICE IN "FROZEN." YOU'VE DONE FIVE OTHER PROJECTS.
AS OLAF.
Stephen: BUT THE SEQUEL HASN'T COME OUT YET.
DON'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT IF IT HAD COME OUT?
Stephen: ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN AD OR TWO.
THE SEQUEL NOBODY'S SEEN.
Stephen: DISNEY DOESN'T LIKE TO ADVERTISE.
NO, THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, WE'RE WORKING ON IT.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE OTHER FIVE THINGS?
THERE ARE ALL THESE FROZEN SHORTS. ONE IS CALLED OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE IN FRONT OF COCOA, THE PIXAR MOVIE.
Stephen: IS THERE A OLAF CHIP IN YOUR NECK SO THEY CAN THROW A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND DRAG YOU OFF --
THAT'S VIE WHRENT. I DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S EXCESSIVE. I DO IT ALL THE TIME TO MY KIDS. I READ CONSTANTLY TO THEM. I READ THEM "FROZEN."
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN?
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
Stephen: IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON WHETHER THEY ARE OF TARGET AGE FOR FROZEN.
22 AND 25, STEPHEN.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
58, BROTHER. 58.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO SEND ME YOUR MOISTURIZER REGIMEN.
3 AND 6.
Stephen: BOYS, GIRLS? BOTH GIRLS.
Stephen: THEY ALL WANT TO BE --
ELSA, ANNA. NOBODY WANTS TO BE ME IN MY HOUSEHOLD. IT'S SAD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU WERE THE REINDEER OR THE BIG FROST MONSTER. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU READ EVERYTHING AS OLAF?
WELL, IT'S MY VOICE, SO I REALLY -- ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I KNOW THAT! I KNOW THAT!
SURPRISE!
Stephen: GO AHEAD. 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS -- ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT, WAIT, CLOSE YOUR EYES. FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH, THEY SAY LINCOLN ACTUALLY SOUNDED LIKE THAT.
READY? I'M FREDDY KRUEGER -- ( LAUGHTER ) SO SAD.
Stephen: VERY NICE. ARE THEY SAYING DO IT AS OLAF OR READ AS DADDY?
THEY SAY READ AS DADDY, NOT AS OLAF. I'M, LIKE, I DON'T DECIPHER BETWEEN THE TWO. IT'S ME, DADDY! AND DADDY MAKES ONE CHOICE! ( LAUGHTER ) DADDY DOESN'T HAVE A CHARACTER. DADDY IS A CHARACTER!
DADDY IS A CHARACTER!
Stephen: OKAY, SO, NOW, I'VE GOT TO THANK YOU FOR SOMETHING. WE HAD THE #PUBERME CHALLENGE, WHERE WE RAISED MONEY FOR PUERTO RICO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: SO YOU JOINED IN THE #PUBERME CHALLENGE AND WE GAVE $1,000 TO PUERTO RICO FOR EVERY PERSON WHO JOINED IN. AND THIS IS YOUR PUR #PUBERME -- LOOK AT THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHERE IS THIS?
YEAH, THIS IS IN JUST ANOTHER SOUTH FLORIDA BAR MITZVAH RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: IS THIS YOUR BAR MITZVAH?
NO, I WOULDN'T WEAR THAT TO MY BAR MITZVAH. I HAD A DRUM THEMED HAT FOR MY BAR MITS VIRGINIA BUT THIS IS ME HITTING THE BAR MITZVAH CIRCUIT AND THIS IS CALLED COOL DESPITE THE ACNE LOOK.
Stephen: WERE YOU BIG ON THE CIRCUIT?
HUGE ON THE CIRCUIT. I WAS THE BAR MITZVAH CIRCUIT.
Stephen: UNTIL YOU GOT THERE, THEY WEREN'T OFFICIALLY A MAN. ( LAUGHTER )
THEY WERE STILL 12 AND A HALF EVERY TIME.
Stephen: YOU'VE MADE A BIG TURN IN YOUR CAREER BECAUSE I THINK OF YOU AS A VERY GIFTED COMEDIC ACTOR --
THANK YOU.
Stephen: -- BUT NOW "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS."
"MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS" --
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT, THAT ONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ORIENT EXPRESS.
Stephen: THAT'S HOW OLAF WOULD SAY IT?
MURDER ON THE -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO THIS IS DRAMA. YES.
Stephen: THIS IS FULL DRAMA.
YES.
Stephen: LIKE, I TOTALLY BOUGHT YOU AS DRAMATIC IN THAT SCENE. THAT QUITE SURPRISED ME.
THANKS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: YOU'RE A VERY GIFTED COMEDIC.
I THINK YOU COULD DO A BRILLIANT DRAMA.
Stephen: I'M FREQUENTLY NOT FUNNY.
NO! BUT I STUDY DRAMA AND NOW IT'S FUN --
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU STUDY DRAMA?
I STUDIED ACTING DRAMATIC AT CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY BUT THIS IS FULL CIRCLE FOR ME. YOU DON'T BELIEVE I CAN DO SERIOUS ROLES. I SEE IT IN YOUR EYE.
Stephen: SAY SOMETHING LIKE, I LOVE YOU --
I LOVE YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT, LET ME TRY IT AGAIN.
Stephen: LET ME TRY IT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. GO.
Stephen: WHAT DID I DO? NO.
Stephen: WHAT PART OF THAT -- WHAT DID I DO?
NO, IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, HERE. HERE. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I LOVE YOU. I KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS" OPENS FRIDAY! JOSH GAD, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. MY NEXT GUEST IS A POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND HOST OF MSNBC'S "THE LAST WORD." PLEASE WELCOME LAWRENCE O'DONNELL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: HOW YOU BEEN? UH, UNDER PRESSURE.
Stephen: UNDER PRESSURE? YEAH.
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE?
BECAUSE WE'RE COVERING THE MOST EXTREMELY STRANGE PRESIDENCY IN HISTORY.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE, VERY STRANGE.
AND, UH -- AND WE DO IT LIVE AT 10:00 ON MY SHOW, AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE USED TO BE ABLE TO START WRITING THIS SHOW AT 3:00.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. >. AND NOW YOU START WRITING IT ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO 10:00 BECAUSE THE TWEETS ARE COMING IN LIKE CRAZY.
Stephen: AND CHANGE THE NEWS CYCLE COMPLETELY.
NOT TO MENTION THE INDICTMENTS THAT COME IN.
Stephen: YEAH. O WE'RE GETTING SHAKEN UP ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: I KIND OF LIKE HAT THE PRESIDENT IS IN ASIA 1 HOURS AHEAD FOR THE NEXT, LIKE, WEEK AND A HALF BECAUSE, WHEN WE'RE WRITING OUR SHOW, HE'S ASLEEP.
YES.
Stephen: HE CAN'T CHANGE THE NEWS CYCLE BECAUSE WE TAPE AROUND 5:30 IN THE EVENING.
YOU KNOW HOW LITTLE HE SLEEPS. HE'S A SERIOUS INSOMNIAC SO I IMAGINE ON THIS TRIP YOU CAN'T RELY ON THAT.
Stephen: THEY MUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE SOMETHING.
YOU THINK SO? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
Stephen: YOU CAN'T GIVE A SLEEPING PILLOW THE PRESIDENT? YOU WOULD KNOW.
I WOULD NOT KNOW.
Stephen: WHY WOULDN'T YOU KNOW? YOU WROTE ON WEST WING.
THAT'S CORRECT, I DID. AND WE NEVER -- LET'S SEE, 154 EPISODES, I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY SLEEPING PILL EPISODES THERE WERE. I DON'T REMEMBER MARTIN -- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE HE DID. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO THAT WAS A FANTASY, EVEN IN ITS DAY, IT WAS LIKE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT FANTASY PORN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THERE WERE CRAZY STORY LINES IN THAT. WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU GUYS WROTE THAT WAS ANYTHING AS CRAZY AS THE STORY LINES WE'RE GETTING NOW?
OH, EVERY SINGLE THING THAT'S HAPPENED PROBABLY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF OUR POLITICS, I WOULD HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THE WEST WING SAYING, NO, NO, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN. I WOULD HAVE SHOT DOWN EVERY -- YOU KNOW, REALITY SHOW GUY RUNS FOR PRESIDENT. I GO, NO, NO, IT CAN'T HAPPEN!
Stephen: HE WINS! THAT DESTROYS DRAMA. FICTIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA ABOUT A WHITE HOUSE IS NOW DESTROYED BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GRAVITY TO IT.
Stephen: LAWRENCE, PRETTY GOOD FOR COMEDY, THOUGH.
IT'S VERY GOOD FOR COMEDY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT FAIR.
Stephen: SORRY. NOT FAIR.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A BADGE OF HONOR, IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS, IN THAT YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TV POLITICAL PUNDITS, IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT TERM, TO BE ATTACKED BY THE PRESIDENT IN 2015. "I HEAR THAT DOPEY PUNDIT LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, ONE OF THE DUMBER PEOPLE ON TELEVISION, IS ABOUT TO LOSE HIS SHOW. NO RATINGS, TOO BAD." AND THEN EVEN BETTER "I HEARD SINCE HIS SHOW SUN WATCHABLE THAT LAWRENCE MADE MANY FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT ME, MAYBE I SHOULD SUE HIM?"
THAT'S MY SPACE IN TWITTER HISTORY. I'M THE FIRST PERSON, I THINK THE ONLY TV PERSON HE THREATENED TO SUE ON TWITTER.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DID HE SUE YOU? HE DIDN'T SUE ME. HE SAVED ALL THE LAWYERS FEES TO SUE BILL MAHR, AND THE YOUNG THROUGH IT OUT AND SAID IT WAS SILLY. I BEGGED HIM TO SUE ME AFTER THAT.
Stephen: I'M NEXT. HE WON'T EVEN TWEET ABOUT ME ( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S FASCINATING HE WON'T TWEET ABOUT YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET HIM TO TWEET ABOUT YOU? YOU HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH.
Stephen: SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT HIM?
I GUESS SO. THAT WOULD DO IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOT GONNA HAPPEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'VE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE, IT'S CALLED "PLAYING WITH FIRE" ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN OF 1968. WHAT TODAY CAN WE LEARN ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR POLITICS? ANYTHING WE CAN LEARN AND TODAY'S POLITICS?
WE CAN SEE ALL OF THE PRECEDENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 1968 WHICH IS KIND OF WHERE OUR MODERN POLITICS BEGAN FOR WHAT WE JUST SAW IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN. GEORGE WALLACE'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HE WAS THE SEGREGATIONIST ALABAMA GOVERNOR RUNNING AS ABINDEPENDENT IN 1968, HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER TOLD ME LAST YEAR WHEN HE HEARD TRUMP SPEAK AS A CANDIDATE, HE WAS HEARING GEORGE WALLACE. IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. GEORGE WALLACE WAS THE VERY FIRST CANDIDATE WHO USED THE PROTESTERS IN HIS AUDIENCE TO SHOW HOW TOUGH HE IS. HE WOULD YELL RIGHT BACK AT THEM AND FIGHT WITH THEM, AND THE SECOND ONE TO DO THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP. NO ONE IN BETWEEN THOUGHT FIGHTING WITH THE PROTESTERS IN THE AUDIENCE WAS A GOOD WAY TO PRESENT HIMSELF.
Stephen: NOW, YOU SAY IN THE FIRST SENTENCE, YOU TALK ABOUT ROGER AILES MEETING RICHARD NIXON IN 1968. WHY START THERE?
BECAUSE ROGER AILES MET RICHARD NIXON IN A SHOW LIKE THIS IN A MAKEUP CHAIR WHEN RICHARD NIXON WAS BEGINNING HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. NIXON LOVES THIS GUY AILES WHO SEEMS TO KNOW ABOUT TV, PULLS HIM INTO HIS CAMPAIGN OUT OF SHOW BUSINESS INTO POLITICS. AILES GETS NIXON ELECTED, GETS REAGAN ELECTED, GEORGE H.W. BUSH GET ELECTED, THEN CREATES FOX NEWS. IF RICHARD NIXON HAD NOT MET ROGER AILES IN THAT MIKE DOUGLAS MAKEUP CHAIR, WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE TODAY BECAUSE ROGER AILES CREATED THIS AMAZINGLY EFFECTIVE REPUBLICAN TELEVISION NEWS STATION CALLED FOX NEWS WHICH SUPPORTED TRUMP ALL THE WAY AND WITHOUT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE MADE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE OUTCOME GO HIS WAY.
Stephen: AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER SENTENCES AFTER THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
THERE ARE. THERE IS A LOT.
STEPHEN: "PLAYING WITH FIRE" IS OUT TOMORROW. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DEREK DELGAUDIO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY NEXT GUEST IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE AND TALENTED MAGICIANS OF HIS GENERATION. PLEASE WELCOME, DEREK DELGAUDIO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, WELL, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: PEOPLE OUT THERE MAY NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
I'M CERTAIN OF THAT.
Stephen: YOU ARE DOING A SHOW IN A SMALL THEATER IN NEW YORK. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT?
THE DARYL ROTH THEATER IS THAT THE DARYL ROTH THEATER. THE SHOW IS CALLED "IN AND OF ITSELF." 100 PEOPLE, 120 PEOPLE, HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE? HAAS ANYONE HERE SEEN THE SHOW? ( APPLAUSE ) TWO PEOPLE. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE EVERY NIGHT?
150 PEOPLE. VERY INTIMATE.
Stephen: OKAY. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE SHOW BEFORE I GIVE MY OWN OPINION OF IT HERE?
IT IS SORT OF A THEATRICAL EXISTENTIAL CRISIS, I GUESS.
Stephen: RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU START OFF THE SHOW, AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING, OF TELLING THE STORY OF SOMEBODY TELLING YOU A STORY.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND IF DOING SO LABELS YOU AS SOMETHING.
CORRECT, SOMEONE TELLS ME KIND OF A CAUTIONARY TALE AND THEN THEY TELL ME THAT I AM THE HERO OF THAT STORY.
Stephen: MM-HMM. AND THE SHOW -- AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY, BECAUSE THERE IS MAGIC INVOLVED IN THE SHOW, THOUGH I WOULD NOT CALL IT A MAGIC SHOW. IT SEEMS LIKE A ONE-MAN THEATRICAL PIECE THAT USES MAGIC TO ILLUSTRATE POINTS ABOUT PERSONAL IDENTITY AND WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT REAL.
YEAH. IN THIS SHOW, MAGIC AND ILLUSION ARE USED AS SORT OF A METAPHOR FOR IDENTITY AND THE THINGS THAT WE CAN AND CANNOT SEE ABOUT EACH OTHER.
Stephen: AND HAD THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE IN THIS SHOW. I HAD NEVER HAD THIS BEFORE. IS THAT I HAVE BEEN TO SHOWS THAT DEEPLY MOVED ME BUT I HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE END OF THE SHOW WHERE I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE OR EVEN APPLAUD BECAUSE I WAS SO CAPTURED BY THE LAST MOMENTS OF THIS PLAY THAT I FELT LIKE THERE WAS A THIN LAYER OF STILL AIR ALL AROUND MY BODY THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO DISRUPT.
IS THAT WHY YOU WEREN'T APPLAUDING? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU WERE WATCHING. OKAY, YES. NO, THAT'S SOMETHING I HAD TO GET OVER WAS NOT HAVING PEOPLE APPLAUD BECAUSE, AS A PERFORMER OVER THE YEARS, YOU GET USED TO HOPEFULLY PEOPLE APPLAUDING AND REACTING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME. BUT WITH THIS SHOW, THERE'S A VERY STRANGE REACTION WHERE PEOPLE DO, THEY HAVE THIS MOMENT WHERE THEY KIND OF JUST WANT TO SIT IN IT AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO LAUGH OR APPLAUD BECAUSE THE SHOW IS CONSTRUCTED SO YOU'RE NOT REALLYTURE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHO YOU ARE OR WE AS THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS ARE.
YES.
Stephen: CAN I SHOW THIS MUCH TO LET PEOPLE KNOW?
YES.
Stephen: WHEN YOU FIRST COME INTO THE THEATER, THERE IS A LARGE BOARD ON WHICH THERE ARE -- THERE MUST BE WELL OVER A THOUSAND CARDS.
YES.
Stephen: WELL OVER A THOUSAND CARDS. AND THE CARDS, LET ME HOLD ONE UP LIKE THIS, THEY SAY, I AM, ON ETCH OF THE CARDS, AND THEN HAVE A DIFFERENT THING LIKE I AM A BEEKEEPER, I AM AN IMMIGRANT, AND IT'S ALL DONE ALPHABETICALLY.
YES.
Stephen: AND THIS IS THE ONE I CHOSE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHY DO YOU WANT THE AUDIENCE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE?
BECAUSE, AS I MENTIONED, IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. I WANT PEOPLE TO START WITH THE CRISIS OF DEFINING YOURSELF WITH ONE LABEL. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CALL YOURSELF IN THIS WORLD AND OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE YOU AS? THE SHOW BEGINS AS PEOPLE EVEN ENTER THE THEATER AND THEY'RE FORCED WITH THIS CONFRONTATION, A CHOICE OF WHO AM I, HOW DO I WANT TO BE SEEN AND HOW DO I SEE MYSELF, AND THAT CHOICE IS A PRETTY HEAVY CHOICE.
Stephen: YOU WATCH PEOPLE ON STAGE, ONE PARTICULAR PERSON ON STAGE AND IT'S DIFFERENT EVERY NIGHT GO THROUGH A TRANSFORMATION AS TO WHO THEY ARE TO THEMSELVES AND US.
YES, AND THAT CAN BE PRETTY POWERFUL DEPENDING ON THE NIGHT. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE STEP ON STAGE SAYING THEY DON'T HAVE A FATHER AND LEAVE THE STAGE SAYING THAT THEY DO AND MEANING IT, YOU KNOW, AND, SO, THERE'S REALLY SOME INCREDIBLE TRANSFORMATIONS THAT HAPPEN WITH PEOPLE BECAUSE WE REALIZE THESE LABELS THAT WE GIVE OURSELVES AND GIVE EACH OTHER ARE THE LIMITATIONS AT WE HAVE.
Stephen: WELL, LISTEN, I WISH WE COULD TELL YOU MORE OTHER THAN I HOPE YOU GET FROM THIS MAN'S CONVERSATION THE COLLEGE OF THOUGHT THAT GOES INTO THE SHOW AND I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU THE QUALITY OF THE MAGIC. GO SEE IT. IT WILL MAKE SENSE TO YOU. "IN AND OF ITSELF" AT THE DARYL ROTH THEATER. DEREK DELGAUDIO, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE JASON SEGAL, AND MUSICAL GUEST MAVIS STAPLES. NOW, STICK AROUND FOR AN ALL-NEW JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT!   Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
