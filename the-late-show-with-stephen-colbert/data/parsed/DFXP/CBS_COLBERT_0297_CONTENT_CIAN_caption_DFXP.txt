HELLO, RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN OUT THERE THAT OBAMACARE IS GOING TO BE REPEALED WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. THERE'S A PERFECTLY FINE ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE. HOME REMEDIES. SUFFERISUFFERING FROM BACK PAIN? JUST GET A BIG BOWL OF ICE, PORIN SOME VODKA, AND DRINK. CAN'T STOP SCRATCHING AN ITCHY RASH. EASY? WEAR CHEESE GRATERS AND GLOVES. BROKEN BONE? NO PROBLEM. VISIT A CEMETERY. THEY HAVE ALL THE UNBROKEN BONE YOU COULD WANT. ALL IT TAKES SAY SHOVEL AND A LIFETIME OF BEING PLAGUED BY THE UNDEAD. OPEN WOUND? TAKE OUT SOME GAUZE, ROLL IT OUT, PORVODKA ON THE BANDAGE FOR STERILIZATION, AND DRINK. LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE BIRTH CONTROL? GO TO TARGET ON A SATURDAY. VISIT THE TOY AISLE, AND REMIND YOURSELF, "I CAN JUST WALK AWAY." ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JOE SCARBOROUGH KATE UPTON AND YVETTE NICOLE BROWN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: WHAT'S UP? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY!
Jon: HEY, HEY, HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT IS AN EXCITING DAY-- EXCITING DAY FOR PRESIDENT PUMP, BECAUSE HE WENT ON A FIELD TRIP TO THE MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. HE WAS SO WORRIED STEVE BANNON WOULDN'T SIGN HIS PERMISSION SLIP. HE GOT TO GO. YOU BEEN DOWN THERE?
Jon: I'VE BEEN DOWN THERE GLI HAVEN'T BEEN YET. I HEARD IT'S INCREDIBLE. NOW, TRUMP WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO VISIT THE MUSEUM ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY, BUT THAT HAD TO BE POSTPONED BECAUSE OF SCHEDULING ISSUES. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. AS DR. KING HIMSELF SAID, "I HAVE A DREAM, UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE COMES UP. THEN IT CAN WAIT." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) STIRRING. STIRRING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I BELIEVE OBAMA CALLED THAT "THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW. OR LATER." NOW, AT THE END OF THE TOUR, TRUMP HONORED THE BIGGEST FIGURES IN AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY LIKE SOJOURNER OF TRUTH, BOOKER T. WASHINGTON AND BEN CARSON.
I LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S A GREAT GUY, REALLY A GREAT GUY. AND HE CAN TELL YOU BETTER THAN ME, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE REALLY STARTED SOMETHING WITH BEN.
Stephen: YES, TRUMP REALLY STARTED SOMETHING BY HIRING BEN CARSON. IT IS THE BIGGEST ADVANCEMENT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS SINCE... ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO WHEN WE HAD A BLACK PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT SINCE THEN-- BUT SINCE THEN-- SINCE THEN, PRETTY GOOD SINCE THEN. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE-- AS SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, BEN CARSON HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM.
HUD HAS A MEANING FAR BEYOND HOUSING. IF PROPERLY DONE, IT'S A MEANING THAT'S AS BIG AS ANYTHING THERE IS. AND BEN WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THAT TRUE MEANING AND THE TRUE MEANING OF HUD, AS ITS SECRETARY.
Stephen: YES. I BELIEVE BEN CARSON WILL FIND THE TRUE MEANING OF HUD, JUST LIKE IN THE BELOVED CHILDREN'S STORY: "HIGHWAY THE GRINCH STOLE HOUSING." SO GOOD. CINDY LU WHO OPINIO ALONG WITH CARSON, TRUMP RECOGNIZED OTHER AFRICAN AMERICANS SERVING IN GOVERNMENT. HE HONORED THEM THE ONLY WAY HE KNOWS HOW.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR TIM SCOTT FOR JOINING US TODAY, A FRIEND OF MINE, A GREAT, GREAT SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. I LIKE THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. I LIKE ALL THOSE STATES WHERE I WON BY DOUBLE, DOUBLE, DOUBLE DIGITS, YOU KNOW, THOSE STATES.
Stephen: YES, HE LOVES THOSE STATES WHERE HE WON BY DOUBLE, DOUBLE, DOUBLE DIGITS. BUT HE SEEMS TO HATE THE COUNTRY WHERE HE LOST BY MILLIONS, MILLIONS, MILLIONS OF VOTES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S STILL PRESIDENT! HE'S STILL PRESIDENT. DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT PRESIDENT. HE'S STILL PRESIDENT. HE'S JUST A LOSER PRESIDENT. NOW, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TOLD US TODAY HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ENFORCE THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON IMMIGRATION, AND IT CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH, FOLKS. JUST LAST WEEK, HUNTERS IN TEXAS WERE WOUNDED IN A GUNFIGHT NEAR THE BORDER, WHEN, THEY SAY IMMIGRANTS ILLEGALLY CROSSED IN FROM MEXICO, CONVERGING ON THEIR CAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND TRIED TO ROB THEM. BOTH MEN ARE RECOVERING, BUT IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE STORY, IN THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BELIEVE IT BECAUSE IT WAS ALL A LIE. TURNS OUT THEY SHOT EACH OTHER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WOW. YEAH, THEY SHOT EACH OTHER. THEY SHOT EACH OTHER. THE TRUTH HURTS. NOT AS MUCH AS THOSE BULLETS, BUT STILL... APPARENTLY, ONE OF THE GUYS, NAMED WALKER DOUGHERTY, WAS OUT WALKING AROUND AND WHEN HE RETURNED TO CAMP HE THOUGHT THAT ILLEGALS WERE IN THE R.V. WAITING TO KIDNAP HIS FRIENDS. BUT INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING HIMSELF, HE TRIED OPENING THE DOOR, AND THAT'S WHEN HIS FELLOW HUNTER INSIDE THE R.V., EDWIN ROBERTS, FIRED OFF A ROUND. IT'S LIKE THE OLD JOKE: "KNOCK, KNOCK!" BLAM, BLAM, BLAM! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) THAT'S HOW IT GOES? KNOCK, KNOCK. BLAM, BLAM, BLAM. WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD? TO GET AWAY FROM THE GUNFIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, FROM THE BEGINNING, THE SHERIFF SAID THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE INVOLVED, BUT THAT DID NOT STO AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER AND CARTOON OF AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER. HE SPREAD THE STORY TO HIS 400,000 FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS SAYING THAT AMERICA NEEDS TO BUILD THE WALL BECAUSE, QUOTE: "THE ALIENDSWERE AMBUSHING THE R.V. THAT WALKER AND HIS WIFE," PERIOD. MAN, THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN SO BAD, EVEN HE CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, SPEAKING OF-- SPEAKING OF IMGRIEGZ, LAST THURSDAY WAS SOMETHING CALLED, "A DAY WITHOUT IMMIGRANTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT IT? YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? I DIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT TRUMP CALLED IT WHEN MELANIA STAYS IN NEW YORK. IT TURNS OUT-- BECAUSE HE MISSES HER. BUT TURNS OUT, IT'S WHEN A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY DIDN'T GO TO WORK TO PROTEST TRUMP'S BORDER POLICIES. BUT NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROTEST GOT FIRED. FOR INSTANCE, IN OKLAHOMA THE OWNER OF THE "I DON'T CARE BAR AND GRILL" FIRED 12 LINE COOKS, AND SAID, "I'M ON THEIR SIDE, BUT WE HAVE RULES AT THE 'I DON'T CARE BAR AND GRILL.'" ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH. BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEY SHOULD REALLY CHANGE THE NAME TO THE: "SELECTIVELY ANAL BAR AND GRILL." BY THE WAY, PLEASE, I BEG YOU, DO NOT GOOGLE "SELECTIVELY ANAL BAR AND GRILL." BUT COTRY THE JALAPENO POOPERS. WHAT IS THIS, A MONTH. WE ARE A MONTH INTO TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. AND FOR THOSE OF US-- ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) PACE YOURSELF. IT'S ONLY ONE MONTH, PEOPLE. YOU'VE GOT TO PACE YOURSELF. FOR THOSE OF YOU KEEPING SCORE AT HOME, DONALD TRUMP HAS GONE GOLFING SIX TIMES. SIX TIMES IN 30 DAYS. THAT EXPLAINS THE BUMPER STICKER ON AIR FORCE ONE: "I'D RATHER BE GOLFING, AND THERE'S A 20% CHANCE THAT I AM." ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, WE KNOW-- GOLF. GOLF. GOLF CLAPS. GOLF CLAPS. NOW, WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TO THE GOLF COURSE SIX TIMES, BUT FOR SOME REASON, HIS AIDES WOULD NOT CONFIRM THAT TRUMP PLAYED GOLF EACH TIME HE WENT TO THE GOLF COURSE. SURE, HE COULD BE ON THE COURSE FOR ANY REASON. WE KNOW HE LOVES MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE'S HANDICAPS! ( APPLAUSE ) THAT DESERVES A GOLF CLAP. OOOH. BUT I KNOW WHY THEY'RE DODGING, WHEN TRUMP WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, HE SAID THIS:
I'M GOING TO BE WORKING FOR YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TIME TO GO PLAY GOLF.
Stephen: WELL, THEN THAT'S GOOD NEWS! IF TRUMP HAS TIME TO BE OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE, I GUESS THAT MEANS AMERICA IS GREAT AGAIN. ALSO THERE'S NEWS FROM A DIFFERENT WORLD LEADER YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR, POPE FRANCIS. YESTERDAY HE ADDRESSED STUDENTS AND ADDRESSED A VEXING THEOLOGICAL ISSUE, TKING AT DINNER. OKAY, TEENS, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY. YOU AND YOUR TEXTING IS WHY WE HAVE WARS. NOW, GO CLEAN YOUR ROOM BEFORE BEFORE YOU START A PESTILENCE. JUST WAIT UNTIL YOUR HOLY FATHER COMES HOME. THIS ISN'T NEW. IT'S AN ANCIENT PROBLEM. EVEN JESUS DID IT AT THE LAST SUPPER. "JUDAS TOTES GOING TO BETRAY ME, FROWNY FACE." AND FRANCIS ISN'T DONE WITH YOU YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE HE ALSO CHIDED TODAY'S YOUTHS FOR THEIR LACK OF MANNERS, SAYING THAT INSTEAD OF A FRIENDLY "GOOD MORNING," THEY OPT FOR AN "ANONYMOUS 'CIAO, CIAO.'" NOT ONLY ARE YOU TEENS BEING RUDE. YOU ALSO SOUND SUPER PRETENTIOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) "CIAO CIAO, IL PAPA. CIAO, CIAO. I HAVE TO ZOOM, ZOOM ON MY SCOOTER FOR ANOTHER TEENY TINY ESPRESSO. BEEP, BEEP! CIAO CIAO." CIAO, CIAO. CIAO, CIAO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CIAO, CIAO. I DON'T GET-- FRANCIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE COOL POPE, BUT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S TURNING INTO CURMUDGEON ROAM 1. THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA FOR A TV SHOW: "OLD POPE." I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLIP.
DRAMATIC SCENE AT ST. PETER'S TODAY AS THE FAITHFUL GATHERED TO HEAR THE NEW OLD POPE'S MESSAGE OF HOPE.
HEY, YOU KIDS, GET OFF OF MY LAWN. I'M KEEPING THIS FRISBEE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SCASH IS HERE. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY! YEAH! WOOO!
Stephen: FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF MSNBC'S "MORNING JOE." PLEASE WELCOME, JOE SCARBOROUGH. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO AS YOU KNOW, I'M AN ARDENT VIEWER OF YOUR SHOW.
RIGHT.
Stephen: I WATCH THE "COFFEE JOE MORNING."
EVERY DAY. BIG FAN FROM WAY BACK.
Stephen: WE CALL YOU "COFFEE JOE MORNING" OVER HERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND "COFFEE MORNING JOE" AND THE BREW CREW WE CALL YOU GUYS OVER THERE. HOW'S MIKA?
SHE'S DOING GREAT.
Stephen: YEAH. ARE YOU THE COHOST-- ARE YOU GUYS COHOSTING OR ARE YOU THE HOST AND SHE'S THE COHOST.
IT'S "MORNING MIKA." SHE'S IN CHARGE.
Stephen: SHE IS?
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN IN CHARGE GLI UNDERSTAND SHE'S THE ONE WHO BANNED KELLYANNE CONWAY FROM COMING ON YOUR SHOW.
SHE HAS, SHE HAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S STRONG. THAT'S A STRONG MOVE. SO, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS--
WAIT A SECOND. SO, I RECOGNIZE MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HERE FROM THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION THIS SUMMER.
Stephen: YES. ALL IN CLEVELAND. THEY'RE ALL FROM CLEVELAND.
THERE'S ONE GUY WITH A NASCAR SHIRT IN THE BACK. I THINK THAT MAY BE THE ONLY REPUBLICAN IN HERE.
Stephen: MIKA MAKES THOSE CALLS. IF I WANT TO BE ON THE SHOW-- I CAN BE ON THE SHOW?
YOU HAVE TO ASK MIKA.
Stephen: DO I HAVE TO STAY ON MIKA'S GOOD SIDE?
YES, YOU DO. IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE KELLYANNE KEPT COMING OUT AND EVERYTHING SHE SAID WAS DISPROVEN FIVE MINUTES LATER. IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION.
Stephen: THERE'S A QUICKER WAY TO SAY IN THA IN AN ENTIRE SENTENCE.
WHICH?
Stephen: SHE JUST LIED.
WELL, YEAH, EXACTLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU. YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE INSIDE SCOOP ON THE WHITE HOUSE, RIGHT? LIKE THE PRESIDENT CALLS YOU EVERY MORNING AND SAYS, "WHAT SHOULD I THINK, JOE?" RIGHT? BECAUSE HE CALLS YOU-- I KNOW HE WATCHES YOUR SHOW. WE KNOW HE WATCH YOURSELF SHOW EVERY DAY.
WE THINK HE DOES, BASED ON HIS TWITTER FIELD, YES.
Stephen: THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW ANYTHING DID DONALD TRUMP.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WEAN HE'S FINE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF HIS TWITTER FEED.
IT'S BEEN KIND OF SILENT. HE HAS WATCHED THE SHOW FOR YEARS. EVEN WHEN HE CLAIMS HE'S NOT WATCHING THE SHOW AND SENS OUT NASTY TWEETS TO US, WE ALWAYS LOOK AT THE CAMERA AND SAY, "DONALD, WE KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING THE SHOW, BUT HOW YOU DOING?"
Stephen: YOU DON'T SAY, "DONALD" RIGHT? YOU SAY, "MR. PRESIDENT." EVEN I SAY, "MR. PRESIDENT."
WE'RE IN A TRANSGLIGZ YOU'RE IN A TRANSITION FROM BEING BUDDIES--
THE COUNTRY? A TRANSITION.
Stephen: OH, THE COUNTRY.
HE'S BEEN DONALD TRUMP FOREVER. HE'S BEEN DONALD FOREVER. IT'S HARD TO START CALLING HIM MR. PRESIDENT. AND I'LL BE REALLY HONEST WITH YOU, THE WAY HE'S ACTED OR THE PAST MONTH HAS MADE IT EVEN HARDER TO CALL HIM "MR. PRESIDENT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU-- I'M SORRY.
NO, LISTEN, I'M A REPUBLICAN, AND I'M A CONSERVATIVE. BUT-- LIKE YOU, AND I'M NOT BEING SORT OF SMALTZY. BUT I'M AN AMERICAN. I DIDN'T WROTE VOET FOR BILL CLINTON. THE GUY DROVE ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. BUT WHEN HE PUT HIS HAND UP AND SALUTED OR GAVE HIS OATH, I WAS CHEERING FOR HIM. I THINK WE AS AMERICANS SHOULD NOT CHEER AGAINST OUR PRESIDENT, LIKE RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID HE WAS DOING WITH BARACK OBAMA. I ACTUALLY THINK WE SHOULD PRAY FOR OUR PRESIDENT. BUT THAT REQUIRES ALL OF US AS AMERICANS TO DO WHAT WE CAN WHEN A PRESIDENT IS NOT DOING WHAT HE NEEDS TO BE DOING TO STAND UP AND DO OUR PARK TOO DISPP RIGHT NOW, I THINK IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY REPUBLICANS -- AND LET ME SAY THIS-- EVERYBODY REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE-- THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT QUESTIONS JUDICIAL REVIEW AND QUESTIONS THE LEGITIMACY OF A FEDERAL JUDGE, TO STAND UP AND SAY, "THIS IS NOT RIGHT, AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT OUT." WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT ACTUALLY QUESTIONS FREE SPEECH, THE FIRST AMENDMENT, AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DOING THEIR JOB, I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON MY PARTY, ESPECIALLY, TO STAND UP RIGHT NOW AND SPEAK OUT. BECAUSE I ALWAYS SAY THIS OF EVERYBODY THAT GETS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE-- YOU THINK YOU'RE AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD NOW? YOU DON'T OWN THIS PLACE. YOU ARE RENTING THIS PLACE OUT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LETTING YOU HAVE THIS. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEEDS TO KNOW THA THERE IS GOING TO BE A TIME AFTER DONALD TRUMP AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE JUDGED FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS ON HOW THEY RESPONDED TO THE CHALLENGES OF TODAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Stephen: YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY GOING FOR THAT. YOU WERE TOTALLY GOING FOR THAT. LISTEN, I WISH-- OVER HERE. OVER HERE!
CAN YOU GET ME. I'M GOING TO JUGGLE NOW. I HAVE THEM GOING.
Stephen: I WISH I SHARED YOUR OPTIMISM THAT THERE WILL BE A TIME AFTER DONALD TRUMP. RIGHT NOW I'M A LITTLE WORRIED. DO YOU THINK-- WHO DO YOU THINK IS CALLING THE SHOTS OVER THERE? I HAVE HEARD THAT, LIKE, STEVE BANNON IS DRIVING THE BUS. OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT IS ON THE BUS BUT BANNON IS INVITING PEOPLE ON AND OFF THE BUS. STEPHEN MILLER IS ON THE BUS. REINCE PRIEBUS DOESN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GET ON THE BUS BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN GFT B GOVERNMENT, AND--
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS BUS THING.
Stephen: YOU DON'T? ARE YOU ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS, JOE?
YOU JUST CONFUSED ME. I CAN TELL YOU THIS, KNOWING DONALD TRUMP-- THEY ALWAYS SAY WHO IS THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM WHO INFLUENCED DONALD TRUMP? DONALD TRUMP IS ALWAYS THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM. DONALD TRUMP IS THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE CHOICES. I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A TALE OF TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. YOU LOOK AT THE FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS HE'S PUT OUT THERE, THEY'RE PRETTY SOLID.
Stephen: McMASTER SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE BEST DECISION TRUMP HAS MADE.
GREAT SESSION. THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, MATTIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK HE GOT HIM JUST BECAUSE HIS NICKNAME WAS "MAD DOG." SOMEBODY SAID HE THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING PATTON, BUT IN THE END HE ENDED UP GETTING A REAL STATESMAN AND SOMEBODY LIKE GENERAL MARSHALL. BUST YOU LOOK AT THE FOREIGN POLICY TEAM, HE HAS STRONG PEOPLE ACTUALLY WILL GIVE HIM AGREEMENT ADVICE. WE CAN RELAX ABOUT THAT. MY BIGGER PROBLEM IS THE INSIDE CIRCLE. THERE ARE NOBODY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT CAN GO IN AND TELL THIS PRESIDENT NO. THAT'S BAD. IT'S HAPPENED WITH PAST ADMINISTRATIONS, BUT SINCE HE HAS NO GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE, HE NEEDS THAT, AND WE NEED THAT AS A COUNTRY, SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT THE EXWUTS TO GO IN AND STAND UP AND SAY THIS IS WRONG. INSTEAD YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN MILLER-- OR AS MIKA CALLS HIM, "THE LITTLE DICTATOR." THINK ABOUT THAT FAIR SECOND.
Stephen: WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW LARGE HIS DICTATOR IS.
I THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MIKA'S SUGGESTION. HE GOES ON TV AND SAYS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CAN'T BE QUESTIONED.
Stephen: WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED.
WILL NOTE BE QUESTIONED. I'M SORRY, THAT'S A LITTLE FRIGHTENING.
Stephen: YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THAT'S VERY FRIGHTENING. THAT'S SCARY AS HELL.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND, IF YOU COMPLIMENT DONALD TRUMP, HE LIKES YOU PRETTY INSTANTLY. AND THAT IF YOU SAY SOMETHING NOT NICE ABOUT HIM, HE DISLIKES YOU ALMOST INSTANTLY.
YOU KNOW, I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT --
Stephen: YOU KNOW HIM, RIGHT? YOU KNEW HIM BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT.
JUST TO PUT IT OUT ON THE TABLE, ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BE VERY BLUNT WITH HIM, GIVEN HIM REALLY TOUGH ADVICE. WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GIULIANI OR BOLTEN AS BEING SECRETARY OF STATE, YOU KNOW, WE WERE HAVING A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION. I SAID, "YEAH, YOU CAN PICK THEM AS SECRETARY OF STATE. JUST KNOW THAT MIKA AND I WILL ABSOLUTELY KILL YOU ON THE SHOW FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS." WE, OF COURSE, SAID IT ON TV. THERE'S NEVER ANYTHING WE SAY IN PERSON THAT WE DON'T SAY ON TV. BUT --
Stephen: REALLY? ( LAUGHTER ) SO THERE'S NOTHING YOU'RE GOING TO SAY TO ME WHEN THE CAMERA GOES OFF THAT YOU WON'T SAY RIGHT NOW.
I SWEAR A LOT MORE TO HIM OFF-- OFF CAMERA, AND I'M A LITTLE MORE EMPHATIC. CHRIS HAS SEEN THAT. A LITTLE MORE EMPHATIC. HE DOESN'T-- THERE JUST AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THE NERVE IN THE INNER CIRC TOLL STAWND --
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU APPLY FOR A JOB, JOE?
I AM. I'M GOING TO PLAY WITH YOUR BAND. THAT'S MY JOB.
Stephen: WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE. WE HAVE ANOTHER ACT TO THIS. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JOE SCARBOROUGH.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH JOE SCARBOROUGH. NOW, JOE.
YES.
Stephen: WE WERE TALK BEFORE THE BREAK ABOUT YOUR BESTIE, DONALD TRUMP.
YUP.
Stephen: NOW, DO YOU THINK THIS IS A SUSTAINABLE ATMOSPHERE WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW? BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE-- I WAS WALKING AROUND THIS WEEKEND THINKING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE EMOTION OR THE DIVISIVENESS OR JUST SOME SORT OF GENERAL VIBE IN THE COUNTRY. THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT CAN GO ON AT THIS FEVER PITCH FOR A LONG TIME.
IT JUST CAN'T. AND I'LL TELL YOU, THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE-- REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE-- PEOPLE THAT HAVE VOTED FOR HIM, PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM, THAT ALL AGREE THIS-- THIS PACE JUST CAN'T BE SUSTAINED.
Stephen: WILL DONALD TRUMP MAKE IT ALL FOUR YEARS OF HIS TERM?
THAT'S UP TO DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN --
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU-- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, I THINK IF HE CONTINUES THE WAY HE CONTINUED THE FIRST MONTH, I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S SUSTAINABLE.
AND DON'T THINK IT WILL LAST FOUR YEARS.
Stephen: OR WILL WE JUST GET USED TO IT? WILL WE JUST BUILD A CALLOUS ON OUR SOUL? OUR SOUL WILL BEGIN TO LOOK LIKE A BIG TOE.
I THINK WE'VE ALREADY DONE THAT. I THINK WE'VE ALREADY DIED A MILLION DEATHS ALREADY THE FIRST MONTH.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS WILL STAND UP TO HIM? BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS LIKE THE REPUBLICANS FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A TIGER-- THEY CAN RIDE THE TIGER. THEY CAN SORT OF CONTROL TRUMP, GET WHAT THEY WANT, AND HOP OFF BEFORE THE TOBOGGAN HITS THE TREE. START WITH THE TIGER AND MOVED TIE TO BOGON, I REALIZED. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, THEY FEEL THEY CAN GET WHAT THEY NEED OUT OF THEM AND NOT GET HURT BY THE RIDES.
YOU GO FROM BUSES TO TOBOGGANS TO TIGERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT BUT IT'S FRIGHTENING. THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THEY'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT HOW ERRATIC HE'S BEEN. OF COURSE, THEY'D LIKE TO PASS TAX CUTS. THEY'D LIKE TO PASS REGULATORY REFORM. THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE REFORM PLAN OUT THERE, BUT THEY'RE CONCERNED. I WAS INTERVIEWING MITCH MACOBBLE McCONNELL. MITCH DON'T GIVE UP ANYTHING HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP. AND THREE OR FOUR TIMES I ASKED HIM A QUESTION, HE GAVE ME THE POLITICAL ANSWER, I WAS READY TO GO TO THE NEXT AND HE BASICALLY KEPT TALKING. AND HE SAID SOME THINGS THAT WERE VERY HEARTENING, TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRESIDENT FOCUSING HIS MESSAGE, STAYING OFF OF TWITTER, STOPPING WITH THE DISTRACTIONS.
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY LOW BAR TO FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT, THOUGH.  ( APPLAUSE ).
WELL, RIGHT NOW --
Stephen: THAT'S REALLY, THAT'S A MINIMUM--
RIGHT NOW THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.
Stephen: FUNCTIONAL DEMOCRACY IS A LOW BAR.
IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT. DID I SAY THIS-- AND I'M DEAD SERIOUS HERE-- IT HIT ME HOW GRAVE THE SITUATION WAS THIS PAST WEEKEND WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE PRESS THIS WEEKEND. BEN SASS, A REPUBLICAN FROM NEBRASKA, WHO HAS SPOKEN OUT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, TWEETEDLY THE FIRST AMENDMENT I WAS EXCITED. I RETWEETED IT AND SAID, "YEAH, GIVE IT TO HIM." I SAID, WAIT A SECOND, IN 20 SPHAENL, IT SEEMS A SUBVERSIVE ACT TO SIMPLY TWEET THE WORDS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT-- AND I'M SERIOUS-- THAT TELLS YOU WHERE WE ARE ARE RIGHT NOW. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT CORRECTS, AND I HOPE HE MAKES MORE DECISION LIKE HE MADE WITH GENERAL McMAST PERP THAT'S GOOD. I HOPE HE STAYS OFF OF TWITTER. BUT IF HE DOESN'T I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO, AGAIN, DO OUR PART AS AMERICANS.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DO SOBLOW OFF STEAM, TO RELAX YOURSELF IS YOU PLAY THE GUITAR, RIGHT?
OH, THANK GOD. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY HEROIN PROBLEM.
Stephen: NO. THAT'S THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE HERE.
I PLAY GUITAR AS WELL.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A BAND CALLED MORNING JOE MUSIC. IS THAT TRUE?
IT WAS OF THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND.
Stephen: YES.
YES.
Stephen: WOULD YOU PLAY SOMETHING FOR US RIGHT NOW?
WELL, I WOULD LOVE TO YOU. I HEAR YOU'RE AN ELVIS COSTELLO FAN.
Stephen: I'M A HUGE ELVIS COSTELLO FAN.
I LOVE ELVIS, ALWAYS HAVE, AND NEVER PLAYED, "WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT PEACE, LOVE, AND UNDERSTANDING."
Stephen: IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU HAVE REHEARSED WITH THE BAND.
GUYS, HAVE YOU HEARD THE SONG?
Jon: NOPE, NEVER HEARD IT.

Stephen: SO IT'S NOT JUST ONE COVER THIS TIME. IT'S THREE COVERS.

Stephen: NOW, I WANT TO GO OVER THESE COVERS HERE BECAUSE I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN A COUPLE OF THINGS TO ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT BUT I'M SURE YOU HAVE THE INSIDE SCOOP. SO YOU HAVE THREE COVERS SO IT'S SIX COVERS ALL TOGETHER.
I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE COUNTING IT LIKE THAT --
Stephen: THEY'RE COUNTING.

IN FIJI.
Stephen: IN FEEJ GEE YEAH.
Stephen: HAD YOU BEEN TO FIJI BEFORE?
NO, IT WAS MY FIRST TIME. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THERE. I WAS ABLE TO GO SNORKELING THE FIRST DAY. I HAVE TO SAY IT WASN'T A BAT BAD SHOO.
Stephen: NO, PRETTY NICE. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU HAVE A NECKLACE AROUND YOUR NECK, AND A NECKLACE AROUND YOUR WAIST. THERE IS NO BATH BATHING SUIT INVOLVED IN THIS SHOOT AT ALL.
YES. WHICH I GUESS IS WEIRD SINCE IT'S A SWIMSUIT MAGAZINE. IT'S REALLY FOR THE FASHION. THIS MAGAZINE IS REALLY FOR THE FASHION.
Stephen: EXACTLY. HERE'S ONE, THIS ONE, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE.
YOU DON'T WEAR A JACKET TO THE BEACH.
Stephen: I ALWAYS WEAR A JACKET TO THE BEACH. I ALWAYS WEAR A MAD DORJACKET IN CASE A BULL CHARGES ME. YOU HAVE A BATHING SUIT BOTTOM ON THERE.
YES.
Stephen: THIS ONE I PARTICULARLY LIKED. THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, THINGS REALLY GO OFF THE RAILS. ( LAUGHTER )
YELL WL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A ONE-PIECE, SO LOTS OF COVERAGE.
Stephen: IT IS. YOU REALLY HAVE TO CUT UP THOSE PLASTIC SODA CAN RINGS BEFORE YOU TOSS THEM OUT. YOU LOOK LIKE-- YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL BUT A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SEA TURTLE THAT GOT SWEPT UP IN A FISHING NET. FANTASTIC. I WANT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT. THESE ARE THREE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL COVERS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I WOULD NOT LOOK NEARLY AS GOOD IN ANY OF THESE OUTFITS. BIT DO WANT TO POINT OUT, HERE WE GO-- HERE WE GO-- HERE'S ONE OF YOUR COVERS. THIS IS THE AD ON THE BACK OF "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED." THIS CHEST OF DRAWERS IS WEARING MORE BATHING SUIT THAN YOU ARE ON THE BACK.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT NEEDS MORE COVERAGE, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT MODELING.
OKAY.
Stephen: BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT MODELING. YOU, OBVIOUSLY ARE, BLESSED WITH EXCELLENT BONE STRUCTURE AND-- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO MODELING AS WELL. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOURSELF FIT. YOU HAVE TO KNOWING IN SMG ABOUT KEEPING YOUR COMPOSE NUR ALL SITUATIONS. WHAT'S THE HARDEST THING TO DO? LIKE, WHAT'S THE HARDEST SITUATION YOU HAVE BEEN IN WHERE YOU HAVE TO SORT OF KEEP YOUR COMPOSURE AND MODEL?
I GUESS THE HARDEST SHOOT I'VE EVER BEEN ON IS PROBABLY WHEN I WENT TO ANTARCTICA WHICH WAS MY LAST COVER WITH "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED."
Stephen: I REMEMBER THAT. I THINK WE HAVE-- OKAY, YEAH, THIS IS-- THIS IS YOU IN ANTARCTICA.
ANOTHER GREAT PLACE TO WEAR A BIKINI.
Stephen: RIGHT, EXACTLY. WHY DID YOU GO TO ANTARCTICA? JUST FOR THE PENGUINS.
WELL, THAT YEAR'S MAGAZINE THEME WAS TO GO TO ALL SEVEN CONTINENTS WEARING A BIKEEN NEALL SEVEN CONTINENTS. AND I WAS THE LUCKY MOD WHOLE GOT TO GO TO ANTARCTICA.
Stephen: SO SOMEONE-- SOMEONE WENT TO FIJI THAT YEAR, TOO.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU WENT TO ANTARCTICA.
I REALLY ENVIED THEM.
Stephen: YOU ARE ENGAGED TO JUSTIN VERLANDER OF THE DETROIT TIGERS.
YES.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: NOW DO, THEY, WHEN SOMEONE SAY SUPER MODEL DO THEY JUST GO HARVEST AN ATHLETE AND DELIVER HIM TO YOU? "LET'S GET YOU SOMEBODY GOOD. HAVE VERLANDER WASHED AND BROUGHT TO HER TENT."
YES! THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENS.
Stephen: SO ARE YOU ALSO SPORTY? BECAUSE GUYS WHO ARE INTO SPORTS PROBABLY NEED SOMEBODY SPORTY. DO YOU HAVE A SPOFORT YOUR OWN?
YES, I WAS ACTUALLY A COMPETITIVE HORSE BACK RIDER.
Stephen: SO YOU COULD OUTRIDE HIM.
HE'S TERRIFIED OF HORSES.
Stephen: FOR GOOD REASON, THEY'LL GIANT AND THEY'LL BITE YOU.
DON'T BE ON HIS SIDE ABOUT THIS. HE'S SCARED.
Stephen: THEY COULD TRAMPLE HIM TO DEATH.
DOUBTFUL.
Stephen: THEY COULD! YOU'RE NOT SCARED OF HORSES AT ALL?
NO. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS. THEY'RE VERY HEALING.
Stephen:  WHO CAN SMELL FEAR.
YEAH, AND THEY SMELL IT --

HOW ARE YOU? I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE WITH YOU.
Stephen: I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. YOU HAVE BEEN IN AND ON EVERYTHING. "COMMUNITY," "THE ODD COUPLE," "THE OFFICE" "BOSTON LEGAL" "THAT 70s SHOW" "ENTOURAGE" "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM." BUT I KNOW YOU FROM "DONORS CHOOSE."
DONORS CHOOSE, THIS AMAZING CHARITY WE'RE BOTH ON THE BOARD FOR-- ( APPLAUSE ) -- HEY, DONOR CHOOSE.
Stephen: PEOPLE AT HOME-- TELL THE PEOPLE HOW IT WORKS.
DONORS CHOOSE IS A GREAT ORGANIZATION WHERE TEACHERS WHO ARE IN NEED, NEED CRAYONS OR BOOKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS SAY, "CAN YOU GIVE ME $5 FOR THIS OR $2." IT'S CALLED DONORS CHOOSE BECAUSE WE ARE THE DONORS AND WE GET TO CHOOSE.
Stephen: ANY CLASSROOM, ANY SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES.
ANY AMOUNT, ANY AMOUNT.
Stephen: INCREDIBLE.
IT'S KIND OF A LOVE LETTER TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AND WE BOTH HAVE A HEART FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.
Stephen: AND THE BEST PART IS YOU ACTUALLY GET A LETTER BACK FROM THE STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED--
YOU GET THANK YOU NOTES.
Stephen: WHO RECEIVED THE DONATIONS OR THE BOOKS OR THE CRAYONS. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE?
MY FAVORITE IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST CLASSROOM I FUNDED. THEY JUST WANTED-- THE TEACHER JUST WANTED A 64 BOX OF CRAYONS FOR EACH OF HER STUDENTS. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY IN HERE GREW UP POOR, BUT IF YOU GREW UP FOUR, THAT 64-BOX OF CRAYONS WITH ITS SHARPENER, YOU HAVE MADE IT. WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THESE BEARS, THE IDEA OF THEM EACH HAVING THEIR OWN BOX, I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS THE ONE. THIS IS THE ONE I WANT TO FUND FIRST." AND THEN I GOT ALL MY THANK YOU NOTES IN CRAYONS. "DEAR MISS BROWN, THANK YOU." GO TO DONORS CHOICE.ORG,. WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
Stephen: IT'S BEAUTIFUL. SUPPORT SCHOOLS.
YES.
Stephen: WHILE WE STILL HAVE THEM.
WHILE WE STILL HAVE THEM. BECAUSE BETSY IS DANGEROUS. SHE'S OUT THERE. SHE'S ON THE RUN DISWR YOU.
Stephen:  WERE TWEETING TODAY.
I DID TWEET TODAY.
Stephen: YOU WERE TWEETING TODAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING DOWN AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE. AND-- ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS YOUR TWEET.
YOU READ THIS ONE.
NOPE, AND NOPE. NO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NO. BETTER THAN NOT GOING DOWN. GIVE THE MAN SOME CREDIT. BETTER THAN NOT GOING DOWN.
IS IT.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
LISTEN, LISTEN, EVERYTHING IS NOT ALL BETTER BECAUSE YOU ATTACK A PICTURE IN FRONT OF MARTIN LUTHER KING. I NEED EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS IS NOT A GAME. I DON'T LIKE MY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY ONES THAT HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS FOR, YOU KNOW, CIVIL RIGHTS, TO BE USED AS PROPS. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A PRESS-- A PHOTO-OP, I NEED YOU IN FRONT OF SLAVERY OR SOMETHING REALLY GRITTY SO WHEN THEY ASK YOU A QUESTION YOU ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF SOMEONE IN CHAINS AND YOU ARE BEING REALLY HONEST ABOUT ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT BLACK AND BROWN DISPEEM DO IT IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY IN CHAINS.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, YOU-- YOU-- AS I SAID, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS, BUT YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU LIMIT YOURSELF TO P.G. ROLES.
Stephen: I DO.
WHY THE P.G.
