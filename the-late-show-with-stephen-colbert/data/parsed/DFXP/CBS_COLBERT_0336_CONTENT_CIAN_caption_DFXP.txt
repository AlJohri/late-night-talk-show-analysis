I'M A CON MAN! I'M A CON MAN. I'M A CON MAN. I LOVE DONALD TRUMP. I LOVE DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP IS A BAD PERSON. DONALD TRUMP IS A FRIEND OF PUTIN. DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT BUILD A WALL. DONALD TRUMP MANAGES TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF AN OKAY CROWD. DONALD TRUMP HAS SMALL HANDS.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES AMY SCHUMER AND GABOUREY SIDIBE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
STEPHEN: WOOOO!
STEPHEN: WHAT'S GOING ON?
JON: I SEE YOU! I SEE YOU!
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. GUESS WHO'S BACK? HILLARY CLINTON. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) JUST THIS AFTERNOON, SHE SHE EMERGED FROM THE WOODS. JUST THIS AFTERNOON, SHE APPEARED HERE IN NEW YORK AT AN EVENT HOSTED BY "WOMEN FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL." AND THE MODERATOR, CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, INTERVIEWED SECRETARY CLINTON AND ASKED HER ABOUT THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE YOUR ELECTION AS THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT HAVE SAID TO THE WORLD AND TO THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD WHO WERE LOOKING FOR VALIDATION, FOR SOMEBODY TO SHATTER THAT HIGHEST AND HARDEST CEILING?
OH, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY BIG DEAL. AND I THINK THAT UM... (  APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG DEAL. (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT IF 'IFS' AND 'BUTS' WERE CLUSTERS OF NUTS, DONALD TRUMP WOULDN'T BE PRESIDENT. CHRISTINE AMANPOUR SPOKE ABOUT SEXISM.
YOU'VE JUST SPOKEN ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THE SEXISM, THE MISOGYNY AND INEQUITY AROUND THE WORLD, BUT DO YOU BELIEVE IT EXISTS HERE STILL? AND DO YOU THINK-- (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: ASKING HILLARY CLINTON IF SEXISM EXISTS IS LIKE ASKING SERENA WILLIAMS IF SHE'S HEARD OF THIS TENNIS THING. SHE'S AWARE OF THE SITUATION. BUT THE BIG NEWS OF THE INTERVIEW WAS THAT HILLARY CLINTON EXPLAINED WHY SHE THINKS SHE LOST.
BUT I WAS ON THE WAY TO WINNING UNTIL THE COMBINATION OF JIM COMEY'S LETTER ON OCTOBER 28 AND RUSSIAN WIKILEAKS RAISED DOUBTS IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INCLINED TO VOTE FOR ME ASK YOURSELF THIS: WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO OF THE "HOLLYWOOD ACCESS" TAPE BEING MADE PUBLIC, THE RUSSIAN THEFT OF JOHN PODESTA'S EMAILS HIT WIKILEAKS. WHAT A COINCIDENCE. SO, I MEAN, YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP.
Stephen: ACTUALLY, YOU CAN MAKE UP WHATEVER YOU WANT. HAVE YOU MET OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT? HE JUST-- HE'S LIKE-- HE'S LIKE (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) STEPHEN KING. BUT HILLARY MAY HAVE ACCIDENTALLY REVEALED WHY SHE REALLY LOST.
YOU KNOW, IF THE ELECTION HAD BEEN ON OCTOBER 27, I'D BE YOUR PRESIDENT. AND IT WASN'T. IT WAS ON OCTOBER 28.
Stephen: NO, IT WAS ON NOVEMBER 8, MA'AM. THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. "WELL, OCTOBER 29 IS HERE AND I AM NOT PRESIDENT. I GUESS I'LL JUST STOP CAMPAIGNING IN MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN!" THAT'S MY IMPRESSION OF HILLARY, BY THE WAY. I WOULD HAVE WORKED ON IT MORE IF I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS IT WASNT COMEY OR PUTIN OR KEN BONE-- REMEMBER THAT GUY? SHE KNOWS WHO'S ACTUALLY TO BLAME FOR HER LOSS.
I TAKE ABSOLUTE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. I WAS THE CANDIDATE. I WAS THE PERSON WHO WAS ON THE BALLOT, AND I AM VERY AWARE OF, YOU KNOW, THE CHALLENGES, THE PROBLEMS, THE, YOU KNOW, THE SHORTFALLS THAT WE HAD.
Stephen: SO SHE MADE MISTAKES, PUBLICLY RECOGNIZED THEM, AND OWNED UP TO HER SHORTCOMINGS. NO WONDER SHE LOST. THAT'S TOTALLY UNPRESIDENTIAL. BUT I'LL SAY THIS, THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WAS SO BRUTAL-- REMEMBER, LONG, BRUTAL, ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT HAVING TRUMP IN OFFICE IS KNOWING THAT IT'S ALL BEHIND US.
THE COUNTDOWN TO 2020 IS ALREADY ON.
TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT WITH HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN AD, THE EARLIEST ONE THAT HAS EVER AIRED IN A FIRST TERM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: KILL ME. NOW, LISTEN, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR OUR PRESIDENT-- NO NEW ELECTIONS UNTIL YOU FINISH YOUR WARS. LAUGH NOW KEEP IN MIND THIS IS REALLY A CAMPAIGN AD. WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS I SAID YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. IT WAS AN ACTUAL CAMPAIGN AD PUT OUT BY "DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
DONALD TRUMP, SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT 100 DAYS AGO.
Stephen: OKAY, QUICK FACT CHECK ON THE FIRST SENTENCE. THE AD CAME OUT YESTERDAY, WHICH MEANS TRUMP WAS SWORN IN TO OFFICE 102 DAYS AGO. OR AS TRUMP WOULD PUT IT: "MY FIRST 100 DAYS HAD MORE DAYS THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT." ( LAUGHTER ) WE PACKED THEM IN. EXTRA, OKAY? WE SPRINKLED A FEW ON TOP. THAT'S COMP. WE'RE COMPING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS." ( LAUGHTER ) THEY DID MANAGE TO FIT ALL OF TRUMP'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS INTO THE 15 SECONDS.
A RESPECTED SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CONFIRMED. COMPANIES INVESTING IN AMERICAN JOBS AGAIN. AMERICA BECOMING MORE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. REGULATIONS THAT KILL AMERICAN AMERICAN JOBS ELIMINATED. THE BIGGEST TAX CUT PLAN IN HISTORY.
Stephen: SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? THEY DIDN'T SAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST TAX CUT IN HISTORY. THEY SAID IT WAS THE BIGGEST TAX "PLAN" CUT IN HISTORY. ANYONE CAN DO THAT WATCH: "I PLAN TO CUT EVERYBODY'S TAXES TO 0%." THERE, NOW I, STEPHEN COLBERT, HAVE THE BIGGEST TAX CUT "PLAN" IN HISTORY. YOU'RE WELCOME, THEORETICALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) STILL, DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE A LOT. SO WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT?
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM WATCHING THE NEWS.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM THE FAKE NEWS LIKE "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND "THE BOSTON GLOBE," WHICH ONLY GET QUOTED IN LEFT-WING PROPAGANDA LIKE THIS COMMERCIAL. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST DONE. BRACE YOURSELF. BRING IT HOME, TRUMP AD.
AMERICA IS WINNING, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
I'M DONALD TRUMP, AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
Stephen: WOW. COULD WE SEE THAT HEROIC FINAL POSE. COULD WE SEE THAT AGAIN, JIM? WWO, NOT ONLY IS HE PRESIDENT. I THINK HE'S TURNING INTO HE-MAN. "BY THE POWER OF NUMB-SKULL!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOD BLESS HIM. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD AN OFFICIAL CALL WITH PUTIN TODAY. I HEAR THE CALL WAS TENSE, BUT LET'S FACE IT. THAT'S HOW PERFORMANCE REVIEWS USUALLY GO. ( LAUGHTER ) ACCORDING TO REPORTS, ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THE TWO DISCUSSED "THE PROSPECT OF COORDINATING EXPRUGZ U.S. ACTION." OH, I THINK YOU'VE BEEN COORDINATING FOR A WHILE. ACCORDING TO THE KREMLIN, WHEN DISCUSSING NORTH KOREA, THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA CALLED FOR RESTRAINT AND AN EASING OF TENSIONS. YOU KNOW THINGS ARE BAD WHEN PUTIN IS THE VOICE OF RESTRAINT. "EH, DONALD MAKE YOU COULD COOL IT WITH THE TWEETS. IT COMES OFF AS A LITTLE CRAZY." ( APPLAUSE ) PUTIN FANS. A LOT OF PUTIN FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE HERE IN AMERICA, TH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE ATTEMPTING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE AGAIN, BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE MADE ANOTHER BIG PUSH, THEY'RE ON THE VERGE OF LOSING THE HEALTH CARE VOTE. AGAIN? IT'S LIKE LOSING THIS VOTE IS SOME KIND OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITION WITH THESE GUYS. MODERATE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT VOTING FOR TRUMPCARE BECAUSE WHILE IT TECHNICALLY COVERS PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT ALSO ALLOWS STATES TO APPLY FOR WAIVERS THAT COULD GREATLY CHANGE THE COST AND QUALITY OF THAT COVERAGE. SO IF YOU'VE GOT A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, YOU CAN TECHNICALLY GET HEALTH CARE. YOU JUST MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. LIKE HOW I CAN TECHNICALLY HIRE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN TO PLAY MY BIRTHDAY PARTY, BUT I CAN ONLY AFFORD BRICE STRINGSTONE. I LOVE HIM. I LOVE IT WHEN HE PLAYS "THUNDER LOAD." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YESTERDAY, ALABAMA REPRESENTATIVE MO BROOKS EXPLAINED THAT TRUMPCARE IS JUST MAKING INSURANCE FAIRER.
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WILL ALLOW INSURANCE COMPANIES TO REQUIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS TO CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE INSURANCE POOL THAT HELPS OFFSET ALL THESE COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING THE COST TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO LEAD GOOD LIVES. THEY'RE HEALTHY. YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE DONE THE THINGS TO KEEP THEIR BODIES HEALTHY. AND RIGHT NOW THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THINGS THE RIGHT WAY THAT ARE SEEING THEIR COSTS SKYROCKETING.
Stephen: SO HE'S SAYING GOOD PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY AND BAD PEOPLE GET SICK. WELL, THAT'S WHY BROOKS IS GOING TO PUT THIS ON HIS TOMBSTONE-- "I HAD IT COMING." YOU'RE NOT ALIVE. YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING. WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT DID YOU DO? SOMETHING. AND TRUMP'S NOT JUST TRYING TO UNDO OBAMACARE. HE'S ALSO TRYING TO UNDO OBAMALUNCH, BECAUSE HIS ADMINISTRATION IS ROLLING BACK MICHELLE OBAMA'S PUSH FOR HEALTHIER SCHOOL LUNCHES.
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: YOU COULD TELL THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THEY REPLACED HER WHITE HOUSE VEGETABLE GARDEN WITH A NACHO BAR. THAT LOOKED GOOD. YOU GUYS REMEMBER LAST MONTH WHEN TRUMP ORDERED A MISSILE STRIKE ON A SYRIAN AIR BASE? IT WAS THE MOST VIOLENT ASSAULT ON A RUNWAY NOT ORDERED BY UNITED AIRLINES. ( APPLAUSE ) IT ALL-- IT ALL-- FRIENDLY SKIES. IT ALL WENT DOWN WHILE TRUMP WAS DINING AT MAR-A-LAGO WITH THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA ENJOYING WHAT TRUMP DESCRIBED AS THE "MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN." WHICH IS WHY THE MISSION'S CODE NAME WAS "OPERATION DESSERT STORM." ( LAUGHTER ) COULD BE A MISSPELLING. COULD BE A MISSPELLING. ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, WE JUST GOT NEW DETAILS FROM COMMERCE SECRETARY AND JEFF DUNHAM PUPPET GONE ROGUE, WILBUR ROSS. ( LAUGHTER ) SECRETARY ROSS WAS SPEAKING AT A CONFERENCE YESTERDAY AND JOKED THAT THE AIRSTRIKE "WAS IN LIEU OF AFTER-DINNER ENTERTAINMENT." REALLY? WHAT WAS THE PLANNED AFTER- DINNER ENTERTAINMENT? BUSBOYS FIGHTING IN THE THUNDERDOME? STEVE BANNON UNHINGING HIS JAW AND SWALLOWING REINCE PRIEBUS FEET FIRST? AND ROSS CONTINUED HIS WHITE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR, SAYING, "THE THING WAS, IT DIDN'T COST THE PRESIDENT ANYTHING TO HAVE THAT ENTERTAINMENT." NOW, TECHNICALLY, YES, THE MISSILE STRIKE WAS $82 MILLION. BUT REMEMBER, THAT'S FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS. SO, YEAH, IT DIDN'T COST DONALD TRUMP A DIME. OR DID IT? WE'LL NEVER KNOW. OH WHAT ELSE? TRUMP WANTS TO BE ABLE TO SUE THE PRESS. HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE LAWSUITS OUT AGAINST PEOPLE WHO SAY THINGS ABOUT HIM. IN MARCH, TRUMP TWEETED,"THE FAILING @NYTIMES HAS DISGRACED THE MEDIA WORLD. GOT ME WRONG FOR TWO SOLID YEARS. CHANGE LIBEL LAWS?" OF COURSE, TRUMP HIMSELF WOULD NEVER ENGAGE IN LIBEL. JUST ASK CROOKED HILLARY OR LYIN' TED. THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH CHANGING THE LIBEL LAWS AS JONATHON KARL POINTED OUT TO REINCE PRIEBUS ON LAST WEEK'S "THIS WEEK."
CHANGE THE LIBEL LAWS. THAT WOULD REQUIRE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. IS HE REALLY GOING TO PURSUE THAT? IS THAT SOMETHING HE WANTS TO PURSUE?
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT.
Stephen: THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT? STOP THE PRESSES! SERIOUSLY, STOP THE PRESSES. AND I CAN CONFIRM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING INTO CHANGE THE FIRST AMENDMENT BECAUSE I HAVE TRUMP'S REWRITTEN VERSION OF THE CONSTITUTION RIGHT HERE: "CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW AGAINST RELIGION, EXCEPT FOR THE SCARY ONES, OR ABRIDGING THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, OR OF THE PRESS. UNLESS IT IS FAKE NEWS LIKE FAILING 'NEW YORK TIMES'! WATCH 'FOX AND FRIENDS'!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SLOW THAT DOWN. SLOW THAT DOWN A LITTLE. OH, TRUMP ALSO HAS AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE THIRD AMENDMENT HERE. "NO SOLDIER SHALL, IN TIME OF PEACE, BE QUARTERED IN ANY HOUSE, OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE PREMIER SUITE OF AN INCREDIBLE TRUMP HOTEL. THE BEST. FREE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST BEFORE 9:00 A.M. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ROOM SERVICE." ( APPLAUSE ) AND THIS SURPRISED ME. THIS NEXT ONE SURPRISE ME A LOT. TRUMP WANTS TO CHANGE THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO: "BANG! BANG! BANG! PEW! PEW! BANG! BANG!" WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. AMY SCHUMER IS HERE. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, JON, JON, OBVIOUSLY, LIKE ME, I'M SURE WHEN YOU GET HOME THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS SIT AROUND AND WAIT FOR OUR SHOW TO COME ON SO YOU CAN WATCH IT, RIGHT?
Jon: YEAH, I SIT DOWN AT THE PIANO, TURN ON THE TV, AND WATCH.
Stephen: LAST NIGHT WAS ONE OF THE RARE TIMES I DID NOT JUST WATCH OUR SHOW. I ALSO WATCHED OUR DEAR FRIEND JIMMY KIMMEL. I JUST WANT TO SAY TO ANYBODY OUT THERE, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN JIMMY'S MONOLOGUE LAST NIGHT ABOUT HIS CHILD WHO WAS WORN WITH A HEART DEFECT, AND THEY HAD TO HAVE SURGERY, AND THE FIRST SURGERY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, AND THANKFULLY HIS SON, BILLY, IS HOME WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE. PLEASE GO WATCH IT. IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, HEARTFELT STORY, AND IT'S A CALL FOR ALL PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME QUALITY HEALTH CARE BECAUSE IT IS A BASIC HUMAN NEED AND AN ASPECT OF OUR DIGNITY AS CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES. AND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL MAN. I'M SO GLAD THAT BILLY IS AT HOME AND RESTING WITH HIS MOM AND ANYWAY, CHECK IT OUT, YOU GUYS. ALSO, NEXT WEEK, I HOPE YOU'LL CHECK OUT ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL SHOW BECAUSE I'M COMING UP ON MY 20th ANNIVERSARY OF HAVING STARTED ON "THE DAILY SHOW." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) 20 YEARS! I DON'T-- I DON'T LOOK IT! ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK IT WAS JUNE 2 OF 1997. I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST DAY. BUT WE'RE NOT DOING A SHOW THAT WEEK, SO NEXT WEEK, A WEEK FROM TODAY, A BUNCH OF MY OLD BUDDIES FROM "THE DAILY SHOW" ARE GOING TO BE ON HERE, AND WE'RE GOING TO-- WE'RE GOING TO REMINISCE, WE'RE GOING TO TALK, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN. WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME COMEDY ABOUT ALL THOSE GREAT TIMES WE HAD TOGETHER. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE REALLY TALENTED. SPEAKING OF INCREDIBLY TALENTED, MY FIRST GUEST IS THE INCREDIBLY TALENTED COMEDIAN BEHIND "TRAINWRECK" AND "INSIDE AMY SCHUMER." SHE NOW STARS IN "SNATCHED."
DO YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, LIKE, SOMETHING CRAZY, OR LIKE-- DO SOMETHING AMAZING?
YEAH, I'M SURE WE CAN RUSTLE UP SOME ADVENTURE TONIGHT.
YES.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )

Stephen: IT'S A MEMOIR. YOU'RE 33 YEARS OLD. WHY WRITE ONE NOW? YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WRITE ANOTHER ONE IN 10 YEARS. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO WRITE THIS MEMOIR?
I DON'T THINK-- IT DIDN'T START OUT AS A MEMOIR. I STARTED WRITING ABOUT THINGS THAT, LIKE, BOTHERED ME, AND I REALIZED THAT THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE CHAPTER ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BOTHERED ME FELT HORRIBLE, BUT THE LAST SENTENCE FELT REALLY AMAZING. AND SO, LIKE, I REALIZED THAT I WAS GET SOMETHING, LIKE, THERAPEUTIC WORK OUT OF WRITING. AND SO I JUST KEPT DOING IT. AND THE WEIRD-- OKAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SUPER SERIOUS. BUT, ACTUALLY, YOU GUYS IT'S FUNNY. IT'S REALLY FUNNY, TOO. IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD. AND I FEEL REALLY CATHARTIC AND THERE WAS SOME STUFF I HAD TO, LIKE, GET OUT.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE GONE THROUGH, WORKED THROUGH WRITING THE BOOK THINK OTHER PEOPLE WILL READ AND SAY, "I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT? THAT HELPS ME WORK THROUGH JUST BY READING THAT." WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BOTHERED YOU?
SOME LIFE LESSONS. LIKE FOR ONE-- IT'S A WEIRD THING AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. I SPENT THREE YEARS BEING A PHONE SEX OPERATOR.
Stephen: WHAT?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE ACTING LIKE I WOULD KNOW THAT.
I MEAN, SORRY, WELL, LIKE, YEAH, I WAS A PHONE SEX OPERATOR FOR THREE YEARS, WHOLE YEARS. AND THAT'S KIND OF, LIKE, WHAT I DID RIGHT BEFORE I WAS-- LITERALLY, I GOT MY-- MY FIRST ONE WAS "PRECIOUS" AND THAT'S WHAT I DID THE DAY BEFORE I WAS FILMING "PRECIOUS."
Stephen: IT'S LIKE ACTING.
YEAH. IT WAS MY ACTING SCHOOL. SOME PEOPLE WENT TO JEWELLARD. AND I WENT TO THE PHONE.
Stephen: GOOD PROGRAM. WERE THE HOURS GOOD?
THE HOURS WERE GREAT. IT'S, LIKE, A 24-HOUR COMPANY SO YOU CAN --
Stephen: MAKE YOUR HOURS.
I DID 8:00 P.M. TO 8:00 A.M. ON SATURDAY BECAUSE YOU GET DOUBLE THE MINUTES, OKAY? THAT'S A BIG DEAL. MAKE YOUR COINS.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
WRITE THAT DOWN. "DOUBLE THE MINUTES."
Stephen: I GOT IT. YOU HAVE SOME GREAT BLURBS ON THIS. THE TOP ONE SAYS EYE DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THIS. IT MIGHT BE TOO SMALL. "YOU'RE THE BOMB, GIRL, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA." HOW DID YOU GET-- THAT'S A GREAT BLURB. HOW DOES ONE GET THE BARACK OBAMA BLURB?
FIRST OF ALL, BARACK OBAMA IS MY UNCLE BARRY, AS I CALL HIM.
Stephen: DOES HE KNOW YOU CALL HIM THAT?
HE DOES NOT. AND I'M-- I MET HIM AT THE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER, LIKE, BEFORE IT BECAME A FARCE. AND, LIKE, TWO YEARS AGO. AND HE HAD MY NAME ON A CARD. AND I WAS LIKE HI, MY NAME IS GABOUREY. AND HE SAID, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE THE BOMB, GIRL. IT SHOOK ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE IF ANYBODY SAYS THE WORD "BOMB" NEAR THE PRESIDENT-- I NEEDED THE SECRET SERVICE-- BUT HE DID SAY THAT.
Stephen: HE'S ALLOWED TO SAY THAT.
HE'S THE ONE PERSON ALLOWED TO SAY THAT, THAT CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT! ALSO LIKE, "HI, YOUR DAD SAYS YOU'RE THE BOMB," RIGHT? THAT'S SUCH A DAD THING TO SAY. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO CALL ME ALL THAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS LATER.
Stephen: HE IS LIKE A DALD.
HE'S MY UNCLE BARRY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE AN AUNT, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN AUNT WHO IS ALSO A FAMOUS FOR WORKING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHT. DOROTHY PITMAN HUGHES, AND HERE SHE IS WITH GLORIA STEINAM TAKEN IN 1971.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY COOL AUNT. THAT'S A PRETTY COOL AUNT.
YEAH, MY-- MY AUNT-- WE DISAGREE ON HOW TO PRONOUNCE THAT WORD. YOU SAY ANT. AND I SAY AUNT. WHICH ONE OF US IS THE FANCIER ONE.
Stephen: YOU SOUND FANCIER.
IT'S ME.
Stephen: DO YOU SAY VASE. OR VAUZ?
I THINK I SAY "FLOWER HOLDER" BECAUSE I DIDN'T GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. THIS IS A FLOWER HOLDER, RIGHT?
Stephen: THAT IS. THAT IS A CUP.
YOU CAN PUT A FLOWER IN IT. ARE YOU SERIOUS? DO YOU KNOW HOW FLOWERS WORK?
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE.
I GOT SO SIDETRACKED BY AUNT. ( SNORTS ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I PROMISED MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO SNORT TONIGHT.
Stephen: I LOVE A GOOD SNORT. ( SNORTS ).
STOP! OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT REALLY IS NATURAL. YOU DO THAT TO ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I'M HONORED. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE THE BOMB, GIRL. ( SNORTS ) THE BOOK IS "THIS IS JUST MY FACE:  TRY NOT TO STARE." LET LADY IS GABOUREY SIDIBE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE. JIM PARSONS, JEFF GARLIN,  AND PAUL SCHEER. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS LIEV SCHREIBER AND KELLY OSBOURNE.
