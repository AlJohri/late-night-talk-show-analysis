IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MICHAEL MOORE, SUTTON FOSTER, AND MUSICAL GUEST BLACK. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY!
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WHAT'S GOING ON! YOU'RE TOO KIND. FOLKS--  ( CHEERS ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I BEGAN MY DAY AS I OFTEN DO, BY CHECKING DONALD TRUMP'S TWITTER FEED TO SEE HOW FAR THE CRAZY HAS SPREAD. AND TODAY, I REALLY THINK HE'S OFF HIS BEDS, BECAUSE TODAY HE WENT FROM CRAZY TO CRUEL, TWEETING: WHAT? WHAT WON'T YOU ALLOW? SOCKS WITH SANDALS? DANCING? ( LAUGHTER ) PLEASE TELL ME IT'S NOT ALCOHOL. I NEEDS MY DRANK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GOTTA HAVE IT. WHAT COULD IT BE! WHAT COULD IT BE! IT TOOK HIM 10 MINUTES TO TELL US WHAT IT WAS. WHAT COULD IT BE. 10 MINUTES LATER HE TOLD US WHAT HE WON'T ALLOW INCLUDES "TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE IN ANY CAPACITY IN THE U.S. MILITARY. OUR MILITARY MUST BE FOCUSED ON DECISIVE AND OVERWHELMING..." VICTORY AND CANNOT BE BURDENED WITH THE TREMENDOUS MEDICAL COSTS AND DISRUPTION THAT TRANSGENDER IN THE MILITARY WOULD ENTAIL. THANK YOU." THANK YOU? (BLEEP). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE DOESN'T SAY IT. SORRY. WHY THE HELL WOULD HE DO THIS? THIS ISN'T EVEN ONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES. BACK IN THE CAMPAIGN HE TWEETED THIS: WHAT THE WILL DOES HE THINK THE "T" IN L.G.B.T. STANDS FOR? TRUMP? TOMATO? "I'D LIKE AN L.G.B.T. SANDWICH, HOLD THE MAYONNAISE, AND NO GAY STUFF, OKAY." ( LAUGHTER ) THE WHOLE THING-- THE WHOLE THING TOOK TRUMP-SUPPORTER CAITLYN JENNER BY SURPRISE. SHE TWEETED: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CAITLYN, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M THE FIRST PERSON TO BREAK THIS TO YOU, BUT HE'S A LIAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I KNOW-- I KNOW-- I KNOW HE SAID HE WAS YOUR FRIEND, BUT HE WAS USING YOU, GIRL. YOU DESERVE BETTER! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THOSE 15,000 TRANSGENDER TROOPS, WHO VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY, WERE MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS, PROTECTING OUR FREEDOMS, WHEN THEY ALL GOT FIRED BY TWEET. THAT'S LIKE YOUR WIFE DIVORCING YOU BY COOKIE BOUQUET. ( LAUGHTER ) AND KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS WHAT REALLY STINGS-- THEY ARE BEING REJECTED BY A RICH GUY WHO DURING VIETNAM SIDESTEPPED THE DRAFT WITH FOUR DEFERMENTS AND A MEDICAL DISQUALIFICATION FOR BONE SPURS IN HIS FOOT.
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THEY WERE MANLY BONE SPURS IN A POWERFUL DUDE FOOT, OKAY, THAT JUST GOT ALL OUCHY WHEN HE PUT IT IN A BOOT. AND SOME TRANSGENDER VETERANS ARE NOT TAKING IT, LIKE FORMER NAVY SEAL KRISTIN BECK, WHO SAID: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A NAVY SEAL. I WOULDN'T HOLD MY BREATH IF I WERE YOU. I DOUBT HE'S GOING TO SHOW. WHAT WITH THE FOOT AND ALL. AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE TREMENDOUS MEDICAL COSTS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT HEALTHCARE FOR TRANSGENDER PERSONNEL WOULD ADD BETWEEN $2.4 MILLION AND $8.4 MILLION PER YEAR TO THE MILITARY'S HEALTHCARE BUDGET. TO PUT THAT NUMBER IN PERSPECTIVE, THE MILITARY SPENDS FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ON VIAGRA. AND IF YOUR ERECTION LASTS FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS, THAT'S TOO BAD, BECAUSE YOU'RE STUCK ON A SUBMARINE FOR THE NEXT SIX MONGST. SO CLEARLY-- WHY SO MUCH VIAGRA? IS THAT WHY THEY DON'T USE BAYONETS ANYMORE? THEY JUST PUT AN EDGE ON THAT THING? JUST SHARPEN THAT THING UP TO A MIRROR POLISH. PUT THAT ONE OVER THERE. OVER THERE. SO, CLEARLY, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY OR THE MILITARY, BECAUSE THE PENTAGON SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UNAWARE THAT TRUMP HAS DECIDED TO BAR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM THE MILITARY. SO, THE PENTAGON DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. WAIT A SECOND, TRUMP SAID HE CONSULTED WITH "MY GENERALS." I KNOW, THAT MUST BE A TYPO. HE MEANT MY GENITALS. DAMN YOU, SIRI. DAMN YOU, SIRI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. SO WHY IS HE BEING A JERK? OTHER THAN PRACTICE? PROBABLY TO TRY TO DISTRACT EVERYBODY FROM THE FACT THAT REPEAL AND REPLACE IS GETTING ASS AND KICKED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, YOU GUYS REMEMBER YESTERDAY-- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. YESTERDAY-- YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT TO WATCH YESTERDAY. YESTERDAY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE SENATE REPUBLICANS CELEBRATED NARROWLY VOTING TO OPEN DEBATE ON THEIR OBAMACARE REPEAL BILL. WELL, THAT VICTORY IS ON LIFE SUPPORT ALREADY, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, THEIR PLAN TO REPLACE OBAMACARE LOT OF 43-57. BUT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS HAD A BACKUP PLAN FOR THEIR BACKUP PLAN, IT WASN'T OVER BECAUSE TODAY THE SENATE VOTED ON AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD REPEAL OBAMACARE BUT NOT TAKE EFFECT FOR TWO YEARS, GIVING LAWMAKERS TIME TO COME TOGETHER ON A REPLACEMENT PLAN BEFORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE. "GOOD NEWS, HONEY, I KNOW I PROMISED TO RE-DO THE BATHROOM. I COULDN'T AGREE ON HOW TO DO IT, SO I TORE OUT THE SINK AND THE TOILET 3 NOW, DON'T POOP FOR TWO YEARS." THEY HELD THE VOTE TODAY-- THIS AFTERNOON-- THEY HELD THE VOTE TODAY AND THEY LOST AGAIN 45-55. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT-- THAT'S FIVE TIMES. THEY LOST FIVE TIMES. BUT DON'T WORRY. THEY HAVE A BACKUP-BACKUP- BACKUP PLAN, THE SO-CALLED "SKINNY REPEAL,' WHICH I THINK IS MADE WITH SOY MILK. OH, YOU KNOW WHO COULD USE SOME ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION? MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP'S CABINET. BECAUSE HE WILL TURN ON YOU FASTER THAN AN INBRED DALMATIAN. FOR DAYS NOW, OVER A WEEK, HE'S BEEN ATTACKING ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS, WHO WAS THE FIRST SENATOR TO ENDORSE HIM DURING THE CAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: "KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE, AND DON'T BE DONALD TRUMP'S FRIEND." ( APPLAUSE ) FRIENDSHIP? FRIENDSHIP?
Jon: YEAH, FRIENDSHIP.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. THIS MORNING, TRUMP WENT AFTER JEFF SESSIONS AGAIN, TWEETING MAN THAT IS-- THAT IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. FORGET THE SWAMP-- DRAIN THAT TWEET. AND GET THIS: TRUMP LAUNCHED THAT TWITTER ATTACK WHILE SESSIONS WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AND TRUMP WAS TWEETING AT HIM FROM ANOTHER CORNER OF THE SAME BUILDING! ( LAUGHTER ) "MR. PRESIDENT, AS YOUR ATTORNEY GENERAL, I WISH TO DISCUSS AN IMPORTANT MATTER-- AND I SEE YOU HAVE RETREATED TO YOUR TWEETIN' CORNER. I RESPECTFULLY AWAIT YOUR ABUSE. WHERE IS THE SPANKING MACHINE?" ( LAUGHTER ) SO, THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN CHAOS, OKAY. NOBODY TRUSTS ANYBODY THERE. HIS HEALTHCARE PUSH IS FAILING. HIS APPROVAL RATING IS PLUMMETING. SO TO CHEER UP, HE THREW HIMSELF A RALLY IN OHIO LAST NIGHT. THAT IS JUST SAD TO SEE A GROWN MAN WHO CAN'T GO A DAY WITHOUT HEARING THE CHEERS OF AN ADORING CROWD. AM I RIGHT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S RIDICULOUS.
Stephen: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT IS, OBVIOUSLY, A JOKE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ALSO A GREAT REPLACEMENT FOR VIAGRA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT RALLY LAST NIGHT, BECAUSE TODAY TRUMP TWEETED: "THE CROWD IN OHIO WAS AMAZING LAST NIGHT-- BROKE ALL RECORDS." YES, IT WAS THE LARGEST CROWD EVER ASSEMBLED AT THE 6,000-PERSON CAPACITY COVELLI CENTRE. SO, I ASSUME THEY BROKE THE RECORD FOR "MOST 6,000"? BUT REMEMBER, HE SAID IT "BROKE ALL RECORDS." I ASSUME HE HAD THE WORLD'S TALLEST, LONGEST FINGERNAILS GUY, THE FAT MOTORCYCLE TWINS. ALSO, SOMEHOW IT WAS THE HIGHEST GROSSING BOLLYWOOD FILM OF ALL TIME. TRUMP TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER HIS CRITICS.
SOMETIMES THEY SAY HE DOESN'T ACT PRESIDENTIAL. IN FACT, I SAID, "IT IS MUCH EASIER, BY THE WAY, TO ACT PRESIDENTIAL THAN WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TONIGHT, BELIEVE ME.
Stephen: BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TONIGHT IS AN ABSOLUTE EMBARRASSMENT TO THE OFFICE. BELIEVE ME. THIS IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL AT ALL. ( APPLAUSE ) AND, OF COURSE, AS TO BE EXPECTED, DONALD TRUMP WAS VERY HUMBLE ABOUT HIS PLACE IN HISTORY.
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LATE, GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY PRESIDENT THAT HAS EVER HELD THIS OFFICE.
Stephen: "MORE PRESIDENTIAL!" NO.
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN WASHINGTON, WHO INVENTED THE PRESIDENCY. WHO WON THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. AND FOR THE RECORD HE DID IT WITH BONE SPURS IN HIS MOUTH. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, MICHAEL MOORE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, THE MOOCH! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MATTY RICE ON GUITAR SINGING OVER THERE RIGHT NOW. GIVE IT UP FOR MATTY RICE. I WISH YOU SANG MORE. YOU'VE GOT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. I WANT TO HEAR YOU SING MORE, PLEASE.
ASK THE BIG MAN?
Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, WE ARE STILL GETTING TO KNOW NEWLY HIRED WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND MAN WHO'S "WALKING HERE," ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. EEEH! THIS MORNING, HE DESCRIBED WHAT KIND OF GUY HE IS ON "FOX & FRIENDS."
WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT WASHINGTON IS PEOPLE DO NOT LET YOU KNOW HOW THEY FEEL. THEY'RE VERY NICE TO YOUR FACE, AND THEN THEY TAKE A SHIV OR A MACHETE, AND THEY STAB IT IN YOUR BACK. I DON'T LIKE IT. I'M A WALL STREET GUY, AND I'M MORE OF A FRONT-STABBING PERSON ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HE'S A FRONT-STABBER. FINALLY, SOMEONE BEN CARSON CAN RELATE TO. ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, THE MOOCH THREATENED TO FIRE HIS WHOLE DEPARTMENT, SAYING, "THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM CAN STAY IN THE ROOM. THEY HAVE TO STOP LEAKING. IF THEY DON'T STOP LEAKING, I'M GOING TO PUT THEM OUT ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. YOU WANT TO SELL POSTCARDS TO THE TOURISTS OUTSIDE THE GATE, OR DO YOU WANT TO WORK IN THE WEST WING?" HMM. THAT'S A TOUGH CHOICE. PEOPLE WHO SELL POSTCARDS DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY, BUT THEY ALSO RARELY GET SUBPOENAED. I'M NOT SURE... A COIN TOSS.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) BUT THEN-- ♪ ♪ ♪ BUT THEN SOMEONE LEAKED THAT THE MOOCH WAS TRYING TO FIRE A PRESS AIDE NAMED MICHAEL SHORT. APPARENTLY, EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNEW, EXCEPT MICHAEL SHORT, WHO SAID, "NO ONE HAS TOLD ME ANYTHING, AND THE ENTIRE PREMISE IS FALSE." WHICH IS ALSO THE TITLE OF THE G.O.P.'S NEW HEALTHCARE BILL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT-- BUT-- BUT TURNS OUT, BY THE END OF THE DAY, MICHAEL SHORT WAS GONE. BUT SCARAMUCH WAS ENRAGED ABOUT THE LEAK SAYING: ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I'M SORRY, I MISSED THAT IN C.C.D. I'M A ROMAN CATHOLIC. WHAT IS THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE AGAINST LEAKING THAT SOMEONE'S GETTING FIRED? "OKAY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT LIKE JESUS: GET EVERYONE TOGETHER AT DINNER AND SAY 'SOMEONE AT THIS TABLE WILL BETRAY ME. IT'S YOU JUDAS. HOW ABOUT SOME FRONT-STABBING?! OKAY! GA! ♪ ♪ ♪ THIS IS MY BODY, THIS IS MY KNIFE!'" BUT LISTEN-- THE MOOCH WAS CLEAR, OKAY. LEAKERS MUST GO. AND I HAVE FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK BY GOOGLING IT. TURNS OUT THE INITIAL LEAK OF THAT SHORT WAS GOING TO GET FIRED CAME FROM A POLITICAL ARTICLE WHOSE SOURCE WAS SCARAMUCCI. MOOCH! NO, MOOCH! THE LEAK IS COMING FROM INSIDE YOUR OWN SKULL! IT'S STABBING TIME! ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, TODAY THE MOOCH SAT DOWN WITH CHRIS CUOMO AND REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRING.
DID THE PRESIDENT TELL YOU, "GET RID OF THIS GUY, HE'S ONE OF THE LEAKERS"?
I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
WHY?
BECAUSE I JUST SAID I WASN'T GOING TO ANSWER IT.
I KNOW, BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO BEING STRAIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED TO "I'M NOT GONNA OBFUSCATE?"
I'M STRAIGHTLY, STRAIGHTLY NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: "HEY, I'M AN OPEN BOOK. OKAY? THE PAGES ARE BLANK, AND THE TITLE IS 'BOOK.' YOU FIGURE IT OUT." OKAY, LET ME STRAIGHTEN OUT SOMETHING. HEY, IS THAT STRAIGHT ENOUGH FOR YOU? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS LOADED. THE MOOCH WENT ON TO DEFEND TRUMP'S TREATMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL AND MAN TRYING TO ORDER ONE MORE CHEDDAR BAY BISCUITS, JEFF SESSIONS.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A VERY TOUGH SKIN TO WORK FOR AND DEAL WITH THE PRESIDENT. BUT IF HE RESPECTS YOUR TOUGHNESS AND HE RESPECTS YOUR HONESTY AND YOUR LOYALTY, SOMEBODY SAID, AS YOU GUYS WERE ENTERING THIS EIGHT-HOUR SEGMENT, THAT THE LOYALTY FOR THE PRESIDENT IS ONE-SIDED. THAT'S ABSOLUTE NONSENSE, OKAY? HE IS A SYMMETRICAL LOYALIST, FOR SURE. IF YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM, HE'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.
Stephen: "YEAH, YOU KNOW, ONE TINY HAND WASHES THE OTHER. OKAY? YOU SCRATCH MY BACK, I STAB YOUR FRONT." ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MICHAEL MOORE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN OSCAR-WINNING DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, BESTSELLING AUTHOR, AND NOW A BROADWAY STAR. PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL MOORE! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MAN!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YES, THANK YOU.
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. OUR THEATER IS ON BROADWAY HERE, AND NOW YOU'RE OPENING ON BROADWAY. HOW DO YOU LIKE WORKING ON THE GREAT WHITE WAY?
ACTUALLY, MY PRODUCTION OFFICE, WE'RE ALSO MAKING ANOTHER FILM RIGHT NOW, IS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM YOU.
Stephen: ON BROADWAY.
RIGHT HERE. LITERALLY, WE'RE LIKE FIVE FLOORS-- I CAN ACTUALLY-- EVERY DAY WE LOOK DOWN INTO YOUR OFFICE.
Stephen: MY OFFICE?
AND YOUR WRITER S.
Stephen:  I'VE GOT TO GET SOME PANTS ON!
NO, YOU'RE FINE. YOU'RE FINE.
Stephen: I'M OKAY.
YOU'RE FINE. IT'S THE WRITERS, THEY OCCASIONALLY END UP ON THE ROOF.
Stephen: WE HAVE A ROOF-- WE HAVE A ROOF DECK WE GO ON.
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT PUTTING THIS ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE UP THERE PASSING A MARLBOROUGH AROUND OR SOMETHING. I'M NOT --
Stephen: THEY CAN ONLY AFFORD ONE CIGARETTE AT A TIME, STRANGELY. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW WHY. WE HAVE TO PAY THEM MORE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WHAT IS IT, THOUGH, ABOUT THIS CORNER YOU AND I ARE ON. THE DRILLING EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY THERE'S SOME CRAZY DRILLING.
Stephen: I THINK IT'S TRUMP'S FRIENDS IN THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS. THEY JUST GOT-- THERE'S A GUY JACKHAMMERING UP 15 FLOORS UP NEAR MY HEAD ALL THE TIME.
YOU HEAR IT EVERY DAY.
Stephen: THAT'S ALL I HEAR. I HEAR IT RIGHT NOW WHEN WE'RE ON AIR. LISTEN, BUDDY, WE HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU IN A WHILE. LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON SOMETHING. TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN. HE ANNOUNCED IT TODAY JUST BY FIAT, LIKE, DIDN'T TALK TO ANYBODY, DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY, NO LAWYERS, DIDN'T TALK TO THE MILITARY. JUST GOT UP THIS MORNING AND SAID, "YOU KNOW, LET'S GET THOSE FOLKS," AND JUST TWEETED IT AND THERE'S NO IMPLICATION OF WHAT IT MEANS. NO ONE KNOWS. NOBODY ANSWERED ANY QUESTIONS. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS THREAT EVERYONED TO SHUT DOWN THE BRIEFING TODAY IF ANYBODY ASKED ABOUT IT.
WHAT IS SO DISGUSTING ABOUT THIS, IF YOU ARE TRANSGENDER TRYING TO GET BY IN THIS SOCIETY, I COULDN'T THINK OF ANY MORE BRAVE PEOPLE TO HAVE DEFENDING THIS COUNTRY THAN TRANSGENDERS BECAUSE EVERY DAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'VE GOT-- I MEAN--
Stephen: WHAT DO THEY DO NOW? THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF TRANSGENDER SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN, WHAT DO THEY DO NOW?
THEY SHOULD REFUSE TO LEAVE. SERIOUSLY, 15,000-- ( APPLAUSE ) JUST SAY, "WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. COME GET US." LET HIM GO. LET HIM GO AS THE COMMANDER-- ACTUALLY --
Stephen: THEY HAVE A LOT OF WEAPONS. THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF WEAPONS.
WHAT WE HAVE IS A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO IS TRANSSIBERIAN. THAT'S MAYBE THE BIGGER PROBLEM.
Stephen: JEFF SESSIONS IS GETTING A LOT OF HEAT FROM THE PRESIDENT.
YEAH, WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE HE WAS HIS, LIKE, MAIN POLICY ADVISER, HIS BEST FRIEND IN THE CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: A LOT OF HIS EARLY STAFF WAS SESSIONS STAFF.
BEFORE THERE WAS TRUMPISM, THERE WAS SESSION-ISM. BEFORE THAT IT WAS JUST CALLED RACISM, BUT YOU KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT MAKES YOU QUESTION WHETHER ANYBODY WOULD TRUST DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE POLITICS IS ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW, "I DO A FAVOR, YOU DO ME A FAVOR." BUT TRUMP SAY LITTLE BIT MORE "YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND STABBING TIME."
YEAH.
Stephen: A YEAR AGO YOU WROTE AN OPEN LETTER PREDICTING DONALD TRUMP WOULD WIN. WHEN NO ONE ELSE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WIN, YOU SAID, "NO, I THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN." SO, FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS?
NO, NO.
Stephen: YOU WERE RIGHT.
NO, I'VE NEVER WANTED TO BE MORE WRONG IN MY LIFE. WELL, I LIVE IN MICHIGAN.  ( CHEERS ) RIGHT, SO I WAS TRYING TO WARN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, OUT HERE, PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR OBAMA WERE TELLING ME THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM. AND IT WAS LINING OH, WOW. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY CONTACTED THE PEOPLE IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND SAID, "I THINK YOU NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME IN MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA. THESE ARE THE BREXIT STATES OF AMERICA. AND THERE'S A LOT OF ANGRY PEOPLE. THEY DON'T SORT OF LIKE TRUMP THAT MUCH, BUT THEY SEE HIM AS THEIR HUMAN MOLOTOV COCKTAIL THAT THEY WANT TO JUST THROW INTO THE SYSTEM THAT HAS HURT THEM SO BADLY. AND I COULDN'T GET ANYBODY TO LISTEN TO MOW.
Stephen: BUT YOU WERE SO PRESCIENT ABOUT HIM WINNING, NOW THAT HE'S BEEN PRESIDENT FOR ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS, HAS HE MET YOUR EXPECTATIONS? LIKE, IS THIS WHAT YOU THOUGHT-- I MEAN, HIGH OR LOW EXPECTATIONS, THIS IS WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE?
I AM AMAZED AT-- I KNEW WE WOULD GET HIT A LOT BY ALL THE THINGS HE WAS GOING TO DO. I DID NOT EXPECT A DAILY, HOURLY FIRE HOSE OF (BLEEP) IN OUR FACE.  ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, IT WAS JUST-- IT'S ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER THAT --
Stephen: YOU DO-- YOU DO WANT TO READ THE NEWS WITH A SNORKEL. ( LAUGHTER ).
YES. AND SOME WET WIPES. BUT IT'S-- BUT THE THING, IS I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN AMAZING IS THAT-- IS THAT WHILE HE, OBVIOUSLY, GETS DISTRACTED, WE ALL LIKE TO LAUGH AT HIM WITH THE SHINY KEYS AND HE'S OFF ON SOMETHING ELSE, HE ALSO, THOUGH, HAS HIS SHINY KEYS AND WE GET DISTRACTED BY THEM. SO HE GOES OFF ON MIKA OR JOE, OR WHATEVER THE TWEET IS THAT MORNING. AND THEN LATER IN THE DAY IS DOING SOMETHING TO OUR NATIONAL PARKS, OR IS ENDING FUNDING TO KEEP THE GREAT LAKES CLEAN OR THESE OTHER THINGS. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T GET DISTRACTED TOO MUCH BY HIS SHINY KEYS AND STAY ON TOP OF THIS.  ( APPLAUSE ) IN A WAY THAT-- IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
Stephen: NOW, YOU'VE GOT YOUR BROADWAY SHOW RIGHT NOW. IT IS CALLED MICHAEL MOORE ON BROADWAY "THE TERMS OF MY SURRENDER." SO IS THIS YOU GIVING UP? ARE YOU-- ARE YOU WAVING THE WHITE FLAG AND SAYING THIS IS HOW THE WORLD IS NOW?
NO, YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE WRONG WORD. NOT "SURRENDER" IT'S "TERMS." WHAT ARE MY TERMS.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF MICHAEL MOORE'S SURRENDER.
YOU HAVE TO COME SEE THE SHOW. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. I WILL SAY THIS. I WILL SAY THIS. I REFUSE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT AND I'M NOT LEAVING. SO SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: VOTE. YOU-- THREE AND A HALF MORE YEARS.
WELL --
Stephen: DO YOU THINK HE MAKES IT ANOTHER THREE AND A HALF YEARS.
OH, I, I ACTUALLY-- I LIVE WITH THE ATTITUDE-- AND I'M SORRY TO-- I DON'T MEAN TO GO DARK ON YOU HERE. BUT JUST THINK OF-- YOU ALL KNOW YOUR AGE RIGHT NOW. HOW OLD ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN 2025? THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE YOUR, OUR PRESIDENT IN THE YEAR 2025 AT THAT AGE THAT YOU'RE AT. RIGHT. WE DON'T WANT TO THINK THAT. BUT WE WERE ALSO A YEAR AGO SITTING HERE-- NOT MYSELF BUT OTHER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, "THERE'S NO WAY HE'S GOING TO WIN. THERE'S NO WAY. HILLARY'S GOT THIS IN THE BAG." THEY WERE ALREADY POPPING THE CHAMPAGNE CORKS AND CELEBRATING. WE HAVE TO FORM AN ARMY OF CITIZENS AND COME AT HIM LIKE A SWARM OF BEE WHERE'S IT'S HE'S GETTING HIT ONE WAY, ALL THE WAY.  ( APPLAUSE ) , AND, FRANKLY, I SUGGESTED A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT WE HAVE AN ARMY OF SATIRE, BECAUSE I THINK THE WAY TO BRING HIM DOWN IS WITH SATIRE. HIS THIN SKIN, AS YOU POINTED OUT SO WELL, IS SO THIN, ALL WE NEED IS 1,000 OR A MILLION LITTLE COMEDY SHIVS-- NONVIOLENT, DON'T HURT HIM, UNDER HIS SKIN BECAUSE HE CAN'T TAKE BEING LAUGHED AT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON "FOX & FRIENDS." THAT'S ALL HE WATCHES.
HE'S WATCHING YOU STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I REALLY DON'T THINK SO.
NO, NO, NO, AND I'LL TELL YOU AND THE ARMY OF SATIRE, WE ALREADY HAVE GIVEN OUR FIRST MEDAL OF HONOR TO MELISSA McCARTHY, "BECAUSE SHE'S TAKEN DOWN THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL WITH SATIRE ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: PLEASE COME BACK.
I WILL. AND, ACTUALLY, I HAVE, IN MY BROADWAY SHOW, A LITTLE TALK SHOW EACH NIGHT FOR 10 MINUTES. AND I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD COME ON MY SHOW JUDGE.
Stephen: DONE.
IT'S JUST DOWN THE BLOCK.
Stephen: "THE TERMS OF MY SURRENDER" IS IN PREVIEWS THIS FRIDAY AND OPENS AUGUST 10. MICHAEL MOORE, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SUTTON FOSTER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

I WAS THE UNDERSTUDY TURNED STAR. I DID "THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE" BACK 15 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: YOU WERE THE UNDERSTUDY FOR THE LEAD.
I WAS THE UNDERSTUDY FOR THE LEAD AND OUT OF TOWN THE LEAD GOT SICK AND I CAME IN AND TOOK OVER THE PART --
Stephen: THAT'S A MOVIE.
YEAH, AND THEN THEY OFFERED ME THE PART AND THEN I WON A TONY.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SHOULD REALLY PLAY YOU IN THE MOVIE ABOUT THIS. THAT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU DREAM WHEN YOU'RE A KID OF HAPPENING.
YEAH, BUT YOU NEVER-- YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T, LIKE, THROW MARBLES OR TAKE HER DOWN. IT WAS LIKE ALL --
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T "TANYA HARDING" HER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO THAPPENED NATURALLY IN A WEIRD WAY.
Stephen: DID YOU GROW UP DREAMING OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
NOT THAT SPECIFICALLY.
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?
