A REAL MOMENT IN THE YOUNG PRESIDENCY OF DONALD TRUMP, HIS FIRST BIG TRIP TO ASIA. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TRUMP'S ASIAN ADVENTURE. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES: RONAN FARROW. WALTER ISAACSON. AND MUSICAL GUEST KELSEA BALLERINI, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: HEY, HOW ARE YOU? HAPPY FRIDAY! HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY! WHAT'S GOING OCHRIS?  ( APPLAUSE ) I'M GOING TO GET YOU. I'M GOING TO GET YOU. PERFECT! SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE TOO LOVELY. THAT IS-- THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF A FRIDAY CROWD RIGHT THERE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PUT THAT IN WEBSTERS. TAKE A PHOTO, PUT IT IN WEBSTER'S. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S FRIDAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP LEFT TODAY FOR A BIG 12-DAY DIPLOMATIC TRIP THROUGH ASIA. HE'LL BE GOING TO JAPAN, CHINA, SOUTH KOREA, THE PHILIPPINES AND VIETNAM-- BECAUSE I GUESS THOSE BONE SPURS HAVE FINALLY HEALED UP. THIS IS-- WE DON'T KNOW. MAY HAVE TO CANCEL AT THE LAST MOMENT, GET A STUDENT DEFERMENT. THIS IS GOING TO BE TRUMP'S LONGEST TRIP AS PRESIDENT. SOME PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE WORRIED IT'S SO LONG, WHICH IS WHY AIDES HAVE TRIED TO KEEP THE BRIEFINGS SHORT, TO AVOID OVERLOADING THE PRESIDENT WITH DETAILS. "OKAY, MR. PRESIDENT, FOCUS UP. THIS IS A MAP OF CHINA, WHERE THEY MAKE THAT PHONE YOU JUST STARTED TWEETING ON. AND WE'VE LOST HIM. SOMEBODY HAVE ANY FRIED CHICKEN TO WAVE UNDER HIS NOSE? LUCKILY JAPAN HAS HIS OWN PLANS TO KEEP TRUMP HAPPY-- WHEN HE VISITS-- WE ARE NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE ELECT MEETING WITH THIS TOP DIPLOMAT ♪ I HAVE A PEN. I HAVE AN APPLE. APPLE PEN. ♪ I HAVE A PEN. I HAVE PINEAPPLE. UH, PINEAPPLE PEN ♪
HE IS PLANNING ON MEETING PIKOTARO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PERSON WITH A SMALL VOCABULARY AND A LIMITED GRASP OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. ALSO A JAPANESE SINGER. IT'S A FAMILY JOKE. A QUALITY JOKE. OKAY, OKAY. EXPLAIN IT TO ME AGAIN.
I HAVE A PEN. I HAVE AN APPLE. I'M LOST. WALK ME THROUGH IT AGAIN. I'M SORRY, PIKACHU. WALK ME THROUGH IT AGAIN. SO WHY, EXACTLY, IS TRUMP MEETING WITH THIS GUY? WELL, THEY GO WAY BACK. LAST YEAR, A WEEK AFTER TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, IVANKA TRUMP POSTED A VIDEO OF HER DAUGHTER SING, THE SONG, AND THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT SAW THIS VIDEO. SO, A FEW WEEKS LATER, DURING THEIR FIRST MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER, TALKING ABOUT "PEN PINEAPPLE APPLE PEN" HELPED BREAK THE ICE BETWEEN TRUMP AND PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE. THAT'S NO SURPRISE. NOVELTY SONGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG PART OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. WHO CAN FORGET REAGAN'S STIRRING WORDS?
MR. GORBACHEV, IN THE WORDS OF A GREAT AMERICAN, ALBERT YANKOVIC: EAT IT, EAT IT. GIVE YOURSELF AN EGG AND BEAT IT. ALSO, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: AFTER-- WE MISS YOU, RONNIE. WE MISS YOU.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A GONE MAN. AFTER THAT SUCCESS, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT EVEN PRODUCED THIS VIDEO EARLIER THIS YEAR TO COURT IVANKA AND DONALD'S GOOD GRACES: ♪ I HAVE A PEN. I HAVE AMERICA ♪ UH, AMERICA PEN. I HAVE A PEN. I HAVE A JAPAN. UH, JAPAN PEN. ♪ AMERICA PEN JAPAN PEN UH, PEN BEST FRIEND PEN!
Stephen: I HAVE A FACE. I HAVE A PALM. UGH, FACE-PALM.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT IS CATCHY. IT'S CATCHY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SPEAKING OF THE worldwideonline.com INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY-- EMOJIS, OKAY. TURNS OUT, THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING ALL THE NEW EMOJIS, AND IT'S CALLED "THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM," WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THE CRIME SYNDICATE IN A BOND MOVIE. "WELL, WELL, MR. BOND, YOUR ATTEMPTS TO STOP THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM HAVE FAILED. AND NOW IT SEEMS YOU ARE IN DEEP POOP EMOJI."  (  LAUGHTER  ) LAST YEAR--  (  LAUGHTER  ) -- I REPORTED THAT THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM WAS WORKING ON A NEW EMOJI, A FACE WITH WOON RAISED EYEBROW, OR, AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM HIMSELF CALLED IT, THE COLBERT EMOJI. THAT'S RIGHT! YEAH, YEAH!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT? THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS YOU? YEAH! THEY LIKE IT. THAT'S RIGHT! BECAUSE I AM THE ONLY CELEBRITY EVER TO RAISE ONE EYEBROW.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHOA! GET IT UP, BOY!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GET THAT I THINK UP THERE!
Stephen: PUT THAT THING DOWN, DWAYNE "THE ROCK" JOHNSON, OR I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT. BUT HERE'S THE THING-- WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE COLBERT EMOJI FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW. THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL FOR "FACE WITH ONE RAISED EYEBROW" WAS SUBMITTED TO THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM IN 2015. EVER SINCE THEN, IF I WANTED A LITTLE PICTURE OF ME, I HAD TO USE ANY CLIP ART BUSINESSMAN. WHAT'S TAKING THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM SO LONG? WERE THEY TOO BUSY WITH THEIR CURRENT EMOJIS LIKE TRAIN, LOCOMOTIVE, MONORAIL, LIGHT RAIL, AND HIGH-SPEED TRAIN, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HIGH-SPEED TRAIN WITH A BULLET NOSE. I MEAN, COULD THERE BE ANY MORE TRAIN EMOJIS? YES, BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO THERE'S METRO, TRAM, TRAM CAR, RAILWAY CAR, MOUNTAIN RAILWAY, SUSPENSION RAILWAY, AND OF COURSE, TRAIN STATION, FEATURING A TRAIN.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ALL OF THAT, AND STILL NO COLBERT EMOJI? WELL, I GUESS THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM IS SLOW MOVING AND OFTEN DERAILED. I JUST WISH THERE WAS AN EMOJI FOR THAT. WELL GUESS WHAT, EVERYBODY, WAKE UP YOUR THUMBS, BECAUSE THE COLBERT EMOJI IS FINALLY HERE. APPLE'S LATEST-- ONE WOULD HOPE! ONE WOULD HOPE!  ( APPLAUSE ) APPLE'S LATEST-- APPLE'S LATEST iPHONE UPDATE INCLUDES THIS BEAUTY: BOOM!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JIMMY, CAN WE PUT IT UP SPLITSCREEN?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHECK IT OUT! YE. JUST-- LOOK AT THAT. JUST CUT OFF MY NOSE AND DIP ME IN YELLOW PAINT, AND I DEFY YOU TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE! UNICODE SAYS THE COLBERT EMOJI CONVEYS "SKEPTICISM, ACCOMPANIED BY THE CONCEPTS OF DISAPPROVAL AND MILD SURPRISE." OH, REALLY?  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, THE COLBERT EMOJI IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP-- AND, LET'S SAY, SAMSUNG SMART REFRIGERATORS. SO GET OUT THERE AND USE IT. BUT, PLEASE, KEEP YOUR EGGPLANTS AWAY FROM MY FACE. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER WHO HELPED TAKE DOWN HARVEY WEINSTEIN, RONAN FARROW IS HERE! PLEASE STICK AROUND.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, TO THIS FINE FRIDAY HERE AT "THE LATE SHOW"." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS AN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST WHOSE REPORTING AT "THE NEW YORKER" HELPED SHAPE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. PLEASE WELCOME RONAN FARROW. ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
LOVELY TO SEE YOU
Stephen: NOW, FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, YOU WORKED ON A STORY ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN IN HIS ORBIT FOR HOW LONG?
MORE THAN 10 MONTHS
Stephen: 10 MONTHS. AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE OCTOBER 23 EDITION OF "THE NEW YORKER" RIGHT HERE. AND THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER "THE NEW YORK TIMES TIMES--" JODI KANTOR, PUBLISHED THEIR EXPOSE OF WEINSTEIN
EXCELLENT REPORTING
Stephen: NOW IT HAS BECOME A NATIONAL CONVERSATION
THAT'S RIGHT
Stephen: ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE AND THE ABUSE OF POWER AND SWUL CONTEXT, OF POWERFUL MEN AGAINST WOMEN AND OTHER MEN. DID YOU THINK AHEAD OF TIME WHEN YOU WERE WORKING ON THIS, THAT IT WOULD EXTEND BEYOND THE WEINSTEIN STORY?
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION A LOT, AND THE ANSWER IS YOU HEAR AN N.Y.P.D. RECORDING OF A GUY OF THAT PROFILE ADMITTING TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOU KNOW VERY QUICKLY IT'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT STORY. BUT THAT SAID, THIS MOVEMENT OF THE CASCADE OF WOMEN IN GYMNASTICS, WOMEN IN ANIMATION, WOMEN IN EVERY INDUSTRY COMING FORWARD AND SAYING, "ENOUGH," THAT IS SOMETHING I NEVER COULD HAVE COUNT ON
Stephen: NOW, WHEN YOU WERE WORKING ON THE STORY, WEINSTEIN IS A VERY POWERFUL MAN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT, IN THE MEDIA WORLD IN GENERAL, AND HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO USE HIS POWER-- NOT JUST IN THESE SEXUAL SITUATIONS. ONE OF THE FEW THINGS I KNEW ABOUT HARVEY WERE BOOTSTOMPING REPORTER ON, YOU KNOW, OUTSIDE OF A PREMIERE BECAUSE HE ASKED AN ACTRESS THE WRONG QUESTION, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND HE WAS KNOWN FOR THIS SORT OF MONSTROUS BEHAVIOR. DID YOU HAVE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, AND COLLEAGUES WARN YOU OFF AND SAY, "DON'T DO THIS. AFTER NOT GOING TO BE WORTH IT FOR YOU TO DO THIS STORY."
YEAH, LOOK, THERE WERE MULTIPLE MOMENTS WHEN PEOPLE AROUND ME WOULD SIT ME DOWN AND SAY, LOOK, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO KEEP GOING WITH THIS." THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE AND IT WAS NOT JUST DIRECTED AT ME. IT WAS DIRECTED AT A LOT OF REPORTER GLRPZ YOU THREATENED BY WEINSTEIN HIMSELF.
I WAS THREATENED BY HIS LAWYER AND INTERMEDIARIES DID A LOT OF THREATENING AND MENACING STATEMENTS
Stephen: LIKE, "YOU'LL NEVER WORK AGAIN" AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO PRIVATE COMMUNICATION, BUT, YEAH, MENACING STUFF. YOU HEARD OF HOW HE BEHAVES. YOU GET THE IDEA. FUNDAMENTALLY IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT ON THE EARLY REPORTING ON THIS THIS WAS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. YOU CAN'T STOP GOING IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S MAYBE AN ONGOING PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR THAT'S ENDANGERING PEOPLE  ( APPLAUSE )
YES. CHEER FOR THE WOMEN WHO TALKED, YOU KNOW
Stephen: MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID, "LISTEN, IF YOU'RE IN HOLLYWOOD, YOU KNEW THAT HE DID THIS." BUT COULD IT BE THAT-- AND BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A FEAR OF REPRISAL, THAT IT DID NOT BUBBLE UP, YOU KNOW, TO THE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS, JUST BECAUSE THE PRESSURE WAS SO GREAT NOT TO FACE IT?
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE, A VAST MACHINE OF LEGAL INSTRUMENT, P.R. INSTRUMENTS THAT WOMAN AFTER WOMAN TALKED ABOUT BEING CHALLENGED BY AS THEY SOUGHT TO COME FORWARD
Stephen: NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS.
NONDISCLOSER AGREEMENTS A HUGE PART OF IT AND AN AREA OF LAW THAT IS NOW BEING LOOKED AT, SAYING THERE SHOULD BE RESTRICTIONS ON ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PURCHASE SILENCE ON SEXUAL ASSAULT  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I AGREE, IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S ANTI-FIRST AMENDMENT
YOU KNOW, THE THING THAT WAS STRIKE TO ME, TOO, THERE WAS THIS PARTICULARLY UGLY AND POWERFUL MACHINE AIMED AT SECURING SILENCE. BUT, ALSO, THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF REASONS YES SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS DON'T COME FORWARD IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE, YOU KNOW, WHETHER A WOMAN IN A BLUE-COLLAR JOB OR A WOMAN IN HOLLYWOOD. THERE ARE THE SAME PROFOUNDLY PERSONAL REASONS WHY IT IS SOMETIMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO COME FORWARD, YOU KNOW THEY FEAR CAREER REPERCUSSIONS, THEY FEAR WHAT THEIR FAMILIES WILL THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MOST INSPIRING TO ME WAS AFTER HEARING ABOUT THIS WALL OF FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES SAYING, "DON'T TALK," HEARING ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONS AND HOW POWERFUL THOSE WERE. WHEN SOMEONE SAID, "ACTUALLY, YOU CAN DO THIS AND THAT CAN BE HEALING AND THAT CAN HELP OTHERS."
Stephen: YOU WERE DOING THIS ORIGINALLY FOR NBC. AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BROADCAST THE REPORT THAT YOU HAD COME UP WITH, SO YOU TOOK IT TO "THE NEW YORKER." HOW MUCH SOONER WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IF NBC HAD BROADCAST? WHEN WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE ON?
YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE STORY FOR A LONG TIME. A LOT OF EXPLOSIVE THINGS WERE EARLY IN THE REPORTING PROCESS. THERE MAY BE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE NBC PIECE OF THIS WITH TIME. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THIS MOMENT WHERE THIS FLOOD OF WOMEN IS STILL, YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH IN PROGRESS. PEOPLE ARE COMING FORWARD, AND THEY'RE DOING A BRAVE THING, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON THEM
Stephen: SO JULY...  (  LAUGHTER  )
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST A LINE. I'M LEARY OF, YOU KNOW, NOBODY WANTS TO BECOME THE STORY WHEN YOU'RE A REPORTER
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. BUT IT IS PART OF THE STORY-- PART OF THIS STORY IS THE STORY NOT BEING TOLD FOR SO LONG AND YOU EXPERIENCED THE STORY NOT BEING TOLD. AND THERE MAY BE-- WHAT WAS THE REASON YOU WERE GIVEN? HOW ABOUT THAT
LOOK, HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY ON THIS--
Stephen: WERE YOU GIVEN ANY REASON?
HE'S A TOUGH INTERVIEWER
Stephen: IT JUST-- IT JUST--
YOU WOULD MAKE A FINE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, STEPHEN
Stephen: THANKS VERY MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY ON THAT, IT'S VERY CLEAR WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS STORY AND HOW LONG IT STAYED QUIET THAT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT ANY NEWS ORGANIZATION THAT HAS DAMNING EVIDENCE OF ONGOING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY NEEDS TO RUN THAT, NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE IT AND INTERROGATE IT AND RUN IT AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT THAT  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY. THOUGH THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE EMBRACING OPENNESS AND THE COURAGE OF THESE WOMEN, DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW IF ANY OF THESE WOMEN ARE-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO NAME NAMES-- ARE FACING ANY PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE ALREADY?
YEAH, LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FAR. THAT'S ALL OUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC. ASIA ARGENTO IS AN ACTRESS WHO TOLD A BRAVISTIC NOT ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS A BRUTAL ALLEGATION, BUT SHE WENT BACK AFTERWARDS, AS SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS OFTEN DO. THERE ARE SEXUAL ASSAULTS BY BOSSES AND SPOUSES AND PEOPLE YOU'RE CLOSED TO AND ENMESHED IN YOUR CAREER AND SHE WENT BACK AND SHE TOLD ALL OF THAT IN ALL ITS COMPLEXITY. I ADMIRE THAT. SHE HAS BEEN RUN OUT OF HER NATIVE COUNTRY ITALY AND THE CAN CONSERVATIVE PRESS THERE --
Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE COMMENTATORS SAYING SHE WAS ASKING FOR IT. THIS WAS HER FAULT, JUST SHAMING
Stephen:  WELL, NOW, YOU'VE DONE A SECOND ARTICLE, AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A THIRD ARTICLE. CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT PART OF THE STORY HASN'T BEEN TOLD YET?
LOOK --
Stephen: OR FROM WHAT YOU'VE INVESTIGATED?
YEAH, THIS MACHINE THAT WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL IN KEEPING THIS QUIET AS LONG AS IT WAS QUIET-- AND, LOOK, PEOPLE HAVE ASKED, "HOW COULD THIS MANY ALLEGATIONS HAVE STAYED UNDER COVER THIS LONG?" I THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE TO BE SAID ABOUT JUST HOW FAR THAT WENT
Stephen: YOU MEAN, THE PEOPLE WHO AIDED AND ABETTED IT, HOW THIS WAS SORT OF INSTITUTIONALIZED IN HOLLYWOOD?
IN WAYS THAT, HONESTLY, I DIDN'T EVEN FATHOM GOING INTO THIS. AND THAT'S NOT JUST HOLLYWOOD, STEPHEN. THAT'S PEOPLE WITH POWER AND MONEY IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE WAY THEY YIELD IT IN EVERY INDUSTRY
Stephen: WELL, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD MAN THAT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT SEXUALLY ABUSING PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT WOODY ALLEN FOR YEARS. AND THOSE ACCUSATION, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL-- AND I DON'T KNOW MR. ALLEN-- HAVE BEEN LIKE PENNIES AGAINST A BATTLESHIP, NOTHING, THERE'S BEEN NO EFFECT.
A BATTLESHIP THAT HAS BEEN IN THERAPY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS
Stephen: OKAY, WOODY ALLEN HAS DENIED THESE ALLEGATIONS
DENIED, NOT CONVICTED
Stephen: OKAY, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION THAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE HELPED SPARKED ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN, A BEAUTIFUL UNASSAILABLE MAN WILL IN SOME WAY CHANGE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'D ALLEN HAS TO FACE?
LOOK, THERE WAS NO DIRECT LINK IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS SOME PERSONAL CONNECTION THERE THAT MOTIVATED ME TO LOOK AT THIS STORY. IT WAS AN ASSIGNMENT I RECEIVED, AND I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL THEN
Stephen: OKAY
WHAT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN LINKING THESE TWO THINGS AND HELPING DRIVE ME DURING THIS STORY WAS SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS AN ISSUE THAT HAD TOUCHED MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW I UNDERSTOOD OVER TIME THE IMPORTANCE OF CONFRONTING IT ON HONESTLY, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF TOUGH, METICULOUS REPORTING IN EXPOSING THESE KINDS OF CRIMES. IN MY CASE, I WAS, FOR MANY YEARS, ONE OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SAYING, "WHY BOTHER COMING FORWARD MORE? WHAT WILL IT ACHIEVE? IT WILL JUST BRING SHAME AND TROUBLE AND IT'S A POWERFUL GUY?" AND IT WAS A LONG PROCESS OF MY REALIZING, YOU KNOW, NO, THE FACT THAT SHE WANTS TO SPEAK IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT ETHICALLY, AND I AS A REPORTER, TOO, WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT BILL COSBY OR ROGER AILES OR HARVEY WEINSTEIN, HAVE TO GET TOUGHER. WE ALL HAVE TO GET TOUGHER  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ARTICLE. RONAN FARROW, EVERYBODY. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE STAR OF MARVEL'S LATEST MOVIE, IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE, DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. HAPPY FRIDAY, JON. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, YOU GUYS CAUGHT ME. YOU GUYS CAUGHT ME. YOU GUYS CAUGHT ME READING MY BOOK. IN A LITTLE WHILE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WALTER ISAACSON COME OUT HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK ST   "LEONARDO da VINCI." THERE'S ONLY ONE BOOK BETTER, MY BOOK, "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS" ON SALE NOW. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GUILTY, YOU CAN GET SOME OF MY GUILT. "I LIKE TO LIE DOWN WHILE WATCHING TV SO I CAN USE MY BELLYBUTTON TO HOLD DIP."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I HAD A LOT OF IMAGINARY FRIENDS. THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE. I JUST IMAGINED THEY WERE MY FRIENDS."
Jon: OOOOH! WOW, WOW
Stephen: THE BOOK'S GOT HEART. IT'S GOT HEARTS, TOO. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING THIS WEEKEND, BUT I'M VERY EXCITED FOR THE OPENING OF    RAG. AFTER THE SUCCESS OF "THE AVENGERS" AND "THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY," IT FEELS LIKE EVERY CHARACTER IN THE MARVEL UNIVERSE IS GETTING THEIR OWN SPIN-OFF. BUT THERE IS ONE MARVEL CHARACTER I PERSONALLY LOVE WHO HASN'T GOTTEN THEIR OWN MOVIE YET. THIS GUY, ZACH CHERRY. HE WAS IN "SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING." AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: THERE ARE NO SMALL ROLES, BUT THERE ARE VERY SHORT ONES. HIS WAS ABOUT 11 SECONDS. BUT IN MY OPINION, HE WAS THE SENT HIM TO NEW YORK COMI-CON TO SEE IF HE COULD GET HIS OWN MARVEL SPIN-OFF MOVIE. TAKE A LOOK. ♪ ♪ ♪

DARREN, MY SAUCY WISE-CRACKING SIDEKICK, FORMER SPECIAL FORCES OPERATIVE. BUT DUE TO A MILITARY EXPERIMENT GONE AWRY, HE'S CURRENTLY A KETCHUP BOTTLE AND STREET VENDOR'S ONLY FRIEND. THERE'S A CHARACTER WHO'S LIKE A KETCHUP BOTTLE. YEAH.
KETCHUP?
YEAH! DARREN. THAT'S DARREN. HE'D BE CRACKING LINES ABOUT SOMETHING. ♪ ♪ ♪ TURNS OUT PRETTY MUCH ANYONE WHO FINDS A SHARPIE CAN HAVE THEIR OWN PANEL, SO I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A PANEL OF MY OWN. ♪ ♪ ♪ SO I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING. THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THE MOST EXCLUSIVE PANEL AT NEW YORK COMIC-CON. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW ME. I BROUGHT A COPY OF THE SCRIPT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HERE. AND I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD COME UP AND READ A SCENE WITH ME. COLOSSUS, YOU WANT TO HELP ME OUT? WE'LL HAVE YOU DO AT-RISK YOUTH. OKAY, EXTERIOR FOOD CART, NIGHT. STREET VENDOR-- WHICH IS ME-- IS CLOSING HIS CART FOR THE DAY WHEN A YOUNG PERSON IN TATTERED CLOTHES APPROACHES.
HELLO, I AM AN AT-RISK YOUTH. IF I DON'T GET A DECENT SANDWICH, I AM GOING TO DIE-- OR WORSE, JOIN A GANG.
I HAVE JUST THE THING. STREET VENDOR QUICKLY COOKS A TURKEY BURGER JUST RIGHT, SO YOU CAN HARDLY TELL IT'S NOT A REGULAR BURGER. HE HANDS IT TO THE AT-RISK YOUTH, WHO TAKES A BITE AND SMILES.
THIS IS AMAZING.
IT DOESN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE TURKEY.
NO, IT DOESN'T.
THE FULL CAST OF "THE AVENGERS" ENTERS FOR AN UN-CREDITED CAMEO. IT WAS A HUGE HIT WITH THE FANS. BUT IF I WAS GOING TO SELL THIS MOVIE TO MARVEL, I'D NEED MORE THAN JUST RAW ENTHUSIASM.
DO A FLIP!
I'D NEED STAR POWER! SO MY PITCH FOR YOU IS I'M THINKING ABOUT HAVING A NEMESIS CHARACTER WHO IS A HEALTH INSPECTOR. BECAUSE, OF COURSE, A NATURAL ENEMY OF THE VENDOR.
AND I COME, AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU, LIKE, A "C."
HEALTH INSPECTOR: HE FINES STREET CARTS FOR UNSANITARY CONDITIONS. PLUS, HE CAN SEE DEAD PEOPLE! HEY, GILBERT GOTTFRIED! HI, OH, HEY, MY NAME IS ZACH CHERRY. SO I WAS IN THE NEW "SPIDER-MAN." DID YOU SEE THE NEW "SPIDER-MAN" MOVIE?

IT WAS TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE EXECUTIVE EDITORS OF MARVEL THOUGHT AT THEIR OFFICIAL PANEL. HI, MY NAME IS ZACH. I WAS WONDERING IF ANY OF YOU HAD PLANS TO INCLUDE THE STREET VENDOR FROM "SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING" IN THE COMIC BOOK UNIVERSE?
WHO'S THE STREET VENDOR FROM "SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING?"

Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH WALTER ISAACSON.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST REALLY SCRATCHES MY ITCH, BECAUSE HE HAS WRITTEN CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED BIOGRAPHIES ON BEN FRANKLIN, ALBERT EINSTEIN AND STEVE JOBS. HIS LATEST IS "LEONARDO da VINCI." PLEASE WELCOME WALTER ISAACSON. I KNOW YOU AND JON ARE ALREADY FRIENDS?
OH, YEAH. WELL I GREW UP WITH HIS WHOLE FAMILY, THE WONDERFUL BATISTE FAMILY OF NEW ORLEANS. HE'S A GREAT MAN
Stephen: OLD HOME WEEK HERE. OLD HOME WEEK HERE
THANKS FOR THAT INTRO SONG. MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS AT HOME
Stephen: YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT A LOT OF GENIUSES, STEVE JOBS, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, ALBERT EINSTEIN. AND NOW YOU HAVE LEONARDO da VINCI. HOW DOES da VINCI STACK UP AGAINST SOME OF THESE MORE MODERN, OR MODERN WESTERN GENIUSES HERE? HOW MUCH OF da VINCI IS JUST HYPE, WALTIER?
I TRY TO HYPE HIM IN THE BOOK. LOOK AT THE PICTURES. YOU'LL SEE. HE'S PRETTY GOOD
Stephen: HE CAN DRAW. THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE
HE CAN DRAW. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APPEALED TO ME IS THAT HE'S A GENIUS IN ALL SORTS OF FIELDS. HE WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE KNOWN. SO ENGINEERING, ANATOMY, GEOLOGY, WATER WORKS, AS WELL AS ART AND SCULPTING
Stephen: WE THINK OF HIM AS A PAINTER, AND WE THINK OF HIM AS A SCIENTIST OR ENGINEER IN SOME WAYS. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT-- BUT HE ALSO WAS AN ARCHITECT, WASN'T HE?
YOU KNOW, HE DOES-- HE HELPS DO-- AFTER THE MYLAN CATHEDRAL, WHEN HE HATES BECAUSE IT'S GOTHIC, AND HE WANTS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH.
Stephen: AS LONG AS YOU BROUGHT IT UP, LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ASPECTS OF THIS-- WE PROBABLY HAVE IT ON THE BOARD HERE, TOO. DO WE HAVE IT ON THE SCREEN. HERE WE HAVE IT AS WELL. WHAT IS THE ORIGIN AND WHAT IS LEONARDO TRYING TO SAY WITH THIS?
WELL, PART OF THE ORIGIN IS HE'S DOING CHURCH DESIGNS, AND AN ANCIENT ARCHITECT SAID THE CHURCH SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO A HUMAN. LEONARDO IS SUCH A GEEK, HE MEASURES 120 MEASUREMENTS OF THE HUMAN BODY, AND THEN DOES THEM AGAIN WITH THE MOVING BODY TO GET THE PROPORTIONS RIGHT AND HE AND A GROUP OF FRIENDS DECIDE TO SAY HOW WOULD YOU PUT A CIRCLE IN THE SQUARE-- WHICH IS THE OLD AIN'TIENT RIDDLE OF SCARING THE CIRCLE. AND THE REAL COOL THING ABOUT IT. THAT'S HIM. IT'S A SELF-PORTRAIT OF HIM STANDING IN THE EARTH AND THE COSMOS SAYING, "HOW DO WE FIT IN?" SO IT'S A WORK OF GREAT ENGINEERING, A WORK OF GREATER MATH, BUT A NECESSARY BEAUTY AND THE SPIRITUALITY OF HIM FITTING INTO THE COAZ MOAS
Stephen: THE NOTEBOOKS OF LEONARDO da VINCI ARE FAMOUS. HOW MANY PAGES ARE THERE IN THE NOTEBOOKS.
THERE ARE ABOUT 7,200 WHICH WE STILL HAVE, WHICH IS PROBABLY A QUARTER OF WHAT HE WROTE. BUT THAT'S A BETTER PROPORTION THAN THE EMAILS OR PEMOZE OF STEVE JOBS, WHICH ARE KIND OF LOST IN ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION. PAINTING IS A REALLY GOOD TECHNOLOGY FOR THE STORAGE OF INFORMATION. IT'ST THE OPERATING SYSTEM DOESN'T MESS UP. YOU CAN READ PAGE AFTER PAGE AND SEE HIS MIND DANCING WITH MATH AND SKETCHES OF "THE LAST SUPPER," AND SORT OF RIVER RIVER SWIRLS --
Stephen: THEY'RE NOT ORGANIZED BY SUBJECT. IT'S WHATEVER WAS ON HIS MIND.
PAPER WAS QUITE EXPENSE AND I HAVE HE WOULD CRAM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON A PAGE IS & THAT WAY YOU COULD SEE HIM DANCING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN SCIENCE AND MATH AND GEOLOGY
Stephen: WHAT WERE SOME OF THE SURPRISING THINGS YOU SAW THIM THINKING ABOUT?
THERE'S A WONDERFUL NOTEBOOK PAGE WHERE HE'S TRYING TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE AND MOUNTAINS AND HE LOVES SWIRLS OF WATERS AND HOW THEY HAVE THE SAME MATH AS CURLS OF HAIR. AND AT THE VERY BOTTOM HE HAS A TOO # TO-DO LIST YIS THE SKY BLEW BLUE. DESCRIBE THE TONGUE OF A WOODPECKER, AND A RECIPE FOR BOILING NUTS IN OIL TO MAKE WHAT HE CALLS A TAWNING HAIR DYE PUP LOOK HOW PRETTY HE IS. HE'S IN THE MID-30s BY THE TIME HE DOES THAT PAGE. HE'S STARTING TO DYE HIS HAIR BLOND. AND I SAID, "YEAH! HE'S HUMAN! HOW COOL!"
Stephen: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT LEONARDOS LIFE? WAS HE ALL WORK OR ARE THERE STORIES OF HIM HANGING AROUND DRINKING.
HE DOES. HE IS ONE OF THE FRIENDLIEST COLLEGIAL PEOPLE --
Stephen: HE'S NOT LIKE WHAT WE SAW ON THE SPECTRUM
OR LIKE MICHELANGELO, WHO IS VERY MUCH OF A RECLIEWRKS THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE FIELD WHO SAY, "LEONARDO IS MY BEST FRIEND." AND LENARD OAFS A MISFIT I MEAN, HE DIDN'T FIT IN. HE WAS ILLEGITIMATE, LEFT-HANDED, GAY, VEGETARIAN, HERETICLE. AND YET, HE HAS THIS WONDERFUL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. HE DRESSES IN PURPLE AND PINK TUNICS, HE'S VERY FLAMBOYANT. AND HE'S TOTALLY BELOVED, FIRST IN FLORENCE WHERE HE GROWS UP AND THEN IN MILAN, WHERE HE MOVED
Stephen: WHY DID FLORENCE FLOURISH IN SUCH A PARTICULAR WAY?
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE YOU APPRECIATE
Stephen: THANK YOU
IT SAYS SO ON MY NOTES, "GREAT QUESTION." IT'S LIKE NEW YORK, AND YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT A LOT RECENTLY. LEONARDO WAS THIS MISFIT, BUT MISFITS, FIT INTO FLORENCE. LIKE STEVE JOBS WOULD SAY MISFITS ARE REBELS, ROUND PEG IN A SQUARE HOLE. FLORENCE WAS VERY TOLERANT. IT HAD LOTS OF IMMIGRANTS FROM THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPOLE, PEOPLE FROM EUROPE. IT IS GOLD BEADERS AND JEWELRY MAKERS WORKING WITH CLOTH MERCHANTS AND ARCHITECTS. AND SO THE TOLERANCE AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE PEOPLE, WHEN THE MED KEY RAN IT AS A REPUBLIC, IS WHAT MADE IT THE CRADLE OF THE RENAISSANCE
Stephen: AS YOU'RE STUDYING OR DOING THE RESEARCH OF THIS BOOK, IS THERE AN UNANSWERED QUESTION ABOUT HIM WHERE YOU THINK IF ONLY WE HAD THAT DOCUMENT? IS THERE A CUE DOCUMENT ABOUT LEONARDO WE DON'T KNOW?
NO, WITH SO MANY PAGES WE KNOW SO MUCH --
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT LOST WORKS? THING WE HEARD ABOUT BUT NEVER SAW?
IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, GOING ON SALE IS SALVADOR MUNDI, ONE OF THE FEW REDISCOVERED PAINTINGS OF LEONARDO. HE ONLY DID ABOUT 15 FINISHED PAINTINGS, BUT THIS NEW ONE HAS BEEN REDISCOVERED. IT HAD BEEN LOST FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS AND IT'S WONDERFUL AS A WORK OF SCIENCE BECAUSE THE BLESSING HAND OF JESUS IS VERY SHARP AS IT IS COMING OUT. HE HAS A CRYSTAL ORB, WHICH DOESN'T DISTORT JESUS' ROBES. AND SCIENTIFICALLY YOU SAY HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT, IT SHOULD DISTORT. BUN BUTT THEN YOU REALIZE HE'S MAKING A MIRACULOUS QUALITY SO IT'S ALWAYS FUN AND ALSO SOMETHING NEW TO DISCOVER ABOUT LEONARDO
Stephen: THIS IS THE BOOK TO DO IT. "LEONARDO" IS ON SALE NOW. WALTER ISAACSON, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY KELSEA BALLERINI.
