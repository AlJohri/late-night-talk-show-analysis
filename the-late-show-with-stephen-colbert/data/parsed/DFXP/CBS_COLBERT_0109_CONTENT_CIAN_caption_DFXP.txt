Stephen: HEY, HOW ARE YOU? HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, EVERYBODY, UP THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANKS, EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. FRIDAY NIGHT, EVERYBODY, DOESN'T THIS FEEL GREAT, FRIDAY NIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE EARNED IT. I THINK WE EARNED IT THIS WEEK.
Jon: WE, CAN, MAN, WE EARNED THAT THING.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, DO YOU GUYS LIKE THE INTERNET? ME, TOO, I GO ON THERE ALL TIME. IT'S WHERE I EXPERIENCE MOST OF MY FEELINGS THESE DAYS. I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME IN THERE, AND THAT'S WHERE I FEEL THINGS. AND I SAW SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET TODAY THAT REALLY MADE ME FEEL, YOU KNOW REALLY PULLED ON MY HEARTSTRINGS. AND IT WAS THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF JOAO DE SOUZA, A 71-YEAR-OLD FORMER BRICKLAYER IN BRAZIL. I HAVE A GOOGLE ALERT FOR "BRAZILIAN BRICKLAYER." ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, HE'S GOT A BEST FRIEND, A PENGUIN NAMED JINJIN. JIMMY, CAN WE SHOW THEM? OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T STAND IT! THAT IS SO ADORABLE. I DON'T EVEN CARE IF THAT PENGUIN IS SEARCHING HIS EYEBROWS FOR KRILL. THAT'S ADORABLE. HERE'S THE THING-- FIVE YEARS AGO, JOAO FOUND JINJIN COVERED IN OIL ON THE BEACH. HE CLEANED HIM UP, NURSED HIM BACK TO HEALTH, AND THEN HE RELEASED HIM, NEVER EXPECTING TO SEE HIM AGAIN. BUT JINJIN COMES BACK TO SOUZA'S VILLAGE EVERY SUMMER NOW, TRAVELING OVER 5,000 MILES-- I HAVE GOT TO THINK, THE WHOLE TIME BEING NARRATED BY MORGAN FREEMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST ROOK AT THEM NOW. THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE LIKE TOGETHER. THEY SPEND EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR TOGETHER LIKE THIS. HAVING FUN. THE OTHER FOUR MONTHS, JINJIN HEADS WAY BACK TO ARGENTINA TO BREED. AND WHEN HE RETURNS, HE FINDS JOAO AND WAGS HIS TAIL WHEN HE SEES HIM. IT'S LIKE A NICHOLAS SPARKS NOVEL HAD SEX WITH A PIXAR MOVIE AND ITS BABY WAS AN ADELE SONG THAT WAS COVERED IN OIL AND THEN NURSED BACK TO HEALTH. I WANT A PENGUIN. WHO WANTS A PENGUIN? I WANT A PENGUIN. WE WANT A PENGUIN! WE WANT A PENGUIN! WE WANT A PENGUIN. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM, BUT I HAD TO SAY THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS HEARTWARMING TO ME, TONIGHT'S SHOW. TONIGHT'S SHOW IS MY PENGUIN. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT, I'LL BE TALKING WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED MR. JEFF DANIELS! THEN I'LL BE JOINED BY SIX-TIME TONY AWARD WINNER AUDRA McDONALD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE STAR OF THE NEW J.J. ABRAMS MOVIE "10 CLOVERFIELD LANE," MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EXCUSE ME, SIR, COULD YOU GET WOULD YOU MIND GETTING YOUR FEET OFF THE STAGE FOR A SECOND? JUST-- I KNOW. I'M SORRY, YOU LOOK TIRED, BUT THIS IS NOT A PARK BENCH.

Jon: THAT WAS RAIL SOMETHING. YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
Stephen: I'M GLAD BILL WAS ABLE TO GET A LITTLE COUPLE OF Z'S IN THE FRONT ROW. VERY HONORED HE WOULD STOP BY. ONCE AGAIN, HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. I JUST CANNOT GET OVER THE JOY OF KNOWING IT'S FRIDAY. FRIDAY IS ALWAYS SPECIAL HERE AT THE "LATE SHOW" BECAUSE EVERY FRIDAY WE SET UP A HYPOTHETICAL CAGE MATCH BETWEEN TWO THINGS, DONUT VERSUS BAGEL. DUCK WITH A CHAINSAW VERSUS CAT WITH A NAIL GUN. NAIL GUN HAS THE RANGE ADVANTAGE OVER THE CHAINSAW, BUT NEITHER ANIMAL HAS THE OPPOSABLE THUMBS SO IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL. THEN WE POST THOSE MATCH-UPS ON TWITTER, AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE PLACE FOR MINDLESS CONFLICT. AND YOU, THE PEOPLE, DECIDE THE VICTOR. THIS IS...
Audience: "FRIDAY NIGHT FIGHTS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH! OH! THE PEOPLE-- OH, THE PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED FOR "FRIDAY NIGHT FIGHTS." WELCOME TO "FRIDAY NIGHT FIGHTS!" HODGMAN WENT TOOTH FAIRY, WHO WON WITH 56% OF THE VOTE ON TWITTER, AND I'M SURE THE TOOTH FAIRY IS OUT THERE SOME PLACE CELEBRATING BY SNORTING A BIG PILE OF GROUND-UP BABY TEETH. THAT'S HOW SHE STAYS UP ALL NIGHT. THE SECOND FIGHT PITTED THE APPLE GENIUS WITH THE SWITCH BLADE AGAINST A WALMART GREATER WITH A CROSSBOW. LAUGH HODGMAN PICKED THE WALMART GREETER AND GOT 57% OF THE VOTES. SO JOHN HODGMAN BEAT ME IN BOTH FIGHTS. NO HARD FEELINGS, JOHN. I JUST WANT TO SAY, CONGRATULATIONS. I REALLY ENJOYED OUR FRIENDSHIP WHILE IT LASTED. NOW IT'S TIME TO MEET MY LATEST OPPONENT.
HE'S AN ACTOR, WRITER, AND COMEDIAN. YOU KNOW HIM FROM "MR. SHOW," "BOJACK HORSEMAN," AND NOW AS THE HOST OF "NO, YOU SHUT UP" ON THE FUSION NETWORK-- IT'S PAUL F. TOMPKINS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU. HELLO.
Stephen: ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAUL.
ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: PAUL, YOU'RE A WORTHY OPPONENT. I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT. WHAT DOES THE "F" STAND FOR IN PAUL F. TOMPKINS
FASCISM, IT'S A FAMILY'S NAME. TONIGHT'S MATCH-UP IS GOING TO FILL YOU WITH CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA. DID YOU HAVE A HAPPY CHILDHOOD?
LET ME SAY IT'S GREAT TO BE AN ADULT.
Stephen: HOP IN THE STATION WAGON, KIDS, BECAUSE DADDY'S TAKING YOU TO THE MOST BRUTAL BIRTHDAY PARTY EVER, PITTING THE ANIMATRONIC CHUCK E. CHEESE BAND VERSUS THE KNIGHTS OF MEDIEVAL TIMES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MOST BRUTAL EVER. LET'S GO TO THE TALE OF THE TAPE. COMING IN AT FIVE MEMBERS STRONG AND A COMBINED WEIGHT OF OVER 1,500 POUNDS OF FUR-COVERED STEEL AND HYDRAULICS, THE CHUCK E. CHEESE BAND HAS THE DEAD EYES OF A PSYCHOPATH AND WORKS TOGETHER LIKE A WELL-OILED MACHINE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. STRENGTHS INCLUDE: ROCK AND ROLL ATTITUDE, PERFECT PITCH, AND A CHEAP WAY TO CONVINCE GULLIBLE CHILDREN THAT YOU TOOK THEM TO DISNEY WORLD. WEAKNESSES INCLUDE: MY COUSIN LOOKED BEHIND THE CURTAIN ONE TIME AND TOLD ME THEY WERE JUST SITTING THERE, LOOKING DEAD. BUT CHUCK AND THE GANG BETTER WATCH OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE UP AGAINST THE KNIGHTS OF MEDIEVAL TIMES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WEIGHING IN AT OVER 3,000 POUNDS OF MAN, HORSE, AND FREE SODA REFILLS! THESE KNIGHTS ARE READY TO JOUST, KILL, AND BUS TABLES IF BRIAN CALLS IN SICK! STRENGTHS INCLUDE: ABILILTY TO GO IMMEDIATE EVIL ON YOUR ASS, AND THE PENT-UP ANGER OF ACTORS WORKING IN DINNER THEATER. WEAKNESSES INCLUDE: NO KNOWLEDGE OF ACTUAL MEDIEVAL TIMES. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, P.T.F.? WHICH ONE YOU GOT IN THIS FIGHT?
WELL, STEPHEN, I THINK I HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY, 1,000%, THE CHUCK E. CHEESE BAND.
Stephen: YOU ARE CRAZY. THE CHUCK E. CHEESE BAND HAS NO WEAPONS. I'M GOING WITH THE KNIGHTS WHO ARE FULLY ARMORED AND HAVE SWORDS. HOW DO YOU BEAT THAT? HOW DO YOU BEAT THAT?
LET ME ASK YOU THIS-- ARE SWORDS STILL MADE OF METAL?
Stephen: YES.
OKAY, YOU WANT TO STICK A METAL WEAPON INTO AN OPPONENT COARSING WITH ELECTRICITY. WHY DON'T YOU STAY HOME AND JOUST YOUR TOASTER WITH A BUTTER KNIFE?
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WHAT I DO IS I TAKE MY PITCHER OF FREE REFILLS AND I POUR IT INTO THE CHUCK E. CHEESE BAND, AND THEY SHORT OUT. GAME OVER.
OH, OKAY. SO YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO SHORT OUT THESE ROBOTS THAT HAVE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY A FLYING "V" GUITAR? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY HAVEN'T NOW LEARNED TO SELF-REPAIR?
Stephen: THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LEARNING ABILITY. THEY'RE NOT AN A.I. SYSTEM. THEY'RE MERELY HYDRAULICS BEING RUN BY A GUY NAMED ANDY, WHO IS AN 18-YEAR-OLD ASSISTANT MANAGER.
FIRST OF ALL, THAT AN DIERK HE'S ONE TO WATCH. SECONDLY, THEY HAVE BEEN STANDING THERE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE DISINTERESTINGLY SHOVING PIZZA INTO THEIR FACES AS THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAY THEIR PASSION. YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO ABSORBED NOT JUST PITA GREASE BUT, ALSO-- ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE GOING TO ADAPT!
Stephen: THEY'RE GOING TO ADAPT!
YES!
Stephen: REALLY!
YEAH!
Stephen: OKAY, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DANGEROUS?
YES, I DO.
Stephen: OKAY, I'M TALKING ABOUT ACTORS WHO CANNOT GET A JOB SO THEY ARE FIGHTING IN A SANDPIT FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF CHILDREN. MY KNIGHTS HAVE SO MUCH PENT-UP RAGE, THEY DON'T NEED THE WEAPONS. THEY'RE JUST TEAR YOUR ROBOTZ APART PIECE BY PIECE.
HOW-- ANOTHER THE MOMENT SOMEBODY GETS A TEXT SAYING, "OH, GUESS WHAT YOU GOT A CALL-BACK FOR THAT ARID EXTRA DRY COMMERCIAL" THE WHOLE SQUAD DISINTEGRATES.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE ROBOTS WHO ARE MINDLESS AND GODLESS CAN DEFEAT CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS WHO HAVE SWORN TO TAKE BACK JERUSALEM, JUST AS SOON AS THE SECOND SHOW IS OVER. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT?
YOU AND YOUR PRECIOUS RELIGION!
Stephen: LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE.
LET'S AGREE THAT WE DISAGREE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.
Stephen: LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, AMERICA. HEAD TO TWITTER AND VOTE "WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT: ANIMATRONIC CHUCK E. CHEESE BAND VS. THE KNIGHTS OF MEDIEVAL TIMES?"

YES.
IF WE COULD RESCUE GENETICALLY DAMAGED PEOPLE, PERHAPS OVER TIME MAN'S GENETIC MATERIAL WOULD HEAL ITSELF, RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM.
AND I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JEFF DANIELS. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I CAN'T SAY THAT I BLAME YOU.
JUST SAYIN'' HELLO.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE A VERY BUSY MAN RIGHT NOW.
I AM.
Stephen: YOU OPENED LAST NIGHT AT THE BILL ASKO THEATER, A NEW PLAY ON BROADWAY CALLED "BLACKBIRD." CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: AND WE'RE TAPING THIS AROUND 6:00 RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GO ONSTAGE AT 8:00 TONIGHT.
YES, I DO.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU MAKE THE TURN? YOU'RE HERE NOW AS YOURSELF. WHAT'S THE PREPARATION? DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF PRESHOW RITUAL YOU GO THROUGH BETWEEN NOW AND 8:00 WHEN YOU GO ONSTAGE?
WELL, ASIDE FROM THE DRUGS --
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE IN SHOW BUSINESS.
LISTEN.
Stephen: I'M HOPING TO HAVE MYSELF GENETICALLY ALTERED?
ARE YOU, ARE YOU? EXPLAIN THAT TO ME LATER BECAUSE I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. UN, IT'S BROADWAY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.
OH, YOU DO.
Stephen: I DON'T! I'M ON BROADWAY RIGHT NOW BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A BROADWAY PLAY.
IT'S THE SAME FEEL EXCEPT WE DON'T HAVE MICROPHONES. WE'VE GOT TO FILL IT. SO YOU GOTTA DO VOCAL WARM-UPS. YOU CAN HEAR THE VOICE RIGHT NOW IS JUST BEAT UP.
Stephen: A LITTLE RASPY.
BUT ONCE I WARM IT UP, ONCE YOU START TO DO THE THING --
ONE MORE TIME.
NIP, NIP. YOU GOTTA GET IT UP IN THE NASAL UP BEHIND THE EYE S.
Stephen:  BEHIND THE EYES? I HAVE TO TALK OUT OF HERE.
Stephen: NYEP. NYEP. I'M FEELING IT. THEY'RE STARTING TO VIBRATE.
IT SHOULD FEEL RIGHT UP IN THERE. IT'S A NASAL CAVITY KIND OF-- THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO-- YOU WANT TO TALK THROUGH YOUR NOSE.
Stephen: THROUGH YOUR NOSE! NYEP. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ACTOR WE HAD TO DO, SHE SKIS EASILY BENEATH THE CEILING OF STARS UP HERE.
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE NYEP, NYEP, UP IN THERE, THEN YOU START WORKING ON THE LIPS. BADAGADABADA. YOU GET-- YOU GET-- YOU DO THAT. BUGGA GADDA BUGGA GADDA.
Stephen: I WOULD JUST GO TO A BROADWAY THEATER TO SEE YOU DO THAT FOR TWO HOURS. TONIGHT, THE AMAZING DANIELLEO! AND HIS WONDER LIPS.
SO THEN YOU GET NASAL, AND THEN COMBINING WITH THE BADDA GADDA, YOU GET THE LIPS GOING. AND YOU HAVE TO. IT'S A PHYSICAL THING. YOU'VE GOT TO PUT YOUR HEAD, LIKE, HERE. NYEP. BADDA GADDA BADDA GADDA BADDA GADDA. YEAH.
Stephen: THEY DON'T ALLOW THOSE SHOWS ON BROADWAY ANYMORE. GIULIANI CLEANED ALL OF THOSE OUT, LATE 80s, EARLY 90s. I MISS HIM. I MISS HIM.
I'M SERIOUS, YOU HAVE TO --
YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR HEAD BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.
IF I DON'T I SOUND LIKE I'M FROM THE MIDWEST, WHICH I AM --
YOU ARE FROM THE MIDWEST.
BUT GUOUT THERE, AND MY LIPS DON'T MOVE, AND I TRY TO DO THE WHOLE PLAY LIKE THIS AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS. THE PROBLEM IS, ONCE YOU GET TOO WARMED UP, THE LIPS CAN KIND OF TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN AND THEY'RE DOING THIS LIKE THAT. AND YOU GO, "STEPHEN, HOW GOOD TO SEE YOU." AND THEY KEEP MOVING.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A KUNG FU MOVIE. YES, I AM, SHINWU. I GOTTA SEE THIS PLAY.
IT'S REALLY GOOD. IT'S REALLY INTENSE. MICHELLE WILLIAMS IS IN IT. SHE KILLS IT. ( APPLAUSE ) IF YOU'RE-- IF YOU'RE INTO DRAMA, IF YOU'RE INTO-- IT'S ROCK 'N' ROLL THEATER. WE ARE IN YOUR FACE FROM PAGE ONE ON.
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF LONG, THERE'S NO INTERMISSION, IT'S THE TWO OF YOU IN A ROOM AND IT'S KATIE, BAR THE DOOR.
IT IS. IT'S AN ILLEGAL RELATIONSHIP. 15 YEARS LATER, SHE'S 27. I'M IN MY 50s, BUT SHE'S COME TO MY PLACE OF WORK, AND SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL. AND IT'S UGLY, AND IT'S INTENSE, BUT IT'S GREAT, GREAT DRAMA.
Stephen: AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU'VE PLAYED THIS ROLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT MADE YOU GO BACK TO THIS? BECAUSE THAT DOES SOUND RESPONSE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD ABSOLUTELY RING YOU OUT.
I DIDN'T THINK I WENT DEEP ENOUGH. I DIDN'T THINK I DID IT WELL ENOUGH. ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT IT'S BROADWAY, WHICH IS AN HONOR, I JUST DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOOD ENOUGH. AND THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT REALLY, REALLY GREAT ACTORS THAT I ADMIRE, YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE GOING ALL THE WAY.
Stephen: DO YOU SAY THAT TO YOURSELF, "I DIDN'T DO THAT WELL ENOUGH?" ARE YOU REALLY ROUGH ON YOURSELF.
I'M BETTER NOW. LIKE A McEVOY IN "NEWSROOM." THAT'S WHAT THAT IS. AND THERE ARE SOME ROLES, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM WHERE YOU JUST-- A LOT OF THEM ARE "BEN THERE, DONE THAT," I DID IT. BUT THIS ONE WASN'T, AND THE CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN AND GO HARDER WAS, LOOK, YOU KNOW, I MEAN AT THIS AGE TO GET ASKED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF. THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS MY AGE THAT WOULD KILL TO DO THIS. SO I'M-- TO GET ANOTHER SHOT AT IT IS A GREAT HONOR.
Stephen: WELL, THE MOVIE THAT IS OPENING UP THIS WEEKEND-- THIS WEEKEND?
OKAY.
Stephen: OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) SURE.
I'M IN A MOVIE WITH SOME OF THE BEST-LOOKING PEOPLE-- YOUNG PEOPLE --
THE MOVIE IS "ALLEGIANT." THIS IS A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE.
YES.
Stephen: THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE PLAYED SOMEBODY FROM THE FUTURE. YOU ALSO PLAYED SOMEBODY FROM THE FUTURE IN "LOOPER."
I'M THE GUY.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE AUTHORITY GUY FROM THE FUTURE. DO YOU HAVE A DYSTOPIAN VIEW OF THE FUTURE? ARE YOU HOPEFUL ABOUT THE FUTURE?
WELL, IT DEPENDS WHO ENDS UP BECOMING PRESIDENT, DOESN'T IT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. AS I WAS SAYING, YOU'RE FROM MICHIGAN, YOU'RE FROM MICHIGAN THEY JUST HAD THE PRIMARY IN MICHIGAN.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND WE KNOW WHO WON EACH ONE. ARE YOU HAPPY ABOUT WHO WON?
ON ONE SIDE-- I'M INTERESTED IN THE HILLARY BERNIE THING. I ABSOLUTELY GET BERNIEET AND REVOLUTION AND ALL OF THAT. I GET IT, I GET IT. BUT I LOVE EXPERIENCE. I LOVE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN AROUND. I LOVE THE FACT THAT BILL CLINTON'S GOING TO BE UPSTAIRS, IF IT END UP BEING HERE. I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK THAT'S A BAD THING INTURNLLY.
Stephen: ARE YOU SURE THAT'S WHERE HE'S GOING TO BE? ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: ARE YOU SURE?
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. CAN YOU HOLD ON A SECOND.
"ALLEGIANT" "ALLEGIANT" OPENS NEXT FRIDAY, AND "BLACKBIRD" OPENS NEXT FRIDAY AND "BLACKBIRD" IS NOW ON BROADWAY.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WHERE WE'RE JEFF DANIELS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT YOU, AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE, UNLIKE A LOT OF ACTORS. YOU DON'T LIVE IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU DON'T LIVE IN NEW YORK. YOU LIVE IN MICHIGAN, BACK WHERE YOU GREW UP.
I'VE LIVED FOR 30 YEARS A LITTLE TOWN ( BAND PLAYING ) CALLED CHELSEA, MICHIGAN.
I THINK MICHIGAN IS BEAUTIFUL. I WAS THERE THIS SUMMER IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED MONROE, MICHIGAN. AND I GUEST HOSTED A LOCAL CABLE ACCESS SHOW CALLED "ONLY IN MONROE." DID YOU-- DID YOU CATCH THAT BY REQUEST CHANCE?
NO, NO, I BELIEVE IT ONLY AIRS "ONLY IN MONROE."
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. WHILE I WAS THERE I INTERVIEWED A LOCAL MICHIGANDER ENTERTAINER BY THE NAME OF MARSHALL MATHERS. AND WE DISCUSSED UPCOMING EVENTS AND WE DISCUSSED SOME UPCOMING EVENTS IN THE COMMUNITY.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT. I BET THE PEOPLE IN CHELSEA WOULD USE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: THEY'RE IN LUCK, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S TIME FOR CHELSEA, MICHIGAN'S, COMMUNITY CALENDAR.
Stephen: WELCOME TO "COMMUNITY CALENDAR." ( LAUGHTER ).
THESE ARE ACTUAL EVENTS HAPPENING ALL THIS MONTH IN CHELZY, MICHIGAN, AND IN GREATER WASHTENAW COUNTY.
Stephen: AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY COUNTY GREATER.

SATURDAY FROM 7:00 P.M. TO 10 P.M. IS THE CHELSEA LANES IS FAMILY BOWLING NIGHT. IF YOU'RE BOWLING THERE AT ANY OTHER TIME, THOSE AREN'T YOUR REAL PARENTS.
Stephen: AND IF YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH SYRUPY DRINKS, HEAD OVER TO CLEARY'S PUB ON SOUTH MAIN STRIT STREET. THEIR SPECIALTY, MAPLE BACON MARTINIS, WILL GIVE YOUR MOUTH A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOUR HANGOVER WILL TASTE LIKE. CHEAPER.
DUST OFF YOUR BICYCLE FOR A FUN FRIDAY MORNING RIDE THROUGH DOWNYIPSILANTI. THE BIKE YPSI GROUP MEETS EVERY FRIDAY. SO IF YOU WERE LOOKING TO GO TODAY, TOO LATE. IT HAPPENED AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING. YOU MISSED A GOOD ONE.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE NEAR THE CHELSEA ALEHOUSE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, DROP BY AND HEAR THUNDERWUDE, WHO DESCRIBE THEIR SOUND AS BLUEGRASS, FUNK GRASS, SLAM GRASS, EVERYTHING YOU'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM THUNDERWUDE.
ALL THIS WEEKEND, THE CHELSEA AREA PLAYERS YOUTH THEATER WILL PRESENT THE PRODUCTION OF DISNEY'S "ALICE IN WONDERLAND," FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A PRESENTATION BY DISNEY'S YOU COPYRIGHT LAWYERS.
Stephen: TUESDAY, AT THE MICHIGAN FRIEND CENTER, IS A LECTURE CALLED, "WHY CIVIL RESISTANCE WORKS." THOSE INTERESTED SHOULD ATTEND. THOSE NOT INTERESTED SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
AND ON THE 18th, REDDEMAN FARMS GOLF COURSE WILL BE HOSTING THEIR FRIDAY FISH FRY. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CHOICE OF FRIED PERCH OR COD DINNER. AND IF YOU PLAY YOUR "CARDS" RIGHT, PERCH OR COD BREAKFAST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).

Stephen: SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU IN YOUR NEW DIGS.
Stephen: YOU MADE IT TO BROADWAY, BABY.
YOU DID, YOU DID.
Stephen: LAST TIME WE SPOKE OVER AT THE OLD PLACE YOU HAD NOT YET WON YOUR HISTORIC SIXTH TONY.
NO.
Stephen: FOR PLAYING BILLIE HOLIDAY AT "EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL." CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. NO ONE HAS EVER WON IN ALL FOUR CATEGORIES.
YOU GAVE ME SOME NOTES. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT GOT ME THERE.
Stephen: I'VE GOT SOME VOCAL WARM-UP EXERCISES FOR YOU NOW.
I WAS VERY FASCINATEED BY MR. DANIEL'S SEGMENT. BEING A SINGER I HAVE SOME, TOO.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOURS?
MINE AREN'T NEARLY AS FASCINATING AS HIS.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO STICK YOUR HEAD BETWEEN YOUR KNEES?
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, NO. WE DO SHE BREWS A PROPER CUP OF COFFEE IN A COPPER COFFEE POT. AND ♪ MOMMA MADE ME MASH MY M&Ms ♪ ♪ A THING DISTINCTLY HARD TO SAY BUT HARD TO DO. A RAT-A-TAT♪ DO YOU KNOW THAT ONE?
I DON'T, BUT THAT'S FANTASTIC.
Stephen: FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW WHO BILLIE HOLIDAY IS, THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE, MAYBE SOME OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE OUT THERE. TELL PEOPLE WHO SHE WAS, A LITTLE BIT OF HER STORY.
SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE JAZZ SINGER IN THE 30s, 40s, AND 50s, AFRICAN AMERICAN LADY. AND REALLY WAS AN INCREDIBLE SONG STYLIST, UNLIKE ANYTHING ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN.
Stephen: HEARTBREAK VOICE.
HEARTBREAKING VOICE, VERY SMALL VOICE. IT WAS A SINGULAR SOUND. BUT SHE ALSO HAD A REALLY ROUGH, ROUGH LIFE. SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE WHEN SHE WAS A KID. SHE WAS-- BECAME A DRUG ADDICT, AND AN ALCOHOLIC, DIED AT THE AGE OF 44 FROM CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER AND HEART FAILURE AND ALL THIS STUFF. BUT SHE WAS AN AMAZING, ICONIC SINGER.
Stephen: YOU'VE PLAYED THIS PART ON BROADWAY AND NOW IT'S ON HBO, THE BROADWAY SHOW, AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT TO LONDON, I UNDERSTAND.
I'M TAKING IT TO LONDON THIS SUMMER. I'M VERY EXCITED. I'VE NEVER PERFORMED THERE BEFORE.
Stephen: ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: FOR PLAYING A CHARACTER LIKE THAT AND ALSO A BRILLIANT SINGER IN HER OWN RIGHT, HOW DO YOU GET INTO THAT CHARACTER? IS IT THROUGH HER BIOGRAPHY? THROUGH HER TRAGIC STORY? IS IT HER VOICE? THE WAY SHE SPOKE?
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE BILLIE HOLIDAY HAD SUCH AN INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC SOUND, AND I'M A SOPRANO AND I DON'T HAVE A VOICE ANYWHERE LIKE HERS --
Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ACTUALLY DO.
WELL.
HAD TO FIND MYSELF MYWAY INTO THAT VOICE. AND I REALIZED WHEN I WAS STUDYING ALL THE GREAT CLIPS OF BILLIE HOLIDAY THAT SHE SOUNDED A LOT, WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING, LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER, MY GRANDMOTHER, NAN AWHO WOULD SAY STUFF LIKE, "ODD DRA, GET YOUR FEET OFF THE CHESTERFIELD. GET OVER HERE, GIRL." I MEAN, THAT'S HOW MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD TALK. AND I USED TO MAKE FUN OF MY GRANDMOTHER, AND I WOULD, OF COURSE, GET IN TROUBLE FOR COULD GO IT.
Stephen: BUT IT ESSENTIALLY PAID OFF.
YES, ALL OF A SUDDEN I REALIZED, BILLIE HOLIDAY SOUNDS LIKENANA. SO ONCE I STARTED GOING THROUGH MY NANA'S VOICE, I WAS ABLE TO SORT OF FIND BILLIE. SO I HAVE MY NANA TO THANK FOR HELPING ME FIND BILLIE HOLIDAY, ACTUALLY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS-- ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS YOU'VE DONE IS THAT FOR YOUR TONY SPEECH FOR WINNING FOR "LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL" IS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU WANTED TO USE YOUR ART, USING YOUR NOTORIETY TO SORT OF POINT AT SOME OF THE GREAT AFRICAN AMERICAN ARTISTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTEP, WHO HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE NOTORIETY THEY DESERVE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE WORKING ON A NEW MUSICAL CALLED "SHUFFLE ALONG."
YES. ( APPLAUSE ) WHICH IS FOR THOSE-- IT'S BASED ON THE STORY-- IT'S ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE ACTUAL SHOW "SHUFFLE ALONG," WHICH PREMIERED ON BROADWAY IN 1921. AND IT WAS THE FIRST SHOW EVER WRITTEN, DIRECTED, PRODUCED, AND STARRING AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Stephen: IN 1921.
IN 1921.
Stephen: ALL THOSE POSITIONS. WOW.
YES. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS EVER JAZZ IN A BROADWAY SHOW. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS AN ACTUAL SORT OF LOVE INTEREST BETWEEN TWO AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A SHOW. BEFORE THAT IT WOULD HAVE KICKED OUT OF TOWN OR AUDIENCES WOULD HAVE RIOTED.
Stephen: OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS A MINSTREL SHOW.
EXACTLY. AND --
"WILD ABOUT HARRY."
"WILD ABOUT HARRY" WAS FROM THAT SHOW. OUR PRODUCTION, WRITTEN BY GEORGE WOLF AND TAPPED BY SAFION GLOVER WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY AMAZING LEARNING HOW TO TAP AT THE AGE OF... I'M LEARNING HOW TO TAP. IT'S BEEN AMAZING.
Stephen: YOU DON'T LOOK A DAY OVER.
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE ME TAP. I LOOK MUCH OLDER THAN THAT WHEN I TAP. IT'S TELLING THE STORY OF THE SHOW --
AND THERE WERE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE IN THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION IN 1921.
ABSOLUTELY. AT THE TIME THERE WAS AN UNKNOWN LITTLE GIRL, NAMED FREIDA McDONALD, WHO WOULD BECOME JOSEPH 15 BAKER. AND PAUL ROBSON WAS IN IT. IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REASON WE HAVE-- 63rd STREET IS A ONE-WAY STREET BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC WAS SO IMMENSE PEOPLE COME TO SEE THE SHOW ON 63rd --
AND I UNDERSTAND IT WAS PUT OVER ON 63rd BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW AN ALL-AFRICAN AMERICAN PRODUCTION ON BROADWAY.
IT WAS DICEY THE WAY THEY CAME IN. IT WAS A DICEY PRODUCER WHO WAS LIKE WE HAVE THIS OLD DLABIDATED THEATER AND YOU GUYS CAN BE HERE. BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE ORCHESTRA SECTION OF A BROADWAY SHOW WAS INTEGRATED. SO AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE ALLOWED TO SIT IN THE ORCHESTRA SECTION. YOU KNOW, AND FAMOUS PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE GERSHWIN WAS THERE LOT OF TIMES, AND AL JOLSON, AND ALL THESE PEOPLE CAME TO SEE IT AND INTRODUCED SORT OF THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE. SO THIS IS THE STORY OF THAT SHOW.
Stephen: THAT'S 1921.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE, 96 YEARS-- 95 YEARS AGO THIS SHOW PREMIERED.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND NOW, ON BROADWAY RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT LION KING, ON FEET, ECLIPSED, HAMILTON, AND SOON SHUFFLE ALONG.
COLOR PURPLE.
Stephen: COLOR PURPLE. WHY DO YOU THINK DIVERSITY IS SUCCESSFUL ON BROADWAY BUT NOT THAT EMBRACED IN HOLLYWOOD?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I-- I WISH I KNEW, AND THIS IS A STELLAR YEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING ON, ON BROADWAY. AND SOME YEARS REPORT AS STELLAR. I HOPE THAT THERE'S A DIALOGUE THAT HAPPENS NOW, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR, OF ALL DIFFERENT COLORS IN THE ROOM, TO QUOTE "HAMILTON" WHERE IT HAPPENS SO THEY CAN BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SOME OF THE DECISIONS TO GET MORE STORIES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR, OR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN GENERAL MORE IN HOLLYWOOD'S MINDSET.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE NICE. THAT WOULD BE LOVELY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: "LADY DAY AT EMERSON'S BAR & GRILL" PREMIERES MARCH 12 ON HBO. "SHUFFLE ALONG" WILL BE ALONG ANY DAY.

EGGS. TORADOL TO HELP WITH YOUR PAIN.
PLEASE, PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO, PLEASE.
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO, MICHELLE. YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE HERE AT ALL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I--
THERE'S BEEN AN ATTACK, A BIG ONE. I'M NOT SURE YET IF IT'S CHEMICAL OR NUCLEAR. BUT DOWN HERE, WE'RE SAFE.
I WAS DRIVING NORTH OF HERE.
YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT. I SAVED YOUR LIFE, MICHELLE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SAVING MY LIFE. I-- I GUESS I SHOULD-- I SHOULD GO TO A HOSPITAL NOW.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: THAT'S AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL DRESS.
I WANTED TO BRING SOME SPARKLE S.
Stephen:  IT SEEMS A VERY GLAMMUOUS FORM OF CAMOUFLAGE, ALMOST, THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON THERE.
THAT'S VERY TRUE.
Stephen: THE CHARACTER YOU'RE PLAYING INDEPENDENT MOVIE, WHAT IS HER NAME?
MICHELLE.
Stephen: SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD USE SOME CAMOUFLAGE AND GET AWAY--
FROM JOHN GOODMAN. I KNOW. HE'S SO SCARY AND I GREW UP LOVING JOHN GOODMAN. WHY ARE YOU SCARING ME.
Stephen: IT'S JUST HIS JOB. YOU ALSO GREW UP IN ROCKY MOUNTAIN, NORTH CAROLINA.
A LITTLE BIT. I WAS WORN THERE AND LIVED THERE UNTIL I WAS FIVE.
Stephen: THAT'SESOME.
I CLAIM IT.
Stephen: AND THEN YOU MOVED TO UTAH?
YES.
Stephen: HERE'S WHY I ASK, IN THE MOVIE THERE YOU'RE IN AN UNDERGROUND SHELTER HIDING, HE SAYS, FROM SOMETHING TERRIBLE OUTSIDE, AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT. OKAY, THERE ARE PREPPERS-- YOU KNOW WHAT A PREPPER IS?
I ABSOLUTELY CO.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURPRISED BEING FROM UTAH YOU KNOW WHAT PREPPERS ARE. DO YOU HAVE ANY PREPPERS IN YOUR FAMILY?
IT'S A SUBJECT THAT COMES UP A LOT IN MY FAMILY, STRANGELY --
HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE SOME BEEF JERKY THIS WEEKEND.
MY SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW WERE RAISING CHICK EPS FOR A WHILE BECAUSE IF THE THING HAPPENS, WE SHOULD HAVE SOME CHICKEN.
Stephen: RIGHT, SOME ATTACK CHICKENS TO PROTECT YOU FROM WHATEVER IT IS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: DO THEY EVER SAY WHAT THE THING IS? LIKE IF "THE THING "HAPPENS.
THE THING IN THE MOVIE.
Stephen: NO, YOUR SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS BUT THEY FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS COMING THIS, FEELING IN THE AIR.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, THE MOVIE ITSELF, IS THIS-- IT'S CALLED "10 CLOVERFIELD LANE," AND BECAUSE OF THE ASSOCIATION WITH MR. ABRAMS, IS IT-- IS IT A SEQUEL TO "CLOVERFIELD."
IT'S NOT A SEQUEL TO "CLOVERFIELD" BUT I WOULD SAY IT HAS A SPIRITUAL CONNECTION, WHICH J.J. HAS TALKED ABOUT AND I THINK IS AN APT WAY TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH I CAN ALL I CAN TELL YOU.
Stephen: IF YOU CHAINED YOU IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER, WOULD YOU TELL ME MORE?
NOT A WORD OUT OF ME.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO KIND OF KNOWN-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE THIS MONIKER-- BUT YOU'RE CALLED AWE MODERN SCREAM QUEEN.
A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YOU DO A LOT OF HORO.
I'VE DONE A FEW.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THAT MONIKER?
I THINK IT'S GREAT. I DON'T KNOW WHO STARTED CALLING ME THAT. IT'S ON MY WIKIPEDIA PAGE.
Stephen: IT HAS TO BE TRUE IF IT'S ON YOUR WIKIPEDIA PAGE.
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY CALLS ME THAT, THEY SAY, KNOWN FOR HER ISRAELIS ROLLS IN AND THE FIRST ONE THEY MENTION IS RING 2." IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A SCREAM QUEEN --
PARTICULARLY SCARY BACK OF YOUR HEAD. YOU MIGHT HAVE VOLDEMORT'S FACE BACK THERE.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF ODD PROJECTS. DO YOU SEEK THEM OUT, OR DOES THED ONNESS FIND YOU?
I'M NOT QUITE SURE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN DRAWN TO THE WEIRD, TO THE UNSETTLING, SINCE I WAS VERY LITTLE. I THINK PART OF IT WAS GROWING UP IN UTAH AND HAVING THINGS BE SO CLEAN AND NICE AND NORMAL.
Stephen: AND BIG OPEN SKIES.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE BETWEEN THE ANVIL OF THE SKY AND THE ROCK OF THE EARTH OUT THERE.
YES, VERY TRUE.
Stephen: MAKES YOU FEEL SMALL SOMETIMES.
MAKES YOU FEEL SMALL. MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT THE WEIRD UNDERBELLY OF THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE.
Stephen: IT SEEMS VERY CLEAN OUT THERE BUT THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF METH.
OH, THAT IS TRUE!
Stephen: THERE IS. THERE IS SO MUCH METH IN UTAH.
YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT UTAH.
Stephen: I DID A COUPLE OF STORIES FOR "THE DAILY SHOW" WAY BACK IN THE DAY AND I WENT TO A JAIL ONE DAY TO TALK ABOUT AN INCARCERATION STORY AND I SAID WHAT ARE THEY IN JAIL FOR? AND THEY SAID, THEY'RE HERE FOR METH. THEY SAID CHECK THE NEWS, I GUARANTEE YOU THERE WILL BE A REPORTER STANDING IN FRONT OF A FLAMING GARAGE.
IT'S SO TRUE.
Stephen: SURE ENOUGH THAT NIGHT THERE WAS.
GROWING UP, THERE WOULD BE SOME EXPLOSION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A METH LAB THAT JUST BLEW UP. AS A 10-YEAR-OLD,UN THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE JOINING THE CBS FAMILY THIS SUMMER BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A SHOW CALLED "BRAIN DEAD?" ANOTHER WEIRD ONE. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
ALIENS EATING BRAINS OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
Stephen: SO IT'S A HISTORICAL DRAMA.
YUP.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE "SPIRITUALLY RELATED TO "CLOVERFIELD." I HOPE IT SCARES ME.
IT WILL.
Stephen: MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD. "10 CLOVERFIELD LANE," IN THEATERS MARCH 11.
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW. " JOIN US MONDAY WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE JOHN OLIVER, GOLF CHAMPION JORDAN SPIETH, AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY NEW ORDER. BEFORE WE GO, ONE MORE THING--
YOU GO TO PROM WITH ME?
Stephen: YOU'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO SAY YES. NOW IT'S TIME FOR JAMES CORDON. GOOD NIGHT.
