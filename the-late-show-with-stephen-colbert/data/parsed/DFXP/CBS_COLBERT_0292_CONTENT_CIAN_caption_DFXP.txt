AND NOW "THE LATE SHOW" PRESENTS VALENTINE'S DAY CARDS WITH MICHAEL FLYNN. ( LAUGHTER )
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. I WILL NEVER RESIGN FROM BEING YOUR VALENTINE. TO MIKE PENCE, SORRY FOR LIEIN' TO YOU. I FEEL CLAWFUL, BUT OUR FRIENDSHIP IS STILL PURR-FECT. TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE GO TOGETHER LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND TREASON. AND FINALLY TO CHILI'S, TOO. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. ARE YOU HIRING? ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES CHRISTINE BARANSKI, A PERFORMANCE BY HANS ZIMMER AND STEPHEN MILLER, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HI, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SO LUCKY TO SPEND TONIGHT WITH MY TRUE LOVE-- THIS AUDIENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. WEAR SOMETHING LOOSE. BY NOW I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD THE NEWS -- THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS GOING GREAT. WE'RE GETTING TIRED OF WINNING. I'LL TELL YOU WHO REALLY GOT TIRED OF WINNING -- FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER AND MAN WHO DOESN'T SEE WHAT'S SO FUNNY, MICHAEL FLYNN. BECAUSE HE RESIGNED LAST NIGHT. NO SCANDAL. HE JUST WANTED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS RUSSIAN CONTACTS. BUT HE LEAVES BEHIND A DISTINGUISHED LEGACY OF THE SHORTEST TENURE IN HISTORY WITH ONLY 24 DAYS AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. ( PIANO RIFF ) JUST LIKE THAT -- HE'S GONE! FLYNN SURPASSED THE RECORD FORMERLY HELD BY GERALD FORD'S SECURITY ADVISER, ADMIRAL JOSEPH T. FRUITFLY. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED -- AFTER OBAMA IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA FOR MESSING WITH OUR ELECTION, FLYNN CALLED THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR, DISCUSSED THE SANCTIONS AND ALLEGEDLY SIGNALED THE KREMLIN TO EXPECT A REPRIEVE WHEN TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. AND IF THAT SIGNAL WASN'T ENOUGH, THEY GOT THE HINT WHEN TRUMP SIGNED HIS FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW AT FIRST, FLYNN DENIED ALL OF THIS. BUT HE GOT CAUGHT BECAUSE, TURNS OUT, WE LISTEN IN ON EVERY PHONE CALL TO THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. WHO KNEW? EVIDENTLY, NOT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, YOU DUMMY. ( APPLAUSE ) DUMMY, DUMMY! I KNEW! I KNEW THAT!
Jon: EYES!
Stephen: I KNEW THAT! AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THERE WERE RECORDINGS, FLYNN WENT FROM "ABSOLUTELY NOT" TO "HE COULDN'T BE CERTAIN THAT THE TOPIC NEVER CAME UP." I KNOW A WAY YOU CAN BE CERTAIN. AS THE NATIONAL SECURITY, YOU COULD ASK FOR THE TRANSCRIPT. COULD I SEE THAT, PLEASE? ( LAUGHTER ) I SHOULD REALLY NOT HAVE THIS JOB! ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S TREASON. ( APPLAUSE ) AT A SAY ONLY TREASON IS FUNNY. FLYNN EVEN LIED TO MIKE PENCE, WHO THEN WENT ON TV TO DEFEND FLYNN, AND NOW PENCE IS PISSED. YOU CAN TELL BY HIS COLD, HOLLOW-EYED STARE. WHICH IS ALSO HOW YOU CAN TELL HE'S HAPPY, IN LOVE, OR JUST HUNGRY. THE CRAZY PART IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS KNOWN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER LIED ABOUT HIS CONTACTS WITH RUSSIA FOR WEEKS. LAST MONTH, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL SALLY YATES TOLD THEM SHE BELIEVED FLYNN HAD MISLED SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND MIGHT BE VULNERABLE TO RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL. TRUMP DID NOTHING. BUT I'M SURE HE WAS GOING TO GET TO IT RIGHT AFTER ATTACKING NORDSTROM'S AND ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S RATINGS. THEN FIRING SALLY YATES. ( APPLAUSE ) GOT TO DO A LOT. YEAH. BUT NOW FLYNN IS GONE, AND NOW EVERYONE'S SPECULATING WHO'S GOING TO REPLACE HIM. ONE TOP CANDIDATE IS GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS, WHO IS A PROVEN LEADER AND HISTORIC, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE FIRST NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR WHO HAD TO CHECK WITH HIS PROBATION OFFICER. "IS IT OKAY IF I TAKE A JOB IN WASHINGTON?" "DAVID, HAVE YOU BEEN DOING DRUGS?" "NAW, NAW. I'VE BEEN CLEAN." "ANY WEAPONS?" "WELL, I AM ABOUT TO BE IN THE NUCLEAR CHAIN OF COMMAND." "DAVID, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS." BUT IF PETRAEUS DOESN'T GET THE JOB, TRUMP WILL MOST LIKELY GIVE IT TO GENERAL BRADIMIR PUDDIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BRADIMIR PUDDIN. REALLY SUPER GUY. OF COURSE, THIS IS A MAJOR BETRAYAL OF TRUST AND TRUMP IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED BOTH FLYNN AND THE RUSSIANS. JUST KIDDING. HE TWEETED, "THE REAL STORY HERE IS WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ILLEGAL LEAKS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON? WILL THESE LEAKS BE HAPPENING AS I DEAL ON NORTH KOREA ETC?" NO, THERE WON'T BE ANY LEAKS ON NORTH KOREA UNLESS YOUR HIGH SECURITY MEETING WAS INFILTRATED BY SECRET AGENT MAR-A-LAGO BUSBOY. ( LAUGHTER ) TODAY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY SEAN SPICER SPICESPLAINED WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS FORCED TO LET FLYNN GO.
WE GOT TO A POINT NOT BASED ON A LEGAL ISSUE, BUT BASED ON A TRUST ISSUE. THE EVOLVING AND ERODING LEVEL OF TRUST AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION IN A SERIES OF OTHER QUESTIONABLE INSTANCES IS WHAT LED THE PRESIDENT TO ASK FOR GENERAL FLYNN'S RESIGNATION.
STEPHEN: YES, IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IT WASN'T A LEGAL ISSUE, IT WAS A "TRUST" ISSUE. TRUMP STOPPED TRUSTING FLYNN, BECAUSE FLYNN DID SOMETHING THAT WAS "SO" DARN LEGAL -- THAT TRUMP HAD TO ASK FOR HIS RESIGNATION. SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT SEAN SPICER, BUT HE'S THE M.C. ESCHER OF (BLEEP). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT FORGIVE ME, MR. SPICER-- YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING INSANE?
THE IRONY OF THIS ENTIRE SITUATION IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY TOUGH ON RUSSIA.
STEPHEN: YES, TRUMP'S BEEN INCREDIBLY TOUGH ON RUSSIA. NO, INCREDIBLY TOUGH. I MEAN, THE DRY CLEANING BILLS ALONE! INCREDIBLY TOUGH. GOT TO FLIP THE MATTRESS. AND TRUMP'S LOOKING TO FILL A LOT OF JOBS. THE WWW.MONSTER.COM LISTING ASKS FOR "DEDICATED PUBLIC-SERVANTS WHO DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE MELISSA MCCARTHY." AND RUMOR HAS IT THAT HIS PICK FOR AMBASSADOR TO AUSTRIA IS CONCERT PIANIST, INDUSTRIALIST TRUMP SUPPORTER AND FRIENDLY GROCER WITH A DARK SECRET, PATRICK PARK. AMBASSADOR TO AUSTRIA IS PARK'S DREAM JOB. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S AN EXPERT IN THE HISTORY AND CUSTOMS AND HOPES TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S FRIENDSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. JUST KIDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S BECAUSE HE'S OBSESSED WITH "THE SOUND OF MUSIC" AND SAYS HE'S SEEN IT 75 TIMES. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ THE HILLS ARE ALIVE ♪ ♪ WITH THE SOUND OF CRAZY ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS. IS THIS HOW THIS WORKS NOW?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: I'VE SEEN THE LORD OF THE RINGS FIFTY TIMES. DOES THAT MAKE ME AMBASSADOR TO GONDOR? ( APPLAUSE ) I WOULD TAKE THE GIG. BUT PARK'S PROBABLY GOING TO GET THE AUSTRIA. THE ONLY OTHER PERSON TRUMP KNOWS WHO'S MORE OBSESSED WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC IS STEVE BANNON. BUT HE ROOTS FOR THE NAZIS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( BAND PLAYING ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. CHRISTINE BARANSKI IS HERE. PLUS, I SIT DOWN WITH A GROUP OF KIDS AND WRITE A MOVIE. BUT, WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL HAVE MORE OF MICHAEL FLYNN'S RESIGNATION. SO STICK AROUND.
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, JON!
Jon: HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!
Stephen: HOPE YOU SPEND IT WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE. YOU KNOW, WHO I WAS HOPING TO SPEND VALENTINE'S DAY'S DAY WITH IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADVISOR IS STEPHEN MILLER, ADVISES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
I'M PREPARED TO GO ON ANY SHOW, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.
Stephen: OKAY. SO WE INVITED HIM TO COME ON THIS SHOW TONIGHT IN THIS THEATER, AND THE MAN IS A MAN OF HIS WORD. IS HE HERE?
Jon: HE'S NOT HERE.
Stephen: HAVEN'T SEEN HIM?
Jon: NOT YET.
Stephen: OKAY. BECAUSE THIS IS A SHOW AND THIS IS A TIME AND THIS IS A WHERE.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. HE'S NOT SITTING IN WITH THE BAND OR ANYTHING TONIGHT?
Jon: NO, I MEAN, WE GOT A COW BELL FOR HIM IF HE COME AROUND.
Stephen: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. WE STILL HAVE 45 MINUTES FOR HIM TO SHOW UP, RIGHT?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: HE'S GOING TO BE HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, AS I SAID IN THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE YOU CAN SEE MY PANTS, MICHAEL FLYNN IS OUT AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NATURALLY, DEMOCRATS ARE UP IN ARMS.
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?
STEPHEN: I KNOW THAT ONE. NOT MUCH. AND ALL THE TIME. ( APPLAUSE ) OR HE TOLD FLYNN TO DO IT. OKAY? WE DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE CONGRESS WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, AS SOON AS THEY FINISH WITH HILLARY'S EMAIL SERVER. THE MAN IN CHARGE OF ANY INVESTIGATION WOULD BE CHAIRMAN FOR THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND BLOATED DONNIE OSMOND, JASON CHAFFETZ. CHAFFETZ IS THE GUY WHO COULD INVESTIGATE TRUMP'S TIES TO RUSSIA. EXCEPT HE WON'T.
COULD THERE BE A BROADER BIPARTISAN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE ADMINISTRATION'S TIES TO RUSSIA?
I THINK THAT SITUATION IS TAKING CARE OF ITSELF.
STEPHEN: REALLY? THAT'S LIKE A DOCTOR AT THE FUNERAL SAYING, "I WAS GOING TO TELL HIM THE DIAGNOSIS, BUT LOOKS LIKE IT TOOK CARE OF ITSELF!" ( LAUGHTER ) BUT FOR A MAJOR POLITICAL SCANDAL, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN CONSPICUOUSLY SILENT. EVERYBODY BUT NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN AND MAN WITH SLOWLY SHRINKING HEAD, CHRIS COLLINS. HE WENT ON CNN THIS MORNING TO EXPLAIN WHY ALL OF HIS COLLEAGUES WERE NOT COMMENTING ON FLYNN.
YOU ARE THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE GOP THAT WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS. NO WORD FROM RYAN, NO WORD FROM MCCONNELL. WHY IS EVERYBODY SO QUIET?
UH, WELL, IT'S UH UH VALENTINE'S DAY, AND I GUESS THEY'RE HAVING BREAKFAST WITH THEIR WIVES.
STEPHEN: OF COURSE! WHAT WAS I THINKING? VALENTINE'S DAY BREAKFAST! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT OLD TRADITION ALL OF US DO! THAT'S WHY REPUBLICANS WERE SO QUIET ON THIS ISSUE. THEY WERE ALL HAVING BREAKFAST WITH THEIR SWEETHEARTS. BUT IT DOES RAISE ANOTHER QUESTION. WHY WASN'T CONGRESSMAN COLLINS WITH HIS WIFE? TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WE GO LIVE VIA SATELLITE TO HIS WIFE, MRS. CONGRESSMAN COLLINS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MRS. CONGRESSMAN COLLINS, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.
OH, IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY? I HADN'T NOTICED.
STEPHEN: SO, DID YOU AND THE CONGRESSMAN HAVE VALENTINE'S DAY BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?
WELL, THAT WAS WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR, BUT HE WAS GONE BEFORE I WOKE UP. OFF TO CNN! SO, I HAD BREAKFAST FOR ONE.
STEPHEN: HUH. SO ALL OF YOUR HUSBAND'S COLLEAGUES WERE WITH THEIR SPOUSES DURING THIS MAJOR SCANDAL? IS THAT NORMAL?
I'M TOLD IT IS! APPARENTLY, ALL OF THEM WERE ELBOW DEEP IN HEART-SHAPED WAFFLES. GOOD FOR THEM! I'M HAPPY FOR THEM!
STEPHEN: WELL, I ASSUME YOU AND THE CONGRESSMAN HAVE SOME SPECIAL PLANS FOR TONIGHT?
OH, DEFINITELY STEPHEN! I'M SURE CONGRESSMAN COLLINS HAS A BIG SURPRISE PLANNED FOR WHENEVER HE GETS DONE TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNN. HE DOES LOVE THAT MICHAEL FLYNN. I'LL BET THEY HAD VALENTINE'S DAY LUNCH TOGETHER. BUT HE'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER. I'M SURE OF IT! I HAVE TO BE.
STEPHEN: WELL, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, MRS. COLLINS.
YEAH. HAPPY REGULAR DAY!
STEPHEN: MRS. CONGRESSMAN COLLINS EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE BACK WITH CHRISTINE BARANSKI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST IS AN EMMY AND TONY AWARD WINNER WHO STARRED FOR SEVEN SEASONS IN "THE GOOD WIFE." HER NEW SHOW, "THE GOOD FIGHT," PICKS UP WHERE THAT ONE LEFT OFF.
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT MY FINANCIAL SITUATION. I'M ALSO AFRAID I WOULD MISS PRACTICING THE LAW. I WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE KENDALL DEPOSITION AND I THOUGHT, MY GOD, I LOVE THIS. THIS IS WHAT I DO.
SO WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE? THAT I NOT LEAVE. THAT I CLOSE THE CASE AND, UM, THAT I STAY ON.
IN WHAT POSITION? THIS POSITION. MY CURRENT POSITION.
YOU SIGNED YOUR EXIT AGREEMENT.
WELL, YES, BUT I WOULD SUGGEST WE RIP THAT UP FOR THE MOMENT.
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS FOR US.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME CHRISTINE BARANSKI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
YOU'RE MY DATE! IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY.
Stephen: HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY. WOULD YOU LIKE?
I WOULD, THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT'S A WHITMAN SAMPLER, ONLY THE FINEST. ( LAUGHTER )
MY GRANDFATHER GAVE MY GRANDMOTHER WHITMAN SAMPLERS.
Stephen: ON VALENTINE'S DAY?
YES. YOU'RE MY DATE TONIGHT. WHERE'S THE KEY?
Stephen: WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? YOU POINT TO SOMETHING AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.
I LIKE DARK CHOCOLATE.
Stephen: THAT'S A CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE. GOOD CHOICE. YOU'RE CLASSY. ( APPLAUSE ) MMM, MMM --
OH, MINE'S GOOD.
Stephen: VERY TOUGH. ( LAUGHTER )
YOU REALIZE THAT CHARDONNAY --
Stephen: WOULD GO GREAT NOW.
IT WAS WELCHS WHITE GRAPE JUICE WHICH HAS SO MUCH SUGAR IN IT I'M ON A SUGAR BUZZ.
Stephen: I'M SO SORRY WE DIDN'T HAVE REAL WINE FOR YOU.
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: MY RULE IS YOU SHOULD PROBABLY EAT THE CARAMEL IN REHEARSE TOLL MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES. LICK YOUR TEETH A LITTLE BIT. LET ME SEE. MM-HMM. RIGHT OVER HERE. I REALLY AM YOUR DATE. BECAUSE ONLY -- ( LAUGHTER )
IS THAT RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, I'M SORRY, CHRISTINE. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) LAST TIME WE SAW EACH OTHER IS A SALUTE TO A GREAT AMERICAN SONG BOOK AT THE LINCOLN CENTER. A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW YOU HAVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SINGING VOICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHY AREN'T YOU ON BROADWAY MORE OFTEN?
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DOING SEVEN YEARS OF "THE GOOD WIFE" AND WE WENT RIGHT INTO "THE GOOD FIGHT."
Stephen: SLID RIGHT INTO IT?
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD IN COMMON IS THE FIRST MUSICAL I DID IN NEW YORK IS "COMPANY." I SAW YOU IN "COMPANY."
Stephen: I DID THAT FOR ONE WEEK IN LINCOLN CENTER. IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. WHAT WAS TERRIFYING TO YOU.
STEPHEN SONDHEIM, AND THAT VOICE, BOBBY, BOBBY, COMING OVER FOR DINNER --
Stephen: BOBBY BABY? YEAH.
Stephen: AN UNFORGETTABLE SOUND TRACK.
TRY SWEENY TODD. BUT AT THE SONG BOOK EVENT, I GOT TO BE ON STAGE WITH CAROL BURNETT AND JULIE ANDREWS.
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE! ( APPLAUSE ) I SEE YOU ON STAGE WITH THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE THE CONSUMMATE PRO. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY THE KIND OF PERFORMER WHO CAN LAND A PUNCH LINE LIKE A DIME IN A SHOT GLASS FROM 20 FEET. YOU'RE JUST ABSOLUTELY SUCH A BRILLIANT AND PRECISE PERFORMER, I JUST ADMIRE YOU SO MUCH.
CONTINUE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, NOW WE'VE GOT "THE GOOD FIGHT" --
IT'S CALLED "THE GOOD FIGHT."
Stephen: SOUNDS A LOT LIKE "THE GOOD WIFE."
MM-HMM.
Stephen: IN THIS -- HOW SIMILAR IS IT?
I'M SIMILAR IN THAT I WAS ON THE "THE GOOD WIFE" FOR SEVEN YEARS AND NOW I'M IN THE PILOT AND I'M THE OSTENSIBLE SERIES LEAD. BUT IT IS THE DIANE LOCKHART CHARACTER YOU SEE IN THE PILOT BEING VERY DIANE, YOU KNOW, AS YOU SAW IN THAT SCENE. YOU KNOW, SHE'S ABOUT TO RETIRE, SHE'S REACHED THE TOP OF HER GAME. SHE'S ALWAYS WELL DRESSED AND DIGNIFIED, BUT ONE-THIRD THE WAY THROUGH THE PILOT, SHE LOSES ALL HER MONEY IN A MADOFF PONZI SCHEME AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR WORK AND THAT'S THE SCENE YOU SAW IN HER OWN LAW FIRM. IT'S A WOMAN HAVING TO START HER LIFE AGAIN.
Stephen: NOW THAT -- I UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE BIGGEST PERKS IS -- I LOVE THIS SHOT. WHAT'S THIS SPHNCHTS THIS LASTS ABOUT TEN MINUTES BUT WHEN THEY'RE PROMOTING A SHOW, YOU'RE ON BILLBOARDS AND BUSES PASS BY AND YOUR PICTURE. THIS PAST SATURDAY, I WAS GOING TO THE THEATER IN BROOKLYN, AND I HAILED A CAB ON LEXINGTON AVENUE, AND IT PULLED UP AND I OPENED THE DOOR AND I WENT -- I SAID TO THE TAXI DRIVER. I SAID, COULD YOU JUST HOLD FOR A SECOND? STAND THERE TAKING PICTURES OF MYSELF. AND I SAID, I'M SORRY, MISTER, BUT THAT'S ME ON THE TOP OF THE CAB AND NEXT WEEK I WON'T BE ON THE TOP OF THE CAB.
Stephen: THOSE SOUND LIKE TWO LINES FROM A SONDHEIM SONG. ( LAUGHTER )
YES, EXACTLY!
Stephen: YOU HAD TO RESHOOT THE FIRST SCENE OF THE FIRST EPISODE, RIGHT?
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE WERE SHOOTING THE PILOT JUST BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE ELECTION, AND THE PILOT WAS WRITTEN ON THE SUPPOSITION WE WOULD HAVE A FEMALE PRESIDENT. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: I KNOW THE FEELING. ( LAUGHTER )
ANYWAY, SO THEN, YOU KNOW, WE SHOT THE PILOT, BUT IN EDITING, THEY REALIZED THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. IT WAS A BRAND-NEW -- A BRAVE NEW WORLD WE ARE NOW IN. SO THEY CHANGED THE OPENING OF THE PILOT, WHICH IS --
Stephen: WE ACTUALLY HAVE IT HERE.
DO YOU HAVE IT? I DONALD JOHN TRUMP DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR --
I DONALD JOHN TRUMP DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR --
-- THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE --
-- THAT I WILL FAITHFULLY EXECUTE --
-- THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HARD TO PLAY? DID YOU HAVE TO DIG DOWN DEEP FOR THOSE FEELINGS?
NO, BUT THIS WAS SHOT BEFORE THE INAUGURATION, IT WAS SHOT AFTER THE ELECTION BUT BEFORE THE INAUGURATION, SO I HADN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING THE INAUGURATION, BUT THE DIRECTOR SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE SHOCKED. I SAID, NO WORRY. I CAN PLAY THIS.
Stephen: NOW AS YOU WERE IMAGINING THIS, HOW BIG DID YOU IMAGINE THE CROWD WAS IN YOUR MIND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, ONE THING ABOUT THE NEW SERIES WHICH IS GREAT, I'M JEALOUS OF BUT IT'S ALSO QUITE SHOCKING IS THAT IT'S YOU, IT'S, YOU KNOW, A GREAT ENSEMBLE CAST, CUSH JUMBO.
GAME ON "THE GOOD WIFE," LUCCA QUINN.
Stephen: ON CBS ALL ACCESS, YOU GUYS CAN USE BAD LANGUAGE.
I EVEN DROPPED THE F WORD A FEW TIMES. IT WAS SO LIBERATING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I HAVE LINES HERE THAT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOU SAY.
WE'RE ON CABLE NOW.
Stephen: WE'LL BLUSTBLEEP IT FEW I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOU SAY THESE THINGS. THESE ARE LAWYER THINGS WITH BAD WORDS IN THEM.
I'M GOING TO SUBPOENA THE (BLEEP) OUT OF YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) I APPROACHED THE -- MAY I APPROACH THE (BLEEP) BENCH? YOUR HONOR, I (BLEEP) OBJECT!
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? SUSTAINED! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "THE GOOD FIGHT" APPEARS ON CBS ALL ACCESS STREAMING SUNDAY! STICK AROUND!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. JON, YOU SEEN THAT STEPHEN MILLER GUY AROUND?
Jon: OH, NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.
Jon: YEAH. COOL, COOL.
Stephen: LIKE A SKULL WITH A SCRAP OF HAIR. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SURE HE'S HERE. SO, FOLKS, A LOT OF PEOPLE WENT TO SEE MOVIES AROUND VALENTINE'S DAY, THAT'S A LOT OF FUN. AT LEAST MOVIE I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN. HAVE YOU SEEN "MONSTER TRUCKS"?
Jon: OH, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT 2017'S FIRST BIG FLOP. I DISAGREE BECAUSE 2017 ALSO INCLUDES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S GOT A STORY WE CAN ALL RELATE TO. A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR WHO BEFRIENDS A TENTACLED MONSTER WHO HIDES OUT IN HIS TRUCK AND GIVES IT SUPERPOWERS. STILL MORE REALISTIC THAN 50 SHADES OF GREY. ( APPLAUSE ) NOT ONLY A MOVIE FOR KIDS, BY IT'S A MOVIE BY KIDS, BECAUSE THIS IS TRUE, THE STUDIO EXECUTIVE WHO GREEN LIT THIS IDEA GOT THE IDEA FOR THE MOVIE FROM HIS 4-YEAR-OLD SON. BUT IT'S HOLLYWOOD SO HIS AGENT SAID HE WAS THREE. SO I DECIDED IF HE COULD DO IT, WHY CAN'T I STEAL IDEAS FROM CHILDREN, TOO. SO I GATHERED A GANG OF CREATIVE KIDS TO MAKE THE PERFECT MOVIE. THIS IS "KIDS PITCH." ♪ ♪ HI, EVERYBODY. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING!
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR THE STRATEGY SESSION HERE. HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE MOVIE MONSTER TRUCKS?
YES.
Stephen: YOU HAVE? ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THE MOVIE MONSTER TRUCKS?
YES!

Stephen: CAN YOU SHOW ME DEPRESSED? MM-HMM. LIKE ON A ZOLOFT TAB RIGHT NOW. VERY GOOD. HOLD ON. MASON, YOU'RE BACK. DID YOU SEE THE TRAILER TO MONSTER TRUCKS? DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT? NO YOU STILL DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT. WE'RE MAKING THE PERFECT MOVIE. IS IT ABOUT A BOY OR A GIRL?
GIRL. BOY. GIRL.
Stephen: CAN IT BE ABOUT A BOY AND A GIRL?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE BEST NAME FOR THE BOY'S NAME?
THEY'RE BOTH NAMED BOB.
Stephen: HOW DID THEY MEET? ONE LIKES TO BOARD SKATE, THE OTHER ICE SKATE.
Stephen: GOT IT. CAN THE BOY AND GIRL MEET AT SCHOOL?
Stephen: THEY MEET AT SCHOOL. HOW OLD? ELEMENTARY SCHOOL?
HIGH SCHOOL!
Stephen: NOW WE HAVE THE HEROS. WHO ARE THE BAD GUYS?
A SPY --
Stephen: I'M HEARING -- TELL ME IF I'M WRONG -- I'M HEARING THE BAD GUY COULD BE A SPY FROM THE GERMAN ARMY.
YEAH!
Stephen: WE LOVE IT? YEAH. I WOULDN'T WATCH THIS MOVIE IF I HAD TO!
Stephen: NOW, DOES THE MOVIE HAVE MONSTERS?
ROBOT MONSTERS. A ROBOT MONSTER PIG.
Stephen: A ROBOT MONSTER PIG. GREAT. NOW WHAT HAPPENS?
THE GERMAN SPY LOOKS IN THEIR HOUSE WITHOUT PERMISSION.
Stephen: WHAT DOES HE SEE? HE SEES A GUN IN HIS HOUSE.
Stephen: A GUN. IN THE WAR.
Stephen: WAS WAR AGAINST THE GERMANS?
YES.
Stephen: OKAY. RYAN.
WHEN HE WENT OUT, WHEN IT WAS NIGHTTIME WHEN ALL OF THEM WERE SNEAKING, HE SNEAKED AND GRABBED THE GUN.
Stephen: SO THE GERMAN STEALS THE GUN FROM DAD WHO FOUGHT THE GERMANS IN THE WAR.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND DOES THE BOY SEE IT HAPPEN? YES, ANNABELLE.
THE GERMAN SPY SEES SEGMENTS OF BLOOD.
Stephen: HE SEES SEGMENTS OF BLOOD. SO THERE'S BLOOD ON THE LAWN. PAUSE RIGHT HERE. TAKE A DEEP BREATH. ( BREATHING DEEPLY ) THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION -- WHOSE BLOOD?
THE DAD.
Stephen: THE DAD! WHAT DOES HE SAY TO THE KIDS RIGHT AS HE'S DYING? YES, REAGAN?
HE SAYS YOU SHOULD KILL A GERMAN SPY.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD KILL THE GERMAN SPY. SO NOW IT'S A REVENGE MOVIE.
YES!
Stephen: THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. DO THE BOY AND THE GIRL LIKE EACH OTHER?
YES.
Stephen: YES. NEXT STEP. DO THE BOY AND THE GIRL LOVE EACH OTHER?
YES. NO! AT THE END.
Stephen: AT THE END! YES!
Stephen: DO THEY KISS? YES! MAYBE. AND THEN THE BOY SAYS, DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL DANCE.
Stephen: OH, DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE SCHOOL DANCE. BEFORE OR AFTER THEY KISS?
AFTER.
Stephen: AFTER THE KISS. AND HAVE A BABY.
Stephen: ANTONIO, YOU JUST SAID THEY HAVE A BABY?
THIS GOES TO WHETHER IT'S A PG-13 OR MORE THAN THAT. DO WE KNOW HOW BABIES ARE MADE?
YES! BY RECIPES.
Stephen: BY RECIPES, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. VERY IMPORTANT TO USE ALL THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS.
I WANT TO PLAY THE BAD GUY.
Stephen: HERE'S THE PROBLEM, TO GET FUNDING FOR THE FILM, SO PEOPLE PAY MONEY, WE HAVE TO GIVE THE PARTS TO BIG STARS. WHO'S THE BIG STARS? WHO DO YOU LIKE?
ADINA MANZELL.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOYS FOR A SECOND. ANDREW GARFIELD?
WHO IS THAT?
Stephen: DID YOU EVER SEE THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN? HE'S THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN IN THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. HAVE YOU SEEN SCORSESE'S "SILENCE"? HE'S INCREDIBLE IN THAT. ABOUT JESUITS PRIESTS IN JAPAN IN THE 17th CENTURY, QUESTIONING THE ROLE OF FAITH IN YOUR LIFE AND HOW TRUE YOU HAVE TO BE TO YOURSELF IN THE FACE OF GREAT DANGER.
YES, YES, THAT'S -- GOOD.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) HOLD ON ONE SECOND, ANNABELLA. ANTONIO, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT'S ONE OF THE PUREST EXPRESSIONS OF HEART OF SCORSESE IN YEARS?
YES.
Stephen: WHO PLAYS THE BAD GUY, THE MOST EVIL ACTOR YOU CAN THINK OF.
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE BAD GUY.
Stephen: SURE. CAN IT BE A GIRL?
Stephen: INTERESTING. I LIKE THIS.
SO IF A GIRL IS PLAYING, LIKE, THE BAD --
Stephen: GERMAN? YEAH, THE GERMAN SPY, THEN SHE, LIKE, DISGUISES HERSELF AS, LIKE, A BOY.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT. THAT'S VERY TRENDY.
AND SHE FIGURES OUT THAT THEY'RE REALLY NICE, SO THEN SHE REVEALS THAT SHE'S A GIRL AND SHE'S ACTUALLY A SLAVE FOR HER FATHER IN THE GERMAN WAR, SO THEY CHASE AFTER THE ROBOT MONSTER.
Stephen: THEY CATCH THE GERMAN SPY WHERE?
THEY CATCH HIM IN IDAHO.
Stephen: THEY CATCH HIM IN IDAHO BECAUSE HE'S GOT A COMPOUND UP THERE WHERE HE'S A DOOMSDAY PREPPER AND LIVES UP THERE WITH OTHER MILITIA.
WHAT ABOUT THE NAME OF THE MOVIE.
Stephen: OH, THE NAME OF MOVIE? EXCELLENT! ANYBODY?
TEENAGE WAR.
Stephen: MASON, YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE? MASON, HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT SEEING MONSTER TRUCKS? NO. STILL DOESN'T WANT TO SEE IT. ONE, TWO, THREE! TEENAGE WARS! NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I AGREE! THE KIDS ARE GREAT. FANTASTIC! NOW, I'M SURE YOU'RE SAYING TO YOURSELF THAT'S A GREAT IDEA FOR A MOVIE. I WOULD TOTALLY WATCH A TRAILER FOR THAT. WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK. BECAUSE NOW I'M PROUD TO PRESENT THIS EXCLUSIVE WORLD PREMIERE FIRST LOOK TRAILER FOR THE NEW MOVIE "TEENAGE WAR." ( SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC )
