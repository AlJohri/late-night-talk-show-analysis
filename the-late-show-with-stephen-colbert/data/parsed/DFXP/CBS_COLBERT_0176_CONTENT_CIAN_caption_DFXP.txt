WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME ONE, WELCOME ALL. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, YOUR HOST THIS EVENING. AND THERE IS HUGE NEWS IN THE ELECTION. RIGHT NOW THE LATEST POLLS SHOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS TIED WITH DONALD TRUMP. THAT IS AMAZING. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? RIGHT NOW THE EXACT SAME NUMBER OF AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY AS DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT'S COMPLETELY-- IT'S VERY-- I DON'T KNOW. DOES THIS MEAN-- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS WHAT I AM DOING RIGHT HERE. BUT IT FEELS RIGHT. EVER SINCE THE DAMNING FBU REPORT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVERS CAME OUT, HER POLL NUMBERS HAVE NOT LOOKED GOOD. THOUGH THE TRUTH IS SHE MAY HAVE MUCH BETTER NUMBERS HIDDEN ON HER PRIVATE SERVER. WE DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW, NOW, NOW SHE'S IN A DEAD HEAT, A DEAD HEAT WITH DONALD TRUMP, EVEN THOUGH IN THE KEY SWING STATES OF OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND THIS IS TRUE, TRUMP IS CURRENTLY GETTING ZERO PERCENT SUPPORT FROM BLACK VOTERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ZERO! SO OBVIOUSLY EVERY POLL HAS A MARGIN OF ERROR, SO IT CAN ACTUALLY BE NEGATIVE THREE PERCENT. WE DON'T KNOW. AT THIS POINT, THE MATCH ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY EVEN. AT THIS POINT, THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY IS BASICALLY, IT'S BASICALLY, IT'S A COIN TOSS, OKAY, LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW. LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS GOING TO BE, HEAD, CLINTON, TAILS BE TRUMP. LET'S SEE WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE. AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I DON'T. ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE QUEASY, A LITTLE QUEASY. OF COURSE THOSE POLLS MIGHT BE ABOUT TO CHANGE DRAMICALLY BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET IN TO THE SHOW. DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE HIS ADVICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK. YEAH. IT CAME DOWN TO CHRIS CHRISTIE, INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE AND FORMER SPEK OF THE HOUSE, NEWT GINGRICH, A DIVERSE GROUP IF YOU GO BY BOWLING ABLE. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE MAP. BUT NOW TRUMP HAS MADE HIS ELECTION.
BREAKING NEWS FROM CAMPAIGN 2016. CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS CHOSEN THE GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, MIKE PENCE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. MIKE PENCE! AND YOU CAN TELL FROM THE EXCITEMENT IN THIS ROOM-- THAT IS ELECTRIC, YOU MAY KNOW MIKE PENCE FROM NOT KNOWING WHO MIKE PENCE IS. (LAUGHTER) BUT INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE IS NO STRANGER TO HEADLINES. HEADLINES LIKE, WHO IS INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NOW IT TURNS OUT WHEN THE STORY THAT TRUMP PICKED HIM WAS BEING REPORTED, TRUMP HADN'T CALLED MIKE PENCE YET. SO MIKE, IF YOU ARE WATCHING, SURPRISE. GOING TO BE FUN. IT'S GOING TO BE FUN, I PROMISE YOU. GOOD CHOICE. GOOD CHOICE. YAY! PENCE. THE QUESTION IS, OF COURSE, WHY PENCE? WELL, TRUMP HAS SAID FOR WEEKS NOW HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN ATTACK DOG. AND THE WHITE HAIRED SQUARE-JAWED PENCE MIGHT BE JUST THE TICKET. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE JUST GOT SOME FOOTAGE OF MIKE PENCE DEBATING THE DEMOCRATS IN THE INDIANA LEGISLATURE. TAKE THAT! TAKE THAT, MEDICAL FAMILY LEAVE! HEY. HEY. THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU ARE APPLAUDING THAT JOKE OR YOU JUST LOVE JOHNNY QUEST SO MUCH. HEY. I GOT TO SAY, TRUMP MAY NOT LET HODGEY INTO THE COUNTRY. WE'LL HAVE TO SAY. NO, IT'S TRUE. IT'S HIS-- POLICY, NOT MINE. HIS POLICY, NOT MINE. YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE? I LOVE CONSPIRACY THEORIES. OR DO I? (LAUGHTER) ONLY THE I LUM NATIONALI KNOW FOR SURE. SO RIGHT NOW I'M VERY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THIS FOOTAGE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WHERE YOU CAN SEE A WHITE OIJECT TRAVELING DOWN HEADING TOWARD EARTH MOVING PRETTY FAST AND JUST AS IT ENTERS THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE THE FEED CUTS OUT, ALL RIGHT. THIS MADE A LOT OF NOISE THIS WEEK BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CRYING COVERUP. BUT NASA CLAIMS THE STREAM CAN SOMETIMES BE LOST DUE TO TECHNICAL DEFICITS WHILE LIVE STREAMING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. OH REALLY? WELL, WHAT IS MORE LIKELY THAT A CAMERA MOUNTED ON A SPACE STATION ORBITING THE EARTH AT FIVE MILES A SECOND HAD A CONNECTION PROBLEM? OR THAT ALIENS HAVE INVADED? IT'S OCCAM'S RAZOR, OCCAM IS THE NAME OF THE ALIEN RACE THAT WILL ENSLAVE US ALL EVENTUALLY. AND THEY'VE GOT RAZORS FOR HANDS! (APPLAUSE) THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS. THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE SIMPLEST ANSWER. NOW I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS AT NASA, AND I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERES, BECAUSE I HAVE THE INSIDE SCOOP. THE INSIDE SCOOP IS THIS IS WHY THE GOVERNMENT CUT THE FEED, IT'S-- . ♪
Stephen: I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO NASA AND I ALSO WANT STO THANK THE FINE PEOPLE OF OUR ARMED FORCES WHO KEEP THIS PLANET SAFE FROM NOTHING AT ALL. NOW SAY HELLO TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY. HEY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE VERY KIND. PLEASE. COUPLE OF ORDERS OF BUSINESS. NEXT WEEK, NEXT WEEK WE ARE DOING SHOWS LIVE ALL WEEK LONG AFTER THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. SO YOU SEE IT THERE, WE MAKE FUN OF IT HERE. HALF AN HOUR LATER. PLEASE JOIN US. AND IT IS GOING TO BE I LIVE SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO BE BROADCASTING FROM THIS SPOT FROM 11:30 TO 12:30, SO I DONE KNOW WHO THE SPONSORS OF THE SHOW ARE BUT MY SPONSORS WILL BE RED BULL AND ADEROL, OKAY. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE ONE OTHER THING. THERE'S A GUY IN THE AUDIENCE HERE TONIGHT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE GUY, THIS GUY, THE GUY OUT THERE, HOW LONG AGO DID THIS HAPPEN, SIR? YOU ACTUALLY RAN INTO ME IN TIME'S SQUARE. (APPLAUSE) HOW LONG AGO? HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS IN TIME'S SQUARE.
EIGHT MONTHS AGO.
EIGHT MONTHS AGO IN TIMES SQUARE. YOU RAN UP TO MY CAR. I HAD MY WINNOW DOWN AND YOU THRUST YOUR HEAD THROUGH THE WINDOW AND YOU-- YOU-- YOU DID THIS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: ALL RIGHT? THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PHOTO AND YOUR PHONE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU AFTER SECURITY HAS A GOOD LOOK AT IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. I'LL PUT THAT RIGHT OVER THERE. THAT'S NICE. YOU KNOW, I FORGIVE YOU. I FORGIVE YOU. IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME FOR SHOWING THAT PHOTO. YOU KNOW, AS A CATHOLIC I OFTEN ASK MYSELF WHAT WOULD JESUS DO TO FILL THE NEXT SIX MINUTES OF AIR TIME? (LAUGHTER) WELL OBVIOUSLY FOR SWEEPS WE DO THE LOAVES AND THE FISHES AND WALK ON THE WATER AND RAISING OF THE DEAD. THOSE ARE CROWD PLEASERS AM BUT AFTER ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THINK HE WOULD OFFER FORGIVENESS FOR OUR SINS. AND THAT SOUNDS NICE. SO I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD EXAMINE MY CONSCIENCE WITH YOU, THE AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STANDARD DISCLAIMER. I'M NOT SURE IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, I ONCE TOLD MY DAUGHTER I SOLD A BUNCH OF HER GIRL SCOUT COOKIES AT WORK WHEN I REALLY JUST ATE THEM IN MY CAR. AUDIENCE, AUDIENCE, I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK, BUT IF I WAS, I STILL WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR TRIP TO ITALY. I ALWAYS GET A LITTLE SAD AND PANICKED WHEN THEY TELL ME MY HAMBURGER COMES WITH A CHOICE OF FRIES OR SALAD. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NOT ONLY DO I NOT BLAME MY FARTS ON THE DOG, BUT WHEN THE DOG FARTS, I TAKE CREDIT. SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES I WISH I HAD MORE HEALTH PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL ADS HAVE MORE PICNICS THAN I DO. (LAUGHTER) I TELL KIDS THAT AFTER HE'S DONE DELIVERING PRESENTS EVERY YEAR, SANTA GIVES BIRTH TO NEXT YEAR'S SANTA. HE'S NOT FAT, HE'S PREGNANT. (LAUGHTER) ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS IS EATING SOMETHING REALLY HEALTHY JUST BEFORE I DIE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHEN SOMEONE STARTS TELLING ME ABOUT A DREAM THEY HAD, I START HAVING A DREAM ABOUT PUNCHING THEM. (LAUGHTER) AUDIENCE, WHEN I'M ORDERING AT THE MCDONALD'S' DRIVE THRU SPEAKER, I PRETEND TO YELL AT MY KID IN THE BACKSEAT IT SO THEY DON'T KNOW THE HAPPY MEAL IS FOR ME. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU WANT THE SHAKE WITH THAT, BILLY? (LAUGHTER) WHEN I GET A FULL BODY SCAN AT THE AIRPORT, I ALWAYS SECRETLY HOPE THE GUY LOOKING AT THE SCREEN WILL GIVE ME ONE OF THESE. (LAUGHTER) I ONCE BURNED A BOAT JUST TO COLLECT THE INSURANCE MONEY AND ONLY LATER REMEMBERED THAT I DON'T OWN A BOAT. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE.
WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS. IF YOU FEEL TO NEED FORGIVENESS OR SOMETHING LIKE SAYING THE LINE WRONG THAT WAS IN THE PROMPTER JUST NOW, TWEET IT TO ME WITH THE HASHTAG LATE SHOW CONFESSIONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MR. BILL MAHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN CALLING BS SINCE 199 APPROXIMATE. PLEASE WELCOME BILL MAHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK.
REQUEST DON'T YOU PUT THE CHAIR OVER THERE?
Stephen: WHY.
BECAUSE WE'RE ENTERING ON THE WRONG SIDE FOR SITTING DOWN.
Stephen: REALLY?
I'M JUST-- .
Stephen: THAT'S HOW JOHNNY DID T YOU CAME IN OVER HERE AND CAME ACROSS HIS DESK AND SAT DOWN.
JOHNNY WHO, I'M A MILLENIAL.
Stephen: MY APOLOGIES AM HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING THE POKEMON GO! ARE YOU ENJOYING IT PEEK CHEU.
ENJOYING IT, I INHAVEN'TED IT.
Stephen: I DIDN'T HAVE A QUESTION, I WAS JUST SAYING HOW MUCH I ENJOYED HAVING YOU ON.
GREAT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T PREPARE EITHER.
Stephen: BUT I REALLY DISRK LAST TIME WERE YOU HERE, ONE OF MY FAVORITE INTERVIEWS I EVER HAD OR BEEN A PART OF. LIKE PLAYING TENNIS WITH SERENA WILLIAMS. YOU'RE A QUICK.
I AM A STRONG BLACK WOMAN.
Stephen: I'VE HEARD THAT ABOUT YOU. I HAVE HEARD THAT ABOUT YOU. NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THOUGH, WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN NOVEMBER YOU SAID THAT TRUMP WAS WEARING OFF.
IS HE.
Stephen: BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: BUT NOW BETWEEN, YOU SAID IN NOVEMBER HE WAS WEARING OFF THERE HAD BEEN NO PRIMARIES AND I SAID I WANTED YOU TO COME BACK TO SERVE YOU A BIG BOWL OF TRUMP WHEN HE STARTED WINNING PRIMARIES. AND YOU DOUBTED THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN.
WHAT A HORRIBLE THOUGHT.
Stephen: A BOWL OF TRURN.
A BOWL OF TRURP IS.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A BOWL OF TRUMP IS?
I DON'T REMEMBER THIS.
Stephen: SOME TRUMP STEAKS, DO YOU WANT SOME TRUMP STEAKS? UH-HUH. A LITTLE TRUMP WINE. A LITTLE TRUMP WINE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND OF COURSE, SOMETHING ORANGE. SOMETHING ORANGE. DO YOU WANT TO? CUZ HE WON. HE WON, YOU DOUBTED HE WOULD WIN.
I DON'T REMEMBER DOING THAT. BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU DO? YOU FINDED PLACE WHERE YOU WERE RIGHT AND THE GUEST WAS WRONG AND THEN YOU INVITE THEM-- .
Stephen: IT'S SO RARE, THOUGH. I GOT TO CELEBRATE THE TIMES THAT I AM RIGHT.
WHAT I REMEMBER IS THAT WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I ALWAYS SAID NO, I THINK HE IS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER.
Stephen: YEAH. ARE YOU SURPRISED AT ALL THAT HE GOT THE NOMINATION?
I THINK EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED THAT HE GOT THE NOMINATION.
Stephen: I WAS SHOCKED HE GOT THE NOMINATION.
OH GREAT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD EAT THAT BOWL. BUT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE. I MEAN I HAD A GUEST ON THE SHOW WHO WAS TELLING ME THAT ACTUALLY IT IS NOT SURPRISING BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, AMERICANS ARE NOT LOGICAL.
Stephen: NO, WE'RE VERY EMOTIONAL.
AND HE DOES NOT APPEAL TO LOGIC. I MEAN IT'S NOT ABOUT POLICY. IT'S ABOUT A FEELING. AND THAT FEELING IS THAT YOU KNOW WHO HAS GOTTEN A RAW BREAK IN AMERICA? WHITE MEN. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHAT HE IS SELLING. ALWAYS HILLARY IS PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD, THAT CARD THE WOMEN ALWAYS PLAY BY BEING BORN FEMALE.
Stephen: BUT IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR THE WOMEN, LIKE NEVER BEFORE. HE'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR THE WOMEN AND THE BLACKS LOVE HIM AND HE IS GOING TO WIN THE LATINOS. HE'S GOING TO WIN EVERYBODY.
BUT I DO TAKE YOUR POINT THAT WE HAVE NOT QUITE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP YET. AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WHAT THEY DO IN SERIAL KILLER MOVIES. (LAUGHTER) IN SERIAL KILLER MOVIES THE COPS CAN NEVER FILLING OUT-- FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEFEAT THE SERIAL KILLER. SO THEY GET ANOTHER SERIAL KILL TORE WORK WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO-- AND THAT'S WHAT WE-- .
Stephen: WHO IS THE SERIAL KILLER.
WE HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER NARCISSISTIC BILLIONAIRE. I'M THINKING EL CHAPO. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: MORE FAFER, AMIGO. PUTIN, PUTIN MIGHT BE A NICE PERSON.
PUTIN IS A GREAT ALLY OF HIS.
Stephen: PUTIN COMPLEMENTS TRUMP, TRUMP COMPLEMENTS PUTIN, IT'S SIM BIOTIC WITHNESS THAT IS ALL HE RESPONDS TO.
Stephen: COMPLIMENTS.
YES.
Stephen: HAVE YOU INTEFER VIEWED HIM.
Stephen: TRUMP.
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT PUTIN. I HAVE NOT. WHEN HE SUED ME HE KEPT SAYING THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THIS FEUD IS BECAUSE I WON'T DO HIS SHOW. LIKE I GIVE A [BLEEP] IF HE EVER DID MY SHOW. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK-- A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, A LOT OF HIS CRITICS SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DUMB. I DON'T THINK HE'S DUMB, ACTUALLY. HE SEEMS LIKE A SMART GUY WHO IS JUST USING HIS SMARTNESS IN A WAY THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH.
HE'S SMART IN A CERTAIN WAY, I WILL GIVE YOU THAT. I MEAN HE NEVER LOST TOUCH WITH HIS HIGH SCHOOL BULLY, YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER) HE KNOWS HOW TO BRAND THINGS. BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE HIM SMART. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. I MEAN BREXIT WAS A BIG ISSUE RECENTLY. THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT BREXIT, YOU KNOW, BREXIT, RIGHT?
Stephen: BIG FAN. BIG FAN. BIG FANS OF THE END OF THE WORLD ECONOMY OUT THERE.
WELL, THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT BREXIT A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE IT HAPPENED. AND WHAT? OKAY, SHIER, THEY HAD TO DEFINE IT FOR HIM. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE KURDS WERE. THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AND JUST LEARNING THINGS. HE'S LIKE A BABY WITH A MOBILE OVER-- BREXIT.
Stephen: FRESH EYES. FRESH EYES. (APPLAUSE)
NOT THE WAY THE COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.
Stephen: WERE YOU ON TV LAST WEEK? DID YOU HAVE A SHOW LAST WEEK.
NO, WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK, THAT IS WHERE I AM HERE.
Stephen: SO WERE WE. YOU HAVE A SHOW THIS FRIDAY.
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU BEGIN.
TOMORROW, FRIDAY.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. NICELY DONE. WE ARE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK ABOUT BILL'S SHOW ON FRIDAY, TOMORROW. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH OUR FRIEND BILL MAHER. BILL, AS I SAID, TOMORROW FRIDAY, YOU'VE GOT A SHOW LIVE.
I'M GLAD YOU REMINDED ME, I'VE GOT TO LEAVE.
Stephen: WE'LL WAIT A FEW MORE MINUTES, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED LAST WEEK? IT WAS ONE OF SORT OF THE SADDEST WEEKS ON MEMORY, GIVEN A CHANGE, MANY SAD WEEKS WE'VE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY AND ANNEED WORLD. DO YOU HAVE ANY REFLECTIONS ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK SPH.
ON BOTH SIDES OF IT. I MEAN FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, I'M A BIT OF A CYNIC. I THINK CIVILIZATION IS A MILE WIDE AND AN INCH DEEP. WITHOUT THE POLICE ON THE JOB, YOU KNOW, THAT MOVIE THE PURGE, IT WOULD BE THAT EVERY DAY. WITHOUT THE POLICE.
Stephen: I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SOCIAL ORDER AND THERE SHOULD BE SOME AUTHORITY. AND WITHOUT IT, YOU KNOW SHALL IT-- IN TWO DAYS WOULD YOU EAT MY LIVER. (LAUGHTER)
AND IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR YOU.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO OBVIOUSLY ANY TIME ANYBODY SHOOTS A POLICEMAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ABHOR ANT. AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ANDS, IFS OR BUTS ABOUT T SO I DON'T CONDONE IT BUT I UNDERSTAND TESTIMONY YOU CAN ONLY LOOK AT SO MANY VIDEOS OF SHOOTING UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE. I'M SURPRISED IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAPPEN BEFORE.
Stephen: HUH-UH HUH. AND SAID FAMOUSLY THAT THOSE WHO MAKE PEACEFUL REVOLUTION POSSIBLE MAKE VIOLENT REVOLUTION INEVITABLE.
RIGHT, YEAH.
Stephen: AND BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT IS TRYING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME AND IT COMES, IS PAID ATTENTION TO AND THEN IT PASSES.
THIS GOES BACK TO, WELL, CERTAINLY BEFORE. BUT ON TAPE RODNEY KING. RODNEY KING WAS WHAT, 1991? '92, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN WE ALL LOOKED AT THAT TAPE AND WE THOUGHT HOW CAN THESE COPS GET AWAY WITH THIS. YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT RODNEY KING DID, LEAD THEM ON A CHASE, THEY GOT HIM ON THE GROUND AND THERE ARE SIX GUYS WHALING ON HIM WITH A BATON AND SHOW THEY GET OFF. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG HERE THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO OBVIOUSLY VIOLENCE IS WRONG ON BOTH SIDES. BUT YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TALK   TALKING ABOUT POLICE CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME. LIKE I SAY, WE ALL NEED THE POLICE. I THINK WE RESPECT THEM BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH POLICE CULTURE. AND I DON'T THINK MOST POLICEMAN ARE BAD PEOPLE OR WOULD DO THE THINGS WE SEE ON TAPE AM BUT THERE IS THAT THIN BLUE LINE MENTALITY WHERE THEY PROTECT THEIR OWN. AND I THINK THAT-- .
Stephen: YOU THINK IT'S DIFFERENT NOW, DO YOU THINK IT'S WORSE THAN IT USED TO BE OR DO YOU THINK THAT WE JUST GET TO SEE SOME OF THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY NOW.
THAT'S TRUE TOO. WE SEE IT MORE. I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S ANY BETTER. I THINK WE JUST SEE IT. AND I THINK THE POLICE KIND OF LIKE THE PRIESTHOOD, THEY ATTRACT THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE SOMETIMES. SORRY.
Stephen: THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
BUT IT'S KIND OF TRUE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO POLICE WORK BECAUSE THEY WERE THE PERSON WHO WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG, THEY HAD NO AUTHORITY. THEY WERE KIND OF LOSERS AND NOW THEY WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO LORD IT OVER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CANNOT BE REVENGE FOR HIGH SCHOOL. AND WE HAVE TO-- .
Stephen: YOU ARE THINKING OF A FEW PEOPLE. ARE YOU SORT OF PAINTING WITH A BROAD BRUSH THERE?
WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT CERTAINLY, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH VIDEOS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY COPS WHO ACT LIKE THAT. I MEAN ANY IS TOO MANY. AND YES, I DO THINK THAT'S A TYPE OF PERSON WHO GOES INTO POLICE WORK. AND BY THE WAY, YOU CAN ELIMINATE THAT. THERE ARE PSYCHOLOGY TESTS THAT YOU CAN TAKE. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE POLICEMEN. I THINK MOST POLICEMAN WANT TO DO IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. I THINK MOST DO DO IT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY SAY IT'S A DIFFICULT JOB, IT IS A DIFFICULT JOB. THAT YOU VOLUNTEERED FOR. YOU KNOW. NO ONE IS CON SCRIPTED INTO POLICE WORK. YOU WANTED TO DO IT. IT'S DANGEROUS, YES. BUT IT SAYS TO PROTECT AND SERVE ON THIS SIDE OF THE CARD THAT REFERS TO US, YOU ARE PROTECTING AND SERVING. YOU'RE NOT THERE TO PROTECH YOURSELF.
Stephen: THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH IN ANYWAY THE TRAGEDY OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK.
DID I SAY IT DOES?
Stephen: NO, BUT THE IMPLICATION OF THAT WHEN I HEAR THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN SOMETIMES.
NO, I DISN SAY THAT EITHER. I SAID I'M SURPRISED THAT IT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE. YOU CANNOT SHOOT UNARMED PEOPLE CONTINUE ALLLY WITHOUT SOMEONE FIRING BACK. SORRY. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. AND I HOPE IT GETS BETTER IN THIS COUNTRY. IT SHOULD GET BETTER. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE VIOLENCE. BUT YES, I DO THINK POLICE CULTURE HAS TO CHANGE TO A DEGREE. IT'S ONLY BEEN RECENTLY WHEN WE SAW THESE HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS AND ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY EVEN SAID WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS WAS WRONG. BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALWAYS, THEY WERE DOING IT BY THE BOOK. BY THE BOOK? WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED A NEW BOOK. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THERE IS SOME SENSE OF-- WITHIN THE FUNNY PART OF THE SHOW IS OVER.
Stephen: THIS IS ALL BEING EDITED OUT. NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT TO AIR, BILL. WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH THE POKEMON JOKES FOR ALL OF IT. SO YOU KNOW, WE SAID EARLIER THAT IT'S HAPPENING ON BOTH SIDES. DO YOU THINK THERE IS A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T END UP BEING SIDES. THERE COULD BE A SESATION OF A SENSE THAT THERE IS A SIDE. AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT LEADS TO ANOTHER ERA OF HOSTILITY.
IT SHOULDN'T BE SUCH, BUT IT DOES HAVE TO START WITH THE POLICE STOP SHOOTING UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE. AND THE POLICE STOP BUILDING FOR THE GUN-- STOP GOING FOR THE GUN IMMEDIATELY. AGAIN, IT IS A DANGEROUS JOB. I'M SORRY IT IS, BUT YOU VOLUNTEERED FOR IT IT'S LIKE A PROBING TOLL GUEST GETTING TO THE OFFICE AND GOING OH MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOOKING AT [BLEEP] ALL DAY. (LAUGHTER) WHEN YOU'RE A COP, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT [BLEEP] ALL DAY. THAT IS THE JOB YOU SIGNED UP FOR. AND THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS, YOU CAN'T JUST BAM BAM BAM. SO I DON'T GET HURT. AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK MOST COPS DO THAT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY ARE TRAINED INTO THIS BEHAVIOR.
I DON'T THINK THEY ARE TRAINED ENOUGH OR WELL ENOUGH. I DON'T. I MEAN WE'VE SEEN POLICE SHOOTINGS WHERE THEY FIRED LIKE A LOT OF TIMES VERY CLOSE RANGE. AND DIDN'T EVEN HIT THE GUY. SPEND SOME TIME AT THE RANGE.
Stephen: OR BE A STORMTROOPER. PLAF (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT IN THE LATE 60ST PEOPLE CALLED THE COPS PIGS WHICH WAS VERY, VERY WRONG. THAT WAS THE MENTALITY. AND EVER SINCE THEN, WE'VE KIND OF BEEN TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THAT. AND WE PUT THEM ON A PEDESTAL. YOU KNOW, WE-- YOU CAN'T CRITICIZE, YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. THEY'RE ALWAYS HEROES. WELL, THEY OFTEN ARE HEROES BUT THEY ARE ALSO HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE DOING A HUMAN JOB. AND AGAIN MOST OF THEM I THINK LIKE THEIR JOB. BECAUSE YES, YOU SEE SOME OF THE DISRESPECT. AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE DISRESPECTED. BUT TO BE A COP IS ALSO HAS A LOT OF PERKS. A LOT OF PEOPLE KISSING YOUR ASS. A LOT OF FREE DONUTS. A LOT OF FREE STUFF, YOU KNOW. AND THAT'S FINE. BUT THAT'S THE JOB. AND I THINK MOST OF THEM WOULD WANT TO KEEP DOING IT.
Stephen: IT'S NOT A JOB THAT I WOULD WANT TO DO.
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T GO INTO IT. AND THEY DON'T WANT YOUR JOB.
Stephen: THEY MIGHT. IT'S A NICE JOB. I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULDN'T WANT THIS JOB. IT'S A VERY NICE JOB. I SIT HERE, I TALK TO YOU, THEY PAY ME A LOT OF MONEY. I WAS JUST DRINKING.
YOU'RE RIGHT, I TAKE THAT BACK. THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR JOB.
Stephen: THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR JOB TOO, BECAUSE YOURSES IS ONCE A WEEK, THAT SOUNDS REALLY EASY.
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT. CUZ I HAVE TO MAKE IT GOOD. ANYWAY.
OH!
Stephen: REALTIME AIRS FRIDAYS ON HBO AND CHECK OUT SPECIAL CONVENTION EPISODES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. BILL MAHER, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. (APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE).

Stephen: PLAYING OMAR, WERE YOU SORT OF, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THE BREAKOUT CHARACTER OF WHAT IS ALREADY A TREMENDOUS SHOW. DID THAT CHANGE YOUR LIFE PLAY OG MAR.
IT DID. IT PUT ME ON THE RADAR A LITTLE BIT. MY BREAKOUT ROLE, DEFINITELY, IT CHANGED MY LIFE. BUT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL IT KIND OF GREW ME UP. I QUAIT MY YEARS WITH THE TIMES ON THE WIRE LOOK MY COLLEGE YEARS.
I LEARNED REALLY THE BUSINESS FROM, FINANCIALLY HOW TO MANAGE MY MONEY BETTER, HOW TO, YOU KNOW, HOW TO RIDE A CHARACTER OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. NORMALLY, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD JUST BE IN AND OUT GUEST APPEARANCE HERE, BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. BUT OMAR GOT ALL THIS-- THESE FIVE YEARS TO BUILD.
Stephen: YOU GOT TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER.
YEAH.
Stephen: WAS IT HARD TO LET HIM GO WHEN THAT WAS OVER.
MAN, I-- YEAH, IF ANYBODY KNOWS MY STORY, HI A LITTLE BIT-- I HAD A BREAK. UP UNTIL THE WIRE, YOU KNOW, REGULAR KID ON THE STREET.
Stephen: WERE YOU A PERFORMER BEFORE THAT.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, BACKGROUND DANCE, DO MY LITTLE STUFF.
Stephen: BACKGROUND DANCER. WHO FOR.
I BACKGROUND DANCE FOR COUNTRIES KAL-- CRYSTAL WATER, MISTY ELLIOTT, JUST TO NAME A FEW. I USED TO BOOB QUEE BACK IF THE DAY. BUT YOU KNOW, THE CHARACTER OF OMAR THRUSTED ME INTO THE LIMELIGHT AND YOU KNOW, I WAS-- I HAD A VERY LOW SELF-ESTEEM GROWING UP, HIGH NEED TO BE ACCEPTED. CORNY KID, IN PROT JECTS. AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN OMAR GOT, YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW, GETSING THE RESPECT, YOU KNOW, FROM PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY TOOK MY LUNCH MONEY AS A KID. SO IT KIND OF-- .
Stephen: DID YOU START TO AK LIKE OMAR. DID YOU WANT TO BE OMAR IN ANYWAY.
I COULDN'T BE OMAR. I DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS. THAT DUDE HAD, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU KNOW, I WORE THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT SEVEN OUT OF TEN PEOPLE CALLING YOU OMAR WITH ALL THIS LIKE ADMIRATION.
Stephen: LIKE PEOPLE ON THE STREET WOULD CALL YOU OMAR.
THE LINES GOT BLURRED. THE LINES OF REALITY GOT BLURRED.
I KNOW, PEOPLE CALL ME STEF BE COLBERT ALL THE TIME.
I WANT TO BE STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: I KIND OF WANT TO BE OMAR. I LIKE TO HAVE THOSE BALLS. WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT VICELAND AND THE NEW SHOW. BLACK MARKET. YOU'RE GOING ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND MEETING PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF ON THE SHADY SIDE OF BUSINESSES OR OCCUPATIONS OR CERTAINLY PASTTIMES. WHAT MOTIVATED TO YOU DO THIS. WHY DID YOU WANT TO TELL THESE STORIES?
YOU KNOW, IN THE BEGINNING, I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM SPIKE'S OFFICE. AND-- .
Stephen: SPIKE JONES.
SPIKE JONES, WANTS TO MEET YOU. LIKE OKAY, WE GO MEET SPIKE JONES. BASICALLY HE JUST OFFERED ME THE JOB AND I WAS LIKE WELL, YOU DON'T TELL SPIKE JONES NO, BUT I HAD NOT A CLUE WHAT THE HECK THEY WANTED TO DO WITH ME. I WAS FREAKING OUT. LIKE WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH ME, YOU KNOW. OKAY, YEAH, COOL, COOL, OKAY. YOU KNOW.
Stephen: LIKE A FORM OF JOURNALISM.
IT IS. I HAVE WAY TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT JOURNALISTS DO, ESPECIALLY INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS WHEN THEY GO OUT THERE AND REALLY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AND GET THE TRUTH. I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR THAT TO TRY TO JUMP INTO IT IS WITH A LITTLE INTIMIDATED. AND THE FIRST COUPLE OF EPISODES YOU SEE ME TRYING TO STRUGGLE, THE OCD AKER IN ME, HAVE I TO LEARN MY LINES AND LOOK LIKE I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT FAILED MISERABLY. AND I GOT A REALITY CHECK. I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, MIKE, LET IT GO. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW I'M TALKING TO MYSELF IN THE MIRROR. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW ARE YOU NOT THE SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER. SO STOP FAKING IT. JUST GO OUT THERE AND LET PEOPLE SEE YOU LEARN. LET PEOPLE SEE YOU JUST ASK THE QUESTION. MY MOM ALWAYS SAID THE DUMBEST QUESTION IS THE ONE YOU DON'T ASK. AND I JUST WENT OUT THERE, JUST BEING ME AND LETTING THE AUDIENCE SEE ME LEARN, SEE ME GET INVITED INTO THE WORLD. AND IT WAS AN ORGANIC, IT BECAME REAL AND THAT IS WHERE THE MAGIC STARTED TO HAPPEN. YOU GOT THESE MOMENTS THAT YOU CAN'T PLAN FOR. THAT'S BLACK MARKET. I GOT TO MEET A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.

I ALSO WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, ON THIS JOURNEY, WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IS I GOT TO MEET A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE. EVERYBODY IS IN PAIN. AND YOU KNOW, WHETHER WE'RE WHITE, BLACK, MALE, FEMALEK YOUNG, OLD A CROSS THE WORLD, CAPETOWN, LONDON, LIVERPOOL, CHICAGO, ATLANTA, IT WAS ONE COMMON THREAD. NO ONE WAS PROUD OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING BREAKING THE LAW AND LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. AND IF THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY, THEY WOULD DID BETTER, YOU KNOW. AND THAT WAS ACROSS THE LINE, EVERYONE SHARED THAT SENTIMENTS AND IT JUST MADE ME, IT JUST, I DON'T KNOW. I FELT, I FEEL ENLIGHTENED. IT WAS A LOT OF DARKNESS BUT I FEEL ENLIGHTENED FOR BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE PEOPLE'S PAIN.
