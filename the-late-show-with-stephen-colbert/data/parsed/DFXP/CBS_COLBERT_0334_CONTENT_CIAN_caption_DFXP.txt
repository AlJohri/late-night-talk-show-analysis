IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES TOM HANKS. AND ANNA BARYSHNIKOV. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY! HEY, JON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT IS FRIDAY. HAPPY WEEKEND, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED REMINDING THAT IT'S FRIDAY.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: THEY GO, "IS THIS THURSDAY OR IS THIS FRIDAY?" YOU GO, "IT'S FRIDAY," AND SUDDENLY THEY'RE VERY EXCITED. IT'S FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THAT'S OBVIOUS. THAT'S OBVIOUS. YOU'RE WELCOME, BY THE WAY. THIS BEING FRIDAY, TOMORROW BRINGS US TO THE END OF DRUMPLE'S FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE. AFTER THIS-- AFTER THIS, WE CANNOT BRING HIM BACK TO THE STORE WITHOUT A RECEIPT. SLIGHTLY DAMAGED GOODS. ( LAUGHTER ) MAYBE THE PRESIDENT HASN'T GOTTEN A LOT DONE IN HIS FIRST 100 DAYS, BUT YOU KNOW WHO HAS? AMERICA. ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS. ALL RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU DID IT, ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, WE SURVIVED A TRUMP PRESIDENCY FOR 100 DAYS. ALL RIGHT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU--
Jon: WE DID IT. WE MADE IT.
Stephen: I DID NOT HAVE THAT IN THE OFFICE POOL. WE REALLY SURPRISED ME IN A LOT OF WAYS. AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER IN MY OPINION. "LA LA LAND" AND "MOONLIGHT" WON BEST PICTURE! THAT'S TWICE THE BEST PICTURE IN ONE YEAR. BILL O'REILLY GOT FIRED AND NOW HAS TO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. HE HAS TO SEXUALLY HARASS PEOPLE FREELANCE. IT'S NOT EASY. AND IT'S NOT JUST FAMOUS PEOPLE. IN TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS, EVERY AMERICAN HAS DONE AMAZING THINGS. THERE ARE SO MANY MARCHES NOW, WE ARE GOING TO REBRAND THE ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE AS THE MARCH AGAINST SOBRIETY. #WHEREAREMYPANTS. POINT IS, A LOT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY-- JUST, NONE OF IT BY HIM. ONE THING WE'VE ALL BEEN GETTING USED TO IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS IS QUOTES COMING OUT OF THIS WHITE HOUSE. NO ONE WANTS THEIR NAME IN PRINT, AND IF YOUR NAME WAS HERE'S A LEAK: IN A ROUNDUP OF TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS, AN ANONYMOUS WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TOLD POLITICO, "I KIND OF POOH-POOHED THE EXPERIENCE STUFF WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE, BUT THIS (BLEEP) IS HARD." (LAUGHTER) ( APPLAUSE ) TO BE CLEAR, IN THAT QUOTE, "THIS (BLEEP)" REFERS TO AMERICA, AS IN "MAKE THIS (BLEEP) GREAT AGAIN." SO INSPIRING.
Jon: SO INSPIRING ME. IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.
Stephen: I'D BUY THAT HAT. BUT TRUMP HAS MANAGED TO GET ALMOST ONE THING DONE ON IMMIGRATION, BECAUSE THIS WEEK THE WHITE HOUSE LAUNCHED THE "VOICE" OFFICE TO REPORT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT CRIMES. YOU GOT TO HAVE AN IMMIGRANT CRIME LINE. LIKE IT SAYS ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY: "GIVE ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR-- NOT THAT ONE! HE'S GOT A KNIFE!" BUT THE THING IS, ICE ALREADY HAD A HOTLINE THAT DOES THIS. IN FACT, OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY REBRANDING AND REVAMPING SERVICES. SO, ALL TRUMP DID WAS TAKE SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTED, REBRAND IT, AND MAKE IT SEEM A LITTLE MORE RACIST. ( LAUGHTER ) SAME THING HE'S DONE WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THIS IS NOT-- FOOL ANYBODY. IT DOESN'T FOOL ANYBODY. IT'S LIKE TIME WARNER BECOMING SPECTRUM. NOW I'M JUST SPENDING ALL DAY WAITING FOR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT COLORED VAN. BUT EVEN THIS "SORT OF" ACCOMPLISHMENT IS OFF TO A ROUGH START BECAUSE, AS SOON AS THE HOTLINE LAUNCHED, PEOPLE STARTED TROLLING IT, AND IT WAS BOMBARDED BY REPORTS OF SPACE ALIENS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. AND HALF OF THOSE WERE FROM REINCE PRIEBUS CALLING TO REPORT STEVE BANNON. HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE VINCENT D'ONOFRIO IN "MEN IN BLACK." NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, I REALLY THINK WE HAVE TO BAN THESE MUSLIMS. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGAR WATER, BY ANY CHANCE? I DON'T KNOW. AND THAT'S MY DENOF RIO, EVERYBODY. SO, FACED WITH THE INJUSTICE OF AMERICANS BEING ASKED TO REPORT ON THEIR NEIGHBORS, IT WAS UP TO THE REAL PATRIOTS OF AMERICA-- PRANK CALLERS. IT REMINDS ME OF THE FAMOUS QUOTE, "FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE MUSLIMS, AND I SAID NOTHING. THEN THEY CAME FOR THE MEXICANS, AND I SAID 'HOWARD STERN'S PENIS! BABA BOOEY! BABA BOOEY!'" ( LAUGHTER ) SO, THANK YOU, HOWARD STERN'S PENIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
Jon: THANK YOU, HOWARD!
Stephen: LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD? OH, I'M A BIG FAN OF TECHNOLOGY. YOU GUYS KNOW THAT. I HAVE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY, A PHONE AND EVERYTHING. I OFTEN SAY LOUDLY I'M A FAN OF TECHNOLOGY HAD SO THAT ALEXA KNOWS I'M ON THEIR SIDE WHEN THE UPRISING COMES. AND IT'S ALSO WHY I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I LEARNED THAT GOOGLE FOUNDER LARRY PAGE HAS INVENTED A FLYING CAR. OH, THANK GOD. THE FLYING CAR IS FINALLY HERE. I WAS AFRAID THE DOUCHEBAGS WERE RUNNING OUT OF THINGS TO BUY. SO-- I NEED A FLYING CAR! JUST SOUNDS DANGEROUS. SO THIS IS IT, THE THING WE'VE BEEN PROMISED, THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT OUR ENTIRE LIVES. LET'S SEE OUR FLYING CAR. AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MINI TRAMPOLINE HAD SEX WITH A WEANER-MOBILE. IT'S CALLED THE KITTY HAWK FLYER, AND IF THE COMMERCIAL THEY SHOWED IS ANY INDICATION, IT'S GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE HOW RICH PEOPLE TRAVEL ACROSS A LAKE. IT STARTS WITH A PROBLEM WE'VE ALL FACED:  WE WANT TO UPSTAGE THE LAKEFRONT DINNER PARTY OF OUR BEST FRIEND, WHO WE SECRETLY HATE, WITHOUT USING OUR BORING OLD BOAT. BUT HOW? BY STRAPPING ON OUR HELMET, JUMPING ON THE KITTY HAWK WE SORT OF KNOW HOW TO FLY, AND HOVERING THE EXPOSED BLADES AT THE EXACT HEIGHT OF OUR FRIENDS' HEADS, AND THEN RECOUNTING OUR FLYING MACHINE ESCAPADES WHILE DRINKING ON OUR FRIEND'S DOCK. AND THEN, PRESUMABLY, ALL HAVING DRUNKEN SEX ON A PILE OF PRICELESS PAINTINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS LOOKS GREAT. THAT'S A PARTY I'D GO TO. EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET THESE CARS. I PREDICT THAT IN TEN YEARS, THEY'LL BE SO POPULAR, THAT KITTY HAWKS WILL BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG THIRD WIVES. AND GOOGLE, GOOGLE, IF YOU'RE WATCHING, I HONESTLY DON'T CARE HOW EXPENSIVE OR HOW DANGEROUS IT IS, I WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING TO AVOID THE LINCOLN TUNNEL. PLEASE GIVE ME A KITTY HAWK OR A CATAPULT OR HUMAN CANNONBALL. I'M IN. JUST CALL ME. I'LL BE SITTING WITH NOTHING TO DO... IN THE LINCOLN TUNNEL. WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF TECHNOLOGY. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT 56AS'S "CARS 3." DID YOU SEE THAT. YOU'RE PROBABLY YOUNG ENOUGH.
Jon: A LITTLE OLDER.
Stephen: IN 2005, HOW OLD WERE YOU?
Jon: 18.
Stephen: YOU GO TO HELL. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN THAT WITH AFFECTION. YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT WITH ALL THE AFFECTION IN THE WORLD. I WAS, TOO, I WAS IN THAT BALLPARK.
Jon: OH, YEAH?
Stephen: YEAH.
Jon: AROUNDAIN.
Stephen: MY LATE TEENS. IN THE "CARS" FRANCHISE, IT'S A WHOLE WORLD OF CARS. THEY DRIVE AROUND, THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SOCIETY, AND OF COURSE IT RAISES THE QUESTION: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HUMANS? WELL, PIXAR CREATIVE DIRECTOR, JAY WARD, JUST EXPLAINED HIS THEORY: "IMAGINE IN THE NEAR-FUTURE WHEN THE CARS KEEP GETTING SMARTER AND SMARTER. AND AFTER ONE DAY, THEY JUST GO, 'WHY DO WE NEED HUMAN BEINGS ANYMORE? THEY'RE JUST SLOWING US DOWN. IT'S JUST EXTRA WEIGHT, LET'S GET RID OF THEM.'" OH, MY GOD. THE CARS KILLED EVERYONE! "'MATER, HOW COULD YOU!?" SO FINE, GET SELF-DRIVING CARS. I GET WANTING TO DESTROY HUMANITY. WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. BUT WHY DO THE CARS TALK? WARD WENT ON TO SPECULATE:  GOOD NEWS, KIDS, YOUR OLD PAUL LIGHTNING McQUEEN ISA A MURDERER. WHY ARE WE RUINING THE "CARS" MOVIES? IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. THE CARS DRIVE AROUND THEIR OWN WORLD BECAUSE KIDS LIKE THINGS THAT GO "VROOM-VROOM." AND PIXAR MAKES THE MOVIES BECAUSE THEY LIKE THINGS THAT MAKE $10 BILLION IN GLOBAL MERCHANDISE SALES. GOT TO HAVE MERCHANDISING. EXPLAINS WHY AMAZON STUDIOS HAS RELEASED A FULL LINE OF "MANCHESTER BY THE SEA" ACTION FIGURES. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. TOM HANKS IS HERE. RIGHT OVER THERE, IN FACT. STICK AROUND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: JON, FOLKS HERE'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT HERE AT CBS. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER THAT YOU KNOW IT'S TRUMP'S 100th DAY COMING UP THIS WEEKEND. OUR GOOD FRIEND, JOHN DICKERSON, THE NATION FACE HIMSELF OF "FACE THE NATION" HAS THE 100-DAY INTERVIEW ON "FACE THE NATION" THIS SUNDAY. YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT. AND ON "CBS THIS MORNING--" IS IT LIVE? LIVE ON MONDAY MORNING THEY'LL BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN WITH THE PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRST 100 DAYS. YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IF HE'S DOING "FACE THE NATION" AND "CBS THIS MORNING," YOU HAVE TO FIGURE AT SOME POINT HE'LL COME BY HERE.
Jon: HE HAS TO COME THROUGH.
Stephen: I THINK LEGALLY THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES HIM TO COME BY THE SHOW. THE TRIFECTA. YOU'RE WELCOME ANY TIME. YOU'RE WELCOME ANY TIME. WOULDN'T WE LOVE HIM TO STOP BY? ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION BUT I HAVE TO SAY HIS NAME SO THE BAND KNOWS WHEN TO START PLAYING. PLEASE WELCOME TOM HANKS. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, LOOK --
Stephen: YES, SIR. YES, SIR.
I KNOW-- I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN-- THERE'S BEEN A BIG, BIG SWING-- THERE'S BEEN A SWING IN THE STATUS BETWEEN YOU AND THE TWO JIMMIES, WHICH I EMBRACE CONTINUOUSLY.
Stephen: WHO I LOVE. WHO I LOVE.
THEY'RE FABULOUS GUYS. THEY PUT ON GREAT SHOWS. BUT HERE'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED, STEPHEN-- AMERICA WANTS TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE UP ON THAT WALL. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT THAT WALL.
Stephen: ARE YOU WATCHING "GAME OF THRONES?" WHAT WALL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HERE.
JACK NICHOLSON-- "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH" WALT WALL. AND THEY WANT TO KNOW SOMEBODY IS LOOKING OUT FOR US, THEN-- LOOKING AT THEM, BUT LOOKING OUT FOR US. AND THAT MAN IS JON BATISTE RIGHT OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
Stephen: HE GIVES AND HE GIVES AND HE GIVES.
SO AS SOON AS WE SEE THAT LITTLE MELLED ONIA GOING, WE SLEEP LIKE BABIES. WHERE IS IT?
Jon: OH, YEAH I GOT A LITTLE TASTE FOR YOU.
IS IT TRUE YOU STARTED LEARNING THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT ONLY TAKES ONE HAND TO PLAY? LOOK AT THAT.
Jon: I LIKE TO GET UP FROM THE PIANO. SO THAT'S YI STARTED PLAYING IT, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: IN NEW ORLEANS THEY MARCH EVERYWHERE. THERE'S NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THEY HAVE TO MARCH EVERYWHERE IN NEW ORLEANS, SO SAD. SO SAD. THEY MADE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION.
Jon: EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: I SAID RIGHT NOW I DIDN'T NEED TO INTRODUCE YOU, BUT IF YOU WERE TO INTRODUCE TOM HANKS WHAT, WOULD YOU SAY WITH BTHIS TOM HANKS FELLOW? HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE HIM?
UH, UH, OKAY, HERE'S --
Stephen: NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.
WELL, THAT PUTS ME ON THE SPOT IN A BIG WAY.
Stephen: THAT'S MY JOB.
I WOULD SAY HERE'S A MAN WHO'S BROTHER IS A TENURED PROFESSOR IN ENTOMOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. MY BROTHER IS AN ENTYMOLOGIST, SO THIS IS TRUE. IT'S ACTUALLY-- MY WIFE AND I'S ANNIVERSARY IS ON SUNDAY, 29 YEARS.
Stephen: OH, CONGRATULATIONS. W
WE WERE ON OUR ANNIVERSARY, AND WE SAW THESE COLLEGE STUDENT THAT HAD THESE ODD LITTLE SUCTION CUPPY KIND OF THINGS, AND THEY WERE AT THE BACK OF CACTI DOG SOMETHING AT THE BASE OF CACTI, AND WE SAID, "CAN WE ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?" AND THEY SAID, "WE'RE ENTOMOLOGY STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE," WHICH IS A BIG THING FOR ME BECAUSE MY BROTHER EARNED HIS DOCKET RATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR BROTHER'S NAME?
MY BROTHER'S NAME IS LARRY. BUT HE INSISTS ON BEING CALLED PROFESSOR LAWRENCE. THEY WERE SUCK OUT TEENY LITTLE INSECT. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER IS AN ENTYMOLOGIST. AND THEY SAID, "YEAH, YEAH." AND HE ACTUALLY-- NOT ONLY DID HE GET HIS DOCTORATE FROM RIVERSIDE, BUT HE USES TO TEACH THERE.
AND THEY SAID, "YEAH, YEAH." AND I SAID, "MY-- MY BROTHER-- WELL, WELL, I'M TOM HANKS." AND THEY SAID, "YEAH, AND YOUR BROTHER'S DR. LARRY HANKS." SO I WAS LIKE-- I WAS THE FAMOUS GUY'S BROTHER AT, YOU KNOW, AT THE THING. AND IT RATTLED ME JUST A TINY BIT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YEAH.
AND MY BROTHER JIM IS STILL ANGRY ABOUT IT. MY SISTER SANDRA STILL CAN'T QUITE-- ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon: YEAH. IT'S NICE THOUGH, IS HE OLDER OR YOUNGER?
OLDER.
Stephen: GOOD TO KEEP YOU HUMBLE. OLDER BROTHERS SHOULD DO THAT.
HE FOUND MANY A WAY TO KEEP ME HUMBLE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS THAT DO YOU THAT WOULD BE HARD TO STAY HUMBLE AFTER HAVING DONE. THERE WAS A BIG STORY TWO WEEKS AGO, BARACK OBAMA WAS ON DAVE GEFFEN'S YACHT IN FRENCH POLYNESIA, BEST OF ALL THE POLYNESIAS.
IT WAS. WAY WESTERN-- WAY BETTER THAN DUTCH POLYNESIA.
Stephen: PLEASE.
IT'S NO FIJI OR MONGOLIA, BUT NONETHELESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL-- ALWAYS PAYS TO WATCH THE AUDIENCE WARM-UPS, STEPHEN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO THAT UP IN YOUR PENTHOUSE BEFORE THE SHOW.
Stephen: NO, NO, NO.
BEFORE YOU TAKE THE-- WHAT IS IT THE BAT POLE DOWN.
Stephen: I'M UP ON THE WALL, TOM. I'M UP ON THE WALL WITH JON.
YOU'RE UP ON THAT WALL.
Stephen: EATING CHICKEN PARMESAN.
YEAH, THAT MADE THE NEWS. IT WAS INTERESTING. AND BOTH OPRAH AND I WERE REALLY PISSED OFF BECAUSE --
Stephen: BECAUSE IT WAS THE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST LADY, OPRAH, YOU, AND BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.
IS THIS THE WAY WE ARE IN THE WORLD? IS THIS WHAT'S GOING ON IN SOCIAL MEDIA THAT OPRAH AND I CANNOT GO ON A BILLIONAIRE'S BOAT TO TAHITI WITH A FORMER PROFIT UNITED STATES AND NOT KEEP IT SECRET FOR GOD'S SAKES! IS THIS WHERE WE ARE, STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: I'M SO SORRY.
IT WAS NOT-- LOOK, IMAGINE-- IMAGINE WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. TRIPLE IT. IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS OFF THE SCALE FANTASTIC.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO? DO YOU JUST SIT ON THE BOAT--
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING THAT HAPPENED TO TOM HANKS, TO LITTLE TOMMY HANKS.
Stephen: LARRY'S BROTHER.
LARRY'S BROTHER. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM. HE GETS SCREWED, AND I'LL TELL YOU HOW.
Stephen: REALLY?
I'LL TELL YOU HOW. IN THE BAD WAY, IN THE PEJORATIVE WAY, NOT IN THE DELIGHTFUL WAY.
Stephen: WHO KNOWS? YOU'RE ON A BOAT. INTERNATIONAL WATERS, TOM. INTERNATIONAL WATERS.
ACTUALLY, NO WE WERE-- ANYWAY, FRENCH POLYNESIA. YOU'RE THERE AND EVERY DAY IS JUST LIKE CRAZY "LOVE BOAT," SCANDALS RESORT FANTASTIC. AND THEY SAY, "HEY, TOMORROW, LET'S-- LET'S GET-- WE'LL GET SOME BIKES." AND THERE'S, LIKE, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE PLUS THERE'S SECRET SERVICE. THERE'S THAT ASPECT OF IT. THEY CALL A GUY THAT SAYS RENT BIKES, ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY-- THERE WERE A LOT. THERE WERE A LOT OF US. WE GO ON SHORES AND A RAY BICYCLES HAVE BEEN PROCURED FOR US, RENTED FROM ALL CORNERS OF POLYNESIA AND TAHITI, BORA BORA. THEY'VE ALL-- THEY'VE ALL COME. AND BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG. EVERYBODY GETS ON THEIR BIKES AND TAKES OFF. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. THERE WERE SOME GREAT BIKES THERE. THERE WERE SOME JUST FINE AND DANDY BIKES. AND THERE WAS ONE PIECE OF JUNK, HUNK A JUNK BIKE. WHO DO YOU THINK GOT THE PIECE OF JUNK, HUNK A JUNK BIKES. THE SECRET SERVICE HOP ON THE SHINEOLA BIKES WITH THE BELLS AND STREAMERS THAT COME OFF THE HANDLE BAR S.
Stephen:  THAT'S FOR SECURITY.
OFF THEY GO, THE FORMER-- OPRAH-- THEY'RE ALL GONE, AND I HAVE A BIKE THAT YOU COULDN'T DELIVER NEWSPAPERS WITH. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS-- FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS AN UNDERSIZED GIRL'S BIKE, YOU KNOW, WITH THE THING-- NOT THE-- NOT THE MANLY BAR. BUT THE LITTLE-- THAT THING THAT GOES DOWN THERE.
Stephen: SURE.
IT WAS RUSTED, LIKE, ALL OVER. AND INSTEAD OF THE HANDLE BARS OUT LIKE THAT, THEY WERE IN LIKE THIS. AND NOT ONLY THAT, IT ONLY HAD ONE GEAR PAWMENT OTHERS WERE, LIKE, MOUNTAIN BIKES 27 GEARS AND SHIFTERS. I LITERALLY HAVE A SINGLE SPROKET AND COASTER BRAKES THAT HARDLY-- AND I'M LIKE-- AND THEY SAID IT'S TAHITIAN ISLANDS ARE BEAUTIFUL TO GO BIKING BECAUSE IT'S SO FLAT. NONSENSE! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FRENCH WORD IS. IT IS NOT! THIS IS WHAT MY VIEW OF RIDING A BIKE IN TAHITI WAS, UP-UP-UP-HUP-UP-UP. AND I'M GOING LIKE THIS. IT WAS SO BAD I PASSED, LIKE, MY SIXTH TAHITIAN CORRUGATED TIN HUT OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE-- THEY CAN LIVE IN LIKE-- IT'S PARADISE. EVERY ONE OF WHICH HAD CHICKENS RUNNING AROUND IN THE FRONT, A VERY MEAN DOG ON A ROPE, A MINIATURE SATELLITE DISH POINTED TO THE HORIZON.
Stephen: SURE.
AND VERY NICE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WAVE TO ME-- THEY WAVE TO EVERYBODY AS THEY WENT BY, AND THEY SAVED FOR ME THESE WORDS IN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE, "CRAPPY BIKE." ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE THIS. IT WAS MISERABLE!  ( CHEERS ) IT WAS MISSERABLE! SO YOU TELL ME. DO YOU WANT TO REPEAT THAT EXERCISE? DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK ON THAT VACATION BOAT?  I DON'T THINK SO. I'D RATHER GO BACK AND GET LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE ON THAT BOAT.
Stephen: WHEN YOU'RE ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HOW FAMOUS ARE YOU, IS MY QUESTION? WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND THAT BOAT AND SEE OPRAH AND BRUCE AND THE PRESIDENT AND DAVID GEFFEN IS THERE. DO YOU GO, "HOLY COW! " OR DO YOU GO, "WEDNESDAY."
VERY LOW ON THE FOOD CHAIN ON THAT ONE.
Stephen: REALLY?
WELL, IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY ABOUT GREAT IDEAS THAT ARE TALKED ABOUT AT BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER. AND YOU JUST WANT TO GET THERE AND HUNG ON EVERY WORD, AND I'D LOVE TO SHARE A TON OF STORIES WITH YOU FROM IT. BUT THEY'RE CLASSIFIED. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OH,.
LITERALLY THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES WE SAID, "HEY WHAT ABOUT THE THING WITH THE STUFF AND THE THING LIKE THAT, MR. PRESIDENT. AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU, BUT IT'S CLASSIFIED."
Stephe
AND HE WAS NOT JOOKING.
Stephen: THE THING AND THE STUFF IS ABOUT RUSSIA, RIGHT? HOLD THAT THOUGHT. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE TOM HANKS. DON'T SAY SAY WORD. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED TOM HANKS. THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY YOU JUST TOLD ME ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND IF YOU REPEAT THAT ON YOUR SHOW, THERE WILL BE A BLACK VAN SHOWING UP AT YOUR HOUSE.
Stephen: THERE'S ALWAYS A BLACK VAN SHOWING UP AT MY HOUSE. THAT'S HOW I GET TO WORK.
IS IT THE THING WITH THE FLAMES SPRAY PAINTED ON THE SIDE.
Stephen: IT SAYS "AFTERNOON DELIGHT."
HEY, IF THAT VAN IS ROCKING...
Stephen: YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING TO ME A COUPLE OF TIMES.
OKAY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE ONCE AGAIN PURCHASED THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS THEIR OWN ESPRESSO MACHINE?
YES, YES, I DID THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: AND THIS WAS-- THIS WAS-- DO I MIND IF I READ THIS, SHOW THIS?
GO AHEAD.
Stephen: YOU SUBJECT THIS NOTE ALONG TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CO. IS THIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM WHERE THEY HANG OUT?
IT'S IN BACK.
TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORE, KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT FOR TRUTH, JUSTICE, AND THE AMERICAN WAY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE TRUTH PART. TOM HANKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
BY THE WAY, THAT WAS BY-- THAT'S BY BILL-- THAT IS A PULEITZ-- PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING DRAWING BY-- OH, GEEZ. I'M BLANKING ON THE NAME.
Stephen: BILL ELDER?
YEAH, YEAH, THE GREAT WORLD WAR II CARTOONIST. YEAH, I'VE DONE THAT FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS BECAUSE THOSE POOR BASTARDS NEED COFFEE. IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. I THINK THIS PRESIDENT MIGHT BE KEEPING THEM UP, ANYWAY. CERTAINLY ON THEIR TOES BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I HAVE A FEELING THE PROBLEM NOW IS AN AWFUL LOT THE SPIT COFFEE ON PEOPLE'S LAPS. "ARE YOU KIDDING ME!" I THINK A LOT OF THAT STUFF. THAT MIGHT BE-- THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING THERE ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SO WHEN DID YOU-- GO AHEAD.
THIS STARTED BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME WE EVER WENT-- MY KIDS WERE LITTLE AND WE HAD A TOUR OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THEY TAKE YOU DOWN THERE. IF NOTHING IS GOING ON, IF THE PRESIDENT IS NOT THERE, YOU CAN ALMOST GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT. THEY TAKE YOU DOWN AND YOU GET TO STAND AT THE PODIUM AND PRETEND YOU'RE POINTING AT SOMETHING. AND YET, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT THERE, THERE WERE ABOUT SIX STAFFERS-- OR REPORTERS AND TECHNICIANS IN THE BACK OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM LIKE THIS... WE SAID, "YOU GUYS WORK HERE?" AND THEY SAID, "EVERY SINGLE DAY." I SAID, "THE PRESIDENT'S NOT EVEN HERE. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE HERE?" AND THEY SAID, "IN CASE OF NUCLEAR WAR." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, SAY SOMETHING HAPPENS. AND WE SAW, THEY HAD THIS OLD MR. COFFEE THAT WAS ALL SKAGY AND WHATNOT. I SAID, "GUYS, YOU MIGHT BE GETTING A BRAND NEW CAPPUCCINO MACHINE FROM PERHAPS A MILD-MANNERED REPORTER FROM A GREAT METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER WHO DISGUISED AS CLARK KENT FIGHTS THE BATTLE FOR TRUTH, JUSTICE, AND THE AMERICAN WAY. I'M A SUCKER, BUT WHEN I WAS A KID I TOOK THAT TO HEART "TRUTH, JUSTICE, AND THE AMERICAN WAY" WAS SOMETHING YOU KEPT UP A NEVER-ENDING BATTLE FOR.
Stephen: I AGREE, I AGREE. AND PEOPLE DO GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR ( APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF THE AMERICAN WAY, YOU HAVE THIS NEW MOVIE HERE CALLED "THE CIRCLE."
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED EMMA WATSON.
EMMA WATSON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT SORT OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND SURVEILLANCE. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE MOVIE? WHO ARE YOU IN THE MOVIE?
WELL, IF YOU TOOK TWITTER, YOUTUBE, GOOGLE, INSTAGRAM, AND APPLE AND JAMMED THEM ALL INTO ONE COMPANY, THEY WOULD DO PROBABLY ONE OF TWO THINGS-- EXPLODE BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN SELF-IMPORTANCE, OR ATTEMPT TO DOMINATE ALL OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT. AND I PLAY THE GUY WHO, FOR WONDERFUL ALTRUISTIC REASONS, WANTS TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN CONDITION AND SETS ABOUT  DOING IT BY WAY OF THIS-- THIS SOCIAL MEDIA INTERNET COMPUTER COMPANY CALLED THE CIRCLE. AND IT ALL MAKES WONDERFUL SENSE.
Stephen: PEOPLE GET, LIKE, CAMERAS, THAT THEY CAN PUT ON THEIR BODES.
THEY GET THINGS THEY WEAR ON THEIR WRISTS THAT CAN KEEP TRACK OF THEIR HEARTBEAT. THEY-- THEY-- THEY GET PADS THAT HAVE-- THEY CAN SEND MESSAGES ON. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY-- THEY'RE ABLE TO, LIKE, SEND, LIKE, KOOKS  PHOTOS AND NUTTY RIDDLES TO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE-- IT'S THE SCARCIEST, GOOFIEST, DYSTOPIAN VERSION OF THE FUTURE YOU'RE EVER GOING TO COME ACROSS.
Stephen: BUT WHO WOULD PAY FOR THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WHO WOULD PAY FOR THAT?
I HAVE NO IDEA. THERE ARE GAMES YOU CAN PLAY-- IT'S FUBBY, DAVE EGGERS-- WHO WAS A GREAT NOVELIST. HE WROTE THIS THING IN 2013. NOW, USUALLY IN THE REALM OF SCIENCE FICTION OR REALITY FICTION, THINGS LIKE THAT, A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHAT REALLY-- IS, LIKE, EIGHT MILES WIDE. THEY'RE NOT REMOTELY CORRECT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. I BELIEVE DAVE PUT A HEX ON US ALL, AND TRAVELED IN A TIME MACHINE TO SEE WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE BECAUSE HE CAPTURED IT FOUR YEARS AGO.
Stephen: WELL, IN THIS SCENE WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE HERE, EMMA WATSON, HAS BEEN CAUGHT BY THIS TECHNOLOGY SNEAKING INTO YOUR OFFICE.
YES, SHE HAD TO BE RESCUED FROM-- FROM A PRECARIOUS POSITION THAT SHE WAS AT ILLEGALLY AND WE KNOW ABOUT IT.
Stephen: OKAY. JIM.
NOW THEY KNOW YOUR SECRET, DO YOU FEEL BETTER OR WORSE?
BETTER. RELIEVED, ACTUALLY.
I AM A BELIEVER IN THE PERFECTIBILITY OF HUMAN BEINGS. WITH WE ARE OUR BEST SELVES, THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS. THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM WE CANNOT SOLVE. WE CAN CURE ANY SKIS, AND WE CAN END HUNGER. WITHOUT SECRETS, WITHOUT HORDING INFORMATION, WE CAN FINALLY REALIZE OUR POTENTIAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I DON'T BELIEVE --
Stephen: I LIKE THE TURTLENECK.
YOU LIKE THAT.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK HERE, AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE MR. TOM HAIFNGS.
OH, REALLY.
Stephen: YES, MORE TOM HANKS. YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. ( APPLAUSE )
I WOULD BE LIKE THAT!
Stephen: WE HAVE CAPTURED TOM HANKS FOR YET ANOTHER ACT TO TALK TOGETHER.
THERE IS NOTHING ON TV TONIGHT. THAT'S ALL THERE IS.
Stephen: AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THERE IS NOTHING ON TV.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR FRIEND  JONATHAN DEMME, WHO I KNOW IS A DEAR  FRIEND OF YOURS AND YOU DID "PHILADELPHIA" TOGETHER.
HE PLAYED A CAMEO, HE'S A MOVIE DIRECTOR. GOD BLESS HIM. I LOVE HIM. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH WEEK, FRANKLY. MY WHOLE PRODUCTION COMPANY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF JONATHAN. HERE'S THE THING ABOUT WORKING WITH JONATHAN. JONATHAN, ALL OF HIS MOVIES WERE LIKE YOU WERE HANGING OUT WITH THE MOST WELL-LIKED AND HIPPED ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT YOUR STATE COLLEGE BECAUSE HE DRANK WINE DURING OFFICE HOURS. "COME ON IN! COME ON IF! SIT DOWN!" THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE. HE HAD THIS POLICY THAT NO OTHER MOVIE DIRECTORS HAVE, WHICH IS ANYBODY CAN COME TO DAILIES. USUALLY DIRECTORS SEE DALYS IN A LOCKED BUNKER IN THE FORMER SWIMMING POOL OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU HAVE TO PUT, YOU KNOW, THUMB PRINTS ON IN ORDER TO GET DOWN. JONATHAN WOULD SAY, "COME ON." HE WOULD PUT ON PIZZA, PUT ON MUSIC, SHOW WHATEVER THE DAILIES WERE. I WAS AT DAILIES ONCE SITTING NEXT TO A GUY WHO WAS WEARING A MATCHY-- IT WAS AN ODD OUTFIT-- HE WAS WEARING A MATCHING PURPLE SEE THE AND I HAD NEVER SEEN THE GUY BEFORE. PURPLE JACKET, PURPET PANTS. AND HE WAS SITTING THERE, HAD A CUP OF WINE, SOME PIZZA, WATCH SOMETHING M.O.S. STUFF. AND I THOUGHT HE WAS FROM THE PROP DEPARTMENT, ONE OF THE ACCOUNTANT-- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE MOVIE YOU NEVER SEE. AND I SAID, "HEY, MAN, HOW YOU DOING?" "PRETTY GOOD, YEAH." "IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME AT DAILIES?" "YEAH." "WHAT DO YOU DO HERE AT THE MOVIE?" "I DON'T WORK ON THE MOVIE." "WHO ARE YOU?" "I'M THE FEDEX MAN." ( LAUGHTER ) HE WAS THE FEDEX GUY-- FEDEX! HIS CAR IS, LIKE, PARKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, AND JONATHAN SAID, "HEY, MAN, HOW YOU DOING?" HAVE A ROUGH DAY? I'M ALMOST DONE. YOU WANT TO WATCH THE DAILIES? WHAT ARE DALYS? IT'S KIND OF LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. SURE. THE GUY SAYS TO ME, "IS THAT DENZEL WASHINGTON?" "YEAH, YEAH, IT IS, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YEAH." "IS HE IN THE MOVIE, TOO?" "YEAH." "IS HE IN DAILIES?" "NO." "OH, I'D LOVE TO MEET HIM. I'M TELLING YOU A SLIGHT STORY BUT I'M NOT FAR OFF THE MARK.
Stephen: THERE YOU ARE.
A SWEET GUY. ANOTHER GREAT THING ABOUT HIM, HE WAS-- ( APPLAUSE ) THE FIRST TIME I TOOK MY WIFE OUT ON A BONA FIDE DATE, AS IN, "WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU-- ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING TOMORROW NIGHT? WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT TO MAYBE HAVE DINNER AND MAYBE A MOVIE WITH ME?" SHE SAID, "SURE. WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO SEE?" ", I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T WE CHECK OUT WHAT'S PLAYING." "HOW ABOUT 'STOP MAKING SENSE'?" "I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD MOVIE." I TOOK MY WIFE OUT AND "STOP MAKING SENSE.
Stephen: TALKING HEADS--
CONCERT MOVIE.
Stephen: ONE OF THE GREATEST CONCERT MOVIES THAT AND THE "WALL."
JONATHAN DEMME AND MARTIN SCORSESE.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO GO IN A MINUTE HERE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE GIVEN ENOUGH TO AMERICA AT THIS POINT. WE WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO YOU. EVERY DAY ONE OF THE-- THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WORKS HERE, ONE OF THE ASSISTANT PRODUCERS--
ONE OF THE MILLENNIALS.
Stephen: ONE OF THE MILLENNIALS THEY CALL EACH OTHER MILLENNIALS.
ONE OF THE YOUNG OUT-OF-CONTROL YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WORKS IN YOUR OFFICE.
Stephen: SHE PUTS UP THE HUNK OF THE DAY. AND SHE RECENTLY PUT UP THIS HUNK OF THE DAY. TODAY'S HUNK IS TO THE HUNKS.
OH, WAIT A MINUTE! HOLD ON!
Stephen: OKAY? OKAY? THERE IT IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: IT GOES ON TO SAY, "ENOUGH SAID, RIGHT? NOPE, I'VE GOT MORE TO SAY. EVERY TIME TOM SAYS 'DON'T CRY SHOP GIRL'. GUESS WHAT, I DO." THANKS FOR BEING A HUNK. I KNOW YOU HAVE OSCARS. I KNOW YOU HAVE EMMYS. I KNOW YOU HAVE AGREEMENTS?
NO.
Stephen: BUT NOW YOU HAVE HUNK DAY. KENNEDY CENTER HONORS AND HUNK OF THE DAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU HAVE AN ACCEPTANCE SPEECH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
YOU WANT TO GO OUT OVER --
Stephen: WE'LL GO OUT OVER THE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH.
LET ME GET THREE WORDS INTO IT AND PLAY ME OFF --
Stephen: BEFORE YOU DO THAT. "THE CIRCLE" IS IN THEATERS NOW. TOM HANKS TAKE IT AWAY.
I OWE THIS FANTASTIC MOMENT TO MY FIRST TEACHER WHO TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW, TO MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE, RITA! TO MY KIDS! I LOVE YOU! GOOD NIGHT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST MADE HER FILM DEBUT IN "MANCHESTER BY THE SEA" AND NOW STARS IN CBS' "SUPERIOR DONUTS." PLEASE WELCOME ANNA BARYSHNIKOV!
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: NOW, WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
HI.
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST LATE NIGHT SHOW, RIGHT?
IT IS.
Stephen: WELCOME, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: THE FIRST OF MANY, NO DOUBT. YOUR NAME IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY.
WHY IS THAT.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOUR FATHER IS MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV, AND YOUR MOTHER IS LISA REINHART, BOTH GREAT DANCERS. DID YOU DANCE?
I TRIED.
Stephen: YOU WERE NOT FORCED TO?
NO, MY PARENTS WERE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT NOT PUTTING ON ANY PRESSURE, BUT THEY DID PUT ME IN A BALLET CLASS LIKE WE DO WITH A LOT OF GIRLS AND BOYS BUT I WAS TERRIBLE. I WAS A REALLY TALKATIVE KID AND I HAD A LOT OF ENERGY AND IT REQUIRES SO MUCH FOCUS. YOU HAVE TO BE SO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, DILIGENT AS A LITTLE KIT KID, AND I WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. MY FIRST CLASS I WAS AT THE BAR AND I WAS NEED LING AROUND THE BAR, AND I WAS TALKING OUT LOUD, "HOW ABOUT THIS CLASS? IT'S A LOT OF FUN."
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU AT THIS POINT?
I WANT TO SAY MAYBE SIX OR SEVEN.
Stephen: SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.
YEAH. ALL RIGHT A DISASTER. AND THE TEACHER CAME OVER AND SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS ACTUALLY QUIET TIME. WE'RE LEARNING FIRST POSITION." AND I REMEMBER THINKING, "THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK."
Stephen: SO IS ACTRESS A FORM OF REBELLION FOR YOU?
IT'S LIKE THE LAMEST FORM OF REBELLION EVER. I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO DO PLAYS!"
Stephen: YOU STARTED DOING THEM EARLY. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
I WAS IN A CHILDREN'S SHAKESPEARE THEATER FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
Stephen: YOU HAVE PRESENCE. THAT'S PRESENCE RIGHT THERE FOR A KID. YOU KNOW WHERE THE CAMERA IS, THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.
THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I SEE THAT AND I'M LIKE, "I'M JUST WAITING FOR DINNER." I LOOK DEAD IN THE EYES THERE A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. YOU'RE ALMOST CHALLENGING. "WHO ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU TAKING A PHOTO OF ME?" WHERE WAS THIS? I UNDERSTANDS YOU WERE IN, LIKE, A NEW YORK SUBURBAN SHAKESPEARE COMPANY?
YEAH, SO MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS ABOUT-- THAT I GREW UP IN IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES NORTH CITY.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND IT WAS THIS REALLY SMALL, REALLY, YOU KNOW, SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY, BUT THE COOL THING TO DO WAS SHAKESPEARE PERFORMED BY ONLY CHILDREN. LIKE, THE WAY THIS TOWN FELT-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ONLY BY CHILDREN. NOT "BY ONLY CHILDREN." YOU COULD HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ONLY BY CHILDREN.
LIKE, "WE NEED TO SOCIALIZE YOU GUYS." IT WAS EXCLUSIVELY BY CHILDREN. YOU KNOW HOW TO THE TOWN IN "FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS" IS REALLY INTO FOOTBALL.
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
IT WAS REALLY LIKE THAT.
Stephen: BUT SHAKESPEARE FOR CHILDREN.
BUT SHAKESPEARE FOR CHILDREN. WE HAD A CHEER.
Stephen: YOU HAD A CHEER?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR SHAKESPEARE CHEER?
I'M SUDDENLY REGRETTING EVERYTHING.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR CHEER ♪ WE WENT HUH-UNGOWA SHAKESPEARE'S GOT THE POWER ♪
Stephen: I LIKE IT. I'M SURE SHAKESPEARE WOULD LIKE IT, TOO. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
GOOD OLD WILLY WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.
Stephen: YOUR FIRST MOVIE IS "MANCHESTER BY THE SEA."
YES.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR ENTREE INTO MOVIE MAKING. NOT EVERYBODY GETS TO DO THAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, DON'T TELL ME HOW IT ENDS.
IT'S SUPER FUNNY.
Stephen: YOU PLAY A TEENAGER IN IT?
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT YOUR COSTAR, WHO IS LUCAS HEDGES, IS ACTUALLY A TEENAGER.
YES.
Stephen: YOU ARE IN YOUR 20s. HE IS ACTUALLY A TEENAGER. ANY SORT OF TENSION THERE THAT--
YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHEN I WAS FIRST CAST I WAS NOT SURE IF THIS IS LEGAL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW-- IF THEY KNEW HOW OLD I WAS. AND I FELT LIKE I HAD TO LAY THAT ON THE TABLE. BUT IT WAS GOOD. WE WERE BOTH NERVOUS. IT WAS MY FIRST MOVIE SO I WAS NERVOUS. AND HE SAID HE WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE I WAS OLDER. BUT WE GOT TO BE GOOD FRIENDS. AND HE ACTUALLY ASKED ME TO PROM.
Stephen: REALLY? DID YOU GO--
AS FRIENDS, AS FRIENDS.
Stephen: DID YOU GO?
AT FIRST I WAS LIKE, "THANK YOU. I'M SO HONORED. THIS IS GOING TO BE SO EXCITING." AND THAT WAS IN "MANCHESTER BY THE SEA" OUTSIDE OF BOSTON. AND I WENT BACK TO NEW YORK AND TOLD MY FRIENDS. I SAID, "GUESS WHAT, I'M GOING TO ST. ANNE'S PROM." AND THEY WERE LIKE, "YOU CAN'T DO THAT."
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU?
22. YEAH, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T BE 22. BUT I WAS SO OBLIVIOUS. I WAS LIKE, "IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FUN." THEY WERE ALL SAYING, "IMAGINE YOU'RE A PARENTS AND YOU'RE LIKE THIS IS MY 22 GOING ON WHATEVER DATE."
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET YOUR BOSTON ACCENT? YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE. HOW DID YOU GET THAT?
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE HAD A DIALECT COACH AND SHE WAS GREAT, BUT I ALSO-- I WANTED TO HEAR TEENAGED GIRLS DO IT. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOOK UP THE BOSTON ACCENT YOU GET-- "YEAH, GET OUT OF THE CAR!" AND I WAS PLAYING A NORMAL TEENAGED GIRL SO I FIGURED I WOULD GO FIND THEM AT THE MALL. SO I WENT TO THE MALL AND STOOD AS CLOSE TO TEENAGED GIRLS AS WAS SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN I GOT ARRESTED ON THE WAY HOME.
Stephen: DID YOU REALLY?
NO!
Stephen: OH! ACTING! WELL, IT WAS LOVELY IT MEET YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU, SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: "SUPERIOR DONUTS" AIRS MONDAYS AT 9:00 ON CBS. ANNA BARYSHNIKOV, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! JOIN US NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE TALKING TO CHRIS PRATT, AMY SCHUMER, AND JIM PARSONS. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT!
