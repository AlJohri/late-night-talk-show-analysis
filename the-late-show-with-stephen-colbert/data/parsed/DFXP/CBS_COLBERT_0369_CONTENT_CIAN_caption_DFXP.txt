THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS BLOCKED CAMERAS AND AUDIO RECORDINGS FROM RECENT BRIEFINGS. THE PRESS SECRETARY SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO DISTRACT PEOPLE ON DAYS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP APPEARS ON TV.
BEFORE WE BEGIN THE PRESS BRIEFING, I JUST WANT TO GO OVER SOME OF THE NEW RULES. AS YOU KNOW, AS SOON AS MR. SPICER WALKS OUT HERE, WE'LL BE CUTTING ALL AUDIO AND VISUAL FEEDS. OF COURSE, WE WILL STILL BE RELEASING TRANSCRIPTS, BUT THOSE WILL NOW BE IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS. TO RECEIVE A COPY JUST FOLLOW THESE COLLECTIONED:  EYE, BIRD, FOOT. AS FOR THE BRIEFINGS THEMSELVES NO ONE WILL BE ALLOWED TO CAN A QUESTION UNLESS THEY ARE HOLDING THE OFFICIAL BRIEFING CONK. IN ADDITION, EVERY REPORTER WILL BE HANDED A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER. WHOEVER GETS THE BLACK DOT WILL BE STONED TO DEATH BY THE REST OF THE PRESS CORPS. ALSO, DURING THE BRIEFING, ALL EXITS WILL BE SEALED, AND THE ROOM WILL SLOWLY FILL WITH WATER. AN ELECTRIC EEL MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELEASED. THAT IS A "DAY OF" DECISION. I'M TOLD MR. SPICER WILL BE OUT HERE IN A MINUTE. GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL. NOW, FIGHT FOR THE CO, I C ONK.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ERIC STONESTREET. JOHN McENROE. AND MUSICAL GUEST LILLIE MAE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S RIGHT. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? THANKS VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, YOU REMEMBER HOW THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PROMISING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW? YEAH. IT'S THEIR MOST CONSISTENT MESSAGE OTHER THAN "TURN DOWN THAT HIP-HOP RACKET, YOU KIDS!" AND THIS IS THE WEEK BECAUSE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND UNACKNOWLEDGED LOVE CHILD OF ADMIRAL AKBAR, MITCH McCONNELL -- SO SAD. SO SAD. WON'T RETURN HIS PHONE CALLS. ( LAUGHTER ) -- HAS PROMISED HE WILL PASS TRUMPCARE BEFORE THE JULY 4th RECESS. AND HE HAS GOT TO, BECAUSE McCONNELL KNOWS IF THEY DON'T PASS IT NOW, THERE'S A SERIOUS DANGER SOMEONE MIGHT READ IT. NO, IT'S TRUE. IT WILL HAPPEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE TEACHING THE KIDS. THEY'RE TEACHING THE KIDS HOW TO READ NOW, IT'S DANGEROUS. SO, COME HELL OR HIGH WATER, THE VOTE WILL HAPPEN THIS WEEK.
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL THIS AFTERNOON ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS DELAYING A VOTE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WEEK UNTIL AFTER THE 4th OF JULY RECESS.
Stephen: OR, IT CAN WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE BARBECUE. BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU, ONE THING I WILL PASS IS THIS DELICIOUS POTATO SALAD. THANK YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD REASONS NOT TO HAVE THE VOTE THIS WEEK, OKAY. McCONNELL WOULD HAVE LOST. ( APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE DEAL, REPUBLICANS, WHO WERE ALREADY NERVOUS, RAN FOR THE EXITS AFTER THE NONPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT UNDER THE GOP PLAN 22 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE. 22. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER. I ADMIT. TO PUT THAT NUMBER INTO PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU LAID 22 MILLION PEOPLE END TO END, IT WOULD REACH CANADA, WHERE THEY COULD GET HEALTH CARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND-- JUST-- JUST-- JUST FROM THEIR PRIME MINISTER. HIS SMILE HEALS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE BILL CUTS $800 BILLION FROM MEDICAID, A PROGRAM THAT COVERS ALMOST HALF OF ALL BIRTHS, ALMOST TWO-THIRDS OF PEOPLE IN NURSING HOMES, AND ALMOST 40% OF ALL CHILDREN. 40% OF ALL CHILDREN. IN OTHER WORDS, ALL THE KIDS NAMED "MADISON." ( LAUGHTER ) POPULAR NAME IS THE IDEA OF THAT JOKE. SUNDAY-- THAT WHICH THE ANCIENTS CALLED KELLYANNE CONWAY-- EMERGED FROM HER CHAMBER OF SECRETS TO WEIGH IN ON THE BILL'S CUTS TO MEDICAID.
WELL, YOU SAID EVERYBODY WHO'S ON MEDICAID NOW IS GRANDFATHERED IN AND WILL NOT FACE ANY CUTS, AND THAT SIMPLY IS NOT FACTUAL IF YOU HAVE $800 BILLION IN CUTS.
WELL YOU KEEP CALLING THEM CUTS, BUT WE DON'T SEE THEM AS CUTS. IT'S SLOWING THE RATE OF GROWTH IN THE FUTURE AND GETTING MEDICAID BACK TO WHERE IT WAS. OBAMACARE EXPANDED THE POOL OF MEDICAID RECIPIENTS BEYOND ITS ORIGINAL INTENTION.
Stephen: YES, THEY'RE NOT CUTS. IT'S JUST RETURNING MEDICAID TO ITS ORIGINAL INTENTION. IT'S LIKE AN ARSONIST SAYING, "I DIDN'T BURN THE HOUSE DOWN. I JUST TOOK THE GROUND BACK TO PREHOUSE LEVELS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY. THIS IS-- SEE HOW THAT'S BETTER? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY UNDERSTAND. SEE. CONNECTION. BUT AFTER YESTERDAY'S C.B.O. SCORE, PEOPLE STARTED PILING ON. ACCORDING TO DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BRIAN SCHATZ, C.B.O. CONFIRMS THIS THING IS A "BLANK" SANDWICH. NOW, WE DO NOT KNOW YET WHAT WORD THERE WAS REDACTED, SO LET'S JUST SAY IT'S A "SCHATZ SANDWICH." I TRUST I'M MISPRONOUNCING HIS NAME CORRECTLY. THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS SPOKEN OUT AGAINST IT, SAYING WHILE DOCTORS ALL SWEAR AN OATH TO "FIRST, DO NO HARM," THIS BILL VIOLATES THAT STANDARD ON MANY LEVELS. HONESTLY, I THINK-- I'M NOT SURE IT'S TRUE. IT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF PUNCTUATION. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE IT FROM "FIRST, DO NO HARM" TO "FIRST: DO? NO! HARM!" ANCIENT GREEK. TESTIFY ORIGINALLY IN ANCIENT GREEK.  ( APPLAUSE ) EVEN NEVADA REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND MAN LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S BELT BUCKLE-- ( LAUGHTER ) HELLO! DEAN HELLER DAMNED THE BILL, SAYING, "IF THIS BILL PASSES, THE SECOND BIGGEST LIE IS YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING DOWN." OF COURSE, THE FIRST BIGGEST LIE IS, "WE'LL ONLY PUT THE BILL HALFWAY IN." ( LAUGHTER ) DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. MAKES NO SENSE. MEANWHILE, HOUSE SPEAKER AND CYBORG LEARNING TO SMILE, PAUL RYAN, DEFENDED THE BILL THIS MORNING ON FOX NEWS TO EXPLAIN WHY THE C.B.O. SCORE IS FINE.
WHAT THEY ARE BASICALLY SAYING AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE IS IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FORCE PEOPLE TO BUY OBAMACARE, IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FORCE PEOPLE TO BUY SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT, THEN THEY WON'T BUY IT. SO, IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING PUSHED OFF THE PLAN. IT'S THAT PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE NOT TO BUY SOMETHING THEY DON'T LIKE OR WANT.
Stephen: MR. SPEAKER, I DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE I "LIKE" IT OR I "WANT" IT. I HAVE IT BECAUSE I "NEED" IT. FOR INSTANCE, I "NEED" FOOD TO LIVE. I "WANT" THAT FOOD TO BE OREOS ( LAUGHTER ) AND BECAUSE OF MY STEADY DIET OF OREOS, I "NEED" HEALTH INSURANCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? ALTHOUGH, I ALSO ENYOI A DELICIOUS SCHATZ SANDWICH. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON OBAMACARE REPEAL AS THE REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO NOT DO IT. WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON. OH, CNN. I WATCH CNN WHEN I COME HOME AT NIGHT, MY WIFE AND I SIT THERE, A LITTLE ANDERSON COOPER, HE'S ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT, INFORMATIVE AND FAIR. CNN TOOK A HIT THIS WEEK AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF A RUSSIA- RELATED ARTICLE THAT HAD TO BE RETRACTED. THIS IS CNN'S WORST MISTAKE SINCE THEIR SHORTLIVED SPIN-OFF, "WOLF BLITZER'S ROCKIN' SITUATION GARAGE." ( LAUGHTER ) THEY RETRACTED THE ARTICLE. IT WAS ABOUT A RUSSIAN INVESTMENT FUND CONNECTED TO TRUMP OFFICIALS, LIKE FORMER ADVISOR AND QUEEN SONG LYRIC, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. SCARAMMUCH! SCARAMMUCH! NOW CNN SAYS THAT "THE RETRACTION DOES NOT MEAN THE FACTS OF THE STORY WERE NECESSARILY WRONG." BUT THEY PULLED THE STORY BECAUSE STANDARD EDITORIAL PROCESSES WERE NOT FOLLOWED YES, IT'S A FINE STORY. THEY JUST FORGOT TO CALL IT "BREAKING NEWS" AND HAVE A COUNTDOWN CLOCK. AS A RESULT, THREE CNN REPORTERS RESIGNED OVER THE ISSUE, WHICH SEEMED TO SETTLE IT. EVEN ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI HIMSELF TWEETED "CNN DID THE RIGHT THING. CLASSY MOVE. APOLOGY ACCEPTED." ( LAUGHTER ) AND "EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES. MOVING ON." WELL GUESS WHO'S NOT MOVING ON? THE TWEETSTER IN CHIEF, WHO UNLOADED THIS MORNING. "FAKE NEWS CNN IS LOOKING AT BIG MANAGEMENT CHANGES NOW THAT THEY GOT CAUGHT FALSELY PUSHING THEIR PHONY RUSSIAN STORIES. RATINGS WAY DOWN!" AND, "WOW, CNN HAD TO RETRACT BIG STORY ON "RUSSIA," WITH 3 EMPLOYEES FORCED TO RESIGN. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER PHONY STORIES THEY DO? FAKE NEWS!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) IT'S TRUE. THEY LOVE HIM HERE. HUGE-- HUGE TRUMP FANS. IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE TRUMP FANS HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT IS TRUE, CNN DOES HAVE SOME PHONY STORIES. I WATCHED "ANTHONY BOURDAIN'S PARTS UNKNOWN," AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY PARTS OF HIS BODY I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW. THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO IS GUILTY OF FAKE NEWS OUT THERE. IT'S DONALD TRUMP.  ( APPLAUSE ) EVIDENTLY, TRUMP HAS A "TIME" MAGAZINE HANGING ON THE WALLS OF MANY OF HIS GOLF CLUBS WITH THE HEADLINE: "DONALD TRUMP: THE APPRENTICE IS A TELEVISION SMASH!" BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S FAKE. IN FACT THE DATE OF THE ISSUE, MARCH 1, 2009, HAD NO ISSUE OF "TIME" MAGAZINE THAT DAY. TRUMP MADE HIS OWN "TIME" MAGAZINE COVER? MY GOD, THAT CAN ONLY MEAN HE'S ACQUIRED MALL KIOSK TECHNOLOGY! BUT IF THAT ONE'S FAKE, PLEASE, TELL ME THERE'S A CHANCE THIS ONE IS FAKE, TOO. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ERIC STONESTREET IS HERE.

Jon: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW, WITH OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE POSSIBLY LOSING HEALTH COVERAGE, FOLKS ARE GOING HAVE TO LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT, LIKE PRAYER, OR BEING RICH, OR ( LAUGHTER ) PRAYING TO BECOME RICH. WELL, IN THESE DARK DAYS OF DOUBT, THANK GOODNESS FOR GWYNETH PALTROW AND HER LIFESTYLE BRAND GOOP. LAST WEEK, I TOLD YOU ABOUT GOOP'S WELLNESS SUMMIT AND SOME OF THEIR GREAT HEALTH PRODUCTS LIKE THEIR JADE EGG TO INCREASE VAGINAL MUSCLE TONE, LEADING TO THE COMMON QUESTION AT GOOP PARTIES, "HOW MUCH CAN YOU VAGINA BENCH?" ( LAUGHTER ) "DO YOU NEED A LIFT?" NOW GOOP HAS OUTDONE THEMSELVES WITH "BODY VIBES," WHICH THEY DESCRIBE AS WEARABLE STICKERS THAT PROMOTE HEALING. PREVIOUSLY, IF YOU WANTED WEARABLE STICKERS THAT PROMOTE HEALING, YOU HAD TO BUY A BOX OF BANDAIDS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. BUT THESE STICKERS-- THESE STICKERS, JON, THEY'RE DIFFERENT. BECAUSE THEY'RE SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO TREAT CONDITIONS LIKE HANGOVERS, HELP YOU WITH "MENTAL FOCUS" AND EVEN MAN I AM SO THIRSTY, I NEED A BIG, TALL BOX OF STICKERS. AND A TEN-PACK OF BODY VIBE STICKERS COSTS JUST 60 BUCKS. YE, YEAH. FOR THAT PRICE, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PICK UP THEIR ANTI-ANXIETY STICKER FOR THE PANIC ATTACK YOU'LL GET WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU SPENT YOUR RENT MONEY ON STUFF THEY GIVE CHILDREN FREE AT THE DENTIST. THE BODY VIBE WEBSITE GOOP-SPLAINS EXACTLY HOW THESE STICKERS WORK, SAYING, "HUMAN BODIES OPERATE AT AN IDEAL ENERGETIC FREQUENCY. IF YOU TAP A FORK AND THEN HOLD THIS NEAR ANOTHER FORK, IT WILL ALSO OSCILLATE AT THE SAME FREQUENCY. THE THEORY IS THAT YOUR CELLS CAN DO THE SAME THING WHEN USING OUR SMART STICKERS." YES, GOOP HAS APPARENTLY CONSULTED WITH TOP FORK SCIENTISTS TO CREATE THESE STICKERS. SO WHAT GOOP IS SAYING IS BUY THESE STICKERS, AND YOU CAN FORK YOURSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, GOOP EXPLAINS-- BIG FANS. THEY'RE LOVING IT. GIVES HOPE. GOOP EXPLAINS WHY YOU CAN TRUST THESE MIRACLE STICKERS. THEY ARE "MADE WITH THE SAME CONDUCTIVE CARBON MATERIAL NASA USES TO LINE SPACESUITS SO THEY CAN MONITOR AN ASTRONAUT'S VITALS DURING WEAR" IN OTHER WORDS, YOU KNOW IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY VALID, BECAUSE... ASTRONAUT. ( LAUGHTER ) , OF COURSE, THIS RAISES THE QUESTION, WHAT DOES NASA HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE SPACE-AGE SMART STICKERS? WHEN REACHED FOR COMMENT, ONE FORMER NASA SCIENTIST SAID, "WOW. WHAT A LOAD OF B.S. THIS IS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES, B.S., WHICH, OF COURSE, IS NASA JARGON FOR "BENEFICIAL STICKERS." AND ANOTHER NASA EXPERT EXPLAINED THAT ASTRONAUTS "DO NOT HAVE ANY CONDUCTIVE CARBON MATERIAL LINING THE SPACESUITS." WELL, I'M GLAD WE CAUGHT THIS NOW. NASA NEEDS TO BUY A BUNCH OF THESE STICKERS BEFORE THEY SEND ANYBODY ELSE INTO SPACE. NOW, IF YOU'RE STILL SKEPTICAL, THEN REST ASSURED, BECAUSE THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANY ARE BOTH ESTHETICIANS. YES, THE LIFE-SAVING SCIENCE OF BODY BRONZING AND BRAZILIAN WAXING, ALWAYS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR SPACE PROGRAM. NEIL ARMSTRONG AND BUZZ ALDRIN WERE SMOOTH AS AN EEL DOWN THERE.

( LAUGHTER ) THAT I HAVE TRIED TO REINVENT-- I DON'T KNOW IF REINVENT-- BUT TRIED TO LOOK AT THE GLASS HALF FULL DESPITE BEING RIDICULED MERCLESSLY ON NATIONAL TV AT 12 AT NIGHT.
Stephen: SINCE YOU HAVE THIS REPUTATION OF THE GUY WITH THE QUICK TEMPER, DO YOU EVER DISAPPOINT PEOPLE BY BEING EVEN TEMPERD?
APPARENTLY, I'VE RECENTLY TAKEN UP GOLF A LITTLE BIT --
Stephen: "APPARENTLY" MEANING THIS IS A RUMOR YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT? YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE MORE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT DO YOU MEAN "APPARENTLY?"
I DON'T WANT TO ADMIT TO IT BECAUSE I MAY QUIT SOON BECAUSE IT'S SO FRUSTRATING-- ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT A GREAT CROWD. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: UH-HUH...
BASICALLY, THEY WANT ME-- THEY GO, "LOOK, DON'T YELL AT ME" THE CADDY WILL SAY BEFORE I TEE OFF. AND THEY'RE UPSET IF I DON'T GET UPSET. I'M TRYING TO USE REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY. IT'S A MELLOWER MORE MATURE McENROE. MAYBE I SHOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD GUY.
Stephen: I LIKE THIS GUY. I LIKE THIS GUY, TOO.
