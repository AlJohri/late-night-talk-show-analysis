WELCOME TO THE NCAA SELECTION SHOW. AS ALWAYS, I'M LARRY BOBERRY. HERE WITH MY CO-ANCHOR. TODAY WE'LL REVEAL THE BRACKETS FOR THE NCAA TOURNAMENT MARCH MADNESS.
THE NUMBERS AND STATS HAVE BEEN CRUNCHED AND THE RESULTS STORED ON A HIGHLY SECURED SERVER IMPOSSIBLE TO HACK.
Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW! LET'S GET TO IT.
THE NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY IS VILLANOVA.
GOING AGAINST NUMBER NINE SEED, AND THIS IS THE SURPRISE, THE RUSSIAN ARMY!
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME A FOREIGN ARMY WILL BE DPEETING IN THIS TOURNAMENT. THE WILDCATS WILL HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM BECAUSE IT WILL BE FIVE PLAYERS AGAINST 850,000 BATTLE-TESTED SOLDIERS.
NOT TO MENTION THE RUSSIAN ARMY HAS A GREAT DEFENSE AND ALSO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
I WOULDN'T COUNT VILLANOVA OUT YET. THEY HAVE JOSH HART.
BUT RUSSIAN PROVED TENACIOUS ON THE EASTERN FRONT.
I'LL MAKE A BOLD PREDICTION AND SAY THE RUSSIAN ARMY MAKES IT TO THE FINAL FOUR.
I AGREE, BUT IN TEND I THINK THE RUSSIANS LOSE TO DUKE OR DUKE IS TOSSED IN A SIBERIAN LABOR CAMP.
EITHER WAY, GREAT TOURNAMENT. FOR EVERYBODY AT CBS SPORTS, GOOD NIGHT!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN W WELCOMES EWAN McGREGOR, FINN WITTROCK, AND MUSICAL GUEST "THE SHINS," FEATURING "STAY HUMAN" AND JON BATISTE. NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WHOO! HEY! WHAT'S UP? THANKS, EVERYBODY! ( PIANO RIFF ) WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. I HOPE EVERYONE IS STAYING SAFE AND WARM TONIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING A BLIZZARD WITH UP TO 18 INCHES OF SNOW FROM WHAT THE WEATHER CHANNEL HAS DUBBED "WINTER STORM STELLA." FOR THE LATEST ON THE STORM, LET'S GO TO THE WEATHER CHANNEL'S JIM CANTORE.
STELLA!
Stephen: THANKS, JIM. YOU STAY SAFE OUT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU THINK HE WOULD BE WEARING A WINTER COAT. SURPRISING HE'S DRESSED THAT WAY. QUICK REMINDER -- THE WEATHER CHANNEL HAS NO AUTHORITY TO NAME ANYTHING. THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, I HAVE AS MUCH AUTHORITY TO NAME THINGS AS THEY DO, SO, BECAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING 18 INCHES OF SNOW, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS 60 DEGREES LAST WEEK, I'M CALLING IT "WINTER STORM: CRAZY BALLS." ( SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, MUCH MORE LIKELY.
Jon: PRETTY CRAZY.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF CRAZY BALLS -- THE GOP'S HEALTH CARE PLAN CAME OUT LAST WEEK AND, SO FAR, IT'S POPULAR WITH EVERYONE... EXCEPT DOCTORS, HOSPITALS, THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, PATIENTS, THE ELDERLY, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, MORTALS. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. THESE MORTALS, THEY NEED SO MUCH CARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS AFTERNOON, THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE RELEASED ITS OFFICIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOP'S HEALTHCARE BILL AND FOUND 24 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE COVERAGE UNDER THE PLAN. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
OH, MAN!
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. KEEP IN MIND, THAT'S 24 MILLION PEOPLE BY 2026. WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE WON'T LIVE THAT LONG. ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND PERSONAL TRAINER WHO HIGH FIVES WAY TOO HARD PAUL RYAN WENT ON "FACE THE DICKERSON" TO GET AHEAD OF THE CBO REPORT.
THE ONE THING I AM CERTAIN WILL HAPPEN IS CBO WILL SAY, WELL, GOSH, NOT AS MANY PEOPLE WILL GET COVERAGE.
STEPHEN: "WELL GOSH! NOT AS MANY PEOPLE WILL GET COVERAGE. GEE WILLICKERS, I NEED CHEMO! CHEESE AND CRACKERS, I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. HOLY TOLEDO, I SHOULD'VE IDENTIFIED MY NEXT OF KIN, BECAUSE... FIDDLESTICKS, I'M DEAD!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD WHEN ITS FOLKSY. GOSH, GOLLY! ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) SO, ANYWAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD END UP LOSING THEIR HEALTHCARE. SPEAKING OF LOSING IT -- DONALD TRUMP -- ( LAUGHTER ) AS YOU ALL RECALL, A WEEK AGO THAT DONALD TRUMP PINCHED OUT A COUPLE OF EARLY MORNING TWEETS ACCUSING BARACK OBAMA OF WIRETAPPING TRUMP TOWER BEFORE THE ELECTION. TRUMP OFFERED NO EVIDENCE AND THEN DEMANDED THAT CONGRESS GO OUT AND FIND SOME EVIDENCE. WELL, TODAY IS THE DEADLINE SET BY CONGRESS FOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO TURN OVER ANYTHING THAT MIGHT EXIST. SO FAR, BRACE YOURSELF,  NOTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THIS  COMING? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT? EVERYONE, INCLUDING PAUL RYAN.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING TO SUGGEST THERE ARE WIRETAPS?
NO.
Stephen: YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND?
NO. OKAY, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD FOUR TWEETS SPECIFICALLY ACCUSING --
NO.
Stephen: OKAY. SO, THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO CANCEL THE INVESTIGATION?
NO.
STEPHEN: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY ABOUT THIS?
NO. OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
STEPHEN: RYAN'S REACTION ISN'T SURPRISING. TO BELIEVE TRUMP'S CLAIMS, YOU'D NEED A SHAKY GRASP OF REALITY, AND ZERO REGARD FOR THE TRUTH. SEAN SPICER TODAY -- ( LAUGHTER ) SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF SOMEONE HAD TO REPRESENT ME, I'D GO WITH SEAN SPICER.
Jon: YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: TODAY, SEAN SPICER ATTEMPTED TO DOWNPLAY THE PRESIDENT'S WIRETAP CLAIM.
THE PRESIDENT USED THE WORD WIRETAP IN QUOTES TO MEAN BROADLY SURVEILLANCE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.
STEPHEN: SEAN, I THINK YOU'RE GRASPING AT "STRAWS." ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK YOU'RE A FUNNY BUNNY. I DON'T LITERALLY MEAN GRASPING AT STRAWS. I MEAN "DEEPLY TROUBLED." ( LAUGHTER ) THEN SEAN GOT A LITTLE "SPICY."
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE QUESTION THAT YOU STILL HAVE NOT ANSWERED IS--
I HAVE ANSWERED IT!
CAN YOU SAY AFFIRMATIVELY THAT, WHENEVER THE PRESIDENT SAYS SOMETHING, WE CAN TRUST IT TO BE REAL?
IF HE'S NOT JOKING, OF COURSE! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY! IF HE'S NOT JOKING! HOW HARD IS IT TO TELL WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS JOKING?! THE PRESIDENT MEANS IT UNLESS HE'S JOKING. AND IT'S EASY TO TELL. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THE OATH OF OFFICE.
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES SO HELP ME GOD. BAZINGA! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HE ALWAYS THROWS THAT ON THE END, RIGHT? BAZINGA! AND SPICER WASN'T THE ONLY MEMBER OF TEAM TRUMP CLEANING UP THE TWEET STORM. ADVISER AND STEP-MOM WHO IS TRYING TO REPLACE YOUR MOTHER, KELLYANNE CONWAY, EXPLAINED YESTERDAY THAT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT HIS PHONE WAS WIRETAPPED DOESN'T MEAN TRUMP IS WRONG.
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THIS WEEK THAT TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU CAN SURVEIL SOMEONE THROUGH THEIR PHONES, THROUGH THEIR -- CERTAINLY THROUGH THEIR TELEVISION SETS, ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS, AND MICROWAVES THAT TURN INTO CAMERAS.
STEPHEN: IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. ( LAUGHTER ) MICROWAVES THAT TURN INTO CAMERAS. HOW DO YOU THINK WE FILM THIS SHOW? JIM, SHOW CAMERA THREE. SHOW 'EM WHAT WE'VE GOT OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE IT IS. ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT, CONWAY'S MICROWAVE HEATED UP ONLINE, SO TODAY SHE EXPLAINED TO CHRIS CUOMO WHY HER CLAIMS MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OFF.
CHRIS, I'M NOT INSPECTOR GADGET.
Stephen: YES, OKAY, CHRIS? INSPECTOR GADGET HAD ALL SORTS OF TOOLS AT HIS DISPOSAL: GADGET SKATES, GADGET 'COPTER... KELLYANNE CONWAY ONLY HAS ONE MOVE: GO-GO ALTERNATIVE FACTS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THEN SHE KEPT TALKING.
I DON'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE USING THE MICROWAVE TO SPY ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. HOWEVER, I HAVE -- I'M NOT IN THE JOB OF HAVING EVIDENCE.
STEPHEN: OKAY... WHO HAS THE EVIDENCE JOB? BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT PAUL RYAN OR TOM PRICE, AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW IF OBAMA WAS SPYING ON EVERYONE THROUGH THE POPCORN SETTING ON OUR MICROWAVES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( DING ) OH, EXCUSE ME. MY HOT POCKET'S DONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, MMM, MMM! MMM! OH, MMM... AHHH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA, I MISS YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ACTUALLY, CAN I COME IN THERE WITH YOU? CAN I JUST -- CAN I JUST -- CAN YOU PLEASE -- CAN I JUST -- I JUST WANT -- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: NICE.
Stephen: WE NEED A BIGGER MICROWAVE. NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT NOT THE PRESIDENT. THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE HE'S WET ALL THE TIME, DONALD JR. ( LAUGHTER ) HE WAS AT GOP FUNDRAISER THIS WEEKEND IN TEXAS, AND HE REALLY KNEW HOW TO WIN OVER THE CROWD, SAYING, "YOU GUYS GET IT. YOU UNDERSTAND THE FREEDOMS ... SO MANY OF WHICH WE'VE LOST WHERE I COME FROM IN THE PEOPLES' REPUBLIC OF NEW YORK. I CAN SAY THAT AND MEAN IT BECAUSE I SEE IT." DUDE, YOU LIVE ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE. THE ONLY THING YOU SEE ARE GOLDENDOODLES WEARING RAINSHOES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: COME ON! ( STEPHEN MAKING HISSING SOUND ) ( LAUGHTER ) A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BECAUSE TRUMP SENIOR OWNS THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. HE'S TURNED IT OVER TO HIS SON, AND DON JUNIOR ASSURED THE CROWD THAT, SINCE HIS DAD TOOK OFFICE, QUOTE, "I BASICALLY HAVE ZERO CONTACT WITH HIM, AT THIS POINT." OH... THANK YOU ( CROWD SAYS, OH... ) A LITTLE LATE BUT THANK YOU. POOR DON JUNIOR. IT REMINDS ME OF THAT OLD SONG, "THE CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON. THE SILVER FORK AND THE SILVER PLATE, THE GOLDEN TABLE, AND THE GOLDEN BED, AND THE GOLDEN TOILET SEAT, YEAH, DADDY'S GOT A GOLDEN TOILET. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "WHEN YOU COMIN' HOME DAD," "I CAN'T TELL YOU, SON." IT VIOLATES THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE, SON. IT VIOLATES THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE." ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. EWAN MCGREGOR IS HERE. BUT, FIRST, I'LL TALK ABOUT ANOTHER TRUMP CRONY WHO'S COZYING UP TO THE RUSSIANS. STICK AROUND. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," MY FRIENDS, RIGHT OVER THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHERE YOU AT? WHERE YOU AT?
Stephen: JON, THE BAND WE'VE GOT ON TONIGHT, "THE SHINS" ARE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT.
Jon: YEAH,  "THE SHINS," NICE!
Stephen: THEY ARE GIVING AWAY THEIR TOUR VAN, THIS THING RIGHT HERE.
Jon: WHOA!
Stephen: DO WE HAVE A SHOT OF THIS THING PARKED OUTSIDE? IT'S LITERALLY PARKED OUTSIDE OF THE THEATER RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THE BAND NAY TOURED WITH FOR YEARS. IT'S BEEN SUPER CHARGED AND SOUPED UP AND THEY'RE GIVING HER AWAY. STICK AROUND AFTER THE SHOW. YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN WIN "THE SHINS" VAN.
Jon: I'VE SEEN WAY WORSE VANS.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT AD FOR A CAR, YOU'VE SEEN WORSE.
Jon: I'VE SEEN WORSE!
Stephen: RIGHT. SPEAKING OF THINGS YOU'VE SEEN WORSE -- SOME OF TRUMP'S FRIENDS MAY BE IN TROUBLE. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS TIME IT'S FORMER CAMPAIGN ADVISOR AND MAITRE D' AT A GANGSTER-THEMED RESTAURANT, ROGER STONE. HE'S A BIG BUDDY OF DONALD TRUMP. DURING THE ELECTION, STONE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING TIES TO THE RUSSIAN HACKERS WHO BROKE INTO THE DNC. BUT JUST LAST WEEK, WHEN ASKED WHAT CONTACT HE HAD WITH RUSSIANS, STONE SAID -- "NONE. NADA. ZILCH. I AM NOT IN TOUCH WITH ANY RUSSIANS. DON'T HAVE A RUSSIAN GIRLFRIEND, DON'T LIKE RUSSIAN DRESSING AND HAVE STOPPED DRINKING RUSSIAN VODKA." ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: "I THREW OUT ALL MY RUSSIAN NESTING DOLLS, I QUIT MY RUSSIAN ROULETTE LEAGUE, AND I EVEN WALK REALLY SLOWLY SO THAT NOBODY CAN SAY I'M RUSHIN'!" ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, SO NO RUSSIAN! NOTHING RUSSIAN AT ALL! OF COURSE, WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A TRUMP ADVISER DENIES CONTACT WITH SUSPECTED RUSSIAN HACKERS -- THEY LATER ADMIT THEY HAD CONTACT WITH SUSPECTED RUSSIAN HACKERS. AND THIS ISN'T JUST ANY HACKER. IT'S THE ONE IS BELIEVED BY U.S. OFFICIALS TO BE LINKED TO RUSSIA AND GOES BY THE NAME GUCCIFER 2.0. AND WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE HACKED D.N.C. E-MAILS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YESTERDAY, STONE CONFIRMED THAT HE AND GUCCIFER HAD A PRIVATE TWITTER CONVERSATION AND RELEASED A SCREENSHOT IN WHICH GUCCIFER TOLD STONE "I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT U R GREAT MAN. PLEASE TELL ME IF I CAN HELP U ANYHOW. IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLEASURE TO ME." YEAH, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP? MAYBE PICK UP YOUR DRY CLEANING, OR, HEY, ANY ELECTIONS YOU NEED RIGGED? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT STONE HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR WHY HE DIDN'T MENTION HIS DIRECT CONTACT WITH ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST NOTORIOUS HACKERS, TELLING THE WASHINGTON TIMES, "IT WAS SO PERFUNCTORY, BRIEF AND BANAL, I HAD FORGOTTEN IT." ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING MY COLLEGE GIRLFRIEND SAID. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TO CLEAR THIS UP, WE MANAGED TO SECURE AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW. PLEASE WELCOME LIVE VIA SATELLITE, THE HACKER HIMSELF, GUCCIFER 2.0. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, MR. 2.0. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT IS GREAT PLEASURE TO ME, STEPHEN. YOU LOOK SO MUCH DIFFERENT IN PERSON THAN IN PRIVATE PHOTOS I FIND ON YOUR COMPUTER.
STEPHEN: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP ADVISER ROGER STONE.
YES, I LOVE ROGER! I CALL HIM "STONEY THE TIGER" BECAUSE HE'S GRRRRRRREAT MAN!
STEPHEN: REALLY? BECAUSE HE SAID HIS CONTACT WITH YOU WAS "BANAL" AND "PERFUNCTORY."
WELL, I'M SURE "PERFUNCTORY" IS GOOD! IS "FUNKY", LIKE AMERICAN HIP-HOP.
STEPHEN: NO, HE DENIES HAVING ANY REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.
WELL, OKAY. IS NOT IMPORTANT TO ME EITHER. I DM WITH MANY DECAYING AND BEAUTIFUL OLD MEN ... OH, WHO AM I KIDDING? I MISS HIM SO MUCH! I MAY BE MOST DANGEROUS HACKER IN THE WORLD, BUT THE STONE-MAN BREACHED THE FIREWALL... TO MY HEART. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO KNEW THAT COLLUDING TO THROW ELECTION FOR PARANOID REALITY TV STAR COULD HAVE SUCH BAD RESULT!
STEPHEN: GUCCIFER, I'M SO SORRY.
HE PROMISED ME HE'D HELP RAISE LITTLE GUCCIFER 3.0! ( LAUGHTER ) DON'T WORRY, GOOSEY-3, PAPA WILL BE HOME SOON!
STEPHEN: GUCCIFER 2.0, EVERYONE... WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH EWAN MCGREGOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ HEY GOODLOOKIN' ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT CURRENTLY STARS AS AN ENDEARING CANDLESTICK IN "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" AND AN ENDEARING DRUG ADDICT IN "T2 TRAINSPOTTING." ♪ ♪
GO, GO, GO! ♪ ♪
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME EWAN McGREGOR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
THAT WAS NICE. WHERE ARE WE?
Stephen: WE'RE IN THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER BEEN IN HERE.
Stephen: NEVER BEEN IN HERE?
NO.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T COME HERE WHEN DAVE WAS HERE?
I NEVER LOOKED UP IF I DID. I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: WE CHANGED THE CEILING.
WELL, IN THAT CASE, MAYBE I HAVE. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE KEPT IT AS COLD AS WE USED TO.
THAT DOES REMIND ME OF DAVE'S STUDIO.
Stephen: AS I SAID IN THE INTRO, YOU ARE PLAYING A TALKING CANDLE STICK.
YEP.
Stephen: AND A 40-YEAR-OLD HEROIN ADDICT IN THESE TWO DIFFERENT FILMS. WHICH ONE OF THESE THINGS IS MORE BELIEVABLE? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT ANY OF THE GUYS FROM "TRAIN SPOTTING" ARE ALIVE IS PRETTY CRAZY.
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S QUITE A STRETCH TO BELIEVE ME AS A CANDLESTICK. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: OH, I TOTALLY BUY YOU AS A CANDLESTICK.
THE TRUTH IS, RANT CLEANED UP HIS ACT OVER THE YEARS. A LOT OF PEOPLE CLEAN UP AFTER HEROIN AND GET OVER IT.
Stephen: THOSE GUYS ARE LIVING A PRETTY ROUGH LIFE THERE. THE FACT YOU PEOPLE IN T2 HAVE ALL YOUR TEETH IS SURPRISING. ( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T THINK BOBBY HAS ALL OF HIS THERE. HE'S MISSING ONE, I THINK.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," YOU PLAY A CANDLESTICK. HOW DOES ONE PREPARE AS AN ACTOR, HOW DOES ONE DO A RIDE ALONG AS A CANDLESTICK?
MONTHS AND MONTHS OF RESEARCH. I DON'T KNOW REALLY KNOW. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT IT IS I SORT OF JUST SWANNED INTO IT WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT. IT WAS A MISTAKE, AS IT TURNED OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH A BEAUTIFUL FRENCH WOMAN FOR 23, -5, -4 YEARS, AND I THOUGHT I COULD DO THE FRENCH ACCENT, WITH BULL I COULDN'T DO IT.
Stephen: YOU DID THE FRENCH ACCENT AS LUMIER AND YOU COULDN'T DO IT?
IT WAS A BIT SOUTH OF THE BORDER.
Stephen: YOU WERE A BIT MEXICAN? WE DON'T NEED NO STEENKING BEAST! ( LAUGHTER )
WE ARE GUESTS! WE ARE GUESTS! S-- ( LAUGHTER )
WE RECORDED IT BECAUSE I'M A CANDLESTICK. WE GOT THERE BEFORE SHOOTING, RECORDED ALL THE DIALOGUE, AND WHAT WE RECORDED WAS GOING TO BE PLAYED BACK ON SET FOR THE AMAZING ACTORS TO LISTEN TO. AND I LEFT GOING, OH, NO, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE LISTENING.
Stephen: IS THIS JUST IN A RECORDING BOOTH OR WAS IT THE SIR COZ WITH THE BLUE BALLS ON.
WE DID THE BLUE BALLS THING, WHICH IS A BIT OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE HERE ACTUALLY. WE DID THE BALLS THING JUST TO GET MY MOVEMENT SO I COULD FEEL A BIT LIKE ME, I GUESS. THEN I RECORDED MY DIALOGUE. WE DID IT TOGETHER IN A RECORDING STUDIO.
Stephen: WHO IS HE? HE PLAYS COGSWORTH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE CHILDREN, SURAL YOU KNEW THIS MUSICAL BEFORE YOU TOOK THE JOB, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN?
OLDEST IS 21, MY YOUNGEST IS 6.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU ESCAPE FROM DISNEY, THE BLACK HOLE THAT IS BE OUR GUEST?
I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT, THE ORIGINAL.
Stephen: IT'S VERY GOOD. IT'S NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO. I DON'T KNOW, IT WASN'T ONE THEY WATCHED.
Stephen: HAS IT NOT BEEN TRANSLATED INTO SCOTTISH?
NO. NO. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT SHOULD BE.
Stephen: YEAH. O, I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS QUITE HANDY IN A WAY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A PART THAT'S WELL KNOWN, IT'S GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW IT SO IT CAN BE YOURS. I DIDN'T TRY TO BE LIKE THE GUY WHO DID IT IN THE CARTOON IN THE '90s.
Stephen: THERE IS A LITTLE CONTROVERSY IN THIS FILM.
THERE IS A LOT OF GAY SEX IN THE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING ) THERE IS A LOT OF GAY SEX IN THIS CARTOON. IF YOU LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR ALABAMA, YOU SHOULD NOT GO AND SEE THIS FILM! WHAT WOULD JESUS THINK?!
Stephen: I'LL ASK HIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT?
Stephen: NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE. THERE ARE RUMORS HE HAS GAY PARTS.
HE'S A GAY CHARACTER.
Stephen: I THINK IT TURNS OUT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY.
HE'S A GAY CHARACTER. IT'S 2017. FOR (BLEEP) SAKE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. IS THAT ANY OF YOUR DIALOGUE FROM THE FILM? OR IS THAT -- ( LAUGHTER )
NO, NO.
Stephen: BUT IT IS SOME OF YOUR DIALOGUE FROM T2 TRAINSPOTTER.
SOME OF MY LIGHTER DIALOGUE, YEAH.
Stephen: NOW SPEAKING OF AN ACTOR, SOMEONE WHO'S COMMITTED TO THEIR ROLE IN TRAINSPOTTING, YOUR CHARACTER LOVES THE DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS HEROIN AND HAS TO KICK IT BUT KEEPS GETTING SUCKED BACK IN. DID YOU DO A RIDE-ALONG THERE? DID YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF, WELL, IF I'M GOING TO PLAY A HEROIN ADDICT I AT LEAST SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON THE NOD.
I DID THINK ABOUT IT AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT IN TIME. THE TRAINSPOTTING NOVEL WAS SORT OF A NOVEL OF OUR GENERATION IN SCOTLAND AND FURTHER AFIELD I GUESS. BUT IN SCOTLAND IT WAS LIKE THE BOOK OF OUR GENERATION. AND WHEN WE ARE PREPARING TO MAKE THE MOVIE,  I FELT LIKE IT WAS -- IT FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BECOME WHAT IT HAD BECOME. IT FELT THAT SPECIAL. I WAS CONVINCED IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING PIECE OF WORK. I DID THINK, I'VE NEVER DONE HEROIN AND IF I'M GOING TO CONVINCINGLY PLAY A HEROIN ADDICT, IRKED TRY. I HAD A NOTION OUR SCRIPT WRITER -- HE'S A DOCTOR -- AND I THOUGHT, WELL, HE COULD GIVE US SOME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH, HE COULD GIVE US SOME.
Stephen: DOCTORS IN SCOTLAND HAVE HEROIN IS THIS.
I'M SURE THEIR ACCESS TO SOME SOMEWHERE.
Stephen: SURELY. I THOUGHT, THAT WOULD MAKE IT SAFE. SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND THEN I STARTED WORKING WITH DANNY BOYLE AND WE WENT UP TO GLASGOW AND WORKED WITH RECOVERING ADDICTS AND ONE GUY BECAME OUR HEROIN ADVISOR ON SET. I WENT TO ONE OF THEIR RECOVERY MEETINGS AND I WATCHED THESE YOUNG GUYS AND GIRLS COME IN AND I SAW THE EXTRAORDINARY SUFFERING THEY WERE GOING THROUGH AND THE PAIN IN THEIR EYES AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY DISRESPECTFUL TO THEM FOR ME TO GO TRY HEROIN.
Stephen: TO DABBLE. I DIDN'T NEED TO. IT WASN'T NECESSARY. SO I ASKED ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE GENEROUS ENOUGH TO GIVE US THEIR TIME, AND I ASKED THEM TO DESCRIBE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO WITHDRAW AND WHAT IT FELT LIKE WHEN YOU INJECTED HEROIN. I'M AN ACTOR AND I HAVE TO USE MY IMAGINATION, SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO THEM TO HAVE DONE THAT.
Stephen: WHEN I WATCHED TRAINSPOTTING, I NEEDED SOME OF THE SUBTITLES FOR SOME OF THE SCENES. IS THAT SCOTLAND'S REVENGE ON THE ENGLISH? ( LAUGHTER )
NO, I THINK OUR MIDGEYS ARE THE REVENGE. THEY'RE TINY MOSQUITOES. THEY'RE A NIGHT MAYOR. NOBODY GOATS THERE BECAUSE THEY GET EATEN ALIVE BY THEM.
Stephen: IS THERE A SCOTTISH PHRASE YOU PARTICULARLY LOVE THAT I PERHAPS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT IF YOU SAID IT? BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OF THE FILM I'M ONLY GETTING THE EMOTIONAL CONTENT FROM.
YES, WELL, I'LL COME ON TO THAT. PARTLY, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, I THINK, WHEN WE MADE THE FIRST TRAIN SPOTTING FILM, THEY ASKED US TO REDO THE FIRST THIRD OF THE MOVIE TO MAKE IT SLIGHTLY LESS SCOTTISH.
Stephen: YOU DUBBED IT? JUST THE FIRST THIRD, WE DUBBED SOME OF IT.
Stephen: OKAY. IF YOU SEE THE BRITISH VERSION, BOBBY CARLISLE HAS A MAJOR SCENE AND IT STARTS AT THE VOLLEY WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE BUB AND THEY TIED IT UP SO YOU COULD SLIGHTLY UNDERSTAND HIM AND IT RUINED IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING YOU GET THE POINT NOT TO GO NEAR HIM OR ANNOY HIM IN ANY WAY. SO WE DIDN'T DO THAT THIS TIME, BUT WHAT DANNY'S DONE IS HE HAS DONE SOME SORT OF SLIGHTLY AMUSING SUBTITLING AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE TO HELP THE AMERICAN EAR INTO THE ACCENT.
Stephen: YEAH. BECAUSE IT'S AN ACT OF TRUST FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES.
YEAH. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MY FAVORITE SCOTTISH PHRASE?
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TO. IT'S A BIT RUDE, THOUGH.
Stephen: SURE. IT GOES LIKE THIS -- IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET HUNG FOR STEALING A SHEEP YOU MIGHT AS WELL (BLEEP) IT AS WELL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

THEY CUT OUT MY BIG SINGING NUMBER. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T WIN.
THAT WAS THE CLUTCHING POINT.

SOME STORIES I HAVE BEEN SWORN TO SECRECY ABOUT.

Stephen: I HEARD YOU WERE ACCEPTED TO JUILLIARD AND YOU SAID, NAH. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT MADE YOU SAY "NAH"?
I WAS 18 AND PROBABLY FULL OF MYSELF AND I WANTED TO JUST DO SOME TV AND I WAS ON THE PILOT OF "COLD CASE," YOU REMEMBER THAT SHOW?
Stephen: NOPE. NOPE. OKAY. IT'S GONE. I GOT INTO JUILLIARD. I KIND OF AUDITIONED ON A WHIM. I WAS, LIKE, I'M NOT GOING TO EVER GET IN. I THOUGHT, I'LL AUDITION AND GET IT OVER WITH. THEY CALLED ME AND SAID, YOU'RE IN, YOU CAN COME. I SAID, CAN I DEFER FOR A YEAR? THEY SAID WE DON'T DEFER. SO I TURNED THEM DOWN AND TRIED OUT NEXT YEAR.
Stephen: AND THEY ACCEPTED YOU.
YES, IT PAID OFF.
Stephen: WHEN YOU TRAINED AT JUILLIARD, WHAT'S THE SECRET SAUCE?
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TELL YOU.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO START MY OWN THEATER SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET, TRY TO TRITO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS.
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S FOUR YEARS, AN INTENSE PROGRAM.
Stephen: FIRST ANIMAL SPINE.
THE FIRST THREE MONTHS WE'RE LAYING ON OUR BACKS HUMMING, NONSTOP.
Stephen: DID YOU DO CLASSICAL VOCAL TRAINING AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
YEAH, LOTS OF VOCAL TRAINING, LOTS OF ARTICULATION, VOICE WORK, ALL THAT STUFF. I'VE FORGOTTEN IT ALL.
Stephen: DID YOU GUY DO -- FISTS AND LOUDEST BOASTS. HE THRUSTS HIS FISTS AGAINST THE POSTS AND STILL INSISTS HE SEES THE GHOSTS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE SLITS THE SHEETS, THE SHEETS SHE SLITS AND ON THE SLITTED SHEETS SHE SITS. ( STEPHEN RESPEEDS )  REPEATS )
WOW, YOU DIDN'T SAY THE WORD!
Stephen: THE CENSOR HAD HER FINGER ON THE BUTTON THE ENTIRE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR DAD WORKED IN SHAKESPEARE.
HE DID IN LENNOX, MASSACHUSETTS. THAT'S WHERE I CAUGHT THE BUG.
Stephen: DID YOU WANDER AROUND THE HOUSE RECITING SHAKESPEARE?
YEAH, ROMEO AND JULIET AND WHATEVER. I TRIED TO SKIP THE WORDS AND GET TO THE SWORD FIGHTS. WE WOULD GO OUT IN THE WOODS AND TRY TO FIND STICKS AND FIGHT WITH THEM. IT WAS A SPECIAL WAY TO GROW UP. IT DEFINITELY EXPOSED ME TO THEATER AT A VERY YOUNG AGE AND I THINK IT WAS A HEFERLTY WAY TO START.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING WITH SALLY FIELD?
SHE'S THE BEST IS THAT HAS SHE MADE OUT WITH YOU YET?
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
