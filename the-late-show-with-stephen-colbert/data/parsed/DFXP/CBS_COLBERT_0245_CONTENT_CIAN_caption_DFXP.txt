Stephen: HELLO, AMERICA. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS, THEN S YOU'VE PUT THE BOTTLE DOWN AND REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS. NOW, YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT ON TUESDAY THERE WAS AN ELECTION. WE DID A LIVE SPECIAL ON SHOWTIME, AND WE'RE BRINGING YOU THE BEST MOMENTS OF THE WORST MOMENTS. AND GUESS WHAT? IT'S FREE. SHHH! DON'T TELL SHOWTIME. WE WENT ON THE AIR AT 11 P.M. THAT NIGHT WHEN THE RESULTS WERE FIRST COMING IN. IF I SEEMED CONFUSED AT TIMES, IT'S BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET SIX HOURS EARLIER, SO I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE WORLD WAS RAPIDLY PLUNGING INTO DARKNESS. SO SIT BACK, RELAX, AND ENJOY, IF YOU'RE STILL ABLE TO DO ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MARK HALPERIN AND JOHN HEILEMAN HEILEMANN. JEFF GOLDBLUM. AND MUSICAL GUEST ELLE KING. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH! THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S SO LOVELY. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU OUT THERE, IN HERE, ALL AROUND THE PLACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING, AMAZING. THANKS SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. YOU DON'T NEED TO STAND FOR ME. YOU DON'T NEED TO CHANT MY NAME, AMERICA DOESN'T HAVE DICTATORS. YET. WELCOME TO MY LIVE ELECTION NIGHT SPECIAL ON SHOWTIME! I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN (BLEEP) COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I KNOW. GOTTA GET USED TO IT. I'M SORRY. HE'S SO INNOCENT. JON BATISTE HAS SUCH INNOCENT EARS. HERE WE ARE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE END OF THE ELECTION. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WHAT A YEAR TONIGHT HAS BEEN, RIGHT NOW EYE KNOW YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE YOUR PHONES OR ANYTHING-- RIGHT NOW THE ELECTION IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL AND TOO TERRIFYING TO CONTEMPLATE. TRUMP HAS OUTPERFORMED EXPECTATIONS IN EARLY RESULTS. THIS ONE IS A NAIL BITER AND A PASSPORT GRABBER. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE AVOID THE APOCALYPSE, AND HALF OF THE COUNTRY IS VOTE FOR THE ASTEROID. YOU CAN FEEL IT?
PEOPLE-- PEOPLE-- ARE YOU ON EDGE TONIGHT?
Audience: YES!
Stephen: I THINK EVERYONE IS ON EDGE, SPECIFICALLY, LIKE THE EDGE OF THE COUNTRY WAITING FOR TRUMP TO WIN SO THEY CAN WALK INTO CANADA. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ONE OF THE MOMENTS I LIKE MOST ABOUT ELECTION DAY, IT HAPPENS EVERY FOUR YEARS, AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF A SWEET HOME THE, THEY SHOW ON THE NEWS THE FOOTAGE OF THE CANDIDATES GOING TO VOTE. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S HILLARY CLINTON VOTING FOR HERSELF FOR PRESIDENT. OBVIOUSLY, NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT ALSO THE OTHERS WERE WRITE-INS. ( LAUGHTER ) DONALD TRUMP ALSO WENT TO THE POLLS TODAY AND HE MADE HISTORY BY STEPPING INSIDE A PUBLIC SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE. AND ONCE INSIDE, TRUMP CAST HIS VOTE WHILE SPYING ON MELANIA'S BALLOT. THAT'S INCREDIBLE-- THAT IS-- THAT IS THE FIRST TIME TRUMP HAS BEEN CAUGHT CHEATING OFF ONE OF HIS WIVES INSTEAD OF ON ONE OF HIS WIVES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT DAY FOR WOMEN. ARE THERE ANY WOMEN HERE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M A HUGE FAN. I LOVE WOMEN. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS A SIGNATURE DAY FOR WOMEN, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S TARA REID'S 41st BIRTHDAY. I'M WITH HER. FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND THIS IS REALLY, REALLY MOVING WHEN YOU GO. AND SEE THE BALLOT-- WOMEN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAST THEIR VOTE FOR A FEMALE PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT GAVE ME CHILLS WHEN I WENT TODAY. MANY WOMEN MARKED THE OCCASION BY COVERING SUSAN B. ANTHONY'S GRAVESTONE WITH THEIR "I VOTED STICKERS." IT WAS A MOVING TRIBUTE AND I'M SURE IF SHE WERE ALIVE TODAY SUSAN B. ANTHONY WOULD SAY, "HELP. I'VE BEEN BURIED ALIVE. I HEAR YOUR FOOT STEPS UP THERE, YOU MONSTERS! GET ME OUT OF HERE." WHAT ELSE? OH, LATINO TURNOUT APPEARS TO BE UP IN FLORIDA, GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA, ARIZONA, AND TEXAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY SEEM TO BE CONNECTING WITH HILLARY'S COURAGEOUS MESSAGE, "I DON'T THINK YOU'RE RAPISTS." AND TONIGHT I WILL BRING YOU ALL THE RESULTS IS WHAT IT SAYS ON THE THING HERE. I'M NOT SURE I WILL. I DON'T BELIEVE PERSONALLY, I DON'T BELIEVE IN RED STATES AND BLUE STATES. ON OUR MAP, WHEN TRUMP WINS A STATE, IT WILL TURN BRIGHT ORANGE. AND WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WINS A STATE, IT WILL BE DELETED. HERE'S THE THING-- WHEN I WALKED INTO THIS THEATER, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER CLINTON OR TRUMP HAS WON. BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW TRUMP'S CANDIDACY EVEN GOT THIS FAR.
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, STEPHEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JEFF GOLDBLUM! JEFF! JEFF! TELL US-- TELL US-- THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. JEFF, TELL US HOW DID IT GET THIS FAR?
IT'S CHAOS THEORY. THE G.O.P. TOOK A HARDENED CHUNK OF AMBER WITH PREHISTORIC IDEAS AND CREATED A MONSTER. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD KEEP HIM CONTAINED, BUT THEY DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE MILLION DIFFERENT HORRIBLE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG.
Stephen: LIKE HIM SAYING AND DOING THINGS?
EXACTLY RIGHT. THE G.O.P. WAS SO PREOCCUPIED WITH WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD CREATE A CANDIDATE, THEY DIDN'T STOP TO THINK IF THEY SHOULD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND NOW HE'S DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN HIS PATH, INCLUDING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
Stephen: MY GOD. JEFF, PLEASE, TELL ME HE HASN'T LEARNED HOW TO OPEN DOORS!
NO, HIS HANDS ARE TOO SMALL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, SURELY, IF HE LOSES THE ELECTION, HE'LL JUST GO AWAY, RIGHT?
STEPHEN, IF THERE IS ONE THAT THING EVOLUTION HAS TAUGHT US, IT'S THAT TRUMP'S EGO WILL NOT BE CONTAINED. IT EXPANDS TO NEW TERRITORIES AND CRASHES THROUGH BARRIERS, PAINFULLY, MAYBE EVEN DANGEROUSLY, BUT, UH... WELL, THERE IT IS. BE ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT WAIT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT-- WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT TRUMP, UH, FINDS A WAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JEFF GOLDBLUM, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, JEFF.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WHEN I COME BACK, I'LL HAVE JOHN HEILEMANN AND MARK HALPERIN "THE CIRCUS," AND I MEAN THE POLITICAL SHOW NOT WHAT I'M THINKING OF RUNNING AWAY TO. SO STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MY GUESTTONIGHT ARE EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS AND REPORTEREPORTERS FRREPORTERS FRO "THE CIRCUS." PLEASE WELCOME MARK HALPERIN AND JOHN HEILEMANN. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: GENTLEMEN, BEFORE WE GET INTO OUR CONVERSATION, I UNDERSTAND FROM THE DOCUMENTARY YOU GUYS DRINK A FAIR AMOUNT ON THE TRAIL. WOULD YOU CARE FOR A COCKTAIL?
BRING IT ON.
WE ALREADY HAD THREE UPSTAIRS.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
Stephen: I'VE GOT SOME PREMADE OLD FASHIONEDS.
ARE DOUBLES AVAILABLE.
Stephen: THEY ARE CHEERS.
TO AMERICA.
Stephen: HERE'S TO DEMOCRACY.
IN ACTION.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU A TECHNICAL QUESTION THAT YOU GUY THINK POLITICAL ANALYSTS WOULD KNOW, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) IS HAPPENING?
THAT IS A TERM POLITICAL SCIENTISTS USE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE MAGIC BOXES HERE. YOU'VE GOT YOUR "HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY," WHICH TECHNICALLY SHOULD SAY, "DON'T PANIC" ON THE FRONT OF THEM. IS HAPPENING OUT THERE? I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ANYTHING IN THE PAST HALF HOUR. WHAT IS GOING ON?
MY SENSE IS THAT THIS AUDIENCE WILL NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE THIS. BUT HE IS NOW THE FRONT-RUNNER.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HE HAS MORE PATHS NOW TO 270 ELECTORAL VOTES THAN SHE DOES.
Stephen: HE HAD ALMOST NO PATH A WEEK AGO.
THAT WAS BASED ON PUBLIC DATA. I THINK POLLING AND STATISTICS CAN TELL YOU A LOT, AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN'S CONFIDENCE WAS BASED ON THAT. BUT THERE IS A HUMAN ELEMENT TO POLITICS, AND IT APPEARS THAT AT LEAST-- IT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO WIN-- BUT IT APPEARS THE MOMENTUM AND THE DESIRE FOR CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY HAS MADE THIS A MUCH CLOSER RACE THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT.
Stephen: SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED? WHEN I CAME IN HERE, FLORIDA HAD NOT BEEN CALLED? HAS IT BEEN CALLED?
STILL HAS NOT BEEN CALLED. IT'S VERY CLOSE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE AMOUNT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE TOO MUCH FOR HER TO SURMOUNT.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW, WITH FLORIDA AND OHIO--
TWO STATES ARE FRONT AND CENTER THAT WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT A WEEK AGO, WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN. HE'S AHEAD IN BOTH. IF HE WINS THEM BOTH, HE'S PRESIDENT. IF HE-- IF HE WINS ONE, IT'S-- HE NEEDS SOMETHING ELSE. THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS SAYING YOU'VE GOT AREAS IN BOTH STATES-- MADISON HAS STILL NOT REPORTED BACK. ANN ARBOR HAS STILL NOT REPORTED BACK. THEY'RE HOPING THERE ARE PARTS OF THOSE STATES, WHEN THE VOTE COMES IN, THEY'LL MAKE THEM CLOSER, AND WE COULD HAVE SOME RECOUNTS.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE-- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS. IF YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE A DIAGNOSIS, IF YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE AN M.R.I. TO THE NATION TO SAY HOW DID WE GET TO THIS SPOT? WHAT WOULD BE THE DIAGNOSIS FOR THE UNITED STATES. DR. HALPERIN WHAT WOULD BE YOUR DIAGNOSIS FOR THE UNITED STATES?
CAN AN M.R.I. DEPICT SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED. IF HE WINS IT WILL BA SURPRISE FROM A POLITICAL SCIENCE POINT OF VIEW BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ARE GOING TO BE REALLY UPSET, JUST AS IF SHE WINS A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE REALLY UPSET. THIS HAS BEEN THE DARKEST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN I HAVE COVERED. I HAVE COVERED EVERYONE SINCE '88. THE AFTERMATH, BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE, WHOEVER WINS, IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY CHALLENGING TIME FOR AMERICA. GOOD LINE FOR A COMEDY SHOW, EH?
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IT'S A COMEDY SHOW AT THIS POINT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DOCUMENTARY RIGHT NOW. AM I IN YOUR ( BLEEP ) DOCUMENTARY RIGHT NOW IS THIS JUST FOR SHOWTIME?
DO SOMETHING IRRESISTIBLE.
Stephen: WHAT?
DO SOMETHING IRRESISTIBLE.
Stephen: INTO THE DOCUMENTARY?
YEAH.
Stephen: IF TRUMP WINS HOW ABOUT BURSTING INTO TEARS CAN AND SCREAMING ( BLEEP ) FOR THE NEXT 45 MINUTES. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY? ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT? DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. SO THAT'S BEEN CALLED.
HE IS-- HE IS NOW ON THE DOORSTEP OF 270 ELECTORAL VOTES.
Stephen: WOW, WOW. THAT'S A HORRIFYING PROSPECT. I CAN'T PUT-- I CANNOT PUT A-- A-- I CAN'T PUT A HAPPY FACE ON THAT. AND THAT'S MY JOB. IS THERE-- IS THERE A COMPARABLE MOMENT IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY THAT-- THAT YOU CAN PULL OUT? JOHN, YOU CAN PULL ANYTHING OUT OF YOUR POCKET OF ALL THE POLICIES YOU'VE FOLLOWED? ARE WE ON VIRGIN SNOW RIGHT NOW?
WE ARE ON VIRGIN SNOW. ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T SAY SNOW. IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING MAYBE A LITTLE BROWNER THAN SNOW WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW. NO, I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN, WHEN WE STARTED "THE CIRCUS" THE FIRST EPISODE WAS CALLED "THE OUTSIDERS" AND IT WAS FOCUSED ON I THINK THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE RACE. ONE WAS DONALD TRUMP, AND THE OTHER WAS NOT HILLARY CLINTON. THE OTHER WAS BERNIE SANDERS. TO GO TO YOURENING THING ABOUT THE M.R.I. OF THE SOUL, TERMINAL GRIEVANCE ANDANGER AND POPULIST IRE AFFLICTS BOTH SIDES, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON THE FAR LEFT AND FAR RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE REALLY PISSED OFF. AND A LOT MORE PISSED OFF THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE KIND OF PLACES WE SPEND TIME UNDERSTAND JUST HOW COMPREHENSIBLE PISSED OFF THEY ARE AT DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, WALL STREET, THE FORTUNE 500, THE MEDIA, EVERYBODY. THAT SENSE OF ANGER, OUTRAGE, AND GRIEVANCE DROVE A LOT OF OUR POLITICS, LEFT AND RIGHT. IT JUST HAPPENS BERNIE SANDERS FELL A LITTLE SHORT ON THE LEFT, AND DONALD TRUMP STAGED A HOSTILE TAKEOVER ON THE RIGHT AND NOW WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.
OUTSIDE OF THE CIVIL WAR, WORLD WAR II, AND 9/11, THIS MAY BE THE MOST CATACLYSMIC EVENT THE COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN.
Stephen: WELL-- ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE. I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW. CHEERS. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR THE NEWS--
YOU DON'T MEAN ANY OF THAT. YOU DON'T MEAN ANY OF THAT.
Stephen: NO, OBVIOUSLY, I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE. I'M GOING TO FINISH THIS REAL--
YOU CAN FINISH MINE, TOO. I HAVE TO GO BACK BACK TO WORK.
Stephen: I GOTTA WORK. THE FINAL SEASON OF "THE CIRCUS" AIRS THIS SUNDAY. MARK HALPERIN, AND JOHN HEILEMANN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST HAS DEFENDED ALL OF US FROM ALIEN AND CIEN DINOSAUR ATTACKS IN THE MOVIE, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS AS SCARY AS THIS ELECTION RIGHT NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME THE ONE, THE ONLY, THE GREAT JEFF GOLDBLUM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: JEFF, I HAVE A CARD HERE THAT SAYS I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. BUT I'LLING FRANK. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING BACKSTAGE IN THE GREEN ROOM?
YES, YES, YEAH, YEAH. I'VE WATCHED FOR THE WHOLE TIME. I'VE PUT IN HOURS, MY WIFE AND I EMILY HAVE PUT IN HOURS AND HOURS OF READING AND STUDYING AND PARTICIPATING. WE WENT TO OHIO A COUPLE OF WEEKENDS OKAY AGO AND DID CAMPAIGN EVENTS FOR HILLARY. TONIGHT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE WONDERFUL AND IT COULD BE. I'M VERY FRIGHTENED. I'M VERY ALARMED. I'M SOBERED.
Stephen: YOU'RE SOBERED. WE COULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IF YOU LIKE. ( LAUGHTER ) UH-HUH.
ALL OF THAT, YOU KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I'M IN SHOCK. I'M IN SHOCK. BUT, I'M-- I'M TRYING TO-- TO-- TO NAVIGATE HOW I CAN BEST, YOU KNOW-- LOOK, HORRIBLE THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO ME, TO ALL OF US. WE'LL--, YOU KNOW-- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SURE, EXACTLY.
OUR LIVES WILL END.
Stephen: THAT'S THE HAPPIEST THOUGHT I CAN THINK OF. PERHAPS SOMETHING WORSE THAN THIS WILL HAPPEN TO ME ONE DAY.
YES, WELL IT CERTAINLY WILL.
Stephen: YES.
AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT-- THE TALENT IN LIFE IS HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT.
Stephen: SURE. I MEAN FROADO AND SAM DIDN'T THINK THEY'D BE ABLE TO MAKE IT UP MOUNT DOOM.
FROADO AND SAM-- YES, YES, OKAY, I'M NOT SO EXPOSED. HERE'S WHAT I THINK. EITHER WE-- THEY SAY YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE THREE THINGS-- ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SOMETHING. YOU'RE ENJOYING SOMETHING. OR YOU'RE ACCEPTING SOMETHING. WHATEVER CARDS THE UNIVERSE DEALS YOU. SO THIS IS A TEST OF OUR ABILITY TO ACCEPT.
Stephen: OKAY, TRY AND ACCEPT THIS. SEE IF YOU CAN ACCEPT THIS? GEORGIA AND IOWA HAVE GONE FOR DONALD TRUMP. HOW'S THAT GOING? HOW'S THE ACCEPTING GOING?
WELL --
DO YOU MEDITATE. DO YOU MEDITATE IN DO YOU DO ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF PUP SEEM LIKE-- YOU DON'T GET TOO EXCITED. YOU DON'T GET TOO DEPRESSED.
I'M VERY, I'M VERY PASSIONATE AND EXCITED. I HAVE HIGHS AND LOWS.
Stephen: BUT THEY LOOK THE SAME TO US.
REALLY?
Stephen: WE LIKE ALL OF THEM, BUT--
I ASPIRE TO A YOAGIC LIFE SOME TIMES. I'M MEDITATING NOW. I THINK THIS CAN BE A MEDITATION IF YOU FIND YOURSELF PRESENCE IN THIS MOMENT. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY TRICKS FOR HOW TO GET PRESENT IN THE MOMENT?
UM...
Stephen: I AM THE ONE WHO IS HERE. THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
WELL, YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING, YOU KNOW, AND YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING.
Stephen: LET'S PAY ATTENTION TO THESE PEOPLE. HOW ARE EVERYBODY FEELING? IT MAY NOT BE THE HAPPIEST NEWS SO FAR THIS EVENING, THE STORY'S NOT OVER.
YEAH.
Stephen: CERTAINLY. ARE YOU HAPPY THAT YOU'RE ALL TOGETHER? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU SEE? THAT'S SOMETHING. WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING RIGHT THERE.
I CAN FIND SOMETHING INSPIRING. CERTAINLY-- CERTAINLY MUSIC IS. I'M THRILLED I'M HERE. CERTAINLY MUSIC IS INSPIRING. IT CAN-- MUSIC WILL BE A PART OF MY LIFE AND HEALING, I'M SURE.
Stephen: BECAUSE PLAY THE PIANO.
NO MATTER WHAT. I PLAY THE PIAPO. IT SOOTHING THE SAVAGE BEAST OR BREAST.
Stephen: BREAST. WE'RE ON SHOWTIME SO WE CAN SAY "BREAST" INSTEAD OF "BEAST."
YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN CAN DO WITHIN YOUR CIRCLE OF INFLUENCE. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. EVEN WHEN YOU OTHERS -- WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN THIS "OTHERRING" BUSINESS, YOU KNOW. THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON, YOU'RE SPATE FROM ME, AND "IT'S YOUR FAULT," INSTEAD OF THE "WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER" BUSINESS, YOU LOOK IT TO THE PERSON WHO IS THE FOCUS OF YOUR DISGUST AND OUTRAGE AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES YOU GO, ," THE REASON I'M SO OUTRAGED AT THAT PERSON IS I NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE ELEMENTS OF PERSONALITY IN MYSELF." IN FACT --
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.
WELL --
NO, THAT'S REALLY LOVELY. PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING WE ALL SHOULD THINK ABOUT TOMORROW. NO MATTER HOW THIS ENDS UP TONIGHT, PEOPLE SHOULD WAKE UP TOMORROW AND THINK, OKAY, WHEREVER WE ARE, WHAT CAN I DO TO UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE? YES, OF COURSE. I MEAN, I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES I'M A TREMENDOUS CLOWN AND IDIOT. AT HOME, WE READ TO OUR 16-MONTH-OLD SON, CHARLIE--
Stephen: YOU HAVE A 16-MONTH-OLD SON?
I DO. IT'S MY FIRST SON WITH EMILY. TODAY IS MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU CHOSE TO BE WITH US? I'M HONORED.
WELL, IT'S A GREATER HONOR FOR ME. BUT WHEN HE COMES TO A PICTURE OF A CLOWN IN THE BOOK HE GOES, "DA-DA." I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THAT. KEEP OUR EYES ON OUR OWN PAPER, OUR THIRD GRADE TEACHER USED TO SAY. SO I THINK THAT APPLIES HERE, TOO. ALSO, I WILL NOT STAY UNINSPIRED BY WHAT INSPIRED ME.
Stephen: WHAT POSITIVE MESSAGE CAN YOU GET FROM TONIGHT?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU. THAT BEING INSPIRED, ENCOURAGED, BRAVE, BOLD, AND-- AND ACTIVE INTO YOUR FUTURE-- INTO THE PROGRESS OF YOUR OWN FUTURE AND EVERYONE'S FUTURE, DEPENDS ON YOU. THAT'S IN YOUR CIRCLE OF INFLUENCE. AND I WON'T BE UNINSPIRED AFTER THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY, "IF I LOSE, IF MY SIDE LOSES, THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME." THAT'S STUPID, IN MY OPINION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I SAY-- THAT NO MATTER WHAT, BECAUSE WE ALL LOSE. WE'RE ALL GOING TO LOSE NO MATTER WHAT. AND IT'S THE JOURNEY THAT COUNTS, AND HOW WE COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO EACH OTHER'S MUTUAL BENEFIT THAT COUNTS. IN THE COURSE OF THIS, I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT A WOMAN BEING PRESIDENT, I WENT AND LOOKED AT THAT MOVIE "NORMA RAY" AGAIN. IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN WHO FINDS HER POWER AND STRENGTH. THE MUSIC THAT BECOMES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE AND THE END OF THE MOVIE-- I'M GOING TO SING A LITTLE SNIPPET ♪ IT GOES, IT GOES LIKE THE RIVER FLOWS ♪ AND TIME IT ROLLS ALONG AND MAYBE WHAT'S GOOD GETS A LITTLE BIT BETTER ♪ AND MAYBE WHAT'S BAD GETS GONE I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: JEFF GOLDBLUM, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT YOUR HOST AND SEXY KITTY CAT. NOW, THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED WHY DONALD TRUMP WOULD WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WE PUT TOGETHER A BRIEF, ANIMATED TIMELINE OF HIS PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS WHICH AT THE TIME WE CREATED IT, WE THOUGHT WAS SATIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) LUCKILY FOR US, IT ALSO WORKS AS HISTORY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER )
DONALD TRUMP. IS HERE TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST RECENTLY IN AN EPISODE OF "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" THE MEN'S COOKING TEAM DID NOT IMPRESS THE JUDGES FROM OMAHA STEAKS. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF BLAME TO GO AROUND, BUT YOU, MR. TRUMP, RECOGNIZE THAT THE REAL PROBLEM WAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP. AND SO, ULTIMATELY, YOU DIDN'T BLAME LITTLEJOHN OR MEATLOAF. YOU FIRED GARY BUSEY. THESE ARE THE KIND OF DECISIONS THAT WOULD KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT.

Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. AS YOU'VE SEEN, TUESDAY WAS A ROUGH NIGHT 3 REALLY GOT ME THINKING BY THE END. SO I DECIDED TO CLOSE THE EVENING BY JUST SPEAKING FROM MY HEART, WHICH BY THAT TIME WAS PUMPING PURE BAUSCHON. JIM? I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTING, BRUISING ELECTION FOR EVERYONE.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND IT HAS COME TO AN ENDING THAT I DID NOT IMAGINE. WE ALL NOW FEEL THE WAY RUDY GUILIANI LOOKS. ( LAUGHTER ) SEEING THIS ELECTION-- SEEING THIS ELECTION, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD, I MEAN, SHE'S GOING OFF TO PORTUGAL. EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING, "HAS AMERICA LOST ITS MIND?" AND IS ANSWER SEVIDENTLY, BACK OFF, BUDDY. WE'VE GOT 300 MILLION GUNS AND WE'RE KIND OF STRESSED RIGHT NOW. BY EVERY METRIC, I MEAN, WE ARE MORE DIVIDED THAN EVER AS A NATION. DO WE HAVE THIS GRAPHIC FROM EARLIER BEFORE? ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER, MORE THAN 4 IN 10 VOTERS SAY THE OTHER PARTY'S POLICIES ARE SO MISGUIDED THEY POSE A THREAT TO THE NATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYBODY FEELS THAT WAY. AND NOT ONLY THAT, MORE THAN HALF OF DEMOCRATS SAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MAKES THEM AFRAID. WHILE 49% OF-- DO I HAVE THIS RIGHT, IS IT 49% OF REPUBLICANS SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SO BOTH SIDES ARE TERRIFIED OF THE OTHER SIDE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE VOTING BOOTH HAS A CURTAIN SO YOU HAVE SOME PLACE TO HIDE AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER. SO HOW DID OUR POLITICS GET SO POISONOUS? I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE OVERDOSED, ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR. WE DRANK TOO MUCH OF THE POISON. YOU TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF IT SO YOU CAN HATE THE OTHER SIDE. AND IT TASTES KIND OF GOOD, AND YOU LIKE HOW IT FEELS. AND THERE'S A GENTLE HIGH TO THE CONDEMNATION, RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT, RIGHT? YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT. WHEN I WAS A KID, WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT POLITICS THIS MUCH. A LOT, BUT NOT THIS MUCH. I GREW UP IN WATERGATE. THAT WAS MY-- MY FIRST PRESIDENT WAS NIXON. I'D COME HOME FROM SCHOOL, COULDN'T WATCH THE "BEVERLY HILLBILLIES" BECAUSE THERE WAS SENATOR SAM IRVIN WITH THE BIG EYEBROWS TALKING ABOUT CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT WAS A GREAT DIVIDING MOMENT, I THINK, IN AMERICAN POLITICS. THAT'S THE MOMENT WHERE WE ALL STOPPED TRUSTING EACH OTHER. BECAUSE VIETNAM WAS WRAPPED UP IN THAT, TOO. PEOPLE WERE DYING FOR POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY, RATHER THAN A CAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN. BUT AS A KID, EVEN WITH ALL THAT, WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS AS MUCH. WE STUCK WITH SAFE SUBJECTS, LIKE, YOU KNOW-- BACK THEN IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT RELIGION AT THE DINNER TABLE OR TRY TO GUESS WHICH FAMILY MEMBER WAS GAY, YOU KNOW? ( LAUGHTER ) BACK WHEN IT MATTERED, YOU KNOW. POLITICS USED TO BE SOMETHING WE THOUGHT ABOUT EVERY FOUR YEARS, MAYBE TWO YEARS IF YOU HAD NO SOCIAL LIFE. YOU CARED ABOUT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. THAT'S GOOD WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH BECAUSE THAT LEFT ROOM IN OUR LIVES FOR OTHER THINGS AND FROM OTHER PEOPLE. I'M FROM A BIG FAMILY. JIMMY, EDDIE, TOMMY, MARG OH, JAY, PETER, PAUL, AND STEPHEN. MY MOTHER WAS BORN TWO DAYS BEFORE A WOMAN COULD VOTE THE FIRST TIME IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I WAS THINKING THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE TIME THAT SHE GOT WHAT SHE WANTED. SHE TOLD ME AT AGE 92, RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED, "OH, I THINK I WOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY THIS TIME. IT'S TIME." SHE ONLY VOTED FOR ONE DEMOCRAT IN HER ENTIRE LIFE, AND THAT WAS KENNEDY, BECAUSE-- SPOILER ALETTER-- WE'RE CATHOLIC. ( LAUGHTER ) POLITICS IS A LOT OF HORSE RACE, AND HORSE RACE IS GAMBLING, AND GAMBLING SACCORDING TO THE BIBLE, A SIN BECAUSE IT ITSELF IS A POISON, WORRYING ABOUT WINNING AND NOT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WINNING IS. I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED OUR DEMOCRACY DIDN'T WANT US IN IT ALL THE TIME. INFORMED, YES. POLITICKING ALL THE TIME? I DON'T THINK SO. NOT DIVIDED THAT WAY. THEY DESIGNED AN ELECTION THAT WAS MEANT TO CONFUSE US AND BORE US A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S WHY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE EXISTS. AND C-SPAN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHY THE STATE OF THE UNION BEGINS WITH 20 MINUTES OF SHAKING HANDS WITH GRANDPAS. BUT NOW POLITICS IS EVERYWHERE, AND THAT TAKES UP PRECIOUS BRAIN SPACE WE COULD BE USING TO REMEMBER ALL THE THINGS WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN COMMON. SO WHETHER YOUR SIDE WON OR LOST, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS (BLEEP) FOR A WHILE. SO-- ( APPLAUSE ) SO KEEP YOUR AMERICAN FLAG UP, BUT YOU CAN TAKE OFF YOUR AMERICAN FLAG HAT. YOU CAN PUT AWAY YOUR "I VOTED" STICKERS. AND YOU CAN... GET BACK TO YOUR LIFE. AND I'D LIKE TO TRY TO END THIS ELECTION SEASON RIGHT NOW BY VOTING UNANIMOUSLY ON A FEW THINGS THAT ALL BRING US TOGETHER. FAIR WARNING. SOME OF THESE ARE SILLY. BUT IN THE FACE OF SOMETHING THAT MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS HORRIBLE, I THINK LAUGHTER IS THE BEST MEDICINE. YOU CANNOT LAUGH AND BE AFRAID AT THE SAME TIME. AND THE DEVIL CANNOT STAND MOCKERY. SO HERE ARE SOME THINGS AMERICANS DON'T FIGHT ABOUT. HERE'S ONE THING AMERICANS CAN ALL AGREE ON-- WHEN YOU AGREE ON SOMETHING, DO YOU SHOUT YES?
Audience: YES!
Stephen: OF COURSE YOU DO. HERE'S ANOTHER: NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND ON HILLARY'S PRIVATE SERVER, EVERY AMERICAN AGREES WORK EMAIL SUCKS.
Audience: YES!
Stephen: ALSO, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR AGE, RACE, OR POLITICAL PARTY, EVERY AMERICAN CAN AGREE THAT KIT KATS SHOULD BE EATEN IN SEGMENTS, NOT BITTEN INTO LIKE A NORMAL CANDY BAR, YOU ANIMAL. AND EVERY RED-BLOODED AMERICAN KNOWS THAT IF YOU'RE ORDERING A BUNCH OF PIZZAS, THERE'S NO REASON TO GET A VEGGIE ONE. NO ONE'S GOING TO EAT IT. FOR (BLEEP) SAKE, PLAIN CHEESE IS VEGGIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND ALL OF US, I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF US FROM PORTLAND, MAINE, TO PORTLAND, OREGON, KNOW THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PORTLANDS. THEY NEED TO BE NUMBERED. OREGON, YOU'RE PORTLAND NUMBER TWO NOW. AND IF YOU MAKE A LIVING PRANKING PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE, ALL AMERICANS ASK THAT YOU WALK. SLOWLY INTO THE OCEAN AND THEN PUT THAT ON SNAPCHAT. AND AS AMERICANS, THERE ARE THINGS WE WILL NEVER FORGET, BUT NONE OF US WILL EVER REMEMBER WHAT THE WAR OF 1812 WAS ABOUT. WERE WE MAD AT CANADA OR SOMETHING? I DON'T KNOW. FOR IT WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING WHO REMINDED US TO JUDGE PEOPLE NOT BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT BY WHETHER THEY "REPLY ALL" ON A MASS EMAIL. DEEP DOWN, AMERICANS KNOW THAT ALEX TREBEK WILL NEVER DIE, AND IF HE DOES, IT WON'T COUNT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) REAL AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THE "LOW GAS" LIGHT IS NOT A WARNING BUT A CHALLENGE TO SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GET ON WHATEVER AMOUNT OF GAS IS LEFT IN THE TANK. I SAY WE'RE MAKE MAKING IT TO TULSA. WE STAND UNITED IN OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BIGGEST SELLING POINT OF COOL WHIP ISN'T THE TASTE BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S FREE TUPPERWARE. IT'S TIME WE SET ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES AND AGREE THAT WE WILL PAY EXTRA FOR GUAC, IT'S NICE TO GET A REAL CARD IN THE MAIL ONCE IN A WHILE, AND THE FIRST PERSON TO GET UP FOR SECONDS AT A WEDDING BUFFET IS A (BLEEP) HERO! AND ABOVE ALL-- EVERYBODY UP! EVERYBODY UP! MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE. MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE. AND, ABOVE ALL, WE, AS A NATION, AGREE THAT WE SHOULD NEVER, EVER HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION LIKE THIS ONE! DO YOU AGREE?
Audience: YES!
Stephen: NOW, PLEASE GET OUT THERE! KISS A DEMOCRAT! GO HUG A REPUBLICAN! GIVE A LIBERTARIAN A (BLEEP)! I DON'T CARE! THE ELECTION IS OVER! YOU SURVIVED! GOOD NIGHT, AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
