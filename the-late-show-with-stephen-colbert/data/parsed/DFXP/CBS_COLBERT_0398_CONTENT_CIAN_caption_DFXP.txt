TODAY ON "FACE THE NATION," NO CONDEMNATION BY PRESIDENT OF WHITE NATIONALISTS AFTER DEADLY PROTEST IN A SOUTHERN CITY. THE PRESIDENT WHO BUILT A CAREER ON BLUNTNESS TOOK PAINS TO NOT PLACE BLAME ON ANY ONE GROUP ENRAGING MANY.
SO WHAT COULD PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE SAID ON SATURDAY?
THIS IS A VICIOUS GROUP OF ANIMALS LIVING IN THEIR PARENTS' BASEMENTS -- A NETWORK OF LAWLESS SAVAGES -- WHO SHOULD BE PUT IN JAIL, BY THE WAY -- VERY BAD PEOPLE -- BING, BING, BONG, BING, BING -- AND UNLESS YOU NAME THE ENEMY, YOU WILL NEVER EVER SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S DOING!
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, BOB ODENKIRK AND MUSICAL GUEST LIAM GALLAGHER, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) HOW ARE YA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, JOE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! LEWIS! PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR SHOWS STEPHEN COLBERT. ( PIANO RIFF ) IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. BOY, WHAT A TERRIBLE WEEKEND. YEAH. WHITE SUPREMACISTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY CARRYING SHIELDS, CLUBS, BODY ARMOR, AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONRY DESCENDED ON CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA TO HOLD A RALLY CALLED, "UNITE THE RIGHT." THE RALLY WAS A CLEAR ATTEMPT TO SPARK VIOLENCE, AND IT DID. ONE OF THESE WHITE SUPREMACISTS DROVE A CAR INTO A CROWD OF COUNTER-PROTESTERS KILLING ONE YOUNG WOMAN, HEATHER HEYER, AND INJURING 20 MORE. IN ADDITION, TWO VIRGINIA STATE TROOPERS, WHO WERE MONITORING THE RALLY FROM THE AIR, WERE KILLED WHEN THEIR HELICOPTER CRASHED. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT IS DIFFICULT HOW HEARTBREAKING IT IS TO SEE THIS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY. BUT HERE'S ONE THING THAT'S NOT HARD TO EXPRESS: NAZIS ARE BAD. THE K.K.K.? NOT A FAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT WASN'T HARD. THAT ACTUALLY WAS EASY. I ENJOYED SAYING IT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ON SATURDAY, WHEN THE NATION LOOKED TO OUR PRESIDENT TO REBUKE THESE HATE GROUPS, ALL HE SAID WAS THIS:
WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS THIS EGREGIOUS DISPLAY OF HATRED, BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE ON MANY SIDES, ON MANY SIDES.
STEPHEN: "MANY SIDES?" ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS TERRORISM, NOT YOUR ORDER AT K.F.C. ( LAUGHTER ) "I'D LIKE THE TEN PIECE BUCKET WITH POTATO WEDGES, FRIES, MASHED POTATOES, YOU KNOW WHAT? MANY SIDES. MANY SIDES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "COLESLAW." ( PIANO RIFF ) HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY YOU CONDEMN THIS IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN NAME THE GROUPS RESPONSIBLE OR SAY WHAT THEY DID? "I STRONGLY CONDEMN YOU-KNOW-WHO, ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHAT, AND AREN'T WE ALL NAZIS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT?" ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE SEEN ANGRIER YELP REVIEWS! AND, BELIEVE ME, THEY WEREN'T AFRAID TO USE THE WORD "NAZI" WHEN DESCRIBING HOW LONG THEIR JALAPENO POPPERS TOOK. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THIS IS THE NUT OF WHAT'S MOST DISTURBING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AFTER A TRAGEDY AND, AFTER HE MADE HIS STATEMENT, REASONABLE PEOPLE COULD NOT TELL IF WAS CONDEMNING THE NAZIS. AND IT'S NOT LIKE TRUMP IS A SHRINKING VIOLET. HE'S "KNOWN" FOR CRITICIZING THINGS. IF ONLY THE PRESIDENT WAS AS MAD ABOUT NEO-NAZIS MURDERING PEOPLE IN THE STREETS AS HE'S BEEN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, THE "NEW YORK TIMES," CNN, JOE SCARBOROUGH, KRISTEN STEWART, THE CAST OF HAMILTON, DIET COKE, NORDSTROM NOT SELLING HIS DAUGHTER'S CLOTHES, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, MAYOR OF LONDON SADIQ KHAN, "ME," THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, GOLD STAR FAMILIES, PENN JILLETTE'S LAS VEGAS SHOW, THE MOVIE "DJANGO UNCHAINED," MERYL STREEP, AND LADY GHOSTBUSTERS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND! AND WHILE HE WOULDN'T NAME THE PERPETRATORS, TRUMP "WAS" VERY QUICK TO SAY WHO'S "NOT" TO BLAME.
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME IN OUR COUNTRY. NOT DONALD TRUMP, NOT BARACK OBAMA. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.
STEPHEN: "YEAH, OBAMA AND I BOTH SHARE SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE, I MEAN, I EMBRACED ALT RIGHT RACISTS, OBAMA IS BLACK, WE BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM IN OUR OWN WAY ." WELL, AFTER THE PRESIDENT BLEW THE EASIEST CONDEMNATION OF ALL TIME, TRUMP TOOK CRITICISM FROM "MANY SIDES, MANY SIDES." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) MANY SIDES, I, I -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT HE DID GET PRAISE FROM ONE GROUP: NEONAZIS. ONE PROMINENT WHITE POWER WEBSITE WROTE, "TRUMP COMMENTS WERE GOOD. HE DIDN'T ATTACK US. HE JUST SAID THE NATION SHOULD COME TOGETHER. NOTHING SPECIFIC AGAINST US." "HE SAID THAT WE NEED TO STUDY WHY PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY AND IMPLIED THAT THERE WAS HATE ON BOTH SIDES! HE SAID HE LOVES US ALL." CAREFUL, GUYS. HE SAYS HE LOVES YOU NOW, BUT ONE DAY HE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU FOR YOUNGER NAZIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU.
Jon: HE MIGHT COME AROUND!
Stephen: OF COURSE, NAYSIES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES PRAISING DONALD TRUMP. SO WAS THE KLAN. LIKE FORMER K.K.K. GRAND WIZARD AND CURRENT TAXIDERMY LIZARD, DAVID DUKE. ( LAUGHTER ) SEEN HERE BEING RACIALLY SUPERIOR. ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU, JON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DUKE WAS AT HATE-A-PALOOZA, AND SAID THIS:
WE ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK, WE'RE GOING TO FULFILL THE PROMISES OF DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVED IN, THAT'S WHY WE VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP.
STEPHEN: SO THE KLAN VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S RIGHT. I REMEMBER THEY WORE THOSE SPECIAL "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" HATS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I CERTAINLY HOPE WE'RE APPLAUDING FOR HATS. ( LAUGHTER ) FACED WITH THIS P.R. CLUSTERMUNCH, ON SUNDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED THIS: "THE PRESIDENT SAID VERY STRONGLY IN HIS STATEMENT YESTERDAY THAT HE CONDEMNS ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE, BIGOTRY AND HATRED AND, OF COURSE, THAT INCLUDES WHITE SUPREMACISTS, K.K.K., NEO-NAZI, AND ALL EXTREMIST GROUPS." OKAY. FINALLY, SOMEONE WILLING TO STAND UP, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THAT PERSON WAS BECAUSE IT WAS "AN UNIDENTIFIED WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON." ( LAUGHTER ) WHY UNIDENTIFIED? "LOOK, OF COURSE, WE DON'T SUPPORT THE NAZIS OR THE K.K.K. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE MY NAME ARE YOU?" ( LAUGHTER ) "I COULD GET IN TROUBLE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND HERE'S THE THING. SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T NEED THEIR ANTI-NAZI STATEMENTS EXPLAINED LATER. LIKE THE MAYOR OF CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHO CALLED THE RALLY A "COWARDLY PARADE OF HATRED, BIGOTRY, RACISM, AND INTOLERANCE." WHICH COINCIDENTALLY WAS ALSO THE THEME OF  STEVE BANNON'S SENIOR PROM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "UNDER THE SEA."
Jon: "UNDER THE SEA." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: ALSO, YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT, ON FRIDAY, THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS HELD A TO HAVE-WIELDING MARCH ONLY HOLDING TICKY TORCHES. HOW LAME. THAT'S LIKE VILLAGERS COMING AFTER FRANKENSTEIN HOLDING SCENTED CANDLES. "UGH, SANDLEWOOD VANILLA BAD!" ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE COMPANY THAT MAKES TIKI TORCHES RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING, QUOTE: "TIKI BRAND IS NOT ASSOCIATED IN ANY WAY WITH THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AND ARE DEEPLY SADDENED AND DISAPPOINTED. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE BACKYARD GATHERINGS AND TO HELP FAMILY AND FRIENDS CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER AT HOME IN THEIR YARD." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ) YES, GIVE IT UP! GIVE IT UP! I GOTTA SAY, IT'S PRETTY TROUBLING WHEN A BACKYARD DECORATION COMES OUT SWINGING STRONGER AGAINST NAZIS THAN THE PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) YOUR MOVE, LAWN FLAMINGOS. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, FACED WITH GETTING MORALLY DUNKED ON BY PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY, TODAY, THEY DUG A TRENCH, LOWERED THE BAR INTO IT, AND THE PRESIDENT SLITHERED OVER IT, AND SOMEHOW FOUND THE COURAGE TO READ A STATEMENT CLEARLY WRITTEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE:
RACISM IS EVIL AND THOSE WHO CAUSE VIOLENCE IN ITS NAME ARE CRIMINALS AND THUGS. INCLUDING THE K.K.K., NEO-NAZIS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND OTHER HATE GROUPS THAT ARE REPUGNANT TO EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR AS AMERICANS.
REPORTER: WAS THAT SO HARD? WHY DID THAT TAKE TWO DAYS? "HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NAZIS?" "GIMME 48 HOURS TO GET BACK TO YOU." ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP TRIED TO HEAL A NEWS CYCLE BY REMINDING US WHAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON.
WE ALL SALUTE THE SAME GREAT FLAG.
STEPHEN: NO, WE DON'T. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE SEEN THEIR FLAGS. THEY CAN'T AGREE ON WHICH ONE TO SALUTE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? DON'T MIX US UP. ( PIANO RIFF ) HE DIDN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THERE, BUT LATER HE WAS PRESSED ON THE ISSUE BY CNN'S JIM ACOSTA:
MR. PRESIDENT, CAN YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU DID NOT CONDEMN THOSE HATE GROUPS BY NAME OVER THE WEEKEND?
THEY'VE BEEN CONDEMNED. THEY HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED.
WHY ARE WE NOT HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY? YOU SAID ON FRIDAY WE'D HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE.
WE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE. WE JUST HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE.
CAN WE ASK YOU SOME MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT SIR?
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL. I LIKE REAL NEWS. NOT FAKE NEWS. YOU'RE FAKE NEWS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
STEPHEN: SEE HOW FAST YOU CONDEMNED CNN, RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD WITH NO SCRIPT. NEXT TIME, LIKE THAT, BUT WITH NAZIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S SIMPLE. HE CAN DO IT. HE'S VERY GOOD AT IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT NAZIS. A LOT OF THESE GUYS SHOWED UP TO THE RALLY "WEARING THEIR UNIFORM OF KHAKIS AND WHITE POLO SHIRTS." BECAUSE NOTHING STRIKES MORE FEAR IN THE HEARTS OF YOUR ENEMIES THAN COSPLAYING AS THE ASSISTANT MANAGER OF A POOL SUPPLY COMPANY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) LOOK, NAZIS, YOU DON'T GET TURN KHAKIS AND WHITE POLO SHIRTS INTO THE OFFICIAL UNIFORM OF RACISM. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO GUYS WHO ACTUALLY DRESS LIKE THAT? PEOPLE LIKE ME AND JAKE FROM STATE FARM? ( LAUGHTER ) DO I HAVE TO THROW OUT ALL MY POLO SHIRTS NOW? WELL, TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME. IF YOU GET TO RUIN KHAKIS AND POLO SHIRTS, I SAY RED BASEBALL CAPS MEAN YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'LL SIT DOWN WITH "THE MOOCH"! STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! I LOVE IT! THAT'S FANTASTIC! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, JON. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS THE SHORTEST TENURED COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR IN WHITE HOUSE HISTORY. PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ANTHONY, COME ON UP! ( AUDIENCE BOOING )
I'LL PRETEND THOSE MOOCHES AND NOT BOOS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WE'LL FIND OUT LATER. ( LAUGHTER ) THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: IS IT? I TOOK A LIST OF ALL YOUR COMEDY WRITERS, MY KILL LIST, THEY'RE IN THE BACK, I WROTE THEM ALL DOWN.
Stephen: YOU'RE COMEEDCALLY THREATENING TO KILL PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME?
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO JOKE ANYMORE, I'VE LEARNED THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO START -- ( CROSSTALK ) NO, YOU DON'T GET TO STOP MY SHOW. I STOP MY SHOW. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING, I WANT YOU TO KNOW JUST FOR THE RECORD, THIS IS ON THE RECORD, THIS IS BEING RECORDED RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S A MICROPHONE YOU'RE WEARING RIGHT NOW. OKAY. SO I SAID NO GOTCHA QUESTIONS, BUT I'M GOING TO LEAD WITH ONE.
GO AHEAD. ( LAUGHTER ) WON'T BE THE FIRST ONE.
Stephen: NAZIS, GOOD OR BAD?
SUPER BAD, WE KNOW THAT, SUPER BAD.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO YOU CALLED "THE MOST MEDIA SAVVY PERSON OF OUR TIMES," WOULD SHANK A SOFTBALL LIKE THAT SO HARD WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE JUST COME OUT THERE AND CONDEMNED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE TO START VIOLENCE?
WELL, I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES THERE. HE SAID THE "ALL SIDES" THING. "MANY SIDES." HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAY HARSHER ON THAT. I SAID THAT.
Stephen: HOW? HE SHOULD HAVE CONDEMNED WHITE SPREM SIMPLE AND -- WHITE SUPREMACY AND NEONAZIS. I DON'T WANT TO BLAME OR POINT FINGERS AT THE PRESIDENT.
Stephen: HE'S RESPONSIBLE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I THINK, LISTEN, IT WAS LATE. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT WASN'T, BUT HE DID GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY AND MAKE A STATEMENT WHICH YOU JUST SAID, IT WAS VERY DECLARATIVE AGAINST IT.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT PREPARED REMARKS SATURDAY AND TODAY. TODAY HE STUCK TO THE SCRIPT. SATURDAY, HE WENT OFFSCRIPT WITH HIS "MANY SIDES, MANY SIDES," AVES AN AD-LIB IN THE MOMENT. WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK HE MEANT? THE ONE WRITTEN DOWN OR THE ONE HE JUST COMES UP IN THE MOMENT.
IT HAS BEEN SUPER ROUGH ON ME AND HIM BUT HE IS A COMPASSIONATE PERSON. I ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THAT'S MY OPINION.
Stephen: DON'T BOO HIM FOR BEING THE MESSENGER. WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE OF THAT?
WELL, I MEAN, LISTEN, IT'S COO SUPER TOUGH JOB. HE MADE A STEP TO GIVE UP WHAT WAS A LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE --
Stephen: WHO CARES? REALLY? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL BAD FOR A GUY WHO GAVE UP HIS BILLIONAIRE LIFESTYLE TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD?
IT WAS TOUCH AND GO, THOUGH.
Stephen: WHAT WAS TOUCH AND GO?
WELL, I THINK WHEN HE STARTED HIS CAMPAIGN, IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO WIN.
Stephen: THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY WAS UNCLEAR.
I UNDERSTAND. STEPHEN, IT'S A HUGE SACRIFICE TO DO WITH STUFF. YOU MAY NOT AGREE.
Stephen: ONE THING YOU DON'T GET TO DO IS COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
I HAVEN'T HEARD HIM COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
Stephen: HE HAS. HE SAID, IT'S A VERY HARD JOB. HE SAID, I COULD HAVE HAD MY PREVIOUS LIFESTYLE --
BUT THAT'S HIM WEARING HIS HEART ON HIS SLEEVE, THOUGH, THAT'S HIM EXPRESSING HIMSELF. THAT'S HIS -- I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA, MICHELLE OBAMA ALSO EXPRESSED YOU KNOW, IT'S A FISH BOWL, IT'S A DIFFICULT JOB.
Stephen: SURE. I THINK PRESIDENT BUSH SAID THE SAME THING. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT JOB.
Stephen: GETTING BACK -- BEING THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR IS A DIFFICULT JOB. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: MY ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS -- YOU'RE A GUY WHO SAID HE HITS FREE-THROWS WITH A TOP COAT.
I'VE SEEN HIM DOING THAT, YEAH.
Stephen: SAYING CONDEMNING WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND NEONAZIS IS A ONE INCH PUTT. WHY DO YOU THINK HE CHOKED?
IT'S A COUNTERINTUITIVE THING WITH HIM AS RELATES TO THE MEDIA. THE MEDIA EXPECTS HIM TO DO SOMETHING, HE SOMETIMES DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING HE DOES --
SOME OF THAT --
Stephen: -- TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM?
SOME OF THAT WORKED DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: HE'S NOW THE PRESIDENT.
I UNDERSTAND, BUT ME'S ALSO GOING TO SEE HIS BASE, HE'S FLOWN TO OHIO ANDTHER PLACES.
Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING HIS BASE IS NAZIS?
OF COURSE NOT. LET'S BE FAIR TO HIM TODAY, HE CONDEMNED THE NAZIS TODAY.
DOES HE ORDER HIS SPINE ON AMAZON PRIME? WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
THAT'S A GOOD LINE, AND I SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOUGHER ON IT. THE PROBLEM IS I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON THAT WOULD COME FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OR FORMERLY FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, I DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL COME AND SIT HERE AND ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT ONLY HE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION. I SAID YESTERDAY AND MAINTAIN HE'S GOT TO BE TOUGHER ON THAT STUFF IF HE WANTS HIS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA TO PASS. HE HAS TO MOVE IN A MORE MODERATE DIRECTION, HE HAS TO APPEAL TO MORE INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATES WHO POSSIBLY VOTED FOR HIM TO HELP HIM ASCEND TO THE PRESIDENCY.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
SMALL.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN IN THE BUILDING.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT I MEAN IS, WHAT IS IT LIKE? FROM THE OUTSIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE A DUMPSTER FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT IS IT LIKE -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVE RUMORS OF INFIGHTING AND THERE IS CHAOS IN THERE. WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR THE TEN DAYS YOU WERE IN THERE? DID YOU GET A SENSE OF THE CHAOS?
WELL, LISTEN, I MEAN, IT'S A TOUGH PLACE. THERE WAS A LOT OF INFIGHTING. YOU KNOW, THE FRONT STABBER WAS BACKSTABBING, I THINK YOU SAID THAT TWO WEEKS AGO. I HAVE A TENDENCY TO BE VERY OPEN AND HONEST WITH PEOPLE. WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT. THEY GO BEHIND EACH OTHER'S BACKS, LEAK THINGS TO THE PRESS AND SAY NASTY THINGS TO EACH OTHER TO DESTABILIZE THEM OR TO INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENT'S JUDGMENT OF THEM, SO, WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT ME, I WAS PRETTY OPEN ABOUT HOW I FELT ABOUT PEOPLE -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- VERY OPEN --
Stephen: VERY OPEN. -- AND I TELL YOU THE WAY A GOOD CULTURE WORKS, I'VE RUN TWO REASONABLY SUCCESSFUL OF ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DECOR AND IT DIDN'T GO THAT WAY.
Stephen: THIS IS YOU HOLDING YOUR THUMBS IN YOUR BELT LIKE A GUN SLINGER, AND THIS IS REINCE PRIEBUS.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT IS GOING ON? WERE YOU BROUGHT IN JUST TO GET RID OF HIM?
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY IS THAT AND SEAN SPICER?
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY.
Stephen: WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS PART OF YOUR JOB?
I WOULD SAY --
Stephen: SAY ITRLIKE "THE MOOCH."
WELL, ALL RIGHT, SO --
Stephen: GIVE ME SOME "MOOCH."
SO "THE MOOCH" OF LONG ISLAND WOULD SAY THERE'S NO LOVE LOST THERE. LOOK AT THE PICTURE.
Stephen: YEAH. THAT WAS CAUGHT BY A "WALL STREET JOURNAL" PHOTOGRAPHER, WHICH WAS A GREAT INTERVIEW WITH THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL." THE WEIRD THING ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH REINCE IS WE WERE PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS WHEN I WAS A POLITICAL DONOR WRITING CHECKS TO THE R.N.C. BUT ONCE I WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE ADMINISTRATION, FOR WHATEVER REASON, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE ADVERSARIAL.
Stephen: YOU THOUGHT HE WAS ONE OF THE LEAKERS.
I DID.
Stephen: HE'S GONE, RIGHT? WHO'S LEAKING NOW? IS IT STEVE BANNON?
WELL, I'VE SAID THAT.
Stephen: SAY IT NOW. LISTEN, I HAVE BEEN PRETTY OPEN ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: IS STEVE BANNON A LEAKER?
HE GOT CAUGHT ON TAPE SAYING THAT.
Stephen: IS HE GOING TO BE GONE IN A WEEK?
IF IT WAS UP TO ME HE WOULD BE GONE BUT IT'S NOT UP TO ME.
Stephen: YOU SAID HE'S TRYING TO SUCK HIS OWN (BLEEP). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ARE YOU ALLOWED TO SAY THAT?
Stephen: THEY SAID IT WAS COOL. THEY SAID I COULD SAY IT TONIGHT.
MOM, I'M SORRY I SAID THAT. ALTHOUGH HE AUTOGRAPHED A CARTOON FOR YOU SO I'M BRINGING THAT HOME.
Stephen: HERE'S THE DEAL. ARE YOU TELLING Y TELLING US THAT NEVER EVEN TRIED? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS AN ADULT MALE -- IT DOES NOT PASS THE SMELL TEST.
EDDY MURPHY SAID IF YOU COULD DO THAT HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE. NO, I'M NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THAT.
Stephen: NO ONE SAID HE SUCCEEDED.
NO, HE'S NOT CAPABLE OF IT EITHER. MAYBE HE'S DOING HOT YOGA IN THERE.
Stephen: WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WE'RE BACK! WITH FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. "MOOCH," DAVID DUKE WAS AT THIS RALLY? CHARLOTTESVILLE. HE SAID THEY WANT TO FULFILL THE PROMISES OF DONALD TRUMP, THAT IS WHY THEY, THE KLAN, VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP.
MM-HMM.
Stephen: ARE THERE ELEMENTS OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE WHITE HOUSE NOW.
NO.
Stephen: IS STEVE BANNON A WHITE SUPREMACISTIST?
I DON'T THINK. I'VE NEVER ASKED HIM. WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THE TOLERATION OF IT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY INTOLERATED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY. O FOR ME, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MOST PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE AND PERHAPS YOUR FAMILY AND DEFINITELY MY FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCED SOME LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION, SO I FIND IT DISGUSTING AND REPREHENSIBLE AND I WILL RENOUNCE IT EVERY LIVING DAY OF MY LIFE.
Stephen: DO YOU FEEL BURNED BY YOUR EXPERIENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
NO, NO, NO.
Stephen: YOU WERE THERE TEN DAYS, EXTREMELY LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT, EVEN AT THIS POINT AFTER YOU WERE SHOWN THE DOOR, DO YOU FEEL BURNED OR BACKSTABBED.
NOT AT ALL.
Stephen: REALLY? WELL, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, WHEN YOU TAKE A JOB LIKE THAT, STEPHEN, YOU KNOW YOUR EXPIRATION DATE WAS COMING. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LAST TOO LONG BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD LAST LONGER THAN A CARTON OF MILK.
Stephen: OR A BAG OF RAW SHRIMP.
YOU BOUGHT YOUR EGGS AND WERE COOKING THEM THE DAY I GOT FIRED, TOTALLY FINE, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) MY POINT IS YOU TAKE THE JOB AND RECOGNIZE YOU'RE SERVING AT THE BEHEST OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND IF HE DOESN'T WANT YOU THERE ANYMORE, YOU HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY LEAVE AND LEAVE WITH HONOR. I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES, I TRIED TO OWN OPINION TO THOSE MISTAKES. LET ME TELL YOU, YOU CAN FEEL THIS FROM ME, I'M AN HONEST PERSON.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, DON'T USE ME AS A CHARACTER WITNESS FOR YOU. I DON'T KNOW. I MET YOU FIVE MINUTES AGO. I WON'T SIGN A LOAN FOR HIM.
I'M GOOD WITH THE LOANS.
Stephen: "THE MOOCH" ALWAYS PAYS HIS DEBT.
PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME KNOW I'M A STRAIGHT-UP PERSON.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY IF YOU COULD GO BACK.
I REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU DON'T WANT TO MORPH OR CHANGE YOURSELF, YOU JUST WANT TO BE YOURSELF, AND IF THE GOOD LORD PUT YOU IN A DIRECTION OR A STREAM WHERE IT'S GOING THE RIGHT WAY, GREAT THINGS WILL HAPPEN. IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, I'M COOL WITH IT. THIS GUY HAS BEEN HITTING ME THREE STRAIGHT WEEKS AND IT'S FINE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR FATE, DO IT WITHOUT BITTERNESS AND STAY HUMBLE.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S A GREAT HONOR.
Stephen: WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO OTHER EX-MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO COME ON THE SHOW? WAS IT A NICE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE?
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT. I RECOMMEND THE PRESIDENT COME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME.
I HAVE GIFTS FOR STEPHEN, OKAY?
Stephen: CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THIS? LET THE MAN EXPLAIN. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET THE MAN EXPLAIN.
LISTEN, AFTER HE HIT ME SO HARD FOR THREE WEEKS, HE THOUGHT I WOULD STAB HIM WITH THAT, THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THE HERMETICALLY SEALED SKYS.
Stephen: LOVELY. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, EVERYBODY! BE BACK WITH BOB ODENKIRK! STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS A WRITER AND ACTOR WHO IS CURRENTLY EMMY NOMINATED FOR HIS STARRING ROLE IN "BETTER CALL SAUL".
BETTER GET READY TO BE FAMOUS ALBUQUERQUE! I CAN MAKE YOU A TV STAR FOR A PRICE YOU CAN AFFORD. CALL ME, SAUL GOODMAN, THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS! CALL ME NOW, NOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GUY AT THE STATION SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN SO MANY STAR WEBS IN A ROW. IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE.
SAUL GOODMAN. YEAH, IT'S LIKE IT'S ALL GOOD, MAN. THE GUY HAS A LOT OF ENERGY.
YEAH. IT'S JUST A NAME.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME BOB ODENKIRK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. SAUL GOODMAN, WHO, YOU KNOW, YOU OBVIOUSLY PLAYED FOR MANY YEARS.
YES.
Stephen: FAST-TALKING -- HE'S A HUSTLER.
YES, HE IS. HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF ME. SOMEBODY ONCE ASKED ME, IF I SAW SAUL GOODMAN IN A ROOM WOULD I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH HIM? I SAID, NO WAY. I WOULDN'T GO NEAR THAT GUY.
Stephen: WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SAUL GOODMAN?
OH, YEAH, HIS HANDS WOULD BE MOVING AND HE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY AND HE'D SPIN EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW, A CERTAIN WAY. YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I THINK I JUST TALKED TO HIM FOR 20 MINUTES, ACTUALLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SAUL GOODMAN, THAT'S NOT THE FIRST LAWYER YOU'VE PLAYED, I UNDERSTAND.
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID -- WELL, A YOUNGER KID -- I DID PRETEND TO BE A LAWYER ONCE, YES.
Stephen: HOW OLD? 15.
Stephen: 15? YES, MY FRIEND PETE HAD USED THE GAS STATION AS A SHORT CUT, AND --
Stephen: TO GET AROUND TRAFFIC OR SOMETHING?
YES, AND HE HAD TO GO TO COURT. A POLICEMAN SAW THAT. SO I SHOWED UP, AND I HAD CARDS AND I WORE A SUIT AND I SAID, I'M HIS LAWYER, HANDED OUT THE CARDS.
Stephen: YOU SAID BOB ODENKIRK, LAWYER?
I SAID BOB ODENKIRK, LAWYER, AND THEN THEY TOLD ME TO SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP. AND THEN MY FRIEND CALLED THE JUDGE YOUR HIGHNESS. ( LAUGHTER ) HE DID NOT GET OFF WITH IT.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR END GAME? WHAT WERE YOU HOPING TO MAKE HAPPEN?
I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE FUN AT MY FRIEND'S EXPENSE. THIS IS WHAT COMEDY IS. THIS IS WHY WE DO IT.
Stephen: OKAY. SO YOU WERE LITERALLY JUST --
I WAS JUST HAVING A LAUGH, AND HE WAS IN PAIN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, I FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOU IN SECOND CITY IN CHICAGO. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU BACK THEN.
YES.
Stephen: SO I KNOW YOU AS A COMEDIAN, YOU KNOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: I MISSED YOUR SHOW -- WILL SHOW. NOW YOU'RE MR. DRAMA.
I'M VERY SERIOUS.
Stephen: YOU'RE VERY SERIOUS. ( APPLAUSE ) HAVE YOU, LIKE -- YOU'RE, LIKE, A RENOWNED DRAMATIC ACTOR. NO, REALLY, YOU ARE. YOU GET NOMINATED THREE TIMES FOR DOING DRAMA. YOU ARE A RENOWNED DRAMATIC ACTOR. DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PROCESS?
I LEARNED A FEW THINGS. I FEEL LIKE DRAMA IS HARDER THAN COMEDY. WITH COMEDY YOU HAVE JOKES AND IF YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE JOKES AND DID THEM IN A ROOM WITH FRIENDS AND GOT A LAUGH, YOU FEEL CONFIDENT YOU GOT A LAUGH. DRAMA, THE RICH STORY, WRITTEN BY THE HEAD WRITERS OF "BETTER CALL SAUL" AND PEOPLE FROM "BREAKING BAD," YOU KNOW, IT'S A VERY RICH, LAYERED STORY. YOU GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A SEASON OF THAT KIND OF STORY AND YOU'RE JUST HOPING THE AUDIENCE CAN FOLLOW WHERE IT'S ALL GOING, AND IT SORT OF RESONATES WITH THEM THE WAY YOU'RE PLAYING IT. SO I'M ALWAYS AMAZED. I FEEL VERY LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING THAT JOB, COMPARED TO COMEDY. ALSO, I LEARNED, IN DRAMA, IT'S NOT GOOD TO KIND OF GIVE ADVICE TO YOUR OTHER ACTORS, WHERE, IN COLDY, PEOPLE ARE MORE, LIKE, HEY, I'VE GOT A LINE FOR YOU! AND IF IT'S FUNNY, THE PERSON IS, THANK YOU, AWESOME! I WAS DOING FARGO WITH A GREAT ACTOR AND GOOD FRIEND MARTIN FREEMAN, AND WE HAD A SCENE TOGETHER AND I WAS LIKE, OH, I HAVE AN IDEA FOR HIM. MARTIN, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE YOUR CHARACTER IS LIKE A LITTLE ENVIOUS OF ME. I MEAN, SECRETLY. AND THAT'S WHY HE'S RESENTFUL, AND HE JUST LOOKS AT ME. HE GOES, NEVER TELL ME HOW TO ACT AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WITH THAT ACCENT. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. IT KILLED ME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMMY NOMINATION.
THANKS.
Stephen: BIG DEAL ( APPLAUSE )
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED IN SUCH AN AMAZING GROUP OF ACTORS.
STEPHEN: AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE REALLY GUNNING FOR THE WIN HARD THIS YEAR?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, STEPHEN? I'M JUST GOING THE REGULAR INTERVIEWS. BUT THAT'S NOT WEIRD.
STEPHEN: WELL SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT, TO ENSURE VICTORY, YOUR EMMY CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ACTING A LITTLE UNETHICALLY.
WHAT!? THAT'S CRAZY! WHO IS "SOME PEOPLE?" I'D LIKE TO HAVE NAMES.
STEPHEN: WELL, FOR EXAMPLE, ME AND MY STAFF. IN FACT, WE OBTAINED A VIDEOTAPE OF YOUR SON.
MY SON? YOU MEAN BOB ODENKIRK, JR.?
Stephen: YEAH. HE IS A HIGH-QUALITY BOY.
STEPHEN: WELL THE VIDEO SHOWS HIM TAKING A MEETING HE SHOULDN'T HAVE. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST WATCH IT.
YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS, YES! LET ME SEE IT!
Stephen: JIM? HEY! COMRADES! ALL RIGHT! HOW YOU DOING? GOOD TO SEE YA! THANKS FOR COMING BY THE ODENKIRK TOWER. I'M BOBBY ODENKIRK, JR. I'M MY DADDY'S EMMY CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST. HE'S A GOOD MAN, MY BAD. OH, THERE HE IS! GOTTA KISS THE PICTURE! NOW, WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME TO HELP MY DADDY WIN AT THE EMMYS. MAYBE WE COULD DO A LITTLE COLLUSION HERE, MAYBE A FEW MAJOR CRIMES, IF YOU DON'T MIND. ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST OFF, YOU GUYS GOT ANY DIRT ON MY DADDY'S EMMY COMPETITION?
EMMYS? WHY YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THIS?
HAVE YOURSELF AN ODENKIRK CHEESE BALL. THEY'RE THE NUMBER ONE CHEESE BALLS IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT NOW AT THIS POINT. TELL ME YOU DON'T HAVE SOME DIRT ON THIS GUY, KEVIN SPACEY, HUH? HE HASN'T DELETED ANY E-MAILS RECENTLY? HOW ABOUT THIS GUY, HIS AHMED, IS HE NOT A MUSLIM?
WE WERE TOLD THIS WOULD BE ABOUT THE RUSSIAN ADOPTION.
OKAY, ADOPTION -- HEY, HOW ABOUT AN ODENKIRK PORK CHOP? THEY'RE THE NUMBER ONE PORK CHOP IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW! I'VE GOT SOME VERY NICE BOYS WHO I WOULD LIKE ADOPTED TO RUSSIA. HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS LITTLE FELLOW? NAME IS MILOSH, I THINK.
OH, THIS IS US! THEY REINVENTED THE FAMILY DRAMA!
THEY REINVENTED THE FAMILY DWRA MA, THERE YOU GO! TAKE THE BOYSICS TAKE THEM BACK TO RUSSIA, GIVE 'EM A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE, GIVE 'EM A LITTLE BIT OF PRIDE, SOME CONFIDENCE, MAKE THEM SENSE OF SELF-WORTH SO THEY DON'T TRY TO WIN THE LOVE OF A FATHER BY MEETING A BUNCH OF DIRTY RUSSIAN MOBSTERS IN A BROKEN DOWN MOTEL ROOM.
YOU ARE MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE. PLEASE STOP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
