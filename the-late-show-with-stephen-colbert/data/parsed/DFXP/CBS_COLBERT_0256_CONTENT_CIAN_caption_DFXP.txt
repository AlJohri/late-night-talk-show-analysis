Stephen: I'M SO GLAD.
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT THERE?
Stephen: WHAT? WHERE?
STICKING OUT OF YOUR POCKET.
Stephen: OH, THIS IS. THIS IS JUST MY DIGERDOO. I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS CARRYING IT. WE WERE SO MUCH TOGETHER. SHE'S LIKE MY LIMB, MY LADY. SHE'S MY LADY LIMB. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME, WHY DON'T WE JAM?
I'M REALLY NOT CLEAR ON WHAT THAT THING DOES.
Stephen: FIRST, IT MAKES MUSIC. THEN IT CHANGES THE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. LET'S JAM. YOU KNOW THAT SONG FERGLICIOUS.
I KNOW THAT.
Stephen: I'LL START YOU JUMP IN ♪ THEY WANT MY TREASURE SO THEY GET THEIR PLEASURES FROM MY PHOTO ♪ YOU CAN SEE ME YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ME ♪ I AIN'T EASY, I AIN'T SLEAZY-- IS THIS WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING?
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S JUST BEGUN TO HAPPEN BABY.
OKAY.
Stephen: YEAH.

Stephen: YEAH.
I DON'T THINK MY VOICE FITS WITH YOUR BIG STICK.
Stephen: OH, OKAY, YEAH, THAT'S COOL. HAVE A GREAT-- HAVE A GREAT SHOW. I SHOULD-- I SHOULD GET-- I SHOULD GO. WHAT WAS THAT? HEY! THAT'S A GREAT IDEA! WHY DON'T WE BOTH DIJERYDOO. ARE YOU DOWN TO DOUBLE DIJERYDO?
I GUESS.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT, AWESOME.
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE DIJERY DOO.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? WHAT'S THAT BEHIND YOUR EAR? ( LAUGHTER ) HERE YOU GO. FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, 8.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MATTHEW BRODERICK ALI WENTWORTH AND MUSICAL GUEST FERGIE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COLOMBIA.
Stephen: HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, MARK. HOW YOU DOING, CHRIS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON? PHILOSOPHICAL.
Jon: PHILOSOPHICAL.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I AM STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY FRIDAY! WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU ALL READY FOR THE WEEKEND? I AM. I ABSOLUTELY AM. YOU GUYS YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS DONALD TRUMP GUY?
Jon: UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
Stephen: IT'S CRAZY. HE ISN'T EVEN PRESIDENT YET, AND DONALD TRUMP IS ALREADY SAVING JOBS. FOR INSTANCE, HE HAS DONE WONDERS FOR MINE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND YESTERDAY--  ( CHEERS ) THANK YOU! NOT WORTH IT, BUT THANK YOU. YESTERDAY, TRUMP WAS AT THE CARRIER AIR CONDITIONING PLANT IN INDIANA AFTER SAVING 1,000 JOBS FROM BEING SHIPPED TO MEXICO, SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE TO MEXICAN WORKERS: IF YOU WANT GOOD-PAYING FACTORY JOBS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME HERE AND TAKE IT FROM AN AMERICAN! AND EVERYONE-- HE SAID HE WOULD DO IT. HE DID IT. THAT WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DID IT. IT HAPPENED. EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED BY THIS CARRIER DEAL. EVEN DONALD TRUMP WAS SURPRISED. AND THIS IS TRUE, HE DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT HE PROMISED TO DO IT.
AND THEY HAD A GENTLEMAN, WORKER, GREAT GUY, HANDSOME GUY, HE WAS ON, AND IT WAS LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE LEAVING. HE SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT, "NO, WE'RE NOT LEAVING BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP PROMISED US THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING." AND I NEVER THOUGHT I MADE THAT PROMISE. AND I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, MAN. AND THEN THEY PLAYED MY STATEMENT, AND I SAID, "CARRIER WILL NEVER LEAVE." BUT THAT WAS A EUPHENISM.
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WHAT A "EUPHENISM" IS. BUT I'M GUESSING IT'S A EUPHEMISM FOR SOMETHING. POINT IS, TRUMP HADN'T PLANNED ON DOING THIS BUT THEN ENDED UP DOING IT ANYWAY, SORT OF LIKE HOW HE GOT ELECTED PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon: HEY! HEY! HEY.
Stephen: IT SHOCKED HIM. AND HE DID IT-- WHAT? WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING! IT WAS A EUFENISM." SO ALL TRUMP HAS TO DO TO SAVE AMERICA'S JOBS IS HAVE ONE VICE PRESIDENT FROM EVERY STATE. OF COURSE, AMONGST ALL THE GOOD FEELINGS, TRUMP HAD A WARNING:
COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES ANYMORE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.
Stephen: YES! CARRIER FACED HARSH CONSEQUENCES, LIKE CAPITOL HILL 7 MILLION IN TAX BREAKS. SO WATCH OUT, ISIS. "KNOCK OFF THE NONSENSE OR YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAJAMA-GRAMMED." AND EVER SINCE TRUMP GOT ELECTED, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION ON WHAT'S CALLED THE ALT-RIGHT NEWS BLOG. BREITBART DO THE-- I'M NOT SURE. breitbart.white, WHICH USED TO BE RUN BY TRUMP'S CHIEF STRATEGIST, STEVE BANNON. CRITICS SAY THE SITE IS A HOTBED OF RACIST, SEXIST AND ANTI-SEMITIC VIEWS WHILE SUPPORTERS SAY EXACTLY THE SAME THING. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, AFTER GETTING A LOT OF BACKLASH, KELLOGG'S HAS ANNOUNCED THEY ARE PULLING THEIR ADS FROM BREITBART BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ALIGN WITH THE COMPANY VALUES. REALLY IS THERE THE MAKER OF FROSTED FLAKES DOESN'T AGREE WITH BREITBART? YOU THINK THEY'D LOVE A BRIGHT ORANGE CARTOON WHO PROMISES TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GRRRRRREAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: PLAY IT, TOMMY! PLAY IT, TOMMY!
Stephen: IN RESPONSE TO KELLOGG'S PULLING ADS, BREITBART SAID THEY WERE SORRY TO SEE A VALUED ADVERTISER GO AND WOULD WORK TO TRY TO REPAIR THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE FUTURE. JUST KIDDING! THEY ACTUALLY PUBLISHED THIS ARTICLE TITLE, "#DUMP KELLOGG'S: BREAKFAST BRAND BLACKLISTS BREITBART, DECLARES HATE FOR 45,000,000 READERS" AND WENT ON TO SAY "IF YOU SERVE KELLOGG'S PRODUCTS TO YOUR FAMILY, YOU ARE SERVING UP BIGOTRY AT YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE." BIGOTRY? COME ON. CEREAL IS NOT BIGOTRY. OTHER THAN, OBVIOUSLY, LUCKY CHARMS. THAT LEPRECHAUN IS MAGICALLY OFFENSIVE! THAT TRICK RABBIT'S WEIRD, TOO. KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THE KIDS. HERE'S SOME HAPPY NEWS. SOMEONE COMMITTED A CRIME AND GOT AWAY WITH IT. I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M KIND OF EXCITED ABOUT THIS STORY. THERE'S A GUY HERE IN MANHATTAN WHO STOLE A BUCKET FULL OF GOLD FLAKES WORTH $1.6 MILLION OFF A TRUCK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOLD FLAKES ARE. I ASSUME DONALD TRUMP'S BREAKFAST CEREAL? THIS GUY JUST WALKED UP TO THE BACK OF AN ARMORED TRUCK AND TOOK IT. IT WAS THE PERFECT CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THE DOZENS OF CAMERAS THAT FILMED HIM DOING IT. HERE HE IS CHECKING OUT THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. THEN HE JUST GRABS AN 86-POUND BUCKET OF GOLD! RUN, BUCKET MAN, RUN! I LIKE TO IMAGINE HIS "OCEAN'S 11"-STYLE HEIST PLAN: "FIRST, I ASSEMBLE A CRACK TEAM-- MUSCLE, BRAINS, CHINESE ACROBAT. HERE'S THE PLAN: I'M GOING TO WALK UP TO THE BUCKET AND TAKE IT, AND THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE IT." ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, SHOOT SOME HOLES IN THAT! SHOOT SOME HOLES IN THAT! SOMEBODY GET ME SOME JULIA ROBERTS. THAT'S HOW YOU GET JULIA ROBERTS LIKE THIS. ( SNAPS FINGERS ) THING IS, THIS HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 29, AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T CAUGHT THE BUCKET-OF-GOLD THIEF. I'M NO DETECTIVE, BUT HAVE THEY CHECKED THE END OF A RAINBOW? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MATTHEW BRODERICK IS HERE AND WHEN WE COME BACK, WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM A FURRY HAT. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I FEEL GOOD I FEEL GOOD ♪ I FEEL GOOD TODAY OH, SO GOOD TODAY ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE ALL FEELING GOOD TODAY. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND THE BAND, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT-- THAT CRUMP GUY?
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: MORE ON THAT GUY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT GUY. I DON'T KNOW. ONE OF THE REASONS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM IS HE DOESN'T TALK TO THE PRESS. INSTEAD, HE JUST TWEETS DIRECTLY AT THEM, LIKE, "IF CUBA IS UNWILLING TO MAKE A BETTER DEAL FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE, THE CUBAN AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE U.S. AS A WHOLE, I WILL TERMINATE DEAL." DEAL BAD! TRUMP SMASH DEAL! TRUMP'S GOING TO DO ALL HIS FOREIGN POLICY VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. STOP MANIPULATING YOUR CURRENCY, CHINA, OR HE WILL SWIPE LEFT. AND THE TWITTER PRESIDENCY IS PERFECTLY FINE WITH THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE PRESS TRUMP DOES GET AN INTERVIEW WITH TRUMP, THIS GUY.
Stephen: YEAH, IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS, THEY'LL JUST TWEET IT: "MOTORCADE CRASHED IN DITCH. LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS. SAD." ( LAUGHTER ) FINE, FINE. IT WILL BE FORTUNE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING. I THINK TRUMP TAKING TO TWITTER ALL THE TIME IS JUST THE WAY TO GET AROUND THE PRESS. THE WAY A DICTATOR WOULD GO OUT ON HIS BALCONY TO ISSUE DECREES TO HIS ADORING MAZES BELOW WHICH IS UPSETTING TO ME BECAUSE-- DEMOCRACY. HE'S CLEARING RIPPING OFF MY SEGMENT, BIG FURRY HAT. AND THEN MY STAFF PUTS THOSE THINGS ON TWITTER. NEED PROOF HE'S RIPPING ME OFF? HE'S WEARING A PERMANENT FURRY HAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, MISTER, LISTEN UP! LISTEN UP! TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME THAT TWO ARE ALREADY PLAYING. SO, MR. TRUMP, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE. THIS IS BIG FURRY HAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD RIGHT THERE. THAT'S GOOD RIGHT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) MY PEOPLE! MY PEOPLE. NOW THAT THIS HEAD IS UPON MINE HEAD, ANY PROCLAMATIONS I NOW MAKE ARE FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN.

Stephen: LIKE FERRIS BUELLER, IT WAS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE, THE 19 EIGHTs.

Stephen: PEOPLE IN MY HIGH SCHOOL USED TO SAY, "THAT'S YOU. FERRIS, THAT'S YOU." WAS THAT A COMPLIMENT?
ABSOLUTELY. I YEAH.
Stephen: A TROUBLEMAKER, A GUY WHO DITCHES --
DID YOU DO THAT.
Stephen: I DID IT ONCE.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
Stephen: I WAS BORED. BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO IT WITH A PRETTY GIRL AND MY TROUBLED FRIEND.
HE SAYS THAT IN THE MOVIE. HE SAYS THE WORST THING IS IF YOU DON'T PLAN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS SO YOU END UP HOME OF SITTING AT HOME WATCHING TV ALL DAY.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID. DID YOU EVER DITCH?
I WOULD MISS A PERIOD OR TWO, STROLL IN-- THE HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO WAS ON CENTRAL PARK.

IT WAS VERY ARTIE SO YOU COULD SORT OF FLOAT OUT EVERY NOW AND THEN. ( LAUGHTER ).

Stephen: BROADWAY STAR. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SEEN HIM BACKSTAGE OR SOMETHING.
YOU WOULD THINK, BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MET HIM. I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER COME TO A SHOW THAT I WAS IN AT ALL.
Stephen: REALLY?
I NEVER HAVE BEEN-- NO, BECAUSE USUALLY IF SOMEBODY LIKE THAT COMES YOU KIND OF KNOW IT OR COMES BACK STAGE.
Stephen: HE'S LOUD YOU'D KNOW IT.
"YOU WERE GREAT." THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. ( LAUGHTER ) I ALWAYS WANTED THAT. "SUPERB" "VERY, VERY FUNNY." I DON'T HAVE A DONALD TRUMP IMPRESSION.
Stephen: YOU DO. YOU DO HAVE A DONALD TRUMP.
IT'S NEW. I'M SORRY TO TRY IT OUT HERE. I HADN'T WORKED ON IT.

Stephen: I DID NOT KNOW. YOU STAYED AT HIS HOUSE.
YES.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU STAY AT HIS HOUSE?
PARTLY ON SAVE MONEY ON PRODUCTION IN MY OPINION. BUT I WAS IN NEW YORK AND I WAS IN THE GUEST HOUSE JUST FOR REHEARSAL OR SOMETHING. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "YOU CAN JUST STAY FOR THE WHOLE SHOOT." I DON'T HAVE A PLACE IN L.A.
Stephen: HOW LONG?
MONTHS.
Stephen: REALLY?
I LIVED IN A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE JUST BELOW WARREN BEATTY HE COULD CHECK ON ME.
Stephen: "YOU WERE OUT LATE LAST NIGHT, BRODERICK."
AND ONE NIGHT I ACTUALLY DWE DID A NIGHT SHOOT, AND I CAME HOME VERY LATE, AND I HORR GOT THE CLICKER IN MY CAR. I HAD SWITCHED CARS AND I CAN COULDN'T MOVE-- I COULDN'T OPEN THE DPAET.

Stephen: YOU AND GEORGE, OBVIOUSLY, I WATCH THIS "GEORGE WITH THE SWEEK STEPHANOPOULOS" DO YOU AND GEORGE APPROACH-- HE'S REAL NEWS AND YOU'RE A COMEDIAN. HOW DO YOU-- HOW IS YOUR WORLD VIEW DIFFERENT? HOW DO YOU MAKE SOMEONE WHO IS VERY SERIOUS LIKE HIM AND VERY SILLY LIKE YOU--
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS MUCH LIKE YOU AND YOUR WIFE, RIGHT? SHE'S VERY SERIOUS AND SMART AND HAS INTEGRITY AND IS MORAL. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:
Stephen: YES, NO, NO, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY-- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
I'M DESCRIBING MY HUSBAND.
Stephen: THAT'S THE CASE.
AND THEN THERE'S US.
Stephen: RIGHT.
THE CLASS CLOWN.
Stephen: RIGHT.
THE DAMAGED SOUL.
Stephen: EXACTLY. THE PIGEON WITH THE BROKEN WING FLOPPING AROUND ON THE SIDEWALK.
I'M IN A SHOE BOX. YOU MIGHT BE ON THE SIDEWALK. I THINK IT MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP. I THINK IF I WERE MARRIED TO CARROT TOP, WE MIGHT BE A LITTLE ANNOYING AT A DINNER PARTY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. THE GUY'S JACKED.
HE'S GOT A SUITCASE FULL OF PROPS AND THAT'S FUN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT GEORGE-- THERE'S A-- IT'S A YING AND YANG THING.
Stephen: WHO IS THE YING AND WHO IS THE YANG.
IT'S LIKE LUCY AND DESI.
Stephen: I'M IN MY 40s.
YOU'RE AT LEAST A DECADE OLDER THAN ME. WHAT! PREGNANT WITH THE SOUND GUY! YOUNG, YOUNG, YOUNG! ANYWAY, BUT THE THING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT GEORGE IS --
WHAT DON'T I KNOW ABOUT GEORGE?
HE'S SO DUMB.
Stephen: REALLY?
STUPID.
Stephen: REALLY.
WHEN I MET HIM, HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE MIDDLE EAST WAS SO HE'S --
HE'S MOSTLY JUST A PRETTY FACE.
HE'S ONE OF THE SEXIEST MEN IN AMERICA "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE. HE'S ALL FLUFF. THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. I AM THE PUPPET MASTER BEHIND HIM.
Stephen: WOW, WOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND SO YOU THINK HE MIGHT TAKE THAT ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT YOU'VE OFFERED ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE?
I THINK HE'S PACKING NOW. NO, HE HAS AN EAR PIECE DURING "THIS WEEK" AND I SAY, "ASK PENCE..." OTHERWISE HE'S JUST WATCHING --
"ASK PENCE HOW HE LIKED 'HAMILTON'." ASK HIM ALI WENTWORTH--
I'M LEAVING.
