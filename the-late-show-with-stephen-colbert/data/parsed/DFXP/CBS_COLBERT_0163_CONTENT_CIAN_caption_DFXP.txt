Stephen:  HEY I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE, ALEXANDER SKARSGARD.
SKARSGARD.
Stephen:  SKARSGARD.
SKARSGARD.
Stephen:  DO YOU BECOME A LONG LINE OF SKARSGARD?
IT CAME FROM LARS SKARSGARD. HE SMOKES CIGARS, AND PLAYED GUITARS, HIS MOTHER MARGE, MET LARS IN THE YARD, HIS YARD WAS BOTTOM BARTED, GOT HIT BY SHARDS OF REBAR.
Stephen:  DID HE HAVE A STAR?
HE HAD A SCAR, THEY HAD IT PRETTY HARD.
Stephen:  THANKS FOR SHARING THAT STORY WITH ME, ALEXANDER.

TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES, ALEXANDER SKARSGARD, NATASHA LEGGERO, AND ZIGGY MARLEY. FEATURING JON AND STAY HUMAN.  IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHO "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT!"  Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH! THAT'S GOOD! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU. PLEASE SIT DOWN. I THINK I'VE SUCKED ENOUGH OF YOUR LIFE FORCE OUT OF YOU FOR NOW. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HELL OF A GAME LAST NIGHT. EVERYONE SEE IT? IF YOU DIDN'T, THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS BEAT THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS IN GAME SEVEN TO WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP! "WOOOOOO!" (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  AND HOLD ON. FOR ALL MY GOLDEN STATE FANS OUT THERE, "WOOOOOOOOO." YOU DIDN'T WATCH -- YOU WATCHED?
I WATCHED. I LOVE THE GAME.
Stephen:  BASKETBALL HAD TO WIN. FOR REASONS OF RATINGS, I DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL US.
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME.
Stephen:  I THINK YOU JUST PLAYED YOUR HAND, JON. THIS GAME HAD SO MANY UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS STEPH CURRY TYING UP THE GAME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WITH A DEEP THREE, LEBRON JAMES COMING OUT OF NOWHERE FOR THIS INCREDIBLE BLOCK, AND THAT AMAZING SHOT FROM DOWNTOWN BY RAMSAY BOLTON. OK, I MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY SWITCHED OVER TO "GAME OF THRONES." LOT OF INJURIES IN THAT GAME. SPOILER ALERT: I HAVE A FEELING SOME OF THOSE CHARACTERS MIGHT BE ON THE DL NEXT SEASON. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  AND IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE NIGHT FOR LEBRON JAMES. HE PUT UP INCREDIBLE STATS: 27 POINTS, 11 REBOUNDS, 11 ASSISTS, AND LIKE 300 DRIBBLES. MAYBE MORE. I LOST COUNT AFTER A WHILE. IT WAS CLEVELAND'S FIRST SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIP IN OVER 50 YEARS (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THE WHOLE CITY GATHER IN CELEBRATION WITH ZERO RIOTING. THEY ARE SAVING THAT FOR THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  OF COURSE JUST FLIPPED OVER BURNING ELEPHANTS. OF COURSE, ENDING THAT STREAK WAS ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL FOR LEBRON JAMES. ONLY TWO YEARS AFTER RETURNING TO CLEVELAND, HE BROUGHT HIS HOME TOWN BACK FROM A 3-1 DEFICIT AGAINST THE TEAM WITH THE BEST RECORD IN N.B.A. HISTORY. IT'S AN INSPIRING CINDERELLA STORY, IF CINDERELLA HAD FIRST BETRAYED HER FAMILY BY TAKING HER TALENTS TO SOUTH BEACH. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  CINDERELLA, GO TO HELLEY!
Stephen:  SO NO SURPRISE THAT ONCE BUZZER SOUNDED, LEBRON WAS OVERTAKEN WITH EMOTION. WHICH MEANS NOT ONLY IS HE CHASING JORDAN'S CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS HE'S ALSO COMING FOR JORDAN'S MEMES. AND IN HIS POST-GAME INTERVIEW, LEBRON KNEW EXACTLY WHO TO THANK FOR HIS CITY'S RETURN TO GREATNESS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE MAN ABOVE GAVE ME THE HARDEST ROAD, BUT IT'S NOTHING THE MAN ABOVE DON'T PUT YOU IN NEW SITUATIONS YOU CAN'T HANDLE. THIS IS WHAT HE WANT ME TO DO.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. ACCORDING TO LEBRON JAMES, GOD WANTED THE CAVS TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIPS. BUT DOES THE MAN UPSTAIRS REALLY CARE THAT CLEVELAND'S LONG SPORTS DROUGHT IS OVER? LET'S FIND OUT. ARE YOU THERE, GOD? IT'S ME, STEPHEN.
HELLO EVERYONE. HELLO! GO CAVS! WOOOOO! (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: SO LEBRON WAS RIGHT. YOU WERE SUPPORTING CLEVELAND THE WHOLE TIME.
WELL, NOT THE WHOLE TIME. I WAS A STEPH CURRY FAN FOR MOST THE SEASON. THAT GUY IS UNBELIEVABLE. HE HIT SOME SHOTS EVEN I COULDN'T MAKE!
STEPHEN: SO WHAT HAPPENED?
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS SHOES? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  WAIT A SECOND LORD. YOU ENDED THE WARRIORS HISTORIC SEASON BECAUSE OF STEPHN CURRY'S SHOES?
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON. LITTLE MELISSA FRANKLIN OF SHAKER HEIGHTS, OHIO SAID HER NIGHTTIME PRAYERS. MEANWHILE, JIMMY CONKLIN IN OAKLAND WAS HAVING IMPURE THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS CAMP COUNSELOR. (LAUGHTER)
FOR SHAME! YOU DESTROYED THE GREATEST SEASON OF ALL TIME, JIMMY. HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT YOU LITTLE PERVERT! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  THAT WAS REALLY ROUGH. I MEAN I NEED SOME SUNSCREEN LORD. GOD, I GOT TO SAY. THIS REALLY MAKES YOU SEEM KIND OF PETTY.
STEPHEN, HAVE YOU READ THE BIBLE? I TOLD ABRAHAM TO KILL HIS SON JUST TO SEE IF HE WAS "INTO" ME. (LAUGHTER) GOOD TIMES.
Stephen:  I OVENS, BUT WHY DID YOU MAKE CLEVELAND SUFFER FOR SO LONG?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I HAVE BLESSED THE PEOPLE OF CLEVELAND WITH SO MUCH. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME AND, UM, THAT BASKETBALL GAME LAST NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  WELL, LORD, IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST CLEVELAND.
OH, HEAVENS NO. IT'S CHICAGO I'M GOING TO PUNISH! (LAUGHTER)
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT I HAVE PLANNED FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE CUBS SEASON! YOU EVER SEE SOMEONE PITCH WITH LEPROSY? GIVES NEW MEANING TO THE TERM "KNUCKLE BALL." (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: GOD, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP!
KING JAMES RULES!
Stephen:  ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE HIM STEP BY. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD. HE'S WELCOME HERE ANY TIME, ANY TIME. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: SPEAKING OF BIBLICAL PUNISHMENTS, DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Steph
Stephen:  LET'S CALL THEM TRUMP BOMBS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY THAT MAN'S NAME SO MANY TIMES, I'M THINKING OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT. THAT'S THE TRUMP-BUMP. GET USED TO IT. FOR ALL OF THE TALK OF TRUMP'S BUSINESS ACUMEN, HE HASN'T ACTUALLY RELEASED A LOT OF INFORMATION ON HOW HE'D RUN THE COUNTRY MORE EFFICIENTLY. UNTIL NOW.
EVERY TIME SOMEBODY MAYBE MAKES A THREAT, THERE GO THE SHIPS, THERE GO THE PLANES, THERE GOES EVERYTHING. EVERY TIME YOU TURN ON ONE OF THOSE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS, IT COSTS YOU PROBABLY $1 MILLION. I WOULD SAY "DON'T TURN IT ON!" THE CAPTAIN WOULD SAY "WE WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW GREAT THESE ENGINES ARE WORKING." NO, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT! JUST DON'T! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  THAT'S A GREAT POINT. YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY BY NOT TURNING ON AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. YOU CAN SAVE EVEN MORE BY PUTTING THE ENGINE IN NEUTRAL WHEN THE WATER'S GOING DOWNHILL. JUST COAST TO THE MIDDLE EAST. DID YOU NOTICE THAT LITTLE KEY-TURNING MOTION HE MADE? THAT'S HOW HE THINKS THAT AIRCRAFT CARRIERS START LIKE PONTIACS. JI JI JI. DON'T, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. GOT TO BE CAREFUL, DON'T PUMP THE GAS TOO MUCH. YOU DON'T WANT TO FLOOD THE CARBURETOR OF YOUR NUCLEAR POWERED AIRCRAFT CARRIER. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S DETAILED POLICY STATEMENTS LIKE THIS THAT COULD BE THE REASON WHY TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER COREY LEWANDOWSKI WAS FIRED TODAY. WHICH IS SHOCKING. SOMEBODY WAS "MANAGING" THAT CAMPAIGN? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  JI JI JI! AFTER DEFENDING LEWANDOWSKI WHEN HE WAS CHARGED WITH BATTERY OF A FEMALE REPORTER, WHY FIRE HIM NOW? THE WHOLE THING IS A MYSTERY WRAPPED IN A RIDDLE SLAPS IN AN ENIGMA AND SPRAYED WITH SPRAY-TAN. THE WHOLE THING, IT WAS ALL SUMMED UP BY A SOURCE INSIDE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHO TOLD NBC NEWS, NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IS HAPPENING. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE! AND JUST THIS AFTERNOON HIS COMMUNICATION HE DIRECTOR GAVE THIS STATEMENT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING???
Stephen:  WAS IT GOOD? IT'S AN OLDIE BUT GOODIE. CAN'T WATCH THAT TOO MANY TIMES. AND YET DONALD TRUMP, AFTER FIRING LONGTIME ADVISORS, SUPPORTERS DROPPING LEFT AND RIGHTS, AND NO FUNDING COMING IN STILL SEEMS SO CONFIDENT. AND I WAS WONDERING WHY, UNTIL I SAW HE HAS A SECRET WEAPON -- SCOTT BAIO! FOR MY YOUNGER VIEWERS WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH SCOTT BAIO, HE STARRED IN "JOANIE LOVES CHACHI" AND "CHARLES IN CHARGE." WHICH ARE TWO SITCOMS YOU'RE ALSO NOT FAMILIAR WITH. AND RECENTLY, BAIO SHOWED HIS SUPPORT FOR TRUMP IN A FOX BUSINESS INTERVIEW WITH ASHLEY WEBSTER, WHO I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON, IS NOT NAMED LESTER.
IT APPEARS THE PRESIDENT IS VERY RELUCTANT TO SAY ISLAMIC TERROR? WOULD YOU AGREE?
VERY RELUCTANT? HE'S ABSOLUTELY RELUCTANT. I CAN'T TELL LESTER, WHETHER HE'S DUMB, A MUSLIM OR A MUSLIM SYMPATHIZER, AND I DON'T THINK HE IS DUMB. SO, AT A CERTAIN POINT IF YOU ARE HAVING A PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE LESTER, AND YOU KNOW THAT 2% OF THE PEOPLE COMING TO YOUR HOUSE WANT TO KILL YOU, WON'T YOU WANT TO EITHER FIGURE OUT WHO'S COMING INTO OUR PARTY, OR NOT HAVE A PARTY? WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?
STEPHEN: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE SURPRISING: SCOTT BAIO'S OPINION OR THE FACT THAT SOMEONE ASKED SCOTT BAIO'S OPINION. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, NEXT THEY'RE GOING TO ASK THOUGHTS ON TRUMP'S BORDER WALL FROM WILSON FROM "HOME IMPROVEMENT." THAT, I WOULD LISTEN TO. THAT GUY I WOULD LISTEN TO. NOW AS SURPRISING AS THIS SEEMS, AS SURPRISING AS THIS SEEMS, BAIO'S BEEN DOING THIS HIS ENTIRE CAREER. JUST LISTEN TO THIS CONTROVERSIAL POLITICAL STATEMENT HE MADE ON "CHARLES IN CHARGE".
SO, I WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE BEFORE YOUR NEW CORN POPS?
F.D.R. KNEW PEARL HARBOR WAS COMING AND DID NOTHING TO STOP IT.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW SAY HELLO TO JOHN BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY, OF COURSE, WAS FATHER'S DAY, DID EVERYBODY HAVE A NICE FATHER'S DAY? ALL THE DADS OUT THERE, YOU DESERVE IT. MINE WAS FANTASTIC. DID I NOT DO A LOT. I SAID ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS TO SIT ON MY BACK PORCH AND HAVE MY KIDS COME AND DRINK WITH ME. THAT STORY IS STRANGE BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. BUT APPARENTLY, SOME DADS SPENT THEIR TIME DIFFERENTLY, BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW VIRAL CHALLENGE SWEEPING THE INTERNET WHERE DADS AROUND THE INTERNET ARE TRYING TO WITH CHEERIOS AS THEY CAN ON THEIR SLEEPING BABIES. IT BEATS THE OTHER CHALLENGE DAD'S DO ON THE INTERNET: TRYING TO ERASE THEIR BROWSER HISTORY. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE! BUT THIS IS STACKING CHEERIOS ON THE HEADS AND THE ARMS OF SLEEPING BABIES. LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PHOTOS. LOOK AT THAT. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE. REALLY PUT SOME EFFORT INTO YOU. REALLY REMINDS YOU WHY WOMEN HAVE BEEN CAREGIVERS SINCE THE DAWN OF HUMANITY. OOH COME LOOK, ME STACK MA'AM MOTH BONES ON BABY. QUICK. TAKE CAVE PAINTING!" I GOT TO SAY, THIS DAD CHEERIO CHALLENGE IS MUCH EASIER THAN THE ONES MOMS DO WHEN THE BABY'S SLEEPING, LIKE "DO I HAVE TIME TO WASH MYSELF?" AND "DO I HAVE ANY VOMIT-FREE SHIRTS LEFT?" NOW, I SAY THAT IT'S SWEEPING THE INTERNET BUT THE TRUTH IS WHO KNOWS IF ANYONE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THOSE PHOTOS, BECAUSE I ALSO JUST SAW THIS HEADLINE: "SIX IN TEN OF YOU WILL SHARE THIS LINK WITHOUT READING IT, A DEPRESSING NEW STUDY SAYS." YES, THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE FORWARDING THINGS TO YOU, DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY JUST FORWARDED YOU.
I MEAN IT MAKES YOU QUESTION EVERYTHING. DOES MY AUNT EVEN BELIEVE THE TEN REASONS A CAT IS BETTER THAN A HUSBAND? I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S DEPRESSING THOUGH. I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE THE WRITER JUST REALIZED THAT NO ONE WAS ACTUALLY READING ANY OF THE CONTENT HE WAS WRITING. IT'S LIKE HE'S SPENT HIS CAREER SHOUTING INTO SOCK AND TOSSING IT OFF AN OVERPASS. LET ME TALK TO THAT ONLINE WRITER AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DWINDLING BROADCAST TV INDUSTRY. DID SOMEONE NOT READ YOUR INTERNET POST OR RETWEET YOU? I'M SO SORRY FOR YOU. NOBODY KICKED ON IT, NOBODY MADE YOU CLICKETY CLIQUE. PEOPLE LEAVE ME ON IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE THEY HAVE SEX (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  BY THEMSELVES! WHY DON'T YOU WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THAT THAT NO ONE WILL READ? HASHTAG TRAGIC. THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME. WE'RE ALL SO BUSY THESE DAYS AND ACTUALLY READING THE LINKS THAT PEOPLE SEND YOU TAKES TIME. YOU KNOW, HOW IT'S EASIER TO CALL SOMEONE THAN TO GO SEE THEM? AND IT'S EASIER TO TEXT SOMEONE THAN TO CALL THEM? WELL, IT'S EASIER JUST TO RETWEET A HEADLINE THAN TO REMEMBER WHY YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING. THE POINT IS, NOBODY READS ANYMORE. SOON, WE WON'T EVEN READ TO OUR CHILDREN. WE'LL JUST SHOW THEM A HEADLINE THAT SAYS "THE TOP TEN PLACES SAM WON'T EAT GREEN EGGS AND HAM." NUMBER EIGHT WILL SHOCK YOU. IT'S IN A BOX. I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. IF 60% OF PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET ARE GOING TO JUST SHARE A LINK JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT THE HEADLINE SAYS, WHY SHOULDN'T I TAKE ADVANTAGE? IN FACT, WHEN WE PUT UP THIS VIDEO OF ME TALKING ABOUT THIS ON THE INTERNET TOMORROW, THE HEADLINE WON'T BE "STEPHEN COLBERT DISCUSSES CLICKBAIT." IT'LL BE, "STEPHEN'S LIVE COLONOSCOPY ENDS IN DISASTER. ALEXANDER SKARSGARD STILL MISSING." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ALEXANDER SKARSGARD. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

Stephen:  I'M ON THE 7,000 CALORIE THING. I'M WAITING TO GET TO THE WEIGHT LIFTING PART OF IT.
BUT THE OTHER PART IS LESS EXCITING, SIX MEALS A DAY AND MORE CARDIO, TO GET RID OF THE FAT.
Stephen:  AND NO FUN I BET?
NO FUN FOR EIGHT MONTHS.

YES. IT TOOK ME FIVE MONTHS UNTIL I ALLOWED MYSELF OR MAGNUS GAVE ME A CHEAT-DAY. WE SHOT THE MOVIE IN LONDON, WE WERE AT THE GYM AND LIFTING WEIGHTS AND HE SAW THAT MY WILL TO LIVE WAS FADING.
