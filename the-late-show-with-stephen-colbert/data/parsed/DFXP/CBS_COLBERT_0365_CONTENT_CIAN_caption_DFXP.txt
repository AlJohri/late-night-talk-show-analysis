NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: WHOO! YEAH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WHOO! THANKS, EVERYBODY! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY NICE. HEY, EVERYBODY! ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN ) THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOO! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY NICE. VERY NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. NOW, I HOPE YOU GUYS HAD A GREAT FATHER'S DAY WEEKEND. DID YOU, JON?
Jon: GREAT ONE.
Stephen: I HAD AN AMAZING ONE. I SLEPT TILL 1:30.
Jon: YOU SLEPT? OH, YOU WERE ALONE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU WERE BY YOURSELF. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: ALONE WITH MY DREAMS. ( LAUGHTER ) PRESIDENT HAD A NICE ONE. THE PRESIDENT WAS OUT AT CAMP DAVID. MUST HAVE BEEN NICE FOR TRUMP TO GO OUT TO THE COUNTRY TO GET AWAY THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BECAUSE, LAST WEEK, THE "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE -- BUT, OF COURSE, THAT IS  JUS -- DON'T GET TOO EXCITED. ( CHEERING ) -- THAT'S JUST SPECULATION FROM A HOSTILE NEWSPAPER USING ANONYMOUS SOURCES, SO DONALD TRUMP DID THE SMART THING AND MADE NO COMMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JUST KIDDING. ON FRIDAY -- ( LAUGHTER ) ON FRIDAY, HE TWEETED -- "I AM BEING INVESTIGATED FOR FIRING THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR BY THE MAN WHO TOLD ME TO FIRE THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR! WITCH HUNT." MR. PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW THE PHRASE "YOU BETTER LAWYER UP?" IT'S SHORT FOR "YOU BETTER GET A LAWYER AND SHUT UP." ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY? TRUMP'S TWEET DOESN'T JUST CONFIRM HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION, IT ALSO BLAMES DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ACCOUNTANT DAYDREAMING OF HAVING SEX WITH MONEY, ROD ROSENSTEIN. HE'S THE MAN WHO TRUMP SAID "TOLD" TRUMP TO FIRE THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR IN A LETTER THAT TRUMP ASKED HIM TO WRITE. IT'S ALL SUMMED UP BY THE FAMOUS PLAQUE ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK -- "THE BUCK STOPS WHEREVER I TOLD ROD TO TELL ME IT SHOULD!" ( LAUGHTER ) AND BECAUSE HE WAS IN ON THE -- AND BECAUSE ROSENSTEIN WAS IN ON TALKS ABOUT FIRING COMEY, ROSENSTEIN MAY NEED TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM THE RUSSIA PROBE. IT WOULD BE THE THIRD MEMBER OF THIS INVESTIGATION TO BE GONE, AFTER ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS AND FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. IT'S ALL IN THE LATEST SEASON OF "SURVIVOR: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ISLAND." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MAN, FOR REAL! BEEN IN THE GYM, HUH?
Stephen: ROSENSTEIN LOOKS GOOD. HE'S WIRY BUT HE'S JACKED. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT'S WEIRD FOR THE PRESIDENT TO EVEN BLAME ROD ROSENSTEIN, BECAUSE REMEMBER WHAT TRUMP TOLD LESTER HOLT --
REGARDLESS OF RECOMMENDATION, I WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY. I DECIDED TO JUST DO IT. I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIA THING WITH TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A MADE UP STORY."
STEPHEN: SO, IF TRUMP SAYS HE DECIDED TO FIRE COMEY, AND TRUMP SAYS ROD ROSENSTEIN TOLD TRUMP TO FIRE COMEY, THAT MEANS TRUMP IS ROD ROSENSTEIN! ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A FIGHT CLUB SITUATION! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S FIGHT CLUB! THEY'RE THE SAME GUY!
Jon: WOW, THE SAME CAT.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM ON CAMERA TOGETHER. THEY'RE THE SAME GUY. NO WONDER HE CAN'T STOP PUNCHING HIMSELF IN THE FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND ONCE AGAIN, SIR, THE FIRST RULE OF FIGHT CLUB IS "DON'T TALK ABOUT IT." ( LAUGHTER ) SO FOR DAMAGE CONTROL YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE SENT OUT TRUMP ATTORNEY AND MR. BURNS'S LAWYER FROM "THE SIMPSONS," JAY SEKULOW. ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) JAY SEKULOW WAS ON ALL THE SUNDAY SHOWS -- CBS, CNN, NBC, FOX NEWS, "ANIMAL PLANET," AND "THE HANDMAID'S TALE." ( LAUGHTER ) SO POWERFUL. SUCH A POWERFUL PORTRAYAL. AND HAD ONE CLEAR MESSAGE --
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN AND IS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT BEEN AND IS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION.
Stephen: OKAY, CLEAR AS A BELL. THE PRESIDENT ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY IS NOT BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I'M SORRY, YOU WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING.
HE'S BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
STEPHEN: SEKULOOOOWWWW!!! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! YOU HAD ONE JOB!! YOU HAD ONE JOB!! SAY HE'S NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION. BUT YOU HAD TO SHOOT YOUR MOUTH OFF ON TV. YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT TRUMP OF TRYING TO KEEP PRESIDENT TRUMP PRESIDENT, AND CHRIS WALLACE NOTICED.
FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE NOW SAID THAT HE IS GETTING INVESTIGATED AFTER SAYING THAT YOU DIDN'T.
NO.
YOU-- YOU JUST SAID, SIR, THAT HE'S BEING--
NO, HE'S NOT BEING INVESTIGATED!
YOU JUST SAID THAT HE'S BEING INVESTIGATED. SIR, YOU JUST SAID TWO TIMES THAT HE'S BEING INVESTIGATED.
NO. THE CONTEXT OF THE TWEET, I JUST GAVE YOU THE LEGAL THEORY, CHRIS, OF HOW THE CONSTITUTION WORKS.
STEPHEN: "AND IF I WAS LYING COULD I HOLD UP THIS PIECE OF PAPER?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DO YOU DENY THIS IS A PIECE OF PAPER? IT'S PAPER! PAPER! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN, KATY BAR THE DOOR.
I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO REPHRASE IT, BUT I'M JUST BEING REALLY--
NO, SIR, I DIDN'T REPHRASE IT. THE TAPE WILL SPEAK-- JAY, THE TAPE WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF, YOU SAID HE IS BEING INVESTIGATED. AND IT'S NOT JUST BEING --
CHRIS! HE IS -- I JUST --
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE, JAY!
STEPHEN: PLEASE STOP FIGHTING. PLEASE STOP FIGHTING. IT'S JUST SO -- I'M SORRY -- IT'S JUST SO TRAGIC TO SEE MY PEOPLE -- MIDDLE AGED, WHITE MEN WITH DARK HAIR AND GLASSES -- TURN ON EACH OTHER LIKE THIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CAN'T WE ALL JUST WORK OUT OUR DIFFERENCES OVER A DRAFT BEER AND SOME TOM PETTY MUSIC? ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ YOU DON'T HAVE TO -- ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) SEKULOW TRIED TO RECOVER.
I DO NOT APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH WHEN I'VE BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT AND HAS NOT BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION. I DON'T THINK I COULD BE ANY CLEARER THAN THAT--
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, AGAIN, SIR --
I CANNOT READ THE MIND-- YOU'RE RIGHT, CHRIS. I CAN'T READ THE MIND OF THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
OKAY, GOOD, WE'RE IN AGREEMENT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION. YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION OR NOT.
STEPHEN: SO, TO RECAP, SEKULOW IS SAYING TRUMP IS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, IS UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND HE HAS NO IDEA IF HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION. OKAY? A GOOD LAWYER COVERS HIS BASES. THAT WAY -- WHEN THE JUDGE ASKS, "HOW DOES YOUR CLIENT PLEAD, GUILTY OR INNOCENT?" HE CAN ANSWER, "ALL OF THE ABOVE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW -- HE'S GOOD. HE'S GOOD. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! SETH ROGEN IS HERE! PAUL SHAFFER IS HERE! STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP! YOU GUYS SOUND GREAT TONIGHT, JOHN. YOU GUYS SOUND AMAZING.
Jon: HELLO! HELLO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING BAND. THAT IS THE GREATEST BAND PRESENTLY ON THE TELEVISION. PRESENTLY ON TELEVISION.
WE'RE RIGHT HERE. I SAY PRESENTLY BECAUSE TONIGHT WITH US IS PAUL SHAFFER AND THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS BAND, FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME RETURNS TO THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. YOU TWICE GOING TO PLAY TOGETHER?
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO STORCH THE STAGE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GET THE EXTINGUISHER AFTERWARD. IT WILL BE HOT.
STEPHEN: MY FIRST GUEST IS AN ACTOR, WRITER, AND DIRECTOR YOU KNOW FROM "KNOCKED UP", "THE INTERVIEW" AND "THIS IS THE END." PLEASE WELCOME SETH ROGEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
HI, GUYS!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU, GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON AGAIN.
GREAT TO BE HERE, THANK YOU.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT TIE. THANK YOU, IT'S A COOL TIE.
Stephen: IT'S A COOL SNAKE SKIN TIE.
IT'S COOLER THAN I AM.
Stephen: YOU'RE PRETTY COOL.
THANK YOU. I FEEL FANTASTIC. THAT WAS A GREAT BOOST FOR MY EGO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FINALLY.
Stephen: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, YOU AND THE MOVIES AND YOUR PROJECT, THE SECOND SEASON OF "PREACHER" THAT YOU ARE PRODUCING AND CO-WROTE. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA FOR A SECOND.
LET'S DO IT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A FAIRLY MAJOR PRESENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND MADE FRIENDS WITH SOMEBODY ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT SURPRISED ME.
WHAT'S AMAZING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA IS IF SOMEONE FOLLOWS YOU ON TWITTER AND YOU FOLLOW THEM, YOU CAN COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THEM THROUGH DIRECT MESSAGING.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE BOTH ON TWITTER.
YEAH, AND YOU FOLLOW UP EACH OTHER, YOU CAN OPEN UP A PRIVATE CONVERSATION, AS IT WERE, AND I FOUND OUT DONALD J. TRUMP FOLLOWED ME.
Stephen: REALLY? YES. AND I FOLLOWED -- AND I THEN FOLLOWED HIM TO TRY TO OPEN A LINE OF COMMUNICATION.
Stephen: SURE, OF COURSE. WITH THE SON OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS A PRETTY COOL THING TO TRY TO DO, I THOUGHT.
Stephen: I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF ART CARDS HERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU TWEETED THIS TO HIM FIRST. WOULD YOU MIND READING IT?
I SAID, YO, DONALD TRUMP, JR., I NOTICE YOU FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER, PLEASE ASK YOUR DAD TO RESIGN BEFORE HE DESTROYS THE PLANET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ASSUMING HE WOULD DO IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH. WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING, I WAVED, HOPING HE WOULD LET ME IN.
Stephen: SURE. NO RESPONSE?
HE'SED ME ON THAT ONE, WHICH WAS SHOCKING. I TRIED TO BE POLITE.
Stephen: YOU SAID, THANKS, DUDE.
I SAID THANKS, DUDE.
Stephen: THIS IS THE PART I LOVE. BECAUSE YOU SAID BECAUSE YOU BOTH FOLLOW, YOU CAN DIRECT MESSAGE, YOU DIRECT MESSAGED HIM.
I DID.
Stephen: THIS IS A MESSAGE THAT UP UNTIL THIS MOMENT ONLY HE HAS RECEIVED.
I THINK SO, YEAH. I SAID, HEY, MAN, IT'S SETH. YOUR FATHER IS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR MEDIA, COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA AND DESTROY OUR ENVIRONMENT. IT WOULD BE SUPER COOL FOR YOU TO SAY, YO, DAD, WHY DON'T YOU STOP ALL THIS AND JUST GO BACK TO BEING A GUY ON TV? THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD WOULD BE PRETTY PSYCHED, THANKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOTHING.
Stephen: NO RESPONSE? NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. WHICH, AGAIN, I THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY POLITE AND MEASURED AND NO RESPONSE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
Stephen: WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS, I CHECKED OUT MY TWITTER FEED AND TURNS OUT HE FOLLOWS ME, TOO. SO I WANTED TO D.M. HIM.
WE COULD DOUBLE TEAM HIS ASS, YEAH, MAN.
Stephen: OR JUST REACH OUT. GET IN ON THIS.
Stephen: I THOUGHT I WOULD SEND HIM THIS. I'M GOING TO SEND HIM, "SUP? HANG WITH @SETH ROGEN, WHY DON'T YOU RETURN HIS D.M.s? HOW ABOUT WE ALL CHILL TOGETHER AND BURN ONE, DON'T TELL@JAMES FRANCO. VERY JEALOUS ." THERE YOU GO, THAT'S OFF TO THE PRESIDENT'S SON RIGHT THERE.
I CONSIDER IT ANOTHER DIRECT MESSAGE AS WELL CONFIRMING TO HIM --
Stephen: SAYING WE'RE TOGETHER. WHAT COLBERT SAID IS TRUE.
WE'RE COMING, HEAR MY MESSAGE. I SENT HIM A THIRD ONE LATE ONE NIGHT STARTS WITH, HEY, MAN, DON'T MEAN TO COME ACROSS LIKE A WEIRDO OR ANYTHING -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S A TERRIBLE BEGINNING.
I'M CREEPING ON HIM LIKE SOMEBODY WHO'S BLOCKING ME ON TINDER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. DON'T MEAN TO COME ACROSS LIKE A WEIRDO, JUST REALIZED I COULD MESSAGE YOU AND THOUGHT I WOULD. MAYBE ASK YOUR DAD TO INVESTIGATE IF HIS CAMPAIGN IS IN TALKS WITH RUSSIA. THIS WAS BEFORE THE FLYNN THING. MAYBE HAVE SOMEBODY LOOK INTO FLYNN'S TIES TO RUSSIA. MAYBE ASK HIM TO GO HACK TO HOSTING GAME SHOWS. HE WOULD PREFER THAT. THEN I SENT ANOTHER ONE, HEY, DUDE, CHECKING IN. SEEING WHAT'S UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I THINK YOU SEE THESE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW COULD HE NOT. IF NOT, MY FRIEND STEVE IS GETTING IN ON THIS. CHECK IT OUT.
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S @STEPHEN AT HOME, ASK YOUR DAD TO QUIT, PLEASE.
Stephen: THANKS FOR THE SOLID. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S DONE. YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S DONE POLITELY, IT'S DONE WITH LOVE.
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, WHAT WILL?
Stephen: VOTING? OH, NO.
Stephen: WE TRIED THAT ONE. YOU ACTUALLY GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF HEAT YOURSELF. YOU'RE A BIT OF A SCAPEGOAT FOR PEOPLE WHO DO LIKE THE PRESIDENT, THEY TOLD YOU TO GO BACK TO CANADA BECAUSE, SPOILER ALERT, YOU'RE FROM VANCOUVER.
I'M FROM VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA.
Stephen: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BLOWING THIS POPSICLE STAND AND GO BACK NORTH?
NOT YET. OUR PRIME MINISTER IS THE MOST -- HE'S AVAILABLE. I CALL TRUMP STUMP. THAT'S A FUNNY. I THINK HIS BIGGEST SUPPORTERS WOULD RATHER BANG THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA THAN HIM EVEN, I WOULD IMAGINE, IF GIVEN THE CHOICE. I WOULD.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A GUY TO MAKE 'EM LAUGH.
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S WHY THEY WOULD BOTH CHOOSE ME. BUT THEY'RE LEGALIZING WEED THE NEXT YEAR IN CANADA, WHICH IS GREAT.
Stephen: IN VANCOUVER, I HAVE BEEN TO VANCOUVER, YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S NOT LEGAL THERE.
IT'S LEGAL IN VANCOUVER.
Stephen: ON CAMERA, PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO THROW WEED AT ME. NOTHING HAPPENED TO THEM.
SOUNDS FANTASTIC. YEAH, I'M FROM THERE. YEAH, THAT'S WHY I'M LIKE THIS.
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL CITY. NO, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY. BUT I'M HERE TO STAY WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, UNFORTUNATELY.
Stephen: WE LIKE IT. I HOPE YOU WILL STAY.
STEPHEN: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE SETH ROGEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE BACK WITH OUR FRIEND SETH ROGEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, SETH, YOU HAVE -- YOU'RE NOW IN THE SECOND SEASON OF A PROJECT OF LOVE FROM YOUR HEART CALLED "PREACHER" WHICH YOU COE WRITE, COE DIRECT AND PRODUCED. IT'S BASED ON THE COMIC GRAPHIC NOVEL. WHAT IS IT?
A SCI-FI, HORROR, DRAMATIC COMEDY SHOW WHEREIN A PREACHER IS EMBEAUD WITH THE SPIRIT OF AN ANGEL AND A DEMON WHICH GIVES HIM, LIKE, THE BABY OF AN ANGEL AND DEMON WHICH GIVES HIM, LIKE, A POWER, AND HE HAS A BEST FRIEND WHO'S A VAMPIRE, AND HIS GIRLFRIEND IS AN ASSASSIN, AND THEY FIND OUT GOD IS MISSING FROM HEAVEN AND IS SOMEWHERE ON EARTH PHYSICALLY AND THEY'RE ON A ROAD TRIP TO FIND HIM AND BRING HIM TO WHATEVER JUSTICE THEY CAN, BASICALLY.
Stephen: IT'S AN ETERNAL STORY.
EXACTLY, IT'S ONE OF THOSE. THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF ON TV NOW. YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THERE IS 20,000 SHOWS. YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO FOR IT, THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT.
Stephen: EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU AS A COMEDY GUY BUT YOU HAVE AN ODD BENT FOR END OF DAYS, SORT OF APOCALYPTIC.
YES.
Stephen: WITH YOUR BUDDIES, YOU DID "THIS IS THE END."
YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU A DOOM CRYER?
I DO THINK THE WORLD IS GOING TO END, YEAH, FOR SURE.
Stephen: WHEN THE SUN EXPANDS AND SWALLOWS US OR NEXT WEEK?
SOME IDIOTS WILL BLOW IT UP. YOU CAN BLOW UP THE WORLD, SO SOME IDIOT WILL. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE BLOWN UP EVERYTHING WE CAN BLOW UP, SO WHY WOULD WE STOP WITH THE WORLD? I DON'T KNOW. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID, ACTUALLY, I ASKED MY DAD, DO YOU THINK THE WORLD'S GOING TO END? AND HE LOOKED AT ME COMPLETELY SERIOUSLY AND SAID, IT ALREADY DID.
Stephen: WHAT DID HE MEAN? I HAVE NO IDEA. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS SO DARK. I WAS, LIKE, SIX.
Stephen: YOU WERE SIX? I WAS VERY YOUNG.
Stephen: DID HE KISS YOU AND SAY, SLEEP TIGHT, HONEY?
EXACTLY. IT WAS A DARK STATEMENT, I THINK ABOUT IT A LOT. I'M AFRAID TO ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT, HONESTLY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU ENJOY COMEDY, BUT DO YOU ENJOY GORE? BECAUSE THERE'S ENJOYABLY GROTESQUE STUFF IN THERE.
I DO ENJOY. I GREW UP WATCHING SAM RAIMI AND A LOT OF PETER JACKSON'S MOVIES. SO WE LIKE GORE AND "PREACHER" HAS A LOT OF GORE. SOMETIMES IT'S TOO GRUESOME FOR EVEN THE EFFECTS PEOPLE. THERE IS A SCENE WHERE SOMEBODY CUTS THEIR HEART OUT IN FRONT OF THEIR MOTHER AND TRIES TO GIVE IT TO HER. IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY SCENE ( LAUGHTER ) THE MOTHER IS SUPPOSED TO GET BLASTED IN THE FACE WITH FAKE BLOOD. WE KEPT QUEUING THE FAKE BLOOD AND IT WASN'T HAPPENING. I WENT TO THE GUY WITH THE FAKE BLOOD TUBE AND HE SAID, I CAN'T DO THIS. I SAID, DO YOU WANT ME TO DO IT? AND HE SAID, YES, I DO WANT YOU TO TO IT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT ME, BUT LITERALLY WITH NO QUALMS IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM, I BLASTED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN THE FACE WITH A HEALTHY SERVING OF FAKE MOVIE BLOOD.
Stephen: AS AN ACTRESS, HOW DID SHELF ABOUT IT?
SHE FELT GOOD. SHE WAS A TROOPER, AND THE SCENE IS FANTASTIC. SO, YEAH, THAT'S SHOW BUSINESS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SEE WHAT YOU'RE MISSING, DONALD TRUMP, JR.?
EXACTLY, YOU COULD HAVE THESE INTERACTIONS WITH ME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: PLEASE COME BACK. I WOULD LOVE TO.
Stephen: IT'S SO FUN HAVING YOU.
I LOVE BEING HERE SO MUCH. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SUCCESS.
Stephen: OUR FRIEND SETH ROGEN, HIS SHOW "PREACHER" RETURNS ON A.M.C. SUNDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "SILICON VALLEY." HE ALSO WROTE AND STARS IN THE NEW  FILM "THE BIG SICK," WHICH IS GETTING A TON OF CRITICAL ACCLAIM. PLEASE WELCOME KUMAIL NANJIANI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! COME ON UP HERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I LIKE THAT LOOK, MAN. IT'S A VERY CLEAN, VERY CRISP LOOK YOU'VE GOT THERE. FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU. I'M THE FIRST PERSON ON THE SHOW THAT DONALD TRUMP, JR. DOESN'T FOLLOW ON TWITTER. I ACTUALLY CHECKED. I GOT EXCITED. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I CHECKED AND FOUND OUT I WAS FOLLOWED. MAYBE AFTER TONIGHT HE WILL.
WELL, I'M GOING TO TWEET AT HIM.
Stephen: YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD.
HEY, CAN I GET A FOLLOW BACK. THANKS, DUDE.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO END WITH THE THANKS, DUDE. GOT TO KEEP THIS NICE.
GOT TO BE POLITE, YEAH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I LOVE YOUR SHOW SO MUCH. IT'S BEEN GOOD.
Stephen: AND I LOVE YOUR SHOW SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE "SILICON VALLEY." WE GO WAY BACK. MY SHOW WAS THE FIRST TV SHOW YOU WERE ON, IS THAT RIGHT?
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: WHERE AMERICA MET YOU IS YOU CAME OUT FROM UNDERNEATH MY DESK. EIGHT OR NINE YEARS LATER YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE CALLED "THE BIG SICK."
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU WROTE IT, YOU STAR IN IT AND -- WHERE'S MY CUT?
I HAVE BEEN SENDING YOU 20% FOR EIGHT YEARS.
Stephen: OH. YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE MONEY?
Stephen: I'M SURE COMEDY CENTRAL IS CASHING THE CHECK. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU AND YOUR WIFE EMILY WROTE "THE BIG SICK." TELL THE CROWD WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
IT'S BASED ON THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS, WHILE WE WERE FIRST DATING AND MY PARENTS WANTED TO GET AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE MARRIED TO A PAKISTANY WOMAN.
Stephen: LIKE THEY'D PICK THE GIRL?
YEAH, YEAH, THEY'D PICK THE GIRL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE HEARD THE PHRASE, ARRANGED MARRIAGE?
Stephen: YEAH. BUT IT'S A --
WE'RE STILL AT IT.
Stephen: OKAY. DIDN'T KNOW. DIDN'T KNOW. GO AHEAD. ( LAUGHTER )
BUT EMILY AND I STARTED DATING. WHEN WE WERE FIRST DATE AGO FEW MONTHS IN, SHE FELL INTO  A COMA -- IT'S A COMEDY, I PROMISE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW LONG WAS SHE IN A COMA?
SHE WAS IN A COMA EIGHT DAYS. I HUNG OUT WITH HER PARENTS. I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW THEM TUN THEN. THERE THEY ARE. YOU SEE THEM? HI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. WELCOME BUT SHE'S FINE --
IT'S A COMEDY. IT REALLY IS, I PROMISE YOU. IT SOUNDS LIKE A NOT COMEDY, BUT IT IS A COMEDY.
Stephen: I BELIEVE YOU. HE'S DOING GREAT. SHE'S CRUSHING IT.
Stephen: OKAY. POILER ALERT, SHE COMES OUT OF A COMA.
Stephen: EIGHT DAYS. A LITTLE COMA.
I DON'T KNOW, FELT QUITE LONG AT THE TIME, STEPHEN. EIGHT DAYS FELT LIKE A SIZABLE LENGTH FOR A COMA. FOR ME, IDEAL IS ZERO.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. ( APPLAUSE )
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF THE BEST, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. SO I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CLIP?
I HAVE TO SET UP THE CLIP. SO, IN THE MOVIE, BY THIS POINT, SO EMILY'S IN THE COMA AND HER PARENTS ARE HERE, AND EMILY AND I JUST HAD A VERY CONTENTION BREAKUP, AND HER PARENTS KNOW ABOUT IT. SO THEY KIND OF DON'T WANT ME TO BE AT THE HOSPITAL ANYMORE, THEY WANT ME TO GO.
Stephen: YOU HAD A BREAKUP BEFORE SHE WENT INTO THE COMA?
YEAH, SHE WENT INTO THE COMA AND I SAID, THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: FUNNY, KIND OF FUNNY.
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GETTING MUCH BACK RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M DOING THESE JOKES, YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING AT ALL. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I'VE SORT OF BEEN HANGING AROUND THE HOSPITAL. THEY WANT ME TO LEAVE. I WON'T LEAVE. WHAT YOU SEE IS THIS IS THE FIRST CONVERSATION WE FINALLY HAVE WHERE I FINALLY SIT WITH THEM TO EAT AND IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF DAYS, AND MY CHARACTER IS A GUY WHO, LIKE, MAKES THE WRONG JOKE ALL THE TIME. HE'S NOT GOOD WITH HIS FEELINGS, SO HE TRIES TO DEFLECT IT WITH JOKES.
Stephen: MM-HMM. RAY ROMANO AND HOLLY HUNTER PLAY THEM.
Stephen: NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY NICE.
AND, SO --
Stephen: AND THIS IS YOU EATING DINNER TOGETHER.
LUNCH AT THE HOSPITAL CAFETERIA. THIS IS OUR FIRST CONVERSATION TOGETHER.
Stephen: JIM. SO, UH, 9/11 -- ( LAUGHTER ) NO, I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT WITH -- PEOPLE.
YOU'VE NEVER TALKED TO PEOPLE ABOUT 9/11? NO. WHAT'S YOUR STANCE?
WHAT'S MY STANCE ON 9/11? OH, ANTI. WE LOST 19 OF OUR BEST GUYS. ( LAUGHTER ) TERRIBLE JOKE, OBVIOUSLY. 9/11 WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY... ...AND IT'S NOT FUNNY TO JOKE ABOUT IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT MY WONDERFUL FATHER IN LAW ASKED ME WHEN WE FIRST SPOKE.
Stephen: OKAY. HE WARMED UP TO IT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JOKING. HE NEVER ASKED ME THAT.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT YOUR FOLKS? THEY'RE DEPICTED IN THE MOVIE, TOO, I ASSUME?
YEAH, THEY'RE VERY EXCITED. THE PERSON WHO PLAYS MY DAD IN THE MOVIE, HE'S A BOLLYWOOD LEGEND. HE'S, LIKE, ROBERT De NIRO OF INDIA. THIS WAS HIS 500th FILM HE'S IN. I JUST SAW HIM TWEET YESTERDAY. SAID JUST COMPLETED MY 510t 510th FILM. I SAID, YOU DID 10 FILMS? I HAVEN'T SEEN 10 FILMS SINCE THEN. I ASKED MY DAD, WHO DO YOU WANT TO PLAY YOU? AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET HIM AND MY DAD VISITED THE SET AND THEY GOT A PICTURE TOGETHER AND A WEEK LATER MY DAD CALLED ME AND SAID, I PUT IT ON Facebook. I'M UP TO 92 LIKES. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HE'S BLOWING UP. HE'S BLOWING UP.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. "THE BIG SICK" IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. KUMAIL NANJIANI, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE GREAT PAUL SHAFFER! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )

Stephen: OH, MY GOODNESS. WHOO-HOO! MAN, DOES IT FEEL GOOD TO HEAR THAT SONG IN THIS THEATER RIGHT NOW.
OH, MY GOODNESS -- WELL -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: A SONG THAT YOU WROTE.
I DID. I WROTE THE THEME OF THE DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW AND IT WAS, YOU KNOW, PLAYED EVERY NIGHT FOR ALL THOSE 33 YEARS.
Stephen: YEP. AND YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT INCOME OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF MY CHILDREN. ( LAUGHTER ) ONLY KIDDING. WE HAD A WONDERFUL RUN. TO BE HERE, THOUGH, FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE IN MY -- THIS WAS MY AREA --
Stephen: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE BEEN BACK HERE SINCE DAVE'S LAST NIGHT.
I AND MY BAND WERE OVER HERE AND DAVID WOULD BE WHERE JON IS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.
Stephen: YEAH. O IT'S BEEN REVERSED AND IT'S LIKE BEING ON ACID A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: WELL, GOOD. IN A GOOD WAY.
Stephen: WELL, WE FLIPPED THE STAGE BECAUSE WE WANTED YOU ON SO MUCH THAT WE WANTED YOU TO FEEL WELCOME IN THE RIGHT STAGE PORE THE INTERVIEW.
BACK IN MY SPOT, YES.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE?
I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THE LITTLE TOUCHES LIKE THIS. INCREDIBLE. WE HAD COVERED THIS UP. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS A BROADWAY HOUSE, THOUGH.
Stephen: YEAH. WASN'T IT? THE HAMMERSTEIN THEATER.
Stephen: 1927. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU TID THIS FOR 33 YEARS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU MISS ABOUT BEING ON TV EVERY NIGHT?
WELL, EVERY NIGHT, YOU CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOUR OPINION GOING TO BE EVERY NIGHT, AND I DON'T HAVE THAT TO FALL BACK ON. IT WAS PARTICULARLY GREAT AT FAMILY FUNCTIONS, SOCIAL FUNCTIONS. MARGARET, UNCLE ERNIE, LOVE TO SEE YOU BUT I'VE GOT A SHOW. I WOULD BE FLYING, GOT TO MAKE THE SHOW, GET TO THE AIRPORT, NICE TO SEE YOU, THOUGH. DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE. ( LAUGHTER ) OTHERWISE, IT IS MAYBE A LITTLE HEALTHIER. TWO YEARS LATER I CAN LOOK BACK ON IT AND SAY, MY GOODNESS, WE WERE A LITTLE WOUND TIGHT.
Stephen: 200 HOURS OF THIS A YEAR.
AND YOU NEVER REALLY COME DOWN, YOU ALWAYS HAVE ONE TO DO THE NEXT NIGHT. IT'S TRUE YOU CAN MAKE UP FOR YOUR MISTAKES, YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE BUT YOU DON'T RELAX REALLY. IT'S GREAT. IT'S A REAL PRIVILEGE TO DO IT. I HOPE YOU HAVE AS LONG A RUN AS WE HAD.
Stephen: OH, THANKS. WE WILL. WE'RE HAVING FUN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND THIS IS THE HIPPEST BAND IN THE LAND. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOTICING BACKSTAGE JON ONE OF THE GREAT JAZZ PIANIST, AND WHEN HE NOODLES -- A TECHNICAL TERM WHEN THERE'S COMEDY GOING ON YOU DON'T WANT DEAD AIR, JUST TINGLING ON THE PIANO. THE HIP TERM IS NOODLING -- THIS IS HOW HE NOODLES -- ( PIANO RIFF ) -- YEAH, BACH, BA BEETHOVEN, WE WERE NOODLING. I BROUGHT MY BAND. THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS BAND.

YOU HAVE ALL THE DIFFERENT -- DIFFERENT COLORS, YES. WHITE, OF COURSE, FOR SUMMER AROUND IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY BRITISH ON THE SHOW. BUT THIS MAN HAS PUT ME --
Stephen: I ASK, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF JON'S OUTFITS, IS HE BRINGING HIS GAME?
IT'S NOT EASY TO PUT THE TWO BANDS TOGETHER. THEIR BAND, OUR BAND, VALERIE SIMPSON AND ME SING AGO DUET. I HAD A LOT OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. WHEN I CALLED JON UP, I SAID, FIRST OF ALL, WHO IS YOUR TAILOR, BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT -- YOU KNOW -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
