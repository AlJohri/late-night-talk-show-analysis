THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT WHITE HOUSE IS A REAL DUMP.
OKAY, LET'S FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE, SOMETHING WITH SOME REAL CLASS. LET'S SEE, THE PALACE OF VERSEILLE, NAH, NOT ENOUGH OF ENOUGH GLD LEAF.
TAJ MA GENTLEMAN, NO, CURRY MAKES ME CASS GASSY, THE PYRAMIDS RIGHT ON THE GOLF COURSE, I DON'T WANT TO BE BURIED WITH MY HELP.
MOTTO, LAVA, KEEP OUT THE MEXICANS, EXCELLENT SECURITY SYSTEM, A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF MOUNT DOOM, WE COULD HAVE OUR PRESS CONFERENCES THERE, LET ME TAG THAT ONE. THE DEATH STAR, OOO, DADDY LIKE.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, WE WELCOME DAVE CHAPPELLE, JAMES VAN DEER BEEK AND JOE WALSH. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. WHOOO. THANKS, EVERYBODY, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. AND I AM-- (APPLAUSE) I GOT TO SAY, I AM REALLY GLAD MY FAMILY GOT HERE IN 1828. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP JUST PULLED UP THE IMMIGRATION LADDER BEHIND US. TODAY THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A HARSH NEW IMMIGRATION BILL. AND I GOT TO SAY, TRUMP IS FULFILLING AT LEAST ONE KEY CAMPAIGN PROMISE.
GET THEM OUT OF HERE! GET THEM OUT OF HERE! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NOW DON'T SAY, DON'T YOU DARE SAY HE'S JUST CRUELLY TARGETING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.
BECAUSE THE BILL WANTS TO REDUCE LEGAL IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES BY 50%.
BOO!
Stephen: MELANIA, HONEY, I GOT SOME TOUGH NEWS, ONLY 50% OF YOUR PARENTS CAN COME IT THANKSGIVING. I SAY YOUR MOM. SHE'S THE GREATEST IN SHAPE. REALLY LOOKING GOOD. NOW THE BILL SOUNDS BAD BUT TO KIND OF CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE BIT, TO TAKE THE STINK OFF OF IT THEY GAVE IT A CATCHY NAME, THE REFORMING AMERICA IMMIGRATION FOR STRONG EMPLOYMENT OR RAISE ACT. THE RAISE ACT, OKAY. MUCH BETTER MARKETING THAN THE ORIGINAL NAME THE REFORMING AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP IS SUPER TOUGH ACT. YEAH. THEY DIDN'T USE IT, I DON'T KNOW WHY. ST HONEST TRK IS AN HONEST-- BASICALLY DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO CREATE WHAT HE CALLED A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM THAT AWARDS POINTS TO GREEN CARD APPLICANTS BASED ON SUCH FACTORS AS ENGLISH ABILITY. YES, IMMIGRANTS HAVE TO LEARN PROPER ENGLISH LIKE BIGLY, COVFEFE, AND BINGE BINGE BINGE BINGE BINGE BINGE BINGE. (LAUGHTER) BING, BING.
THE AND IT IS A TRIPLE SYSTEM. NOW TRUMP EXPLAINED HIS SYSTEM HIMSELFS WITHIN AS A CANDIDATE I CAMPAIGNED ON CREATING A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS U.S. WORKERS AND TAXPAYERS. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. MERIT-BASED.
Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, WHEREVER YOU ARE TODAY, IT IS NOT BASED ON MERIT. (APPLAUSE) BUT, BUT, DONALD TRUMP COULD NOT BE PROUDER OF THIS BILL SAYING, THIS WOULD BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REFORM TO THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN HALF A CENTURY. IT IS A HISTORIC AND VERY VITAL PROPOSAL. YES, EXTREMELY HISTORIC. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS SINCE THE WHOMP THE IRISH WITH A STICK ACT OF 1884. YEAH, EAT STICK, PATTY, EAT STICK. THEN TRUMP EXPLAINED, TRUMP EXPLAINED HOW THIS BILL IS GOING TO HELP THE AMERICAN WORKER.
THE RAISE ACT WILL GIVE AMERICAN WORKERS A PAY RAISE BY REDUCING UNSKILLED IMMIGRATION. THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT ONLY RE-- RESTORE OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE IN THE 21S CENTURY, BUT IT WILL RESTORE THE SACRED BONDS OF TRUST BETWEEN AMERICA AND ITS CITIZENS.
Stephen: YEAH, BEFORE THIS BILL, AMERICA HAD TOTALLY LOST TRUST IN ITS CITIZENS. AFTER ALL, CITIZENS ELECTED DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T TRUST US. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND-- WE DID IT. WE DID IT. WE, DID IT.
I'M NOT SURE THE RAISE ACT IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS. BECAUSE A "WASHINGTON POST" SURVEY OF ECONOMISTS FOUND THAT 89% BELIEVE IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA FOR TRUMP TO CURB IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES. EXPERTS OVERWHELMINGLY PREDICT IT WOULD SLOW GROWTH. THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT TRUMP WANTS TO DO WITH MAGANOMMICS. HOLD ON, "WASHINGTON POST." DON'T SAY MAGANOMMICS. IT DOESN'T COUNT AS ECONOMIC POLICY IF IT WAS WRITTEN BY A HAT. NOW TO DEFEND THEIR NEW IMMIGRATION POLICY THE WHITE HOUSE SENT OUT POLICY ADVISOR AND ST. JOSEPH BABY GOEBBELS STEPHEN MILLER. IT DID NOT GO WELL. IT DID NOT-- COULD HAVE GONE BETTER. HE'S  -- HE'S NOT A PEOPLE EL PERSON. FOR INSTANCE, AT ONE POINT CNN'S JIM ACOSTA BROUGHT UP THE POEM ON THE BASE OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY ON THE PEDESTAL, WHICH DOES NOT MENTION ADVANCED TECHNICAL DEGREES BUT DOES TALK ABOUT WELCOMING THE WRETCHED REFUSE OF YOUR TEEMING SHORE. BUT MILLER WASN'T HAVING ANY OF IT.
I DON'T WANT TO GET OFF INTO A WHOLE THING ABOUT HISTORY HERE.
Stephen: THEN DON'T. (LAUGHTER) OR DO.
BUT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS A SYMBOL OF LIBERTY AND LIGHT IN THE WORLD. A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN LIBERTY LIGHTING THE WORLD. POEM YOU ARE REFERRING TO WAS ADDED LATER IT IS NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THE ORIGINAL STATUE OF LIBERTY.
Stephen: THIS IS TRUE. ORIGINALLY THERE WAS A LIMERICK ON THERE, THAT STARTED SOMETHING, THERE ONCE WAS AN IMMIGRANT FROM NANTUCKET. I CAN'T DO THE REST. LET'S JUST SAY THE IMMIGRANT WAS AN ANCESTOR OF STEVE BANNONS. BUT MILLER'S BATTLE WITH ACOSTA GOT EVEN MORE HEATED WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE BILL'S ENGLISH LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS.
THIS WHOLE NOTION OF WELL, THEY HAVE TO LEARN ENGLISH BEFORE THEY GET TO THE UNITED STATES, ARE WE JUST GOING TO BRING IN PEOPLE FROM GREAT BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIAN.
JIM, I HAVE TO HONESTLY, I'M SHOCKED AT YOUR STATEMENT, THAT YOU THINK THAT ONLY PEOPLE FROM GREAT BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA WOULD KNOW ENGLISH.
Stephen: I GOT TO AGREE. I GOT TO AGREE WITH MILLER ON THAT ONE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT AUSTRALIANS ARE SPEAKING IS ACTUALLY ENGLISH. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAKE THEM, CRIKEY, G DAY, WALL ABY, SERIOUS, RIGHT? ONE OF THOSE IS A MAID UP WORD. AND MILLER'S OUT CONTINUED TO RAGE.
IT'S ACTUALLY, IT REVEALS YOUR COSMOPOLITAN BIAS TO A SHOCKING DEGREE THAT IN YOUR MIND-- NO, THIS IS AN AMAZING MOMENT, THIS IS AN AMAZING MOMENT, THAT YOU THINK ONLY PEOPLE FROM GREAT BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA WOULD SPEAK ENGLISH. IT'S SO INSULTING TO MILLIONS OF HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS WHO DO SPEAK ENGLISH FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
THAT'S NOT YOU WHAT SAID T SHOWS YOUR COSMOPOLITAN BIAS.
Stephen: YES, IN THIS MONTH'S ISSUE OF COSMOPOLITAN BIAS IT IS 69 WAYS TO DRIVE JIM ACOSTA WILD. (APPLAUSE) WILD. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IN THE END STEPHEN MILLER SUMMED UP THE TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICY SUCCINCTLY.
THERE ARE 7 BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THE QUESTION OF WHO GETS THAT GOLDEN TICKET NEEDS TO BE A DISCERTAINING PROCESS, THAT MAKES SENSE.
Stephen: LOOK, MILLER, IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PROVE ARE YOU NOT RACIST, DON'T COMPARE THIS TO A MOVIE WHERE A GUY ENSLAVED A BUNCH OF LITTLE ORANGE PEOPLE TO WORK IN HIS FACTORY, HASHTAG FREE OOMPA LOOMPAS. (APPLAUSE) MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP DID A BIG INTERVIEW IN "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" LAST WEEK. AND LAST WEEK, FRIDAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NOW THE JOURNAL PUBLISHED THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE INTERVIEW IN A RELATIVELY FLATTERING ARTICLE USING PHRASES LIKE MR. TRUMP HOPSCOTCHED ACROSS A VARIETY OF POLICY AND PERSONAL TOPICS. I'M SCEPTICAL, HOPSCOTCH IS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO COUNT TO TEN. IT DOESN'T--  (APPLAUSE) NOW "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," HERE'S THE THING. "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" DID NOT RELEASE THE FULL TRANSCRYPT OF THE INTERVIEW BUT LAST NIGHT'S "POLITICO" DID. AND IT'S REALLY LESS HOP AND MORE SCOTCH. NOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO FOOTAGE OF TRUMP SAYING THIS STUFF. BUT LUCKILY, WE'RE ABLE TO GET LIVE VIA SATELLITE SPEAKING EXCLUSIVELY IN ACTUAL ANSWERS, FROM THE INTERVIEW, PLEASE WELCOME CARTOON DONALD TRUMP. CARTOON MR. PRESIDENT. (APPLAUSE) HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
Stephen: GREAT, GREAT. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US, SIR. NOW I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS HOW IS THAT GOING?
SO, I DEAL WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY READ I HAVE UNBELIEVABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL THE FOREIGN LEADERS. THEY LIKE ME, I LIKE THEM, YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING. SO I CALL LIKE MAJOR, MAJOR COUNTRIES AND I WILL BE DEALING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THE PRESIDENT AND I WILL SAY HOW ARE YOU DOING.
Stephen: SO YOUR IDEA OF FOREIGN POLICY IS CALLING PEOPLE JUST TO SAY HI? CAN I SUGGEST YOUR NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE BE A LONELY GRANDMOTHER? OKAY, SO DO YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH FOREIGN LEADERS TOUCH ON ANY POLICY ISSUES?
YOU CALL PLACES LIKE MALAYSIA, INDONESIA AND YOU SAY, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE. AND IT'S PRETTY AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE. WOW, NORMALLY TO GET THAT INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO CHECK A SNAP EL CAP.
GOOD TIP.
NOW HAVE YOU MADE ANY PROGRESS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS?
WHEN I WAS WITH PRESIDENT XI WHO I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH, I SAID DO ME A FAVOR, WOULD YOU ALLOW CATTLE, PLEASE, TO COME IN. I WAS LAST NIGHT IN WEST VIRGINIA AND HI FARMERS COMING UP TO ME AND HUGGING ME AND KISSING ME BECAUSE OF THE CATTLE STUFF.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTO CATTLE STUFF. NOW YOU TWEETED ABOUT TRADE TALKS WITH BRITAIN. CAN YOU TELL US ANY MORE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON?
NO, BUT I CAN SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY INVOLVED WITH THE UK. YOU DON'T HEAR THE WORD BRITAIN ANY MORE, IT'S VERY INTERESTING. IT'S LIKE NOPE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: BUT YOU JUST SAID THE WORD BRITAIN.
NOPE.
Stephen: OKAY. ON ANOTHER POIRNGHTS YOU RECENTLY CALLED THE U.S. THE HIGH ES TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD BUT THE DATA SHOWS THAT IS CLEARLY DENMARK.
WE'RE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE NUMBER IS BUT I MEAN, IT USED TO BE WHEN WE TALKED DURING THE DEBATE, 2.5 TRILLION, RIGHT? WHEN THE MOST ELEGANT PERSON, RIGHT, I CALLED HIM MR. ELEGANT.
Stephen: WHAT DOES ANY OF THAT MEAN? AND AS-- AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ACTUALLY SAID, BUT WHO IS MR. ELEGANT?
I CALL HIM MR. ELEGANT. WELL, HOW DO YOU DO? IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IT IS I, MR. ELEGANT. BUT YOU CAN CALL ME LORD WINSTON ELEGANTE 3 ESQUIRE.
Stephen: AND WHO ARE YOU?
I'M THE PRESIDENT'S IMAGINARY FRIEND. IF YOU WILL EXCUSE MEE, I'M HOSTING A RAGING PARTY FOR THREE MILLION IMAGINARY VOTERS.
Stephen: CARTOON TRUMP AND MR. ELEGANT, EVERYBODY. STICK AROUND, WE HAVE DAVE CHAPPELLE,  . ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I'M PRETTY EXCITED, YOU KNOW WHY.
Jon: OH YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY ENTERTAINER YOU KNOW FROM HIS STANDUP AND OF COURSE FROM THAT SHOW OF HIS. HE'S NOW APPEARING THROUGHOUT THIS MONTH AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL, PLEASE WELCOME MR. DAVE CHAPPELLE. (APPLAUSE)
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ABSOLUTE PLEASURE.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I GOT LIKE-- .
Stephen: WELL, ARE YOU DOING RESIDENCY AT THE RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL FOR 14 DAYS IN AUGUST, RIGHT. YOU HAVE DONE YOUR FIRST SHOW.
ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S A DAY OR SO IT WILL BE 16.
Stephen: 16, YOU ADDED TWO MORE SHOWS.
WE ADDED TWO MORE SHOWS, SOLANGE IS JOINING US. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THIS IS WHAT THE SOUND IS LIKE AT RADIO CITY MUS ECK HALL BUT TIMES TEN BECAUSE ST 4,000 PEOPLE IN THERE.
NOW I'M NERVOUS AGAIN.
Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT.
I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE SHOWS. YOU KNOW, THE REASON I'M DOING THIS RESIDENCY IS, IT'S A PERSONAL THING. IT'S LIKE MY 30th ANNIVERSARY IN COMEDY. (APPLAUSE) AND AS YOU WILL KNOW, THIS IS A HECK OF A BUSINESS TO SURVIVE THAT LONG. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK I WOULD MAKE IT THAT FAR.
WELL, WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN.
ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST I THINK I WOULD DO MUCH BETTER THAN I DID, RIGHT?
WE THOUGHT WERE YOU GONE FOR AWHILE.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, OKAY, SO THE WHOLE TIME NOBODY SAW ME, IT WASN'T LIKE I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING. I EXITIONED, I WAS JUST NOT ON THE BIG STAGE. I WAS NOT UNDER THE HOT LIGHTS.
Stephen: OKAY, YOU WERE WORKING OUT IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING THIS IS, I DON'T KNOW TO SHOW-- THIS IS WHAT YOU-- THIS IS YOU NOW. IN CASE THIS DIDN'T GIVE IT AWAY.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
LOOK AT THAT.
Stephen: ARE YOU SO FAMOUS THAT YOU NEED TO BE YOUR OWN SECURITY DETAIL. WHY DID YOU-- WHAT LEAD YOU TO THE PUMPED, RIPPED, AND FULLY EXPLODED DAVE CHAPPELLE OVER HERE. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE BEEF.
NO, NO, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. IT WAS A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. STEP ONE IS I GOT MARRIED. AND YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE COMES WITH SNACKS AND NAPS.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE LUCKY, YEAH.
I'M A LUCKY GUY. AND THEN AFTER THAT IT WAS LIKE, WHEN I QUIT THE SHOW I WAS JUST LIKE, STRESSED ALL THE TIME. SO I JUST STARTED.
Stephen: STRESSED FROM HAVING QUIT THE SHOW? I THOUGHT THE SHOW WAS THE STRESS.
NO, NO, THE FEAR OF POVERTY IS A TREADMILL.
Stephen: I SEE.
YEAH, YEAH. THAT WILL GIVE YOU, THAT WILL KEEP YOU PUSHING, YOU KNOW, AND I WAS JUST PLAYING CLUBS AND STUFF. SO I JUST STARTED WORKING OUT TO ALLEVIATE THE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OF STRESS. AND THEN IT JUST TOOK A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SOMEONE SAID DAVE, YOU LOOK GOOD, DO I? AND AFTER THAT I WAS OFF TO THE RACES.
Stephen: WELL, SO 30th ANNIVERSARY OF DOING COMEDY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE STATE OF COMEDY NOW? I MEAN WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN CHANGE FROM AGE-- HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN IT STARTED?
I WAS 14.
Stephen: 14, YOUR MOM LET YOU GO GIG AT 14?
OH MY GOD, SHE SAID TAKE ME, IN THE BEGINNING.
Stephen: TO THE CLUBS.
YEAH, OH MY GOD, YEAH. AND THEN AFTER THE SHOW, I CAN'T REALLY SAY IT ON TELEVISION, SHE WOULD CRITIQUE MY ACT ON THE DRIVE HOME, WHICH IS A VERY LONG RIDE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR MOM SAY THOSE [BLEEP] JOKES NEED TO BE CUT AND-- .
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, BUT LET'S BE FAIR. WAS SHE RIGHT? DID THOSE [BLEEP] JOKES NEED TO BE CUT?
I THE [BLEEP] JOKES THAN ANYBODY. SHE WAS WRONG, I MEAN LISTEN, SHE WAS RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT IT WAS GROSS. IT WAS GROSS TO HEAR A TEENAGER TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING YET. BUT FROM HER PERSPECTIVE I IMAGINED, YOU KNOW, THIS IS LIKE 87Y D.C., CRACK EPIDEMIC, SO MANY BAD THINGS THAT I COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO, THAT SHE WAS LIKE WELL, IF HE IS DOING THIS, AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE HE IS. I AT LEAST I KNOW WHO HE IS AROUND.
Stephen: WAS THERE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL IN THE CLUBS, WERE PEOPLE THERE TEMPTING YOU.
IT WASN'T TEMPTING. IT WAS LIKE DUDES HAVING COCAINE NOSE BLEEDS AND ALL KINDS OF CRAZY STUFF LIKE THAT. SO I NEVER REALLY GOT FLOO THE DRUG STUFF. THE WORSE HABIT I PICKED UP WAS PROBABLY SMOKING CIGARETTES. DO.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL SMOKE.
JUST MOMENTS BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE.
Stephen: YOU SAID, YOU HOSTED SNL I THINK THE WEEKEND AFTER TRUMP WAS ELECTED.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IS THAT YOU TRUE, IS THE TIME RIGHT THERE, ABOUT THAT.
YEAH, THE SATURDAY AFTER THAT TUESDAY.
Stephen: AND YOU SAID SORT OF FOM USUALLY AT THE TIME, YOU SAID WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS GUY A CHANCE, WHICH I AGREE WITH, YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE GUY A CHANCE.
THIS IS TRUE.
Stephen: SO NOW WE ARE SEVEN, GETTING ON EIGHT MONTHS IN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CHANCES THAT HE HAS BEEN GIVEN. DO YOU STILL WANT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE OR HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM ALL THE CHANCES.
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANTED TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE THAT NIGHT.
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING-- I'M NOT CRITICIZING THAT YOU SAID THAT. I THINK IT IS A GOOD IMPULSE BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE GUY NOW?
YOU KNOW, LISTEN, MAN. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, I THINK WE'RE ALL GETTING AN EDUCATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY. I KNOW THAT I HEARD DISCUSSING ETHICS THIS MUCH, I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW ETHICS ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK AT THIS LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT AND HE IS PUTTING ALL THIS ON THE FOREFRONT.
Stephen: NOBODY REALLY TALKED ABOUT OXYGEN UNTIL SOMEONE'S GOT THEIR HANDS AROUND YOUR NECK. (APPLAUSE)
VERY TRUE. BUT, BUT, IF YOU REMEMBER, IN THE MONO LOG, THE IN THE EMMY MOM NOMINATED MONOLOGUE, THE IT IS WHAT THEY CALLED IT, THE UGLY EMMYS WHERE THEY SEND IT TO YOU IN THE MAIL IF YOU WIN.
Stephen: THE SCHEMMY'S.
BUT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONDAY LOG I CON TECTS ALLIZED IT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF WHITE AMERICANS HAVE FINALLY GOT TO SEE WHAT AN ELECTION NIGHT LOOKS LIKE FOR BRACK AMERICANS EVERY CYCLE.
Stephen: THE SHOCK.
YEAH, THE SHOCK OF IT WAS JUST LIKE COME ON, MAN, THIS IS LIKE, COME ON. THIS IS HOW TRACTION WORKS. I THINK IT SPEAKS TO HOW EFFECTIVE OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY WAS.
Stephen: HOW TRACTION WORKS?  WHAT DO YOU MEAN TRACTION.
DONALD TRUMP IS THE OTHER FOOT, GOOD FOOT, BAD FOOT.
Stephen: OH, I SEE.
I THINK WE'RE MAKING MOVES. I THINK HE WILL MAKE MORE REFORMS AND BETTER VOTING, WE WILL WORK IT OUT. HE IS A POLARIZING DUDE. HE'S LIKE A BAD DJ AT A GOOD PARTY. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE DAVE CHAPPELLE EVERYBODY. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WE'RE BACK WITH DAVE CHAPPELLE. YOU ORIGINALLY, WHEN WERE YOU SMALL CHILD YOU LIVED IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND.
YEAH, SILVER SPRING.
Stephen: BETHESDA, AND BUT THEN YOU MOVED TO YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO, RIGHT.
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP. I STAYED WITH MY MOTHER BUT I WOULD GO TO OHIO WITH HER IN THE SUMMER AND ON VACATIONS.
Stephen: YOU LIVE IN YELLOW SPRINGS NOW, DON'T YOU.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, YOU MADE-- YOU MADE A LITTLE BIT OF NEWS THIS PAST SPRING WHEN YOU WENT TO A TOWNHALL MEETING.
I DID DO THAT.
Stephen: WENT TO A TOWNHALL MEETING IN YELLOW SPRINGS, OHIO. (APPLAUSE) WHICH IS GREAT. THIS IS-- THAT IS REAL POLITICS.
THAT'S REAL POLITICS.
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH IT.
Stephen: THAT IS CARING ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY. WHAT WERE YOU THERE TO TALK ABOUT?
SMALL TOWNS, LIKE 3600 PEOPLE. THERE WAS A NEW YEAR'S EVE CELEBRATION THAT IS NOT REALLY SANCTIONED BY THE TOWN BUT IT IS HILARIOUS AND WE DO IT EVERY YEAR LIKE A LITTLE DISCO BALL DROPS IN FRONT OF THE BNG AND THE WHOLE TOWN COMES OUT. AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE [BLEEP] SAFE. AND THE POLICE CAME THROUGH, MAYBE TEN AFTER MIDNIGHT WHILE EVERYONE WAS IN THE STREETS, HUGGING AND KISSING. BY THE WAY I SHOULD TELL YOU, THIS IS LEAK IN THE MIDDLE OF TRUMP COUNTRY. BUT CULTURALLY THERE IS LIKE A BERNIE SANDERS IN THE TRUMP-- .
Stephen: 3600 IS A SMALL TOWN.
IT IS A SMALL TOWN.
Stephen: A UNIVERSITY TOWN.
IT USED TO BE. ANT YOK UNIVERSITY USED TO BE THERE, JOHN LITHGOW IS FROM THAT TOWN, COR ETA SCOLT KING, IT IS A SUB VERSIVE, WEIRD PLACE. AND.
Stephen: THE AUSTIN OF OHIO.
IN A WAY, VERY MUCH SO. WITH NONE OF THE MONEY AND FUN STUFF TO DO AT NIGHT.
Stephen: BUT THE NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY.
THIS IS LIKE THE BIG DAS, SO THE POLICE CAME THROUGH AND BUSTED IT UP. AND A GUY, APPARENTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. BUT SOME GUY GOT TASTED.
Stephen: FOR DOING WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THE POLICE TRYING TO GET OUT OF CAR AND HE HELD THE DOOR SHUT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEY TASED HIM AND THE CROWD WAS DRUNK AND THEN THE POLICE-- THE FEELING IN TOWN IS THE POLICE GENERALLY OVERREACTED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TO HOW THE TOWN FUNCTIONS. NOW I PERSONALLY LIKE THE ACTING CHIEF OF POLICE BUT THEY MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. IT WAS REALLY LIKE COME ON, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING. SO PEOPLE WENT AND VOICED THEIR OPINIONS. IT SEEMED STRANGE IF IT IS ON THE NEWS, BUT IN THE TOWN, IT IS JUST LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AM LIKE EVERYBODY KNOWS, IT'S LIKE THE SIMPSONS. YOU SEE THE SAME PEOPLE EVERY DAY AND I'M LIKE THE LOCAL CRUSTY THE CLOWN. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, 30 YEARS IN, 30 YEARS IN, OKAY SO 30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DOING COMEDY, ARE YOU DOING THESE NOW 16 DAYS. THERE ARE A LOT OF MUSICIANS.
COMEDIANS DRK DSH LIKE, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT ME AND CHRIS ROCK HAVE EVER OFFICIALLY HEADLINED TOGETHER. (APPLAUSE) AND.
Stephen: YOU GOT THE CHANCE, THE ROOTS, ERICA BADOU, SOLANGE AS YOU SAID WILL BE JOINING YOU. GOOD LUCK WITH THE RUN. I'M SURE IT WILL BE GREAT. I'M HOPING I GET IT A CHANCE TO SEE IT.
I WOULD LOVE IF YOU COME. YOU SHOULD JUST POP BY AND DO LIKE FIVE MINUTES. (APPLAUSE) IT WOULD BE GREAT.
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE IT.
WE DO A THING AT THE SHOW, AT MY CONCERTS WHERE NOBODY HAS A CELL PHONE SO ALL THIS, YOU KNOW, COMEDIAN WITCH-HUNT STUFF DOESN'T HAPPEN AT MY SHOW. HAVE I A WIDE MARGIN OF ERROR AND A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS GET SAID AND DONE. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ARTISTS TO REALLY FLEX THEIR MUSCLES WITHOUT THE FEAR OF THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE OVERLY SENSITIVE. AND WE ALL GOT TO KIND OF RECALIBRATE OUR EARS A LITTLE BIT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HEAR EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. AND I THINK COMEDY AND MUSIC IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I THINK I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, I THINK I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLING AND I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN BACK FOR AWHILE BUT TO SAY, I'M GLAD YOU AREK BA, BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU HOW BACK ARE YOU, CUZ I DON'T WANT TO FALL IN LOVE AND LOSE YOU AGAIN. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I MIGHT SAY OH, I LOVE DAVE CHAPPELL, I LOVE WATCHING HIS COMEDY AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GONE OUT FOR A PACK OF SMOKES AND ARE GONE FOR 15 YEARS. HOW BACK ARE YOU.
I'M AROUND. I NEVER REALLY GO AWAY. I POP UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND I HAVE BEEN REAL GRATEFUL BECAUSE WHEN I DO POP UP, PEOPLE STILL COME OUT AND WE HAVE A GREAT TIME. I GOT TO TELL YOU, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU MAN FOR YEARS. AND I REALLY DO THINK YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICES COMEDY HAS. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHY THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH, DAVE CHAPPELLE, AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL THROUGH AUGUST 24th. WE'LL BE BACK WITH JAMES VAN DEER BEEK. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST YOU KNOW FROM VARRITY BLUE, DON'T TRUST THE B IN APARTMENT 23 AND OF COURSE DAWSON'S CREEK. PLEASE WELCOME JAMES VAN DER BEEK. NICE TO MEET YOU, COME ON OUT. (APPLAUSE) HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: YOU ARE-- I WOULD DESCRIBE YOU AS DASHING RIGHT NOW.
WELL, THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU HAVE THE ENGLISH MUSTACHE, AND THE SUIT, ARE YOU THE NEXT JAMES BOND?
WELL, WHEN I GREW THE MUSTACHE I THOUGHT I WOULD LOOK LIKE PAUL NEWMAN BUT I KIND OF VEER A LITTLE MORE TOWARD ITALIAN PORN STAR IF I'M BEING HONEST.
Stephen: BOTH GOOD LUCKS. NEWMAN COULD HAVE BEEN ITALIAN PORN STAR, DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HIM. COHAVE DONE ANYTHING. NOW YOU STARTED OFF IN THEATER. WHERE DID YOU GROW UP.
CONNECTICUT, CHESTER, CONNECTICUT.
Stephen: DID YOU COME INTO THE CITY AND SAY I WANT TO DO THAT.
YEAH, I DID. I STARTED AUDITIONING WHEN I WAS 15. I WOULD TAKE THE METRO NORTH COMMUTER TRAIN.
Stephen: AND YOUR FAMILY WAS BEHIND IT.
MY DAD WAS BEHIND T MY BAD PLAYED BASEBALL, SO HE UNDERSTOOD CHASING A DREAM AND MY MOM WAS A DANCER SO SHE REALLY ALWAYS BELIEVED IN ME, THANK YOU, MOM. AND YEAH, SO THEY WOULD GET ME TO THE TRAIN STATION, I WOULD TAKE THAT IN AND I AUDITIONED FOR, THEY WOULD JUST SAY GO, GOOD LUCK.
MY MOM TOOK ME INITIALLY. SHE DIDN'T JUST THROW ME TO THE WOLVES. SHE TOOK ME N I GOT MY FIRST AGENT AND THEN THEY WOULD SEND ME IN FOR COMMERCIALS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, MY BATTING AVERAGE ON COMMERCIALS WAS ZERO.
I COULD NOT BOOK A COMMERCIAL TO SAVE MY LIFE.
Stephen: IF YOU CAN'T BOOK A COMMERCIAL HOW WILL YOU EVER WORK.
EXACTLY. BECAUSE THAT IS THE STEPPING STONE, RIGHT, LIKE I CAN'T GET A CORN POPS COMMERCIAL. I WANTED THAT CORN POPS COMMERCIAL.
Stephen: YOU COULDN'T GET THE CORN POPS COMMERCIAL. DO YOU REMEMBER, WHAT WAS THE COPY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY.
GOT TO HAVE MY POPS.
Stephen: CORN POPS. IT'S NOT-- IS IT TOO LATE.
I THINK IT'S TOO LATE. I THINK IT'S TOO LATE.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR BIG BREAK, OKAY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE AGENT'S ASSISTANT AT MY OFFICE VICTORIA SUBMITTED ME FOR AN EDWARD ALLBY PLAY.
Stephen: THAT SAY CLASSY START.
YEAH, AND I BOOKED IT. AND SO I GOT-- I STARTED GETTING GOOD REVIEWS FOR THIS PLAY.
Stephen: WAS HE STILL ALIVE AT THE TIME.
HE WAS ALIVE, HE DIRECTED IT.
Stephen: SO YOUR FIRST BIG BREAK IS ED WAR ALLBY, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLF. YOU GOT TO WORK WITH HIM, HOWL WERE YOU.
I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: DID HE GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE.
HE GAVE ME THE BEST ADVICE I'VE EVER GOTTEN. I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT REVIEWERS COMING TO THE PLAY. AND I WAS MILLING ABOUT ON STAGE ON A NIGHT I KNEW REVIEWERS WOULD BE THERE. HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP, HE SAID WHAT IS GOING ON. I SAID I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT I AM DOING IS GOOD. IF WHAT I THINK IS GOOD IS WHAT THE CRITICS THINK IS GOOD. AND HE PUT A VERY FRIENDLY HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND SAID RELAX, YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS. AND I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE WAY TO APPROACH EVERYTHING IN THIS BUSINESS, IS DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY OUTSIDE, JUST DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP EVERYBODY OUT.
Stephen: WELL, THE NEW THING ARE YOU DOING, IS YOU'RE PLAYING A GUY NAMED DIPLO.
YES.
Stephen: ON A VICELAND SHOW CALLED.
IT'S A VERY HUMBLE TITLE, WHAT WOULD DIPLO DO.
Stephen: OKAY. SO HERE IS DIPLO, THE CHARACTER, THIS IS NOT YOU, THIS IS THE ACTUAL DIPLO.
THAT IS THE GUY.
Stephen: WHO IS DIPLO AND WHAT DOES HE DO?
DIPLO, I EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE, THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS-- THE WORLD IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHO DIPLO IS AND PEOPLE WHO CANNOT FATHOM THAT ANYONE DOESN'T KNOW WHO DIPLO IS. SO TWO THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER GROUP, I SAY DIPLO IS THE FRANK SINATRA OF ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC. IS HE A DJ, WORLD FAMOUS DJ, PRODUCER. HE'S WORKED WITH EVERYBODY FROM I MEAN MADONNA, BEYONCE, JUSTIN BIEBER F YOU LISS TO POPULAR MUSK AT ALL YOU KNOW HIS SONGS.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW HIS FACE.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO I WAS ASKED TO DO A COMMERCIAL FOR HIS TOUR, FORTH MATTHEW'S BLOCK PARTY AND VICELAND CAME AND SAID WE THINK THIS IS A SERIES. AND I SAID IT'S NOT A SERIES. AND THEN I PLAYED DIPLO, I PLAY A FAKE VERSION OF DIPLO, AND BASICALLY WHAT I PITCHED TO THEM WAS PARABLES TO THE EYES OF A CLOWN AND KIND OF, LIKE E-- JESS-- JESSUS SUCKS AS LIFE.
Stephen: LET'S PUT THAT AT THE BASE OF THE STATUE OF LIB THE. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS CLIP.
WHICH CLIP.
Stephen: MEDICATION OR SOMETHING.
OH, MEDICATION SO BASICALLY WE-- DIPLO HAS NO PROBLEM WITH US MAKING FUN OF HIM. SO WE JUST WENT WILD. SO THIS IS OUR IMAGINED VERSION OF WHAT DIPLO WOULD MEDITATE ABOUT IF HE MEDITATED.
AND YOU WROTE IT.
YEAH, I WROTE IT.
Stephen: OKAY, JIM.
BEUDA SAID WE SHOULD HAVE NO MATERIAL POSSESSIONS THAN WHY WAS HE SO FAT, WHY ARE MONKS ALWAYS ASKING FOR MONEY. IF JESUS WAS ON TWITTER HE WOULD HAVE MORE FOLLOWERS THAN BEUD. BEUD TALKED WITH A TWEET, SUPERSHORT AND CONFUSING BUT-- I BET JESUS HAD MORE HATEDDERS THAN BEUDER, AND MORE FOLLOWERS. [BLEEP] HATERS ARE-- WAIT, WAIT-- THERE WE GO. -- WAS KIND OF CORNY, I BET THEY NEVER GOT INTO ANY PARTIES, I BET WHEN JUS ES CULLED PUP, THEY ARE LIKE WHO DO HOW MANY YOU GOT, 12, AND ONE PROSTITUTE.

NOW, IT'S FUNNY BUT AT THE TIME, BOTH OF THOSE GENTLEMEN, IT WAS TERRIFYING. YOU DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I WENT TO A BENI HANA ONCE WITH JOHN BELUSHI.
Stephen: THE JAPANESE STEAK HOUSE.
AND HE DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO BE THE COOK AND HE WOULD FULL ON SAMURAI.
Stephen: HOW DID THAT TURN OUT.
IT WAS MESSY. (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS MESSY.
Stephen: WELL, NOW I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE GOT A CHARITABLE ENDEAVOR AND YOU ARE ACTUALLY, HOWEVER MUCH HAVOC YOU WRECKED WHEN WERE YOU YOUNGER YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING NICE TO HELP PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. TELL ABOUT THE WORK YOU ARE DOING WITH THE VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS.
YEAH, I'VE ALWAYS PAID ATTENTION TO THE VETS. AND THE VETS SITUATION AND MY FATHER DIED IN ACTIVE DUTY WHEN I WAS ABOUT 20 MONTHS OLD. HE WAS A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT THEN BUT NOW IT'S CALLED THE GOLD STAR FAMILY OR GOLD STAR KID. BUT I GREW UP ALWAYS WONDERING WHAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PROUD OF ME. AND HAD SOME BUDDIES IN VIETNAM WAR AND THEY CAME BACK SHATTERED OR DIDN'T COME BACK. AND I HAVE NTSZED IN MY TRAVELS AND TOURING THAT BESIDES THE BIG NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THERE ARE SOME SMALL COUNTEE, SMALL TOWN VETS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY IN THE TRENCHES AND REALLY DOING WONDERFUL WORK. AND SO I HAVE STARTED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED VETS AID. AND I WANT TO HELP AND TAKE IT UP A NOTCH.
Stephen: ARE YOU DOING A CONCERT IN SUPPORT OF THIS, AREN'T SNU.
YES, ON SEPTEMBER 20th WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THE FAIRFAX VIRGINIA AT A PLACE CALLED THE EAGLES BANK ARENA. NOW IT IS NOT THE EAGLES BANK BUT IT'S JUST THE NAME OF IT OF THE PLACE.
Stephen: YOU GUYS COULD SUE, PROBABLY.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU, WHO ELSE IS GOING TO BE IN THE CONCERT.
KEITH URBAN, THE ZACK BROWN BAND, GARY CLARK SR AND THAT IS-- GOOD LIST OF GUITAR PLAYS AND GUESS WHAT, THEY'RE GOING TO LET ME PLAY TOO. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PLAY FOR US RIGHT NOW AS WE GO OUT TO COMMERCIAL. WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOU PLAY.
