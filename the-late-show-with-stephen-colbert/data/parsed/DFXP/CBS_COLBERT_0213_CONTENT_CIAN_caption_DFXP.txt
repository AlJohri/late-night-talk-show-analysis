Stephen: HEY! HOW  Captioning sponsored by CBS  ARE YOU?
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. GOOD TO SEE YOU, JON. NICE TO SEE YOU.  ( CHEERS ) THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. NICE. WHAT LOVELY PEOPLE HERE. AMAZING. PLEASE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." UP THERE, DOWN HERE, ALL AROUND. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THESE PEOPLE ARE ALIVE ON THIS PLANET. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND I HOPE EVERYONE HERE AND OUT THERE IS WITH A LOVED ONE TONIGHT. I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS-- ANGELINA AND BRAD PITT ARE GETTING A DIVORCE. THAT'S RIGHT, NO MORE BRANGELINA. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE "JELINA" AND "BRAN." HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THE DIVORCE PAPERS WERE FILED YESTERDAY IN LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT, CITING "IRRECONCILABLE ATTRACTIVENESS." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. WE CAN SPECULATE. WE'RE NOT SURE. IN THE EARLY HOURS AFTER SOMETHING THIS CATACLYSMIC, IT IS THE FOG OF WAR. BUT RUMORS ARE SWIRLING THAT BRAD HAD AN AFFAIR WITH FRENCH ACTRESS MARION COTILLARD. YEAH OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO WE COULD SOON BE LOOKING AT MARIAD BROTILLITT. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF BICKERING COUPLES, ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR THIS MONDAY'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE IF THOSE ARE SCREAMS OF EXCITEMENT OR PANIC. IMENT TO LET YOU KNOW, "THE LATE SHOW"" WILL BE COMING TO YOU LIVE ON MONDAY RIGHT AFTER THE CAN BEES. JOIN US, WON'T YOU.  ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE JUST LIKE THE DEBATES, NOTHING ABOUT MY SHOW WILL BE FACT CHECKED. SO PLEASE JOIN ME WITH MY GUEST, QUEEN ELIZABETH II! IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. I THINK IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY, JUST YESTERDAY, MODERATOR LESTER HOLT ANNOUNCED THE TOPICS:  WHICH ARE ALSO THE LEAST-POPULAR SCENTS AT YANKEE CANDLE. I HAVE TO SAY, THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY GENERAL TOPICS. LEAVE SOMETHING FOR THE MODERATORS COMING AFTER YOU, LESTER! IT'S LIKE YOU JUST LICKED EVERY BABY CARROT ON THE DEBATE TOPIC VEGETABLE TRAY. BY THE WAY, "DEBATE TOPIC VEGETABLE TRAY, "ALSO ANOTHER VERY UNPOPULAR YANKEE CANDLE SCENT. TRUMP HAS BEEN PREPARING FOR THE DEBATE BY POSTING AN ONLINE SURVEY ASKING VOTERS TO WEIGH IN ON THE ALL-IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FROM WHAT ISSUES TRUMP SHOULD FOCUS ON TO WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD SAY CROOKED HILLARY ON THE DEBATE STAGE. THAT'S LEADERSHIP. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CORE PRINCIPLES THAT KEFINE WHO I AM. MAO NOW, WHAT ARE THEY AGAIN? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ACCORDING TO TRUMP, THE REASON HE'S PREPPING VIA ONLINE SURVEY IS BECAUSE, "HE'S ONLY GOING ON STAGE TO BE YOUR VOICE." I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE, BECAUSE TRUMP WAS MY VOICE, HE WOULD BE LETTING OUT A CONSTANT HORRIFIED SCREAM. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S I REASON, I BELIEVE, WE DO NOT RUN DEMOCRACY VIA BUZZFEED POLL. I WANT A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO PUTS MORE THOUGHT INTO HIS POLICY, MORE THOUGHT THAN WHAT I PUT INTO FINDING OUT WHICH "GILMORE GIRLS" CHARACTER I AM. P.S.-- I'M A TOTAL LORELAI. ( APPLAUSE ) LORELAI FANS. LORELAI FANS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO DIRECTLY INFLUENCE A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. HE'S READING THIS ONLINE POLL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE SHOULD SAY ON STAGE. HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU, THE COLBERT NATION, TO DO. GO TO www.gop.com/debate-prep-survey, AND FILL OUT THE SURVEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WHEN, ON ALMOST EVERY QUESTION, IT GIVES YOU THE OPTION, "OTHER, PLEASE SPECIFY," AND WHENEVER YOU SEE THE WORDS, "OTHER, PLEASE SPECIFY," PUT IN SOMETHING WE'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR TRUMP SAY, LIKE, "I'M RELEASING MY TAXES." OR "I'M NOT REALLY A BILLIONAIRE." OR "PUTIN'S BUTT TASTES LIKE COTTON CANDY." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH! OH! OH!
Stephen: YEAH. ♪ WE GOT A WINNER ♪ NOW, A POLL CAME OUT LAST WEEK THAT FOUND HILLARY "HAS THE SUPPORT OF JUST 31% OF LIKELY VOTERS UNDER 35," WITH THE REMAINING 69% OF MILLENNIALS SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN BERNIE SANDERS AND HARAMBE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I DO KNOW OF ONE MILLENNIAL WHO'S VOTING FOR HILLARY, FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH. HE QUALIFIES AS A MILLENNIAL BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE'S A THOUSAND YEARS OLD. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST KIDDING. HE'S A VIGOROUS 92, AND TWO YEARS AGO, HE CELEBRATED HIS 90th BIRTHDAY BY SKYDIVING AND TWEETING ABOUT IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO TO THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHOSE GRANDPA STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE AN iPHONE, HAVE HIM TRY IT IN MIDAIR. HERE'S HOW WE KNOW HOW HE'S VOTING. YESTERDAY, FORMER MARYLAND OFFICIAL AND ROBERT KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER, KATHLEEN KENNEDY TOWNSEND, POSTED THIS PICTURE OF HER WITH H.W. ON FACEBOOK, SAYING, "THE PRESIDENT TOLD ME HE'S VOTING FOR HILLARY!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. SO, JEB BUSH, THERE GOES YOUR ONE WRITE-IN VOTE. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TO RECAP: A BUSH TOLD A KENNEDY HE'S VOTING FOR A CLINTON. IF YOU'RE PLAYING ALONG AT HOME, THAT'S "ILLUMINATI BINGO." ( LAUGHTER ) SAY HELLO TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE OLD DAYS. OLD HOME WEEK. HEY! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY FEELING OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A ROUGH COUPLE OF DAYS HERE IN NEW YORK AND AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP US SAFE. THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHTFUL COMMENTARY OUT THERE. THEN THERE'S THIS NEXT THING. LAST NIGHT, TRUMP'S OLDEST SON AND GUY WHO PROMISES YOU A GREAT DEAL ON A 2003 SUZUKI SIDEKICK. DONALD TRUMP JR., TWEETED OUT THIS GRAPHIC: IT'S A POWERFUL METAPHOR, REALLY MAKES ME RECONSIDER MY STANCE ON EATING SYRIAN REFUGEES. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, NOW, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS SKITTLES MEME. FIRST OFF, IT READS, "IF I HAD A BOWL OF SKITTLES AND I TOLD YOU JUST THREE WOULD KILL YOU--" PERIOD. OKAY, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) AS IN, "IF YOU THINK THAT'S A COMPLETE SENTENCE, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR HEAD UP YOUR." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ALSO--  ( CHEERS ) PERIOD! PERIOD! ALSO, TURNS OUT THE MATH IS WRONG. HE'S SAYING THREE OUT OF A LITTLE BOWL OF REFUGEES WOULD KILL YOU, BUT LAST WEEK THE CONSERVATIVE CATO INSTITUTE DID THE MATH AND FOUND THE ODDS OF AN AMERICAN BEING KILLED BY A REFUGEE IN A TERROR ATTACK IS ONE IN 3.64 BILLION. SO THAT'S NOT THREE POISONED SKITTLES IN A BOWL. THAT'S THREE POISONED SKITTLES IN ONE AND A HALF OLYMPIC-SIZED SWIMMING POOLS OF SKITTLES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, YES, FOR THE RECORD, I WOULD EAT ALL OF THEM. BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET STARTED YOU'RE LIKE-- TWO MORE, TWO MORE. I'LL JUST HAVE TWO MORE. THIS MEME ISN'T EVEN ORIGINAL. IT'S A RIPOFF OF A SIMILAR IDEA POSTED BY A FEMINIST GROUP, THOUGH IN THE ORIGINAL ANALOGY, THEY USED M&Ms. OF COURSE, THE TRUMP FAMILY PREFERS SKITTLES BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BROWN ONES. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS GRAPHIC:  IT COMPARES REFUGEES FLEEING THEIR WAR-TORN COUNTRY TO PIECES OF SUGAR. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DREAM OF LIVING IN A COUNTRY WHERE FOOD IS SO PLENTIFUL, WE WASTE OUR CANDY ON METAPHORS. SO LET ME EXPLAIN TO DONALD TRUMP JR. WHY HE'S WRONG IN LANGUAGE HE CAN UNDERSTAND. LISTEN UP, AIRHEAD. REDUCING COMPLEX POLITICAL PROBLEMS TO CANDY IS NUTRAGEOUS. ANYONE WITH AN OUNCE OF SMARTIES IS SNICKERING AT YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE ALIENATING A LOT OF PEEPS. I MEAN, WHERE DOES IT END? DO WE KEEP OUT SWEDISH FISHERMAN OR GAY COUPLES LIKE MIKE AND IKE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SKOR A CHEAP POLITICAL PAYDAY WITH THIS WHOPPER, DUM DUM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE'S MORE. THERE'S MORE. SO GO BACK TO 5th AVENUE, AND FUDGE YOURSELF.

Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! IN A LITTLE BIT, I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY LIKES HER. EVERYBODY LIKES THIS WOMAN, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS MOST FAMOUS FOR TELLING PEOPLE TO EAT THEIR VEGETABLES. IT'S INCREDIBLE. FOR EIGHT YEARS AT HOME AND ABROAD, SHE HAS PROVIDED A VOICE FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTED TO TELL THE REST OF THE WORLD "SEE? WE'RE NOT ALL CRAZY." THE FIRST LADY IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT "LET GIRLS LEARN," HER PROGRAM TO PROMOTE EDUCATION FOR YOUNG WOMEN ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE. NOW, THIS MIGHT COME AS A SHOCK TO A LOT OF YOU, BUT I AM NOT A GIRL. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT A LOT OF IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE-- MY DAUGHTER, MY WIFE, MY MOTHER-- THEY WERE ALL ONCE GIRLS. AND I CAN TELL YOU, I'M GLAD THEY HAD ACCESS TO EDUCATION. OF COURSE, I DID GO TO SCHOOL, AND I LEARNED A LOT WHILE GROWING UP. BUT THERE ARE TIMES THAT I MISS THE INNOCENCE OF BEING A CHILD.

NO. SHE'S MINE.
Stephen: CAN I VISIT?
MAYBE.
Stephen: HEY, MICHELLE? DO YOU THINK FRUITS AND VEGETABLES HAVE FEELINGS?
GOSH, I HOPE NOT. I EAT WAY TOO MANY OF THEM.
Stephen: HEY, CAN I HAVE ONE OF YOUR BABY CARROTS?
YEAH, THEY'RE GREAT. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU EAT TOO MANY CARROTS YOU TURN ORANGE?
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH. AND IF YOU TURN REALLY ORANGE, YOU HAVE TO START SAYING CRAZY THINGS AND RUN FOR PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
HEY, STEPHEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK ADULTS DO ALL DAY WHILE WE'RE AT SCHOOL?
Stephen: OH, THEY GO TO WORK.

Stephen: I THINK THEY DRINK WINE AND WATCH R-RATED MOVIES.
HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?
Stephen: OH, I THINK I WANT TO GO TO HARVARD AND BE A LAWYER AND A WRITER AND AN ADVOCATE FOR NUTRITION AND MILITARY FAMILIES AND GIRLS' EDUCATION. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I WANT TO BE JOE BIDEN. OR A PIRATE.

Stephen: HEY, OW, OW! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHEN I GROW UP I'M GOING TO BE PRESIDENT SO I'LL HAVE THE SECRET SERVICE STOPE YOU FROM DOING THAT TO ME. HEY, MICHELLE, WHY DO WE HAVE TO TAKE THE PRESIDENTIAL PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST? WHY ASK HE CARE HOW MANY SIT-UPS I CAN DO?
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE'S SUPER COMPETITIVE.
I HEARD SOME TEACHERS HAVE THEIR OWN KIDS AT HOME.
REALLY?
YEAH.
HOW DO THEY GET THEM?
Stephen: I HEAR THEY PICK THE ONES THEY LIKE BEST FROM LAST YEAR'S CLASS.
Stephen: HEY, MICHELLE, DO YOU KNOW WHERE BABIES COME FROM?
YOU SHOULD ASK A GROWN-UP.
Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE THEY GET REALLY FLUFTURED WHEN YOU ASK AND THEY START STUTTERING. THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, WELL..." IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD. YOU GOTTA SEE IT.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO DO THAT.
HEY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: YEAH.
IF YOU GOT ONE WISH WHAT WOULD IT BE?
Stephen: I'M NOT TELLING UNLESS YOU TELL.
WELL, I'M NOT TELLING UNLESS YOU TELL.
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S COUNT TO THREE AND SAY THEM AT THE SAME TIME.
OKAY. ONE, TWO, THREE! IMPROVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION FOR THE 62 MILLION GIRLS WORLDWIDE WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

YOU, TOO. YOU GUYS ARE SO SWEET! THANK YOU, GUYS.
Stephen: WELL, I HAVE KNOWN A FEW PEOPLE. I HAVE KNOWN A FEW PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND NOT ALL OF THEM GET THAT KIND OF RECEPTION WHEN THEY GO SOMEPLACE. SO YOU'RE ALMOST DONE WITH THE EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
YES. ALMOST-- WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF THERE!
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT FEEL? IS IT AT ALL BITTERSWEET?
YEAH.
Stephen: OR YOU'RE LIKE, "WHERE'S THE EXIT?"
IT'S DEFINITELY BITTERSWEET. I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS, LIKE, THE LAST, YOU KNOW. AND I FIND MYSELF CHOKING UP BECAUSE WE HAVE RAISED OUR KIDS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE'VE HAD SO MANY AMAZING EXPERIENCES. WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL STAFF. WE LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE US AND CARE ABOUT US. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO BE WALKING AWAY FROM ALL THAT AND IT'S JUST BEEN AN HONOR.
Stephen: HAVE YOU HAD TO SAY TO THE KIDS, "BE PREPARED. THE NEXT HOUSE IS NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THIS."
I ACTUALLY MADE MY KIDS START PACKING THEIR ROOMS ALREADY. IT'S LIKE, GET THIS DONE. WELL, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: YOU DON'T UPON TO KEEP IT TO THE LAST MINUTE.
MY THING SIF YOU DON'T PACK IT, I'M THROWING IT OUT. THAT'S WHAT I DO.
Stephen: THEN IT ENDS UP ON E-BAY.
IT'S ON E-BAY, I SELL IT. YOU KNOW.
Stephen: WELL, THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK YOU IS WHAT IS BEYONCE REALLY LIKE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SHE'S-- SHE'S SO TALENTED THAT I HAVE TROUBLE LOOKING AT HER WITHOUT MY RETINAS BURNING OUT. YOU GUYS ACTUALLY HANG OUT LIKE FRIENDS, RIGHT?
YOU SHOULDN'T LOOK HER IN THE EYE. SHE'S A SPECIAL PERSON.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE BEYONCE'S BEYONCE? SHE LOOKS UP TO YOU.
SHE'S A SWEETHEART. SHE'S SMART. SHE'S CREATIVE. SHE'S A GREAT MOTHER. SHE LOVES HER FAMILY. SHE'SA-- YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST A LOW-KEY LADY. SO WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON IN THAT WAY. EXCEPT I CAN'T SING. I CAN'T DANCE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU CAN DANCE. I'VE SEEN YOU DANCE.
NOT LIKE BEYONCE.
Stephen: WELL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS "ESSENCE" MAGAZINE. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL-- ( APPLAUSE ) TALKING ABOUT YOUR EIGHT YEARS IN THERE. BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS PICTURE, WHICH WHEN IT WAS RELEASED, BURNED THE INTERNET TO GROUND, RIGHT THERE. ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT--
THAT'S ME AND MY BOO.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, WE LIKED YOU ALREADY. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO RELEASE THIS PHOTOGRAPH. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS SAYING TO EACH OTHER THERE? HOW DID THIS MOMENT COME ABOUT?
YOU KNOW, BARACK IS HORRIBLE IN PHOTO SHOOTS, AND I HATE DOING PHOTO SHOOTS WITH HIM, SO I'M SURE RIGHT THERE I WAS SAYING, "WOULD YOU JUST BE PATIENT AND STOP. DON'T RUSH THE PHOTOGRAPHER." HE'S LIKE, "I THINK WE GOT THE SHOT. I CAN GO, CAN I GO?" "NO, YOU CAN'T GO." THAT WAS EXACTLY-- BARACK HAS TWO SMILES FOR A PHOTO. IT'S LIKE THIS SMILE OR THIS SMILE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE JUST SORT OF LIKE, "I THINK WE'RE DONE. WE HAVE IT." AND IT'S LIKE, "NO, WE DIDN'T. THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS THEY HAVE BEEN SETTING UP FOR HOURS." HE COMESES IN AND SAYS, "I THINK I CAN GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES." I WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM TO CHILL OUT AND RELAX, SO THEY CAUGHT THAT DISCUSSION. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT THERE?
CHILL OUT. CHILL OUT.
Stephen: "PLEASE, PLEASE, JUST ONE MORE PHOTOGRAPH."
AND HE'S LIKE, "REALLY?"
Stephen: WHO IS IT HARD TORE GET TO STAND FOR A PHOTOGRAPH, YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR CHILDREN?
OH, MY HUSBAND, WITHOUT A DOUBT. WELL-- YEAH, HIM. HE'S TOUGH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY HIM OR BO AND SONNY.
Stephen: WELL?
HIM. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, THAT SMILE, THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD IMPRESSION OF YOUR HUSBAND. DO YOU DO AN IMPRESSION OF YOUR HUSBAND?
WE ALL THREE OF US HAVE GOOD IMPRESSIONS OF BARACK.
Stephen: WOULD YOU MIND SHARING A LITTLE BIT?
IT'S USUALLYT DINNER TABLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW-- MALIA WILL START IT BECAUSE SHE USUALLY ASKS SERIOUS QUESTION. "DAD, TELL US ABOUT YOUR KAY. AND WHAT ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION ON GLOBAL WARMING?" AND SASHA AND I ARE LIKE, "NO, DON'T GET HIM STARTED." AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, I'M GLAD-- I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. LET ME JUST-- LET ME JUST ANSWER THAT IN THREE POINTS. ONE--" AND THEN ONE-"A," AND ONE-"A" AND "B." AND SASHA AND ARE LIKE OH!
Stephen: YOU'RE LIKE, PROFESSOR, CAN I AUDIT THIS LECTURE?
BECAUSE SASHA AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR FAVORITE SONG ON THE "LEMONADE" ALBUM. HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO THERE IS THERE I HEARD YOU SAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THAT HE LEAVES THE JOB AT THE DOOR WHEN HE COMES INTO THE RESIDENTIAL PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE DOES.
Stephen: IS THAT REALLY TRUE? I CAN'T LEAVE MY JOB AT THE DOOR. HOW DOES HE LEAVE THAT AT THE DOOR?
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST OUR TIME TOGETHER. WHEN HE FIRST WALKS IN, WE HAVE DINNER. IT'S USUALLY DINNER TIME. SO THAT'S THE TIME WHEN UNLESS MALIA ASKS HIM ABOUT HIS WORK, WHICH WE TRY NOT TO HAVE HER DO, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KIDS, YOU KNOW. "HOW WERE YOUR DAYS? WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S THE LATEST GOSSIP?" HE'S REALLY INTO GOSSIP, SO YOU CAN GET HIM-- BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A LIFE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NO, BUT HE'S GOT THE N.S.A., AND HE CAN FIND OUT WHAT ANY OF US ARE THINKING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO BEING THE FIRST LADY, BEING THE FIRST LADY, OBVIOUSLY, IS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S A GREAT HONOR AT THE SAME TIME. DO YOU HAVE ANY FIRST LADY-- WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON THE LAST EIGHT YEARS-- DO YOU HAVE ANY FIRST LADY FAUX PASS, LIKE "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MOMENT?"
SO MANY OF THEM. THEY USUALLY INVOLVE PRONOUNCING SOMEBODY'S NAME WRONG. I'M SO HORRIBLE.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU GO ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
OH, GOD, NAMES ARE SO HARD. AND I PRACTICE AND I TRY TO GET-- AND THEN I GET UP THERE AND I MESS IT UP. EVEN NAMES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. I MEAN, KIDS THESE DAYS, THEIR NAMES. I MEAN-- I CAN TELL YOU, I THINK I'VE GOT IT RIGHT. I'M LOOKING AT THE NAME CARD, AND IT'S LIKE, NO, IT'S NOT TERRY, IT'S TER-REE. I'M USUALLY JUST LIKE, "HEY, SWEETIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING?" I HAVE GIVEN UP ON THAT.
Stephen: IT'S COLBERT, YOU DON'T PRONOUNCE THE "T."
AND IT'S NOT STEVE. IT'S STEPHEN.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING.
I REMEMBER THAT, I REMEMBER.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.
BECAUSE YOU'RE PRETTY TOUCHY ABOUT THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WAS THERE-- CAN YOU HAVE AN "OH, MY GOD MOMENT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. THIS FUN THING I GOT TO DO."
SO MANY. SLEEPOVER AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
Stephen: WHAT?
YEAH, WHAT?
Stephen: DID YOU AND THE QUEEN PAINT EACH OTHER'S TOENAILS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
NO, THEY HOSTED US FOR THE STATE DINNER. WHEN YOU'RE THE GUEST COUNTRY YOU STAY AT THE PALACE. I REMEMBER ORDERING FRENCH FRIES AT THE PALACE. THEY WERE GOOD.
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS HAVE FRENCH FRIES AT THE WHITE HOUSE?
YES, YOU HAVEEG AT THE WHITE HOUSE. DO YOU THINK --
MISS ORGANIC VEGETABLES.
HEY, HEY, NOT EVERY DAY. BUT YOU KNOW. I LOVE FRENCH FRIES. I AM A BIG FRENCH FRY FANATIC. THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO EAT VEGETABLES BECAUSE --
JUST TO BALANCE IT OUT.
TO BALANCE IT OUT, FOR SURE. IT WOULD GET UGLY.
Stephen: YOU SAID TO OPRAH-- MY GOOD FRIEND OPRAH. PLEASE SAY HI.
I WILL.
Stephen: THAT YOUR HUSBAND-- I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT-- YOU CALLED HIM SCITUATE SWAGGA-LICIOUS.
I DID.
Stephen: HOW IS SWAGGA-LICIOUSNESS ACHIEVED?
IT'S A PERSON THAT HAS A LOT OF SWAG. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SWAG IS, STEVE, YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I THINK-- I THINK IT'S TIME TO GO TO A COMMERCIAL. I'LL WORK ON MY SWAG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. THE CAMPAIGN IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT THE TWO CANDIDATES OUT THERE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDAS AND THEIR SPOUSES HAVE TO SORT OF GO ALONG WITH WHATEVER THIS PERSON IS DOING. DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO THERE AND STAND BY THE PERSON RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
UH, NO, NOT REALLY.
Stephen: NO?
NO, BECAUSE IF-- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, IN IT. IF YOU'RE IN IT, AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE, YOU SHOULD HAVE AGREED BEFORE THEY RAN, YOU KNOW. BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH WHAT BARACK WAS SAYING, I WOULD NOT SUPPORT HIS RUN. SO I STAND THERE PROUDLY, AND I HOPE THEY ARE, TOO, STANDING WITH THEIR SPOUSES PROUDLY. SO NO SYMPATHY.
Stephen: BUT THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. FOR INSTANCE, MELANIA TRUMP WAS CRITICIZED FOR USING WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A PORTION OF YOUR SPEECH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY, BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND HER CREATING THINGS. AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME SYMPATHY FOR HER. COW UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MIGHT BE SYMPATHETIC FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? YEAH, THAT WAS TOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON. LET'S MOVE ON. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT "LET GIRLS LEARN." SO 62 MILLION YOUNG WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION. WHAT IS "LET GIRLS LEARN" DOING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THAT SITUATION? BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.
IT'S HUGE. PART OF IT IS BRINGING AWARENESS TO THE ISSUE. NOT JUST INTERNATIONALLY, BUT HERE AT HOME AS WELL. AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN A YEAR AND A HALF TO GALVANIZE RESOURCES, EXPERTISE. UNITED STATES HAS INVESTED MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCE. WE'VE PARTNERED WITH JAPAN AND THE U.K. TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN GIRLS' EDUCATION. THE THE THE WORLD BANK GROUP IS INVESTING OVER $1 BILLION IN GIRLS' EDUCATION.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SOME OF THESE-- SOME OF THE REASONS-- I ASSUME-- AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG-- I ASSUME SOME OF THE REASONS ARE THERE ARE SORT OF CULTURAL OBSTACLES TO GIRLS BEING VALUED AS EDUCATED MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THOSE CULTURAL OBSTACLES, RATHER THAN JUST PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY, HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN COUNTRIES THAT MAY NOT ORDINARILY OFFER THEM?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO BE ON THE GROUND. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHANGE CULTURE IF YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THE CULTURE. AND THE PEACE CORPS HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. WE HAVE PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS WORKING ON "LET GIRLS LEARN" INITIATIVES ON THE GROUND, IN A COMMUNITY, IN A VILLAGE, FOR UP TO TO TO YEARS, REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE CULTURAL ISSUES, DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR NOT JUST THE GIRLS BUT THEIR PARENTS. SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE EACH COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE. THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION TO THAT. THIS PROBLEM, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO COMPLICATED-- EVERY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT. SO AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT IS CRITICAL. BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS OUT THERE DOING THE HARD WORK ON THE GROUND.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND, RIGHT HERE IN THE AUDIENCE-- AND, JIM, IF WE COULD GET A SHOT OF THIS-- THERE ARE SOME YOUNG LADIES IN THE FRONT ROW HERE.
YES.
Stephen: WHO ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS PROGRAM FROM MALAWI, JORDAN. PAKISTAN. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
THEY-- THEY SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY. THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES AT AN EVENT THAT YOU HELPED TO HOST YESTERDAY HERE.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL EVENT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
ON BROADWAY. TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS. WE HELD IT FOR THE SPOUSES OF THE WORLD LEADERS OF THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY. IT WAS A MIXTURE OF STORIES AND, YOU KNOW, INSPIRATION FROM THESE GIRLS, AND EMPOWERING MUSIC FROM SOME OF THE TOP BROADWAY STARS. AND WE HAD THIS HAND SUSPECT YOUNG MAN HERE HELPING US KEEP IT ALL TOGETHER. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT, NOT JUST YESTERDAY, BUT ON EVERYTHING YOU DO ON ISSUES THAT YOU DON'T JUST SPEAK OUT ON. YOU DON'T JUST MAKE US LAUGH. BUT YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE ISSUES, AND YOU CARE ABOUT THEM. AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT WAS AN HONOR TO BE INVITED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY, THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY THAT CNN IS GOING TO HAVE ON CALLED:  "WE WILL RISE" A CNN FILM THAT FOLLOWED YOU ON A TRIP TO LIBERIA.
MARAKESH AND MADRID.
Stephen: AND WE HAVE A CAN CLIP RIGHT HERE. JIM.
YOU'RE IMPORTANT IN YOUR OWN RIGHT. PEOPLE WANT AND NEED TO VALUE YOU BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE OF YOUR STORY, BECAUSE OF YOUR CHALLENGES. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU UNIQUE. YOU KNOW? YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT. YOU WANT TO BE SPECIAL. THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES-- AND THIS IS WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT-- THAT MADE ME SMARTER. THAT MADE ME BETTER, RIGHT? BECAUSE I COULD OVERCOME THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE THE SAME POSITION NEVER HAD TO OVERCOME.
YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S ALWAYS AN HONOR TO TALK TO YOU. AND I HOPE WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN ONCE YOU LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND WILL NOT STOP TRYING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN THE WORLD.

I KNOW I JUST TOLD MYSELF THEY DON'T. LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU JUST JUST SAY IT DOESN'T EXIST AND IT DOESN'T.
Stephen: ONE MILE IN THE OCEAN.
25 MILES BIKING AND A 10"K" RUN, THAT'S 6.2 MILES.
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE IT THE STICK-TO-IVE-NESS TO DO THAT. HAD YOU DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?
I HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE IT THAT BEFORE. IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS ON TRACK AND FIELD BUT MAINLY TO SPEND TIME WITH MY BEST FRIEND AND I DID THE ONE THING THAT DIDN'T REQUIRE RUNNING. I DID SHOT PUT.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, DID YOU SHOT PUT?
I DID SHOT PUT IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Stephen: DID YOU WEIGH, LIKE, 240. YOU'RE TOO SMALL TO DO SHOT PUT.
I WASN'T VERY GOOD. I DON'T THINK I EVER COMPETED. I JUST WANTED TO BE THERE TO BE WITH MY BEST FRIEND AND TALK.
Stephen: THAT IS YOU FINISHING THE TRIATHLON, AND YOU GOING TO THE EMMYS THE NEXT TIME?
THE SAME NIGHT. THAT'S THE SAME NIGHT. THAT'S THE NIGHT-BEFORE PARTY. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE TRIATHLON I HAD TO GET DRESSED UP BUT I KEPT MY TRIATHLON NUMBERS ON BECAUSE THEY WERE SO BAD-AS, IS.

I SHOWERED AND WENT TO AN AFTER-PARTY AND THE NEXT DAY WE WENT TO THE EMMYS, YES. THAT'S MY HUSBAND. HE'S VERY CUTE.
Stephen: HE IS VERY CUTE. SO ARE YOU. I DON'T THINK I'D HAVE THE STICK-TO--IVENESS TO DO IT. ARE YOU A HARD WORKER?
I.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB.
MY FIRST JOB I WAS HIRED BY MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR TO CLEAN A PET PIG.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD HAVE A PIG LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS LEGAL. BUT IT HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS LEGAL TO HIRE A NINE-YEAR-OLD TO CLEAN THE PIG. BUT I DID IT.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE ROUGH WORK.
BUT I NEEDED THAT CASH.
Stephen: I KNOW.
I HAD TO PAY FOR THE THE CORN FLAKES AND THE SUGAR.
Stephen: SOMEBODY'S GOT TO. DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY HELLO TO THE FIRST LADY?
I DID. IT WAS VERY EXCITING.
Stephen: SHE'S VERY NICE, ISN'T SHE?
SHE'S AMAZING. SHE'S INCREDIBLE. I'M SO GRATEFUL PEA HAVE HER VOICE AND HER SANITY IN THIS TIME.  ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) YEAH.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE WAS SAYING, NOT ON CAMERA, BUT SHE WAS SAYING THAT THE IDEA OF ASKING A YOUNG WOMAN, "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?" SHOULD NOT STOP ONCE YOU GROW UP. PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONTINUALLY ASKED, "WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?"
I AGREE WITH THAT.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP, AMERICA FERRERA?
I WANT TO BE KINDER.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. ARE YOU A JERK NOW? ( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, I WANT TO WORK TOWARDS BEING A KINDER, MORE COMPASSIONATE, MORE UNDERSTANDING PERSON.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
YEAH. AND I ALSO THINK, TOO, I HEARD A REALLY INTERESTING THING, THAT INSTEAD OF ASKING KIDS, "WHAT DOCUMENT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?" YOU CAN ASK THEM, "WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE WHEN YOU GROW UP?" AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY SPECIAL WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S NICE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT PART AM I GOING TO PLAY IN SOCIETY?
YEAH, WHAT DO I HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE? WHAT DO I HAVE TO GIVE, TO LEAD LEAVE WORD JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
Stephen: THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE HERE FOR "SUPERSTORE."
YES.
Stephen: AND IT'S BEEN PICKED UP FOR ANOTHER SEASON.
YEAH.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU SAID-- I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID-- I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE BEEN CAST IN A PART THAT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN FOR A LA TINA.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
IT MEANS IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS ASKED TO DO A ROLE THAT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN FOR A LA TINA. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: JIMMY, JIMMY, LET'S CUT THAT QUESTION OUT OF THE INTERVIEW, PLEASE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
IT MEANS THAT EVERY OTHER ROLE THAT I HAD BEEN OFFERED HAD BEEN SPECIFIED. ANNA, LATINA, 20-SOMETHING. CARMEN, LATINA, 20-SOMETHING. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I READ A SCRIPT, AMY, 30, NO ETHNICITY. THAT SEEMS LIKE NOT A BIG DEAL. BUT IN TELEVISION OR FILM IF THE ETHNICITY ISN'T SPECIFIED THE ASSUMPTION AND DEFAULT IN MOST CASES IS WHITE. AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE A REASON FOR THAT ROLE TO BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN THAT. AND SO FOR OUR WRITERS TO WRITE THIS WORLD AND TO WRITE NOT JUST MY CHARACTER BUT ALL THE CHARACTERS JUST AS PEOPLE AND NOT SPECIFY THEIR ETHNICITY. BUT THEN GO OUT AND CAST THE BEST PERSON FOR THE ROLE WHO HAPPENED TO BE LATINO, BLACK, ASIAN, THAT FELT REALLY UNIQUE IN THIS INDUSTRY, AND UNIQUE IN THE WORLD.  ( APPLAUSE ) TO BE SEEN AS A PERSON BEFORE YOU'RE SEEN AS, YOU KNOW, THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN.
Stephen: AMERICA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: CATCH "SUPERSTORE" ON NBC. AMERICA FERRERA, EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW. TUNE IN TOMORROW, WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE ETHAN HAWKE, TIM MEADOWS, AND MUSICAL GUEST, WILCO. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, ALAN CUMMING AND JESSE TYLER FERGUSON. GOOD NIGHT!
