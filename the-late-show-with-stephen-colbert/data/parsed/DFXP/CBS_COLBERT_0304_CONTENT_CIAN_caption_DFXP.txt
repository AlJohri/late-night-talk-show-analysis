IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES HUGH JACKMAN, CONDOLA RASHAD AND MUSICAL GUEST FLAMING LIPS, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( THEME SONG PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! NICE TO SEE YA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! WHOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN ) ♪ THAT'S LOVELY. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY! I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BIG NEWS TODAY OUT OF THE KREMLIN-- I'M SORRY, I MISPRONOUNCED THAT. I MEANT TO SAY THE WHITE HOUSE. NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL, Y'ALL -- YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S ALL THIS SMOKE AROUND THE IDEA THAT THE TRUMP FOLKS COLLUDED WITH THE RUSSIANS TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION? AND THE TRUMP PEOPLE ARE SAYING, "NOTHING TO SEE HERE, FOLKS"? WELL, I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. IT TURNS OUT, JEFF SESSIONS SPOKE WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TWICE DURING TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, EVEN THOUGH, AT HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING, SESSIONS WAS ASKED THIS BY SENATOR AL FRANKEN ABOUT REPORTS OF COLLUSION.
THESE DOCUMENTS ALSO ALLEGEDLY STATED "THERE WAS A CONTINUING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION DURING THE CAMPAIGN BETWEEN TRUMP SURROGATES AND INTERMEDIARIES FOR THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT." IF THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE AFFILIATED WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATED WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN, WHAT WILL YOU DO?
SENATOR FRANKEN, I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. I HAVE BEEN CALLED A SURROGATE AT A TIME OR TWO IN THAT CAMPAIGN AND I DIDN'T HAVE-- NOT HAVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
STEPHEN: FRANKEN DIDN'T EVEN ASK IF YOU WERE INVOLVED! WHY DID YOU VOLUNTEER TO LIE? (SOUTHERN ACCENT) "I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, SENATOR. FIRST, LET ME STAND ON THIS RICKETTY CHAIR NEXT TO THIS FULL BATHTUB AND PLEASE, HAND ME THAT TOASTER." PERHAPS AN ENGLISH  MUFFIN OR TWO DOWN HERE. WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION AGAIN? ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "NO, OFFICER, I DID NOT SEE WHO STABBED THE GENTLEMAN. BY THE WAY, AS A YOUNG MAN MY NICKNAME WAS 'STABBY JACK,' BUT THESE DAYS I CONTROL MY THIRST FOR BLOOD WITH PURE OLD-FASHIONED STRANGLIN'." WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THE RUSSIAN GUY HE SPOKE TO IS SERGEY KISLYAK, THE SAME RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR THAT MICHAEL FLYNN TALKED TO BEFORE HE GOT THE-- KISLYAK OF DEATH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, SESSIONS' OFFICE HAD AN EXPLANATION: THEY SAY THAT SESSIONS DIDN'T LIE. THEY SAY HE WASN'T MEETING KISLYAK AS A SURROGATE, HE MET WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN HIS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES PANEL. "HONEY, I WASN'T HAVING SEX WITH HER AS YOUR HUSBAND. I WAS HUMPING HER IN MY CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES PANEL." TOTALLY DIFFERENT. ( APPLAUSE ) HUGE HUMPING FANS HERE TONIGHT. SO NOW, FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE CALLED ON SESSIONS TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM ANY RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. THIS AFTERNOON, SESSIONS AGREED.
I HAVE RECUSED MYSELF IN MATTERS THAT DEAL WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
STEPHEN: YOU CALLED YOURSELF A CAMPAIGN SURROGATE. THEN, YOU LIED UNDER OATH THAT YOU NEVER MET WITH THE RUSSIANS. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO RECUSE YOURSELF-- YOU'VE ALREADY ( BLEEP ) YOURSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE DON'T HAVE TO BLEEP THAT.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT. THAT'S HOW IT GOES.
Stephen: AND WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW THIS MUCH ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS IF IT WEREN'T FOR SOME LAST-MINUTE WORK BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, "OBAMA OFFICIALS FOUGHT TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN ELECTION MEDDLING." GOOD IDEA. THOUGH I BELIEVE THERE IS A LARGE PIECE OF EVIDENCE SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE OBAMA FOLKS WERE WORRIED THAT AFTER TRUMP TOOK OFFICE, "THE INTELLIGENCE COULD BE COVERED UP OR DESTROYED." YES, TRUMP COULD BURY IT WHERE THE PUBLIC WOULD NEVER SEE IT-- MAYBE WITH HIS TAXES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT WAS ALL AN EFFORT TO "LEAVE A CLEAR TRAIL OF INTELLIGENCE FOR GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATORS." OH, IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT WITH CLUES HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT! THE MOVIE "NATIONAL TREASURE" IS FINALLY COMING TRUE! NICOLAS CAGE, QUICK, CHECK THE BACK OF THE CONSTITUTION. I KNEW IT! VLADIMIR PUTIN'S PHONE NUMBER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT! ALSO CHECK THE FRONT OF THE CONSTITUTION-- THERE'S SOME WRITING ON THAT SIDE THAT'S PRETTY DAMNING TO TRUMP, TOO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, CONGRESS HAS FINALLY STARTED ITS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, WITH HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES SAYING, "ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, WE WILL FULLY INVESTIGATE ALL THE EVIDENCE WE COLLECT AND FOLLOW THAT EVIDENCE WHEREVER IT LEADS." BRING A FLASHLIGHT BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY DARK UP PUTIN'S BUTT. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE OF THESE THINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) MR. TRUMP! ( LAUGHTER ) BATTERY WILL GO DOWN UNLESS YOU TURN IT OFF. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THINGS ARE GETTING SERIOUS BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF HAS BEEN TOLD TO PRESERVE ALL RUSSIA-RELATED MATERIALS. SO YOU HEAR THAT, MR. PRESIDENT? DON'T GET THAT MATTRESS STEAM-CLEANED. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Jon: OOH --
Stephen: YEAH. I LIKE THAT JOKE, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, WHILE HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS GOING DOWN IN FLAMES-- TRUMP WAS IN VIRGINIA, ADDRESSING THE MILITARY IN NEWPORT NEWS. OR AS HE CALLS IT, "NEWPORT FAKE NEWS." TRUMP WAS ON THE DECK OF THE BRAND NEW CARRIER, U.S.S. "GERALD FORD," AND HE DEBUTED A NEW  LOOK.
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST GAVE ME THIS BEAUTIFUL JACKET. THEY SAID, HERE, MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE TAKE THIS HOME. I SAID, LET ME WEAR IT! AND THEN THEY GAVE ME THE BEAUTIFUL HAT. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'LL DO THAT. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT LOOKS.
STEPHEN: LIKE GRANDPA JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE CHANGING ROOM AT THE ARMY SURPLUS STORE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU BUY IT? ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP PROVED RIGHT AWAY THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE MODERN U.S. NAVY.
IT REALLY FEELS LIKE A PLACE -- YOU STAND ON THAT DECK AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE STANDING ON A VERY BIG PIECE OF LAND, BUT THIS IS BETTER THAN LAND.
STEPHEN: CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED A BOAT. ( LAUGHTER ) "IT'S LIKE LAND ON WATER. BUT IT'S DRY. IT'S LIKE A HOTEL, BUT IT'S ON ITS SIDE, AND IT'S NOT SINKING, AND THERE'S NO ROOM SERVICE." THE WORST. ( LAUGHTER ) AND AS BEFITS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO COMPLIMENT THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM.
OUR NAVY IS GREAT, OUR NAVY IS GREAT. OUR PEOPLE ARE GREAT. GREAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: YOUR VOCABULARY, ON THE OTHER HAND, COULD USE SOME WORK. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE, GREAT. NOW, SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WOW, THIS RUSSIAN THING IS DEVELOPING SO FAST. A NEW THING EVERY DAY. HERE'S THE THING, IT IS ONLY GETTING OUT IN THE PUBLIC BECAUSE OF WHITE HOUSE WHISTLEBLOWERS. NO ONE KNOWS WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRUMP IS GETTING FRUSTRATED AND HE THINKS HE MAY HAVE FOUND THE SOURCE OF THESE LEAKS.
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BEHIND IT BECAUSE HIS PEOPLE ARE CERTAINLY BEHIND IT, AND SOME OF THE LEAKS POSSIBLY COME FROM THAT GROUP.
STEPHEN: I DON'T SEE HOW OBAMA COULD BE BEHIND THE LEAKS. HE'D HAVE TO BE IN THE INNER CIRCLE. WE HAVE A PICTURE OF TRUMP WITH HIS CABINET. PULL IT OUT, JIMMY. AH-HA!
Jon: YEAH! YEAH!
Stephen: HE'S SO CLEVER. BUT THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR ME BECAUSE, IF TRUMP THINKS THE LEAKS ARE COMING FROM OBAMA, THEN HE HASN'T CAUGHT ON TO MY SUPER SECRET SOURCE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER EDITION OF "LATE SHOW PRESIDENTIAL LEAK-RETS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ WELCOME TO LATE SHOW PRESIDENTIAL LEAK-RETS. NOW, I'M ABOUT TO SPEAK WITH MY SUPER SECRET SOURCE, HIGH UP IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY, WE HAVE DIMMED THE LIGHTS, AND PUT HIM OR HER BEHIND A SCREEN. HELLO, ANONYMOUS SOURCE.
HELLO, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: I'M GLAD YOUR VOICE IS STILL DISGUISED.
ME TOO. THE MACHINE HAS TWO SETTINGS. IT HAS THIS LOW MODE, OR, I CAN SWITCH IT... TO A JON BATISTE SETTING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW, THAT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE HIM.
YEAH. WHERE YA AT, Y'ALL? HOO! ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: SO WHAT'S THE MOOD OF THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW?
WELL, YOU KNOW THE PHRASE "WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD?"
STEPHEN: YEAH. I'VE HEARD THAT.
IT'S LIKE THAT, BUT NO WHISTLING. IT'S ALL GRAVEYARD.
STEPHEN: SO THEY'RE PRETTY UPSET ABOUT JEFF SESSIONS NEWS?
WELL, A LITTLE. BUT MOSTLY THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT KATY PERRY AND ORLANDO BLOOM'S BREAK-UP. I MEAN, IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE ROMANTIC THAN NAKED PADDLEBOARDING. AND I MUST SAY, ORLANDO BLOOM HAS QUITE THE PADDLE.
STEPHEN: OKAY, BUT IT'S CLEAR NOW, SESSIONS MET WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TWICE BEFORE THE ELECTION, BUT DENIES DISCUSSING THE CAMPAIGN. HOW DEEP DO SESSIONS TIES TO THE RUSSIANS GO?
OH, REALLY, REALLY DEEP. RUSSIA IS THE HOME OF THE ENCHANTED TREE, WHERE SESSIONS AND HIS FAMILY BAKE ALL THOSE COOKIES ( LAUGHTER ) HIS CODE NAME IS E.L. FUDGE.
STEPHEN: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
LET'S JUST SAY A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME. ( LAUGHTER )
COMRADE! COMRADE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: ANY IDEA OF WHERE TRUMP GOES FROM HERE?
AT THIS POINT, EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY'VE GOT TO APPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
STEPHEN: WHO WILL IT BE?
IT'S DOWN TO FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL TED OLSEN, OR TRUMP'S CHOICE, MATLOCK. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HE WOULD BE REALLY GOOD. NOW, THIS SESSIONS BUSINESS IS OVERSHADOWING TRUMP'S VERY WELL-REVIEWED  ADDRESS TO CONGRESS. DID THE PRESIDENT WRITE THIS SPEECH HIMSELF?
NO, THAT SPEECH WAS WRITTEN BY HAVING A THOUSAND MONKEYS TYPE FOR A MILLION YEARS.
STEPHEN: SO STEVE BANNON DIDN'T HAVE ANY INPUT AT ALL?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. BANNON BROUGHT THE MONKEYS OVER FROM BREITBART. THEY'RE WHITE SUPREMA-CHIMPS.
STEPHEN: NOW, TRUMP HAD AN -- NOW, THERE ARE RUMORS DIFFERENT FACTIONS ARE FIGHTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IS THAT TRUE?
YES, THEY'RE FIGHTING IN THE PIT TRUMP HAD INSTALLED UNDER THE OVAL OFFICE. THIS MORNING, KELLYANNE CONWAY GUTTED AN INTERN WITH REINCE PRIEBUS' SHARPENED FEMUR.
STEPHEN: WAIT, REINCE PRIEBUS IS DEAD?
ONLY THE FIRST ONE. HIS CLONES ARE FINE.
STEPHEN: CAN YOU TELL US WHY THE PRESIDENT STILL REFUSE TO RELEASE HIS TAXES?
HE'S JUST REALLY MODEST AND DOESN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THE MILLIONS HE GIVES TO CHARITY EVERY YEAR.
STEPHEN: I WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED THAT.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S ALL THE RUSSIA STUFF. HE CLAIMED PUTIN AS A DEPENDENT. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LITTLE BIRD?
DA! (BIRD ATTACKS) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
STEPHEN: ANONYMOUS SOURCE, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH HUGH JACKMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪

Stephen: THANK YOU, MAN!
Stephen: YOU JUST DID THE REAL MOVIE STAR ENTRANCE.
WHAT'S THAT?
Stephen: MOVIE STARS HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ENTRANCE THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.
REALLY?
Stephen: THEY TAKE THE MOMENT, STAND OVER THERE, ADDRESS THE AUDIENCE FIRST. UMA THURMAN DID THE SAME THING. YOU'RE A TRUE MOVIE STAR.
I HAVE TO THANK YOU PUBLICLY. WE HOSTED AN EVENT IN CENTRAL PARK.
Stephen: I HAVE A PICTURE. YES.
Stephen: THIS IS GLOBAL CITIZEN.
LIGHT AS A FEATHER, BY THE WAY, LIGHT AS A FEATHER.
Stephen: WE CO-HOSTED, YOU HAD A LONG TRENCH COAT ON YOUR SHOULDER.
I CAME OUT FROM WAY TO STAGE LEFT ONLY TO DISCOVER MY EYESIGHT HAS GOTTEN BAD. I SAID, COULD YOU READ IT? I STOOD THERE THE ENTIRE TIME WHILE YOU COVERED FOR ME. I NOW HAVE CONTACT LENSES. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
Stephen: I GOT YOUR BACK, YOU CARRIED ME ON YOUR BACK.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THE THING I FIND HUMBLING IS WE REHEARSED THIS ONCE IN THE STUDIO, AND I GOT ON HIS SHOULDERS, AND I WAS AFRAID, I DON'T KNOW WHY, I WAS GOING TO HURT YOUR SHOULDERS BY SITTING ON THEM. BUT WHEN I GOT OFF, I LIMPED AWAY FROM BEING ON YOUR SHOULDERS. OUR WIVES WERE THERE. MY WIFE SAID, ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU HURT YOUR LEG SITTING ON HIS SHOULDERS? ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS LIKELY HUMBLING. ( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ADAMANTIUM CLAUSE? THIS IS A BASAL CELL CARCINOMA, AT LEAST FORM OF SKIN CANCER. WEAR SUNSCREEN. GET CHECKUPS. BUT I'M ALL FINE. WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE OZONE LAYER. I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT SUNSCREEN. I DON'T EVER REMEMBER MY PARENTS PUTTING IT ON ME. MAYBE THEY DID.
Stephen: WE RUBBED OIL ON OURSELVES.
A LOOF OUTTHAT -- A LOT OF THAT. GET BURNED AND PEELED AND THAT WAS YOUR LOOK.
Stephen: BURN YOU, PEEL YOU, THEY WOULD MAKE YOU INTO A BOOK. ( LAUGHTER ) I HEARD YOU WERE 13 WHEN YOU FIRST DECIDED YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A LIFE IN THE THEATER.
OH, WOW.
Stephen: OKAY, IS THAT A TRUE STORY?
KIND OF. MY FATHER WAS CONVERTED BY BILLY GRAHAM AT A REVIVAL BEFORE I WAS BORN. I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE CHURCH AND WE WENT TO A REVIVAL MEETING. I WAS ABOUT 13 AND I REMEMBER LOOKING UP AT THIS MINISTER. HE WAS UP ON STAGE HAVING A VERY, VERY STRONG SENSE I WOULD ONE DAY BEING ON A STAGE IN FRONT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: DID YOU THINK MAYBE YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PREACHER?
AT THE TIME I THOUGHT MAYBE A PREACHER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RELIGION, LIKE COMIC BOOKS.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT THERE WAS ANOTHER OPTION? A LOT OF PEOPLE -- PEOPLE DON'T KNOW YOU, NECESSARILY, AS A BRILLIANT STAGE ACTOR BECAUSE THEY KNOW UH YOU FROM ALL THE MOVIES.
I'VE DONE IT SINCE FIVE. I DID CAMELOT WHEN I WAS FIVE.
Stephen: LANCELOT? THE KING.
Stephen: OH, SORRY. HAD THE CROWN, DIDN'T QUITE FIT. I REMEMBER HALFWAY THROUGH THE SONG THE CROWN FELL LITERALLY OVER MY FACE. FOR HALF A SECOND, I WAS MORTIFIED. JUST EMBARRASSINGLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE. EVERYONE LAUGHED AND I THOUGHT, IT'S ALL GOOD, DOESN'T MATTER. THAT'S SORT OF WHEN I GOT HOOKED, WHEN I WAS FIVE.
Stephen: ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT HOOKED ON COMEDY IS BECAUSE I HAD DONE DRAMA FOR YEARS AND I FOUND OUT IF YOU'RE DOING COMEDY, AND YOU (BLEEP) EVERYTHING UP, YOU STILL GET A LAUGH. I THOUGHT, THIS IS FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER )
WHEN I MET YOU AND YOUR FAMILY, YOUR SON FOUND YOU FUNNY. I REMEMBER THAT. I REMEMBER HIM LAUGHING, YOU TELLING JOKES AND YOUR WIFE AND SON WERE LAUGHING. I THOUGHT THAT WAS AMAZING, LIKE NORMALLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT IS, RIGHT? IT IS AMAZING.
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THE SHOW. I LAUGH AT THEM, TOO. YEAH.
Stephen: I REMEMBER MY SON HAVING A FRIEND COME OVER, HE WAS ABOUT 13, AND THE GUY WAS PEPPERING HIM WITH WOLVERINE QUESTIONS. MY SON SAID NOTHING AND I'M IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR AND I SAID, LISTEN, MY DAD IS NOTHING LIKE WOLVERINE, HE IS NOT TOUGH OR COOL. DON'T ASK ME ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT.
Stephen: MY KIDS ARE COOL. I STEAL JOKES FROM THEM ALL THE TIME. I STOLE THIS JOKE FROM MY SON, MITCH McCONNELL HAD BEEN MADE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. MY WIFE AND I WERE TALKING IN THE FRONT SEAT AND MY SON IN THE BACK SEAT GOES, MITCH McCONNELL! SHA THE SAME MITCH McCONNELL I'VE NEVER HEARD OF? ( LAUGHTER )
VERY GOOD!
Stephen: I WAS, LIKE, STOLEN! STOLEN! WE'LL TAKE A BREAK AND BE BACK WITH MORE HUGH JACKMAN. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE EXCITED CROWD, WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND HUGH JACKMAN. NOW, LISTEN, THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU'RE HERE. THE BAD NEWS IS THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE GET TO SEE YOU PLAY WOLVERINE.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOUR FIRST MOVIE WAS WOLVERINE?
MY FIRST AMERICAN MOVIE. IT WAS 1999 WHEN I GOT CAST, SO JUST OVER 17 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU AGE? FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY,  "LOGAN" WAS A LITTLE OLDER THAN THIS. THIS, THREE AND A HALF HOURS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY THE ROLE, CAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO, FINALLY, FAT JACKSMAN? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ALL THERES TO, I'VE SEEN YOU WORKING OUT WITH SCOTT PELLEY, I'VE SEEN YOU FIT. THAT WOULD BE A REAL CHALLENGE WITH YOU AS AN ACTOR JUST TO GET FAT!
BY THE WAY, THANK YOU FOR THE BAGUETTE AND THE CHEESE YOU HAD UP IN MY ROOM. I THOUGHT, THIS IS THE BEGINNING. IT'S GONE.
Stephen: THAT'S IT. ALREADY GONE!
Stephen: I CAN TELL. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU MUST BE EXCITED BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO BE IN A TRAINING REGIMEN WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING, RIGHT?
IT'S SORT OF UNBELIEVABLE TO ME, WHAT I DID FOR 17 YEARS WHICH I GOT BETTER AT. THE FIRST ONE, I THOUGHT YOU COULD GET SHAPE IN THREE WEEKS, AND THE DIRECTOR HAD TO PUSH ALL THE SHIRT-OFF SCENES TO THE END, FOUR MONTHS LATER.
Stephen: HE LOOKS AND SAYS, NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT.
REALLY. HE REALLY SAID, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HIDE THE CAMERA HERE, IF YOU GO BACK AND SEE THAT MOVIE, SOME EMBARRASSING SHOTS.
Stephen: NOT REALLY. ( LAUGHTER )
SO, YES, NOW I'M EATING AND LOVING IT, AND SOMETIMES JUST WAKING UP AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING TO HAVE BREAKFAST CEREAL AND GO BACK TO BED WITH IT IN MY LAUGH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR REGIMEN FOR WHEN YOU DO THE SHIRTLESS SCENE.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S -- I FIND OUT THE DATE WHICH IS THE SHIRT-OFF THING, ABOUT A THREE-MONTH RUNUP. YOU HAVE TO BE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. THE THREE MONTHS BEFORE THIS IS SPECIFIC. FINCHES WITH DEHYDRATION. YOU INCREASE YOUR WATER INTAKE UP TO, I THINK I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT THE GAL NLS IS, BUT YOU HAVE ABOUT TEN LITTERS OF WATER, THREE GAL NLS OF WATER A DAY --
Stephen: NO WAY TO CONVERT THAT. YOU DRANK A LOT OF WATER.
A LOT OF WATER. AND THEN YOU STOP ABOUT 36 HOURS BEFORE YOU SHOOT, BUT BECAUSE YOU DRANK SO MUCH YOU'RE PEEING ALL THE TIME. >TIME. THEN YOU GO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND PUT THE CLOTHES ON. SO YOU LOSE ABOUT TEN POUNDS OF WATER WEIGHT.
Stephen: IF I KNOW THERE IS A SHIRTLESS SCENE COMING UP, FOR THE THREE MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME, I DO NOTHING AND QUIT THE DAY BEFORE THE SCENE. WORKS OUT EVERY TIME.
PERFECT.
Stephen: NOW, I WAS TALKING TO PATRICK ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT. I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHILE IT IS IN THE FAMILY OF THE X-MEN UNIVERSE, IT'S A HUGE DEPARTURE TONALLY, AND IT'S INCREDIBLY MOVING BECAUSE YOU GOT TO KNOW AND LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND YOU SEE THEM BROUGHT LOW. THERE IS A VULNERABILITY IN YOUR CHARACTER WHO IS ENTERING SENIOR DMEN   SHAVMENT WHAT WAS IT LIKE THE PLAY THIS CHARACTER?
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. PEOPLE LOVED THE IDEA OF DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
Stephen: WHO IS IDEA WAS IT.
I WOKE UP 4:00 IN THE MORNING. I HAVE A TAPE, IT WAS A MEMO TODAY, TWO YEARS AGO, I 4:00 IN THE MORNING, I WOKE UP BOLT UPRIGHT AND I THOUGHT HOW COOL WOULD IT BE TO ESEE WOLVERINE NOT JUST TAKING PEOPLE OUT -- YOU DO SEE THAT, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: IN WAYS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
BUT AFTERWARDS, WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR THE SOLDIER WHO RETURNS HOME AND TRIES TO FIND PEACE FOR HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE'S A VIOLENT CHARACTER AND HAS DEMONS. IT'S EASY TO SAY, LET'S DO SOMETHING LIKE UNFORGIVEN AND SHANE AND WRESTLER, AND THEN HE WENT OFF AND WROTE IT AND DIRECTED THIS BEAUTIFUL MOVIE WHICH I'M PROUD OF.
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE SEE IT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE X-MEN MOVIES AND THE BOOKS BEFORE THEM, THE X-MEN HAVE REPRESENTED SO MANY DIFFERENT MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS, BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION, I MEANT TO ASK PATRICK STEWART LAST NIGHT, IF IT TURNED OUT THERE WERE MUTANTS AMONG US THAT HAD CLAUSE AND ABILITIES, WE WOULD HAVE TO ROUND THEM UP, RIGHT? THEY'RE DANGEROUS. THEY'RE DANGEROUS. ( LAUGHTER )
YES, BUT LET'S PUT THEM TO GOOD USE AND MAKE THEM HAPPY. LET'S PUT THEM IN A HOME WITH MASSAGES AND LET THEM EAT. CAN WE LET THEM EAT?
Stephen: I THINK YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOURSELF.

YES, MY MOTHER TOOK ME EVERYWHERE, NOT ONLY TO EVENTS, BUT I WAS BACKSTAGE WITH HER, I WAS IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM WITH HER. I NEVER FELT SEPARATED FROM WHO SHE WAS AS AN ARTIST. SHE INCORPORATED ME INTO THAT. WHEN SHE WAS OFF DOING PLAYS, SHE WOULD DO PLAYS IN ATLANTA OFTEN, AND SHE GAVE ME THE ASSIGNMENT OF BEING HER ASSISTANT. SO I WAS IN CHARGE OF WAKING HER UP FROM HER NAP, FOR TELLING HER WHEN IT WAS TIME TO DO HER VOCAL WARMUP, GETTING HER TEA READY. I WOULD SIT IN THE AUDIENCE AND TAKE NOTES. I BROUGHT THEM TO HER. I WOULD SAY, THAT LINE AT THE END, YOU DROPPED OFF. I NEED MORE.
Stephen: YOU TOUGH ON YOUR MOM?
TOTALLY.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
I'VE GOT TO PUSH HER TO BE YOUR BEST.
Stephen: TID YOU GO TO WORK WITH YOUR DAD EVER?
I DID.
Stephen: WHICH WAS MORE FUN?
IT'S HARD BECAUSE BOTH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. GOING TO WORK WITH MY DAD WAS FUN BECAUSE I GOT TO EAT A LOT OF CANDY. THERE WAS STUDIO, SO THERE'S JUST CANDY FOR THE CREW. MY DAD WASN'T AS STRICT WITH WHAT I ATE SO I COULD SNEAK CANDY ALL THE TIME. MUCH VEERS TO DO IT AT MY DAD'S WORK.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW, SINCE YOUR DAD, YOU KNOW, WAS A FORMER N.F.L. PLAYER AND A BIG GUY, DID THAT INTIMIDATE BOYFRIENDS WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? DID THAT SCARE OFF ANYBODY?
IT DIDN'T SCARE OFF ANYBODY. I THINK EVERYONE KIND OF PLAYED IT COOL, BUT, YEAH, I IMAGINE IT WAS PRETTY INTIMIDATING. FOR MY FIANCEÉ NOW, IT WAS  PRETTY INTIMIDATING. HE FACETIMEED MY DAD THE DAY BEFORE HE PROPOSED, SO I CAN IMAGINE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT --
Stephen: DID YOUR DAD KNOW IT WAS COMING OR DID HE JUST, BLING, BLING, DAUGHTER'S HADN'T IN MARRIAGE, PLEASE.
NO, ESSENTIALLY, WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, BUT MY DAD SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM SO I THINK HE KNEW IT WAS COMING.
Stephen: WERE YOU THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED? HAD HE ALREADY ASKED YOU AND THEN SAID, I HAVE TO CLEAR UT WITH YOUR DAD?
WHAT HAPPENED IS I TURNED 30 IN DECEMBER. WE PLANNED A HUGE TRIP TO MEXICO. WE WERE THERE. I WAS GOING TO SURPRISE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE TRIP, I WAS GOING TO TAKE TELL ME ON AN AMAZING BOAT RIDE. I'M SITTING HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE BOAT LOOKING AT THE OCEAN. I HEAR "TURN AROUND." I DID, AND THERE HE WAS. I REMEMBER AS HE WAS ASKING ME, I WAS LITERALLY AT THE EDGE OF THE BOAT, ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT IS, BUT, QUICK, PUT IT ON BECAUSE THIS COULD EASILY TURN INTO A TITANIC SITUATION, WE DON'T HAVE SCUBA GEAR HERE, GET IT ON THE FINGER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME.
Stephen: THE CHARACTER YOU PLAY ON "BILLIONS," ASSISTANT D.A. KATE ZACHER, A KIND OF WONKY ROLE. DID YOU HAVE TO BONE UP ON THE LEGAL ISSUES ON WALL STREET?
YES, AND I THINK THE BEST -- BECAUSE YOU CAN DO RESEARCH, AND IN TERMS OF LOOKING THINGS UP. OF COURSE, THAT'S HELPFUL, BUT FOR ME IT REALLY HELPS TO HAVE SOMEONE TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. LUCKILY, MY SISTER, SHE IS AN ATTORNEY AND SHE WORKS FOR THE MAYOR IN ATLANTA. SHE'S MY GO-TO. WHENEVER I HAVE A QUESTION, I ASK HER. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? MAKE THIS SOUND REAL.
BASICALLY.
Stephen: DOES SHE GET FRUSTRATED BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE JOB.
