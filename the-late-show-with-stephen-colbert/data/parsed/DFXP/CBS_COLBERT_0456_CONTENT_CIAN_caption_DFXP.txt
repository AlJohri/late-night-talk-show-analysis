♪ > WE NEED A HAT TO MAKE FROSTY COME TO LIGHT! (DING-DING)
MAGA, NOW WHO WANTS TO DEPORT SOME DREAMERS?
HUH? LOOK AT THESE HANDS! DO THEY LOOK SMALL TO YOU? WEE! I'M GHOST STEPPING.
YOU'RE AN AWFUL SNOW MAN. FAKE NEWS. I LIKED HIM BETTER WITHOUT THE HAT.
IT WAS YOUR STUPID IDEA. SEE YOU LATER SNOWFLAKES, WHITE POWER!
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT DON, JR. PLEADS PRIVILEGE. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES SARAH PAULSON AND JOHN HODGMAN, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WHOO! HI, EVERYBODY! HOW ARE YA! HOW ARE YA?! GOOD TO SEE YA! WHAT'S GOING ON, EVERYBODY? WELCOME ONE AND ALL, CHILDREN OF ALL AGES TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH! BIG NEWS FROM THE TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. YESTERDAY, WE FINALLY GOT CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY FROM DONALD TRUMP JR. HIS GRILLING BY THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE LASTED ROUGHLY EIGHT HOURS, MAKING IT THE FIRST TIME A TRUMP HAS PUT IN A FULL WORK DAY. ( LAUGHTER ) DON, JR. WAS THERE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS INFAMOUS MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER, NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA. ( LAUGHTER ) AS YOU RECALL, DON, JR. WAS THERE LOOKING FOR DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON. BACK IN JUNE OF 2016, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT THE MEETING WAS ABOUT. AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE! PAUL MANAFORT, JARED KUSHNER-- IT WAS A REAL WHO'S WHO OF WHO WANTS AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT? ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN THIS STORY FIRST CAME OUT THIS SUMMER, DON JR. QUICKLY ISSUED A STATEMENT EXPLAINING THE MEETING WAS JUST ABOUT AMERICANS ADOPTING RUSSIAN CHILDREN. BUT THAT STATEMENT WAS A LIE. AND IT WAS DICTATED BY DONALD TRUMP TO DON, JR. "SON, YOU CAN ALWAYS TRUST ME TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT HOW TO LIE. BELIEVE ME. ALSO, NEVER BELIEVE ME." ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, WHEN THE CONGRESSIONAL PANEL ASKED DON, JR. ABOUT HIS DAD'S INVOLVEMENT, HE DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER, SO HE CITED ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE. "I HEREBY INVOKE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, FATHER-SON PRIVILEGE, SAME-NAME PRIVILEGE, WHITE PRIVILEGE. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR, SUSTAINED. EXECUTIVE PRODUCER DICK WOLF. I REST MY CASE." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, DON, JR. IS NOT A LAWYER, BUT STILL CLAIMS ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE BECAUSE "THERE WAS A LAWYER IN THE ROOM DURING THE DISCUSSION." IS THAT HOW IT WORKS? IN WHICH CASE, I'M GOING TO ROB A LAW FIRM. "ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, HANDS IN THE AIR. REMEMBER, NONE OF YOU CAN TESTIFY!" ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, DONALD TRUMP, JR. HAS LONG INSISTED THAT THERE WAS NO FOLLOW-UP TO HIS MEETING WITH VESELNITSKAYA. SO, YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING. CNN GOT THEIR HANDS ON PREVIOUSLY UNDISCLOSED EMAILS THAT SHOW A FOLLOW-UP AFTER THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING. WOW. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NO END TO THE NUMBER OF EMAILS DON, JR. IS HIDING. WE NEED TO SEE THEM ALL. CAN ANYONE HELP?
RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, CONCERNED CITIZEN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE EMAILS IN QUESTION ARE FROM THE MAN WHO SET UP THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING, BRITISH PUBLICIST ROB GOLDSTONE, SEEN HERE DRESSED AS THE STAR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RECURRING NIGHTMARE. FOR A LONG TIME NOW, VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE INSISTED THAT THE SUBJECT OF THE HACK OF THE D.N.C. WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP AT THE MEETING. SO, YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING. ONE OF THE EMAILS FORWARDED A CNN STORY ON RUSSIA'S HACK OF THE D.N.C., DESCRIBING IT AS "EERILY WEIRD" GIVEN WHAT THEY HAD DISCUSSED AT THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING FIVE DAYS EARLIER. OH, YOU DUMMY. THAT'S LIKE FORWARDING AN ARTICLE ABOUT ARSON AND SAYING "THIS IS EERILY WEIRD, GIVEN THAT WAREHOUSE WE TORCHED FIVE DAYS AGO!" ( LAUGHTER ) DONALD TRUMP, JR. WAS ASKED ABOUT THESE EMAILS YESTERDAY, AND HE SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THEM OR COULD NOT RECALL THE CONTENTS. WOW, TWO EXCUSES! "LOOK, I NEVER GOT ANY EMAILS, AND FURTHERMORE, I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT WERE IN ALL THOSE EMAILS I GOT." LAUGH BUT AFTER HIS TESTIMONY, DON, JR. LEFT IN STYLE. HE POSTED THIS INSTAGRAM PHOTO OF THIS TRUMP-HELICOPTER WITH THE CAPTION, "TIME TO ROLL." COINCIDENTALLY, "TIME TO ROLL" IS ALSO WHAT MICHAEL FLYNN SAID RIGHT BEFORE HE CUT THAT DEAL WITH ROBERT MUELLER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT, DONNIE, "TIME TO ROLL?" YOU LEFT IN A HELICOPTER. IT IS LITERALLY ONE OF THE FEW VEHICLES THAT DOESN'T ROLL! "LET'S PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL IN THIS HOT AIR BALLOON!" NOW, WHILE WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION, IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT THEY WERE AFTER-- FOR AMERICA TO LIFT OUR MASSIVE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST THEM. CLEARLY, THE SANCTIONS ARE WORKING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY. EVEN THE RICHEST MAN IN RUSSIA CAN'T FIND A SHIRT. REMEMBER, IT WAS PROMISING THE RUSSIANS HE'D END THE SANCTIONS, THEN LYING ABOUT IT, THAT BROUGHT DOWN FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER OF POUTY-TOWN MICHAEL FLYNN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, NOW, THANKS TO AN ANONYMOUS WHISTLEBLOWER, WE KNOW THAT, DURING THE TRANSITION, FLYNN TOLD A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE THAT THE RUSSIA SANCTIONS WOULD BE "RIPPED UP." SO THEY COULD GO AHEAD WITH THEIR SECRET BUSINESS DEAL-- A JOINT PROJECT TO BUILD NUCLEAR REACTORS IN THE ARAB WORLD." WITH? ANY GUESSES? IT RHYMES WITH RUSSIA. IT'S RUSSIA. ( LAUGHTER ) COULD HAVE BEEN PRUSSIA. ( LAUGHTER ) IN FACT, FLYNN TEXTED HIS BUSINESS PARTNER "THAT THE PLAN WAS "GOOD TO GO." AND IF ALL THAT WASN'T BALLSY ENOUGH, FLYNN SENT THE TEXT WHILE HE WAS ON THE DAIS, DURING TRUMP'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS! HE WAS MAKING SECRET RUSSIA PLANS WHILE TRUMP WAS BEING SWORN IN! THAT'S LIKE INTERRUPTING YOUR WEDDING TO TEXT YOUR MISTRESS. "YEAH, I DO-- HOLD ON. YOU UP?" I'M SORRY, WHERE WERE WE? ( LAUGHTER ) ONE OF THESE TEXTS WAS APPARENTLY SENT SOMEWHERE AROUND 12:11. THIS IS TRUE -- LET'S SEE WHAT TRUMP WAS SAYING WHILE FLYNN WAS THUMB-TYPING HIS DEAL WITH RUSSIA.
EVERY DECISION ON TRADE, ON TAXES, ON IMMIGRATION, ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, WILL BE MADE TO BENEFIT AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN FAMILIES.
STEPHEN: "SPECIFICALLY, IT'LL BENEFIT MIKE FLYNN, AND MIKE FLYNN'S FAMILY. RIGHT, MIKE? MIKE, WHO ARE YOU TEXTING WHILE I'M TALKING? OH, THE GUYS WHO GAVE ME THE ELECTION? SAY HI." NOW, WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF CRAZY NEWS IN NATIONAL POLITICS, LET'S NOT FORGET THAT'S THERE'S ALSO SOME INSANE STUFF GOING ON AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS WEEK, IN PENNSYLVANIA, SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED DURING WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RUN-OF-THE-MILL COMMITTEE MEETING ON LAND USE.
THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS, GUYS. WE DON'T HAVE TO PROCEED ON THIS ONE. I HEAR YOU, I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME HARD FEELINGS. ( CROSSTALK )
REPRESENTATIVE BRADFORD, LOOK, I'M A HETEROSEXUAL. I HAVE A WIFE, I LOVE MY WIFE, I DON'T LIKE MEN, AS YOU MIGHT. BUT STOP TOUCHING ME ALL THE TIME. IT'S LIKE, KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELF. LIKE, IF YOU WANT TO TOUCH SOMEBODY, YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT MIGHT LIKE IT. I DON'T.
Stephen: WOW. I WOULD HATE TO BE THAT GUY'S TAILOR. "LOOK, I'M FLATTERED, BUT I DON'T NEED A ZIPPER FOR YOUR EASY ACCESS TO MY BATHING SUIT AREAS. I'M A STRAIGHT HETEROSEXUAL MAN MALE, WHO LIKES ALL THE LADY PARTS. I CAN NAME THEM." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WHO'S THE GUY WITH THE IRRESISTIBLY SEXY SLEEVE? IT'S STATE REPRESENTATIVE DARYL METCALFE, A STAUNCH OPPONENT OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WHO HAS SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND NO SURPRISE. AFTER GETTING TO SECOND BASE WITH DARYL'S ARM, HIS HANDSY COLLEAGUE REVEALED HIS GAY AGENDA.
I THINK WE'D BE WISE TO KEEP TO THE TOPIC OF, AS IT TURNS OUT, LANDLOCKED EASEMENTS. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT "LANDLOCKED EASEMENTS" MEANS: THE NON-POSSESSORY RIGHT TO USE AND/OR ENTER ONTO A PARCEL OF LAND WITHOUT PUBLIC ROAD ACCESS. BUT IN A SUPER GAY WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SARAH PAULSON IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I INTRODUCE YOU TO AN ORDINARY AMERICAN HERO. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THANK YOU, THANK YOU!
Stephen: FEELS SO GOOD!
Jon: FEELS SO GOOD!
Stephen: WELL, LISTEN, WE JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE REST OF THE SHOW TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ALL OUR VIEWERS, OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES SUFFERING UNDER THE THREAT OF THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES RIGHT NOW. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE, I THINK, HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS TODAY WHIPPING THOSE FIRES TO INCREDIBLE BLAZE. IT WAS ALREADY AN UNBELIEVABLE DISASTER AND NOW IT'S SPREADING EVEN FASTER. PLEASE, STAY SAFE, TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER, WHICH I KNOW YOU ARE, AND IF YOU PRAY, PRAY FOR RAIN OR AT LEAST THAT THE WINDS WILL STOP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, I KNOW, GIVE IT UP FOR CALIFORNIA. THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A LOT THIS YEAR. NOW, I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THIS SHOW IS SPENT TALKING ABOUT WORLD LEADERS OR CHATTING WITH CELEBRITIES, BUT THE "LATE SHOW" IS REALLY ABOUT YOU, EVERYDAY AMERICANS. IN THESE TROUBLING TIMES, YOU'RE THE ONES STANDING UP AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE: WHETHER IT'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE, PICKING UP LITTER, OR CEASING TO WEAR SOCKS WITH SANDALS, ALLEN-- GOOD GOD-- WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE LAUNCHING A NEW SEGMENT TO TELL THE STORIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO PRESENT PART ONE OF MY 323-MILLION-PART SERIES, "AMERICAN VOICES AND ALSO FACES." JIM? AMERICAN VOICES AND ALSO FACES. AMERICA, LAND OF AMBER GRAIN, PURPLE MOUNTAINS AND GLORY HOLES. AND THERE IS NO HOLE MORE GLORIOUS THAN JACKSON. SINCE THE 1890S, JACKSON, WYOMING, HAD ITS SHARE OF NOTABLE MAYORS, FROM AMERICA'S FIRST NERD COWBOY LESTER L. MAY, TO HAROLD LIVINGSTON, WHO WAS PREVIOUSLY THE MAYOR OF CARTOON TOWN, TO HENRY CRABTREE-- SEEN HERE WITH HIS HUMAN COMPANION -- AND, TODAY, MAYOR PETE MULDOON.
I'M PETE MULDOON. I'M THE MAYOR OF THE WONDERFUL TOWN OF JACKSON, WYOMING.
STEPHEN: PETE MOVED TO THIS IDYLLIC SKI TOWN 18 YEARS AGO.
I MOVED OUT HERE TO SKI FOR A WINTER AND THOUGHT I WOULD MOVE ON AND I NEVER LEFT.
STEPHEN: IS THE SKIING THAT GOOD?
WE'VE GOT THE BEST SNOW IN THE COUNTRY.
STEPHEN: HOW GOOD IS IT?
CHAMPAGNE POWDER.
STEPHEN: BUT TODAY, HE'S NO SKI BUM. BEING MAYOR TO THE 10,000 RESIDENTS OF JACKSON IS A FULL TIME JOB.
WELL, I WORK FOR SKY WEST THROWING BAGS. I HAVE A BAND, A COUNTRY BAND THAT I PLAY IN, AND I RUN A SMALL PRODUCTION COMPANY. AND THEN I'M THE MAYOR.
STEPHEN: IN FACT, HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE IN JACKSON THAT THE MAYOR HAS A ROOMMATE. MEET BOBBY.
BAM, DEPUTY MAYOR ( BLEEP ) RIGHT THERE. BACKHAND IT, BANG! IT'S BACK ON. ALL RIGHT, SORRY, WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?
STEPHEN: BOBBY ISN'T JUST THE MAYOR'S ROOMMATE. HE WAS ALSO A CAMPAIGN ADVISOR.
I HAD A LADY FRIEND AT THE TIME THAT WAS IN TOWN, AND SHE WAS WEARING YOGA PANTS, AND SHE LOOKED REALLY AWESOME IN THESE YOGA PANTS. SO WE TOOK HER TO ALBERTSON'S AND I PUT A COUPLE OF THE STICKERS ON THOSE YOGA PANTS, AND THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE MAN IN THAT STORE THAT DID NOT LOOK AT THOSE VOTE FOR PETE MULDOON STICKERS.
STEPHEN: AND IT WORKED.
YEAH.
STEPHEN: BUT JUST AS PETE TOOK OFFICE, A FEVER SWEPT THE COUNTRY, AND CONTROVERSIAL LANDMARKS COMMEMORATING AMERICA'S EMBARRASSING PAST WERE COMING DOWN. SO PETE DECIDED TO TAKE DOWN JACKSON'S MONUMENT TO AMERICA'S EMBARRASSING PRESENT-- THE TOWN'S OFFICIAL PORTRAIT OF DONALD TRUMP. DON'T GET PETE STARTED ON DONALD TRUMP. OKAY, SOMEBODY GET HIM STARTED.
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?
STEPHEN: JUST SAY ANYTHING.
I THINK HISTORY WILL JUDGE HIM.
STEPHEN: MEOW! GET THIS KITTY A SAUCER. SO, ON A TUESDAY THAT WILL ECHO IN HISTORY, PETE, SEEN HERE IN THE MAYOR MOBILE, MARCHED INTO TOWN HALL. LIKE WASHINGTON DIVING INTO THE DELAWARE, LIKE LINCOLN WINNING THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG, PETE MULDOON TOOK A STAND-- ON TOP OF A LADDER.
I WALKED INTO TOWN HALL ONE DAY AND TOOK THE PORTRAIT DOWN OFF THE WALL. AND I HANDED IT TO MY VICE MAYOR AND ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT.
STEPHEN: BUT THE BACKLASH WAS SWIFT, AND THE ANGER STARTED IN A PLACE YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS.
I THINK IT STARTED WITH A FACEOOK POST.
STEPHEN: OH, OKAY, THAT'S WHERE I GUESSED. THEN, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST, AND I'M GUESSING A GREAT WHISTLER, ZEB BELL WEIGHED IN.
THIS ARROGANT AND POMPOUS-- CLEAN IT UP, ZEB, WATCH YOUR THOUGHTS.
Stephen: DON'T HOLD BACK, ZEB. LET HER RIP.
THIS POMPOUS MAYOR...
STEPHEN: UH, OH, HE DROPPED THE M. WORD!
...OVER IN JACKSON, WYOMING, A LEFT-WING LOON, IS AMAZING.
NEXT THING WE KNEW, IT WAS FRONT PAGE OF FOX NEWS. THE ANGRY EMAILS AND DEATH THREATS STARTED ROLLING PRETTY QUICK.
STEPHEN: BUT THIS WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE MAYOR HAD FACED POLITICAL CONTROVERSY. ONCE AGAIN, BOBBY --
I CAME HOME ONE DAY, AND THE NEWSPAPER WAS RIGHT HERE AND PETE WAS A LITTLE UPSET. AND I SAID, "WHAT'S GOING ON?" HE SAID, "DID YOU READ THE FRONT PAGE?" AND I SAID, "YEAH." HE SAID, "THEY PRINTED IT ON THERE THAT I WAS DOING COCAINE OFF OF A WOMAN'S STOMACH." AND I GO, "SO DID YOU?" AND HE GOES, "WELL, THAT'S BULL-( BLEEP ) BECAUSE I WAS DOING COCAINE OFF OF HER (BLEEP).
STEPHEN: IS THIS TRUE, MR. MAYOR?
WE'VE GOT THE BEST SNOW IN THE COUNTRY.
STEPHEN: SERIOUSLY?
CHAMPAGNE POWDER.
STEPHEN: OKAY, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. WE JUST WANTED TO HEAR BOBBY TELL THAT STORY. ( LAUGHTER )
( BLEEP ) YEAH.
STEPHEN: MEANWHILE, THIS PORTRAIT SITUATION WAS SERIOUS. SO SERIOUS THAT HIS BAND, MAJOR ZEPHYR, WAS FIRED FROM THEIR WEEKLY GIG.
THE BAND ACTUALLY NEEDED THAT. IT'S ANOTHER SOURCE OF REVENUE, YOU KNOW? NOW THE MAYOR'S BACK DOWN TO SIX JOBS. HOW'S HE GOING TO SURVIVE?
STEPHEN: BUT GIG OR NO GIG, COWBOYS DON'T STAND DOWN. SO WHEN THE TOWN CALLED FOR A VOTE TO RESTORE THE PORTRAIT TO TOWN HALL, PETE MADE AN IMPASSIONED PLEA.
I CONTINUE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE DISPLAY OF PRESIDENTIAL PORTRAITS.
STEPHEN: ANYWAY, HE LOST, AND HE HAD TO PUT THE PORTRAIT BACK UP. ( SAD MUSIC ) BUT BECAUSE HE STOOD UP FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED IN FOR LIKE A WEEK, MAYBE A WEEK AND A HALF, THE "LATE SHOW" HAS COMMISSIONED THIS PORTRAIT CAPTURING THE COURAGEOUS MOMENT WHEN PETE TOOK DOWN THE OTHER PORTRAIT. MAY FUTURE GENERATIONS OF JACK-HOLIANS WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER MAYOR PETE MULDOON. AMERICAN VOICE, AMERICAN FACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, PETE! SARAH PAULSON IS HERE. AND LATER, I CHECK IN WITH MY FAVORITE INTERNET MOVIE REVIEWER. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU'RE IN LUCK. MY FIRST GUEST WON AN EMMY PLAYING MARCIA CLARK IN "THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON," AND HAS STARRED IN ALL SEVEN SEASONS OF "AMERICAN HORROR STORY." PLEASE WELCOME SARAH PAULSON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
THERE WAS A SCREAMER!
Stephen: YEAH, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: ALWAYS LOVELY TO TALK TO YOU.
IS IT?
Stephen: NO, IT REALLY IS. IS IT ALWAYS LOVELY TO TALK?
NO.
Stephen: OKAY. I KNOW THAT'S THE WRONG THING TO SAY.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU? I'M OKAY.
Stephen: YEAH? I'M DEALING WITH NORMAL HUMAN ANXIETY AND FEAR AND COUPLED WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, IT'S LAYING ME OUT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A TWITCHY EYE?
I DO.
Stephen: THIS EYE WON'T STOP TWITCHING EITHER.
IT'S BEEN TWITCHING SINCE JANUARY 20.
Stephen: I'M AFRAID TO EXAMINE WHY IT MIGHT BE TWITCHING.
DON'T GO THERE. NO LOOKING INSIDE.
Stephen: NOT TILL THE SHOW'S OVER. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE ME CRY.
THEY MIGHT, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: NO, THAT'S CRUEL. NOT FROM A PAIN, BUT JUST, LIKE, LOOK AT HIM WEEPING.
Stephen: LOOK AT HIM WEEPING. THAT'S HILARIOUS.
THAT IS SO FUNNY.
Stephen: NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN -- WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET AWAY FROM THE NEWS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I NEED. I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM THE NEWS FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
I DON'T HAVE THE LUCK OF WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO WHICH IS FUNNEL YOUR FEELINGS INTO YOUR COMEDY.
Stephen: BUT YOU GET TO GO BE AN ACTRESS AND PRETEND YOU'RE IN A WORLD THAT'S DIFFERENT.
RIGHT, BUT IT'S PRETEND.
Stephen: BUT AMERICAN HORROR STORY SEEMS VERY APPEALING.
I THINK IT SHOULD BE CALLED AMERICAN HORROR STORY, CURRENT EVENTS.
Stephen: WELL, THE THING IS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TIME TO WORRY BECAUSE, IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS, STRAP IN HERE, WON AN EMMY, GOLDEN GLOBE, SAG AWARD, TWO SEASONS OF "AMERICAN HORROR STORY," IN SPEILBERGS OF "THE POST," OCEANS EIGHT. RATCHET, GLASS, BIRD BOX, TALKS TO STAR IN THE GOLD FINCH. THAT SOUNDS AMAZING FROM THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE MOMENTS, THIS IS A SARAH PAULSON MOMENT.
YEAH, MAKES ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE.
Stephen: WHAT, BEING SUCCESSFUL?
YEAH, I CAN SORT OF ONLY IDENTIFY MYSELF WHEN I'M STRIVING TOWARDS SOMETHING AND NOW PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME AND IT'S A VERY STRANGE PHENOMENON.
Stephen: THAT PEOPLE WANT YOU.
YEAH, AND I USED TO IN THE EARLY PART OF MY CAREER GOING TO AN AUDITION AND I MISS BEGGING THEM TO HIRE ME.
Stephen: REALLY? I WAS A YOUNG ACTOR AND AUDITIONS ARE TERRIBLE.
I LOVE THEM.
Stephen: YOU DON'T GET THESE ANYMORE?
I HAVEN'T THE BEEN TO ONE IN A WHILE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, GREAT. IS IT SUSAN?
SARAH.
Stephen: THAT'S WONDERFUL. I'D LIKE TO GO AGAIN.
Stephen: YOU MADE SUPER SPECIFIC CHOICES.
I'M NOT LEAVING.
Stephen: REALLY GREAT. SECURITY, CAN YOU SEND IN THE NEXT GIRL, PLEASE?
NO, I GET REALLY LIKE ROCKY BAROCKYBALBOA. YOU JUST TELL ME TO GET OUT OF HERE.
Stephen: DOES THAT WORK? WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KEEP ME IN THE ROOM.
Stephen: TILL THE ORDERLIES COULD ARRIVE.
YOU JUST TELL ME WHENIO GET OUT OF HERE!
Stephen: OKAY, NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE POST." REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOVIE. IT'S YOU, IT'S SPEILBERG, TOM HANKS, MERYL STREEP AND IT'S THE STORY OF THE PENTAGON PAPERS PUBLISHED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST" IN THIS CASE.
I PLAY THE WIFE OF TOM HANKS WHO'S THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND MERYL STREEP PLAYS KAY GRAHAM, WHOSE HUSBAND DIED AND SHE HAD NOT TAKEN THE POSITION AND WHEN HE DIED SHE BECAME COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
Stephen: AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DO NOT REMEMBER DANIEL ELSEBERG WHO IS STILL WITH US AND INTERESTING GUY AND HE HAD HIS OWN BRAVE CHOICE WHICH WAS TO BRING FORTH THE PLANS TO EXPAND A WAR IN VIETNAM.
A TIME IN HISTORY WHEN AN ADMINISTRATION WAS SYSTEMATICALLY LYING TO THE PUBLIC AND CONGRESS, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT FEELS SO RELEVANT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AND SECRET PLANS. ECRET PLANS.
Stephen: AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TANNED "THE WASHINGTON POST" RACING TO GET THE STORY OUT BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT REALLY IS RESONANT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW, AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE TIMES HAS ALREADY GOTTEN --
THEY HAVE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE SUPREME COURT THEY NEED TO CEASE AND DESIST.
Stephen: THEY SAID "NEW YORK TIMES" YOU CAN'T ACCOMPLISH IT BUT THEN THE POST--- YOU CAN'T PUBLISH THEM BUT "THE POST" GETS THEM.
THEY COULD LOSE EVERYTHING. KAY GRAHAM, THIS PAPER HAD BEEN IN HER FAMILY. IT WAS HER LEGACY. IT WAS HER FAMILY. IT WAS EMOTIONAL, NOT JUST A BUSINESS DECISION. WOMEN AT THAT TIME, AND WE'RE IN A NEW WORLD ORDER CURRENTLY WHERE SHE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A VOICE AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND SHE FOUND A WAY TO DO IT.
Stephen: WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CLIP. DO YOU KNOW?
NO.
Stephen: OKAY. IT'S YOU AND TOM HANKS.
AND TOM HANKS AND I AND I BELIEVE TONY BRADLEY IS A SCULPTOR AND ARTIST AND IT'S A SCENE WHERE HE COMES TO ME AND THINKS HE'S BEING BRAVE FOR PUBLISHING IT AND I HAVE TO SET HIM STRAIGHT HE'S NOT THE BRAVE ONE.
YOU'RE VERY BRAVE. BUT KAY, KAY IS IN A POSITION SHE NEVER THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE IN, A POSITION I'M SURE PLENTY OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE. AND WHEN YOU'RE TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH, THAT YOUR OPINION DOESN'T MATTER AS MUCH, WHEN THEY DON'T JUST LOOK PAST YOU, WHEN, TO THEM, YOU'RE NOT EVEN THERE, WHEN THAT THE BEEN YOUR REALITY FOR SO LONG, IT'S HARD TO NOT LET YOURSELF THINK IT'S TRUE. SO TO MAKE THIS DECISION, TO RISK HER FORTUNE AND THE COMPANY THAT'S BEEN HER ENTIRE LIFE, WELL, I THINK THAT'S BRAVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN I'M WATCHING THAT IS THAT'S SOME WIG.
Stephen: I WOULD HAVE TOTALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR HEAR. YOU WERE ACTING LIKE THAT WAS YOUR HAIR.
THAT'S MY JOB, ACTING LIKE THE HAIR WAS SPROUTING OUT OF MY HEAD THAT WAY.
Stephen: HAD YOU EVER DONE A MOVIE WITH SPEILBERG.
HADN'T BEEN IN A ROOM WITH STEVEN SPEILBERG BEFORE.
Stephen: OH, WOW. I GOT A CALL SAYING WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET STEPHEN SPEILBERG ABOUT THIS MOVIE? I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT. I FELT APPAPLECTIC. I WAS SAYING, YOU TRY TO GET ME OUT OF THERE, STEPHEN! I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO WALK IN. THE DOOR OPENED, I HEARD HARP MUSIC, AND LIKE A MIRAGE, LIKE I HAD BEEN STRANDED IN THE SAHARA DESERT. IT'S LIKE A WAIVEY CAMERA. IT LOOKED LIKE A STEPHEN SPEILBERG IN A GAP MOVIE IN 1994. I STOOD UP AND SAID YOU'RE STEPHEN SPEILBERG. HE SAID YOU'RE SARAH PAULSON. I SAID RIGHT BUT YOU'RE STEPHEN SPEILBERG. EVERY DAY ON THE SET I WOULD SAY GOOD MORNING STEPHEN SPEILBERG. HE SAID YOU CAN CALL ME STEPHEN. I SAID, NO, YOU CANNOT, YOU'RE SHTEPHEN SPEILBERG. ( LAUGHTER )
JESSE CLEMENS, CROSS, ALL THESE PEOPLE, EVERY MORNING IN THE TRAILER, HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING? NO, I DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU START ON THIS MOVIE?
IN JUNE. IT WAS FAST. WE TURNED THIS PUP YARNED SUPER QUICK.
Stephen: THOUGHT YOU MADE IT A YEAR AGO AND HAD NO IDEA DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT.
OH, NO, HE WAS THERE.
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS, MAN.
Stephen: THE POST IS IN THEATERS FRIDAY DECEMBER 22. SARAH PAULSON, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MOVIE REVIEWER GIL PEACHES AND A SURPRISE GUEST. DON'T GO AWAY! PUSHED ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IT'S ALMOST OSCAR SEASON, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EXCITING ONE. UNLESS OSCAR GETS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. THE GUY'S WEARING NOTHING BUT A SWORD. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO SEE ALL OF THE BIG AWARD CONTENDERS, SO BEFORE I BUY A TICKET, I TURN TO THE ONLY REVIEWER I TRUST: GIL PEACHES, AND HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL, "NOT AT THE MOVIES, WITH GIL PEACHES." LET'S CHECK IN WITH HIM NOW. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. WELCOME TO "NOT AT THE MOVIES! WITH ME, GIL PEACHES." HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. OSCAR SEASON IS HERE, THAT TIME EACH YEAR WHEN MY UNCLE OSCAR INVITES ME OVER TO WATCH THE SUPER BOWL. ALSO, THERE'S A TON OF GREAT MOVIES OUT RIGHT NOW. AS ALWAYS, I'VE SEEN ALL THE BIGGEST FILMS OF THE YEAR, EXCEPT UNFORTUNATELY, "EMPLOYEES ONLY," BECAUSE I KEEP GETTING YELLED AT WHEN I TRY TO ENTER THAT THEATER. THE FIRST MOVIE GETTING SOME BUZZ IS "THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI." THIS MOVIE RAISED SOME BIG QUESTIONS, LIKE WHICH THREE BILLBOARDS WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT? I CHECKED MY GOOGLE STREET-VIEW AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BILLBOARDS IN MISSOURI. MANY OF THEM ARE FOR PLACES CALLED "GENTLEMAN'S CLUBS," BUT FOR SOME REASON, ONLY HAVE PHOTOS OF WOMEN. MIXED MESSAGE. I GIVE THIS MOVIE: THREE BILLBOARDS AND A MISSOURI. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELL I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN: OH, GREAT. I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT TODAY'S CO-HOST IS MY PRETENTIOUS COUSIN, PHIL PEACHES.
IT'S ACTUALLY PHILLIAM PEACHES, IV. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, COUSIN, OR AS THEY SAY IN EUROPE, CUISINE. AND I LOVED "THREE BILLBOARDS." MCDORMAND'S PERFORMANCE CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A "TOUR DE FRANCE." THUS, I GIVE IT MY FANCIEST RATING: FIVE PACKETS OF MCDONALD'S FANCY KETCHUP.
STEPHEN: THERE YOU GO WITH YOUR COASTAL ELITISM. PHILLIAM, WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
SOPHISTICATED URBANITES LIKE MYSELF DRINK CUCUMBER WATER. NEED I REMIND YOU, I'VE BEEN TO ANN ARBOR?
STEPHEN: I WAS WONDERING HOW LONG IT WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU TO BRING THAT UP AGAIN?
WELL, IT'S TRUE.
STEPHEN: AND SO IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAD TO CALL ME TO COME PICK YOU UP.
FOR I AM AFRAID OF BUSES.
STEPHEN: THE NEXT MOVIE PHILLIAM AND I SAW THIS WEEK WAS "LADY BIRD," WHICH, ONCE I GOT TO THE THEATER, I DISCOVERED WAS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT L.B.J.'S WIFE, MAKING MY COSPLAY EXTREMELY OUT OF PLACE.
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU WERE DRESSED AS BATMAN. THE MOVIE WAS PART DRAMA AND PART COMEDY, OR AS WE CINEPHILES CALL IT: A DROMEDARY. BECAUSE NOTHING IS SADDER OR FUNNIER THAN A ONE-HUMPED CAMEL.
STEPHEN: IT WAS THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF A TEENAGE GIRL'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HER MOM. WHICH REALLY SPOKE TO ME, BECAUSE I AM ALSO A PARENT, TO STEPHANIE.
HOW IS STEPHANIE?
STEPHEN: WE'RE NOT SPEAKING RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW, SHE TOLD ME.
STEPHEN: ALL IN ALL, I GIVE "LADY BIRD" TWO L.B.J.'S, AND A BATMAN.
WELL, I ADORED "LADYBIRD." IT HAD EVERYTHING US ARTISTIC TYPES LOVE: SMOKING, CRYING, AND A LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY AN ACTRESS WITH AN UNPRONOUNCEABLE NAME. BRAVO TO YOU, SNOWSHOE ROLAND. I GIVE THIS MOVIE FOUR NOBEL PRIZES AND A POET LAUREATE.
STEPHEN: THE LAST MOVIE WE'RE REVIEWING THIS WEEK IS "VACATIONLAND" BY JOHN HODGMAN.
OH, WHAT A STINKER! I COULDN'T EVEN FIT IT IN MY VCR. AND TALK ABOUT BORING! LOOK AT THIS! IT'S ALL WORDS! THE WHOLE MOVIE IS BASICALLY SUBTITLES. IF I WANTED TO READ, I'D BUY A BOOK. SPECIFICALLY, THIS BOOK.
"VACATIONLAND" IS A HIT MOVIE WAITING TO HAPPEN. MANY BLOCKBUSTER FRANCHISES START OUT AS BOOKS: "HARRY POTTER," "THE HUNGER GAMES..."
AND "FAST AND FURIOUS" IS BASED OFF OF "SENSE AND SENSIBILITY." ( LAUGHTER ) THEY REALLY TOOK A LOT OF LIBERTIES WITH THAT ONE. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT JANE AUSTEN COULD NOT DRIVE STICK.
STEPHEN: EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT YET A MOVIE, I'M GIVING "VACATIONLAND" MY HIGHEST POSSIBLE RATING: ONE STAR!
WELL, PERHAPS I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT ON MY RIDE BACK TO THE BIG CITY.
STEPHEN: WHICH I AM GIVING YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF BUSES. UNTIL NEXT TIME, THIS IS "NOT AT THE MOVIES," WITH ME, GIL PEACHES...
AND ME, PHILLIAM PEACHES IV.
STEPHEN: ...REMINDING YOU: JUST BECAUSE YOU BUY A TICKET DOESN'T MEAN THEY'LL LET YOU SLEEP ON THE FLOOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A BEST-SELLING HUMORIST, PODCASTER, AND FORMER "DAILY SHOW" CONTRIBUTOR. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN HODGMAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: PLEASED TO HAVE YOU HERE. I SHARED THE STAGE WITH YOU MANY TIMES. WE WERE AT TH THE "DAILY SHOW" TOGETHER.
NINE YEARS.
Stephen: EVERYONE HAD A CHARACTER. WHAT WAS YOUR CHARACTER? HOW DID YOU FIND YOURS. MINE WAS GIRALDO RIVERA MIXED WITH STONE PHILLIPS. WHAT WAS YOURS?
A LONG TIME I WAS A LUNATIC ACADEMIC. A FEW YEARS AGO, I NEEDED TO MIX IT UP. I STARTED TO NOTICE THIS DERANGED DILETTANTE CREEP WAS WANDERING ON TO CABLE NEWS SETS AND SPOUTING CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT OBAMA'S BIRTH, ALLOWED BECAUSE HE WAS ARGUABLY RICH. HE WAS DONALD TRUMP. I SAID WE NEED ONE OF THOSE FOR THE "DAILY SHOW," A RICH WHITE JERK THAT WANDERS OPENED AND SPOUTS NONSENSE.
Stephen: THAT WAS LONG BEFORE HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YES. THE DERAKED MILLIONAIRE WAS BORN AS A RESPONSE TO TRUMP. AS HE WAS GETTING MORE SERIOUS ABOUT RUNNIN RUNNING FOR PRESIDE WAS, LIKE, THIS IS NOT FUN FOR ME ANYMORE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A BOOK. YES, I DO. I WROTE IT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A BOOK, IT'S CALLED VACATIONLAND. THE FIRST HALF IS ABOUT YOUR TIME IN RURAL MASSACHUSETTS.
RIGHT, I'M NOT A CREATURE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT TO LOOK AT ME.
Stephen: YOU COULD BE A GENTLEMAN FARMER IN THE 18t 18th CENTURY.
I'M AN ASTHMATIC NERD WHO DOESN'T BELONG IN THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU DO? NOT WELL, TERRIFIED MOST OF THE TIME. IN MY EARLY 30s, MY MOM AND DAD HAD A LITTLE HOUSE IN RURAL MASSACHUSETTS AND MY MOM PASSED AWAY AND LEFT IT TO ME. MY DAD SAID, HERE'S HOW YOU RUN THE HOUSE. I SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. HE SAID, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE GARBAGE TO THE DUMP BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRASH COLLECTION. HE SAID IF YOU GO TO THE DONALD TRUMP AND THEY ASK YOU WHERE YOU LIVE, LIE TO THEM. HE SAID TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE STAYING WITH JACKIE BROWN IN COAL RING. NOW, MY FATHER IS NOT A FAN OF JACKIE BROWN, SHE WAS MY MOM'S FRIEND WHO LIVED IN THE TOWN WHERE THE DUMP WAS. MY DAD EXPLAINED WE WERE BREAKING THE RULES BY GOING TO THE CURVE BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE WRONG TOWN.
Stephen: DID YOUR TOWN HAVE A DUMP?
NO.
Stephen: WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THEIR BARGE? BARGE? -- THEIR GARBAGE?
I STILL DON'T KNOW. I HAD TO REHEARSE, STAY WITH JACKIE IN COAL RING. I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THE RULES, I WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES PERFECTLY SO THAT EVERYONE WILL APPROVE OF ME AND LOVE ME IN THE WORLD AND LYING TO THESE DUMPMEN SEEMED LIKE A REAL QUICK TICKET TO DISAPPROVAL. SO I WAS FULL OF FEAR EVERY TIME I WENT THERE AND, AFTER SEVEN YEARS, THEY HAD NEVER ASKED. AND THEN AFTER SEVEN YEARS SOMETHING HAPPENED.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED? JACKIE BROWN DIED. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING. IT WAS VERY SAD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DID THE DUMPMAN KNOW?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL THEM NOW.
Stephen: AND WHAT IS A DUMPMAN?
A DUMPMAN'S THE GUY WHO WORKS AT THE DUMP. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN OFFICIAL TITLE.
Stephen: SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK IS YOUR RURAL TIME IN MAINE.
YES.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT RURAL TIMES? IF YOU DON'T DO WELL IN ONE RURAL AREA, WHY ARE YOU DOUBLING DOWN ON THE RURALITY?
I HAD HOARDED FIVE YEARS OF GARBAGE IN MY GARAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE BOOK FOLLOWS ADVENTURES IN RURAL MASSACHUSETTS, THE PAINFUL BEACHES OF COASTAL MAINE WHERE MY WIFE ASSURED ME I WILL ACCEPT MY DEATH, AND THE OCEAN IS MADE OF HATE AND WANTS TO KILL YOU. YOU GET IN THERE AND YOUR BODY SCREAMS HYPOTHERMIA BEFORE IT DICE.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE FOURTH. A HAUNTED FOREST OF MIDDLE AGE WHICH CONNECTS THE TWO, THAT LEADS FROM MY YOUTHS TO MY DEATH WHICH IS WHAT I'M EXPERIENCING AND I GREW THIS HORRIBLE BEARD. ALL MEN HAVE TO GROW FACIAL HAIR TO ANNOUNCE TO THE WORLD, I'M DONE.
Stephen: I FIND THE OLDER I GET AND THE LESS TESTOSTERONE I PRODUCE, THE MORE I START TO LOOK LIKE AN OLDER WOMAN, AND I WANT TO GROW A BEARD BECAUSE IT IS, AT THIS POINT, MY ONLY SECONDARY MALE SEX CHARACTERISTIC.
YEAH. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO TELL THE WORLD THAT YOU NO LONGER DESERVE PHYSICAL AFFECTION.
Stephen: TRUE. YOUR EVOLUTIONARY PURPOSE IS SERVED, CHILDREN ARE OUT THERE, GOODBYE FOREVER.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PODCAST CALLED JUDGE JOHN HODGMAN WHERE YOU RENDER JUDGMENTS ON DOMESTIC SQUABBLES. WHAT'S THE CURRENT ONE.
IS A HOT DOG A SANDWICH.
Stephen: NO. IT IS MEAT BETWEEN TWO SLICES OF BREAD.
WANT ME TO EXPLAIN IT.
Stephen: SURE. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE AND A CHALKBOARD.
Stephen: 15 SECONDS. HOT DOG IS A SANDWICH, PREMISE. DISPROVE IT? CAN WE FIND A FALSIFYING CONSEQUENCE. YES. WHAT DOES A HOT DOG HAVE NOT EVERY SANDWICH HAS. WHALE YOU DO WITH A HOAGIE OR GRINDER YOU WOULD NEVER DO WITH A HOT DOG. YOU NEVER CUT IT IN HALF.
Stephen: IT'S A HAMBURGER SANDWICH.
A HAMBURGER.
Stephen: A HAMBURGER IS NOT A SANDWICH.
YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. I HAVE TO ACCEPT IT?
YOU DO AND HERE'S WHY.
Stephen: WHY IS THE HOT DOG THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE RULE.
NO, IT'S THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE EXCEPTION. ( LAUGHTER ) IF A HOT DOG BUSH IS A TACO A SANDWICH.
Stephen: NO. OF COURSE NOT, THAT WOULD BE CULTURAL APPROPRIATION, SANDWICH RACISM. BUT YOU --
Stephen: IT'S NOT SANDWICH ANYMORE THAN A SCHMOR IS A SANDWICH. I SAID MEAT BETWEEN TWO SLICES OF BRED.
WHERE'S YOUR LOGIC NOW?
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT A SUBWAY? WHAT ABOUT A SUB? IS A SUBA ISN'T WITCH? A SUBWAY SANDWICH, SIT A SANDWICH?
YES.
Stephen: IT'S A HINGED LOAF.
DO YOU CUT IT IN HALF?
Stephen: NO. URE YOU DO.
Stephen: I DON'T. WHAT DO YOU SAY OF SIX INCHES.
Stephen: I WILL SAY ANYTHING TO WIN THIS ARGUMENT.
LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU SAY A HOT DOG IS A SANDWICH, EVERYTHING IS A SANDWICH BECAUSE AFTER ALL WHAT ARE WE IF NOT MEAT WRAPPED IN FIBERS?
Stephen: I WOULD BE HONORED TO BE A SANDWICH. I IDENTIFY WITH A SANDWICH COMMUNITY.
THEN YOU ARE A SANDWICH AND ALL MY CLOTHING IS MADE OF BREAD.
Stephen: JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN: THE BOOK IS "VACATIONLAND." JOHN HODGMAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE MARK HAMILL AND BOBBY FLAY. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, KOBE BRYANT, AND MORGAN FREEMAN. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
