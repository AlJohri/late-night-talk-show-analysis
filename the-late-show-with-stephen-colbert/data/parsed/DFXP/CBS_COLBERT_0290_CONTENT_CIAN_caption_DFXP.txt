Captioning sponsored by CBS THAT'S HOW THE DEMOCRATS RAISED MILLIONS OF MEXICANS FROM THE DEAD TO VOTE AGAINST YOU.
WELL, I LOVE THAT ONE. I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU AS A FRIEND.
YES. FRIEND.
BANIE?
YES, MR. PRESIDENT?
IT'S JUST Y DON'T THE CELEBRITIES LIKE ME?
OH, DONIE, THEY'RE JUST AFRAID OF YOU.
REALLY?
YES. THEY THINK YOU'RE A BIG POWERFUL MAN WHO WILL BRING AN END TO THEIR WAY OF LIFE AND ALL LIFE ON EARTH.
AM I REALLY THAT POWERFUL.
OF COURSE I AM. NOW, NIGHT NIGHT. DON'T LET THE BED BUGS BITE.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, WE WELCOME WILL ARNETT. PETE MOLLESS AND COMEDIAN PAUL MECURIO. WITH JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. I AM YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT AND MAN T IS FRIDAY, RIGHT? THERE'S NO.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THESE PEOPLE ARE EXCELLENT LIARS BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY THURSDAY RIGHT NOW. HERE'S THE DEAL, WE TAPED THIS AHEAD OF TIME, OKAY. WE DID THIS ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS IS THE SECOND SHOW WE HAVE DONE ON THURSDAY. AND I'M ONLY TELLING THAT YOU IS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT'S THURSDAY BECAUSE WE JUST LEARNED MINUTES AGO, THIS IS TRUE, THAT THE 9th CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS HAS RULED THAT GEORGE AND AMAL CLOONEY ARE HAVING TWINS, EVERYBODY. SO EXCITING, SO EXCITING.
Jon: THAT'S REALLY NICE.
Stephen: FIRST JAY-Z AND BEYONCE, NOW GEORGE AMAL. SO EXCITING, NEXT YEAR THEY WILL FIGHT IN A PIT, ALL FOR CHARITY, OBVIOUSLY. DOCTORS AREN'T TELLING US ANYTHING ABOUT THE SEX OF THE CHILDREN, ALL THEY CAN TELL US IS THAT THEY ARE BREATHE TAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL. ALSO, AND THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUE, JUST MOMENTS AGO THE 9th CIRCUIT COURT HAS RULED THAT IT IS REFUSING TO REINSTATE TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: SO THINGS-- SO THINGS ARE STAYING THE WAY THEY ARE. FOR NOW. AND WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS NOTHING CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. NOW NOW LET'S GO BACK TO PRETENDING IT'S FRIDAY. EVERYBODY READY FOR THE WEEKEND, YOU GUYS? SO READY. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A FRIDAY CROWD, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHO COULD REALLY USE TIME OFF, HIGH WHITE HOUSE PRETION SECRETARY AND HOW SCHOOL WRESTLING COACH YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD RUN INTO, SEAN SPICER, HE HAS HAD A ROUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS. FOR ONE MELISSA McCARTHY RIPPED HIM A NEW SPICE HOLE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE BUT THE PRESIDENT, EVIDENTLY, WAS NOT LAUGHING BECAUSE APPARENTLY TRUMP THOUGHT A WOMAN PLAYING A MAN MAKES SPICER LOOK WEAK. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE MET MELISSA McCARTHY AND SHE COULD KICK THE ASS OF EVERY PAN IN THAT ADMINISTRATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: BUT IF THE PRESIDENT THINKS A WOMAN PORTRAYING SEAN SPICER MAKES HIM LOOK WEAK, THEN HE'S REALLY NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS PICTURE WE MADE OF A LITTLE GIRL PRETENDING TO BE DONALD 2RU6R7. (LAUGHTER) -- TRUMP. AND HE'S ESPECIALLY NOT GOING TO LIKE IT WHEN YOU RETWEET IT AT HIM WITH THE HASHTAG LARGER HANDS. AND, SHE COULD PALM A BASKETBALL, THAT KID AND WHILE ARGUING FOR TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN, WAS THIS TODAY, NO, THIS WAS THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WHILE ARGUING FOR TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN, SPICER EVIDENTLY REPEATEDLY CITED THE ATLANTA TERROR ATTACK. I DON'T REMEMBER ANY TERROR ATTACKS IN ATLANTA. AND NEITHER DOES CNN.
WHAT IS THE ATLANTA TERROR ATTACK.
STILL UNCLEAR WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: BY THE WAY, STILL UNCLEAR WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS ALSO TRUMP'S 2020 CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. (LAUGHTER) AND HE'LL MAKE IT. HE'LL MAKE IT. HE'LL RUN AGAIN. HE'LL RUN AGAIN. NOW LATER SPICER SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT IN AN EMAIL WRITING THAT WHEN HE REPEATEDLY SAID "ATLANTA" ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS HE CLEARLY MEANT ORLANDO. CLEARLY. PEOPLE GET ORLANDO AND ATLANTA MIXED UP ALL THE TIME. THAT'S WHY YOU ALWAYS HEAR CIVIL WAR BUFFS TALKING ABOUT GENERAL SHER MAN'S BURNING OF EPCOT. (LAUGHTER) I SAY WE MUST NEVER FORGET THE ATTACKS ON ATLANTA OR BOWLING GREEN. BECAUSE IF WE DO, THAT'S JUST PRE7-11 THINKING. AND TURNS OUT SPICER IS-- THIS IS WHAT WE ARE HEARING, THAT SPICER HAS NOT BEEN IMPRESSING THE BOSS EITHER. BECAUSE APPARENTLY TRUMP'S BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN SPICER'S PERFORMANCE AND HE'S BEGUN THE SEARCH FOR A NEW COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR. YEAH, HE'S GOT TO FIND A NEW GUY TO GO OUT THERE WITH THE PRESS. SURELY TRUMP KNOWS SOMEONE WHO CAN BE CALM AND CLEAR UNDER PRESSURE.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO [BLEEP] WITH ME! (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: I'LL SAY THIS, MEATLOAF IS LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN SPICER. AND YOU CAN TELL THE PRESSURE IS GETTING TO SEAN. WHEN A REPORTER ASKED TODAY WHY THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T TWEET ABOUT A TERROR ATTACK IN CANADA BUT DID TWEET MULTIPLE TIMES ABOUT NORDSTROM DROPPING IVANKA'S CLOTHING LINE SEAN SPICER GOT A LITTLE SPICEY.
THE COMPLAIN PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO TWEET ABOUT ANYTHING. HE'S TWEETING ABOUT THIS, HE'S NOT TWEETING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
I CAME OUT HERE AND ACTUALLY SPOKE ABOUT IT.
THE PRESIDENT'S TIME.
YOU ARE EQUATING ME ADDRESSING THE NATION HERE IN A TWEET. I MEAN THAT'S THE SILLIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: REALLY? SEAN? S THAT HE'S THE SILLIEST THING YOU'VE EVER HEARD? SILLIER THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TWEETING OUT WHATEVER TURD FLOATS TO THE TOP OF THE OLD PUNCH BOWL? SURELY, SURELY, SEAN,-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THAT'S SILLY? SURELY YOU'RE NOT SUGGEST BE, SURELY YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOUR PRESS BRIEFINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE UNFILTERED OPINIONS OF THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. I MEAN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM, IT'S NICE BUT IT ONLY HAS 49 SEATS. DONALD TRUMP HAS 24 MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS SO LET'S BE CLEAR. THE NEWS IS WHATEVER HE IS SAYING ON TWITTER. YOUR JOB IS TO CLEAN UP AFTER HIM. I MEAN IN THE CIRCUS, YOU WOULD NEVER SAY THE ELEPHANT WAS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE GUY WHO SHOVELS HIS POOP. SO LET'S JUST KEEP THIS IN MIND. THAT'S THE GIG. THINGS DO NOT LOOK GOOD, SEAN. YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET A HEAD START ON YOUR POST RETIREMENT MEMOIR LONG TIES, BIG LIES AND MADE UP CROWD SIZE, MY CRAZY THREE WEEKS IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I WOULD BUY THAT. I WOULD-- SAY I HAD TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY. WELL, VALENTINE'S DAY IS NEXT WEEK. AND THERE'S NOTHING GIVING A NICE CARD TO YOUR SPECIAL SOME ONE. IT IS THE KIND OF GESTURE THAT SAYS MY OFFICE IS NEAR A WALGREEN'S. BUT EVEN THE BEST VALENTINE'S DAY CARDS HAD TO START SOMEWHERE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE THEM DON'T ALWAYS NAIL IT ON THE FIRST TRY. WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME EARLY GREETING CARD EFFORTS IN OUR SEGMENT FIRST DRAFTS.
NO, NO, STUPID.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WHENEVER WE DO FIRST DRAFTS I NEVER DO IT ALONE. I ALWAYS DO IT WITH SOMEONE TO HELP ME. LET'S GO OUT HERE AND SEE IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ME DO FIRST DRAFTS TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT, SOMEBODY WANT TO-- ANYBODY? OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SURE, PLEASE. I WOULD LOVE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COME WITH ME, PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S YOUR NAME, PLEASE.

I THINK I WILL HOLD OFF.
Stephen: OKAY, WELL.

Stephen: WHO IS THE GENTLEMEN.

Stephen: CAN WE GET A SHOT OF ROY OUT THERE. HEY, ROY. HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND ROY BEEN MARRIED?
IT WILL BE 46 YEARS IN JULY.
Stephen: 46 YEARS. CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S FANTASTIC. WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP IS HERE, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN FIRST DRAFTS BEFORE.
I HAVEN'T.
Stephen: THIS IS HOW IT WORKS. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HOLD THESE AND PLEASE KEEP THEM IN THAT ORDER. WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO LIKE THE MAGICIAN ASSISTANT I WOULD LIKE YOU HAND ME THE TOP CARD WHEN I CALL FOR THE NEXT CARD. AND LET'S START NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WHAT WE DO ON FIRST DRAFT, PATTY, IS I READ YOU THE FINAL DRAFT OF A CARD AND THEN I SHOW YOU WHAT THE FIRST DRAFT WAS. WHICH WAS NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE FINAL DRAFT, ARE YOU ON BOARD?
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PREMISE OF THE JOKE.
YES.
Stephen: EXCELLENT. HERE IS THE FIRST ONE. I KIND OF LIKE THIS ONE. THIS IS A CUTE ONE THAT SAYS, YOU STILL DRIVE ME CRAZY. ALL RIGHT? THAT'S NICE. BUT THE FIRST DRAFT, JUST THE TOP ONE PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST DRAFT SAID IF YOU TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE WITHOUT REPLACING THE BAG ONE MORE TIME, I WILL PUT THE BAG OVER YOUR HEAD WHILE YOU SLEEP. WHILE I GOT YOU HERE, THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO AREN'T MARRIED OR THINKING ABOUT GETTING MARRIED. WHAT IS THE SECRET OF 46 YEARS, PATTY?
PERSISTENCE.
Stephen: PERSISTENCE. JUST KEEP GRINDING ON. KEEP GRINDING ON, NO MATTER WHAT. EXSLEBTS. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS, I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE HERE. IT SAYS YOU MAKE MY HEART SKIP A BEAT, BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID, PLEASE STOP FEEDING ME SO MUCH SAUSAGE.  VERY NICE PEOPLE, THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE IS A VALENTINE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY THAT SAYS FRIENDS MAY COME AND GO BUT A SISTER IS FOREVER. NICE. THAT'S SWEET. SWEET. BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE BECKY YOUR MAID OF HONOR?

YOUNGER BROTHER.
Stephen: ARE YOU A BOSSY OLDER SISTER.

Stephen: I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE. SO HERE'S A NICE ONE IT SAYS ON THIS VALENTINE'S DAY, I GIVE ALL MY LOVE TO YOU. OKAY? VERY SWEET, VERY SWEET, FIRST DRAFT WASN'T QUITE AS GOOD.

Stephen: ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE LOVED ONES THAT YOUR CHILDREN HAVE FOUND?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: OKAY FRK YOU SAY NO, I WILL JUST CUT IT OUT OF THE SHOW. YOU CAN BE TOTALLY HONEST. HERE'S ONE, IT SAYS YOU'VE GOT THE BIGGEST HEART OF ANYONE I KNOW, ALL RIGHT.

SURE.
Stephen: AT SOME POINT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WE DECIDED AGAINST IT.
WE DID DECIDE AGAINST IT BECAUSE AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW LOW THE THRESHHOLD WAS.
Stephen: AND YOU AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.
ABSOLUTELY. THAT WOULD BE OUR PLATFORM, RIGHT. WE ARE BEYOND UNQUALIFIED.
Stephen: THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE, 2016.

YEAH, YEAH. (APPLAUSE) THAT WAS-- THAT WAS A REALLY-- THAT WAS A REALLY SPECIAL DAY, THE WOMEN'S MARCH WAS INCREDIBLE AND I SAID THIS BEFORE, THE GREATEST PART FOR ME WAS GETTING A TEXT FROM MY MOM AND HER SAYING HOW PROUD SHE WAS AND THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME. I HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT WOMEN IN MY LIFE INCLUDING MY MOMS AND MY SISTERS. MY POSITION IS I WILL BE DAMNED IF THEY WILL BE TREATED LIKE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. SO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: ARE HAVE YOU MARCHED, YOU HAVE DONE ANY POLITICAL ACTION, DONE ANY MARCHING IN THE STATES?
I HAVE NOT REALLY DONE ANY POLITICAL ACTION-- OR MARCHING, RATHER, IN THE STATES.
Stephen: I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERE OR THERE.
WHAT WAS GREAT BEING THERE WAS, LET'S BRING IT DOWN FOR A MINUTE. WHAT WAS GREAT BEING THERE WAS WHEN YOU REALIZED THE IMPACT THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS ON A GLOBAL SCALE. AND HOW MUCH WHAT WE DO IN OUR POLICIES, ET CETERA, HAVE OVER THERE AND REALLY TOUCH THE LIVES OF PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.

Stephen: LIKE THE HEY HEY HO HO, HELLO GUF, HELLO GUF.
THEY WERE VERY INTO IT, I WILL SAY THAT. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. IT REALLY WAS IT WAS A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE ARE LIKE SORRY, SORRY. THEY'RE JUST VERY, THEY'RE JUST A VERY-- THEY PUT A LOT OF VALUE ON-- ON BEING CIVIL WITH ONE ANOTHER. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE COULD PROBABLY LEARN FROM THAT.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE LOVELY. WELL, JUST TO BE CIVIL, I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON US WHILE WE TAKE A SHORT COMMERCIAL BREAK.
I DON'T MIND AT ALL, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE WILL ARNETT.

IT WILL BE REALLY FUN. WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE RECORDING BOOTH. FOR ANYONE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN TO A RECORDING BOOTH, IT IS A CLOSET BUT MORE BORING.

WHEN I'M HUNGRY I CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE FRIDGE AND GET A POP, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS WRONG WITH ME. YOU HAVE ME SITTING IN SANTA'S LAP. DO YOU WANT ME TALKING TO STRANGERS OR DON'T YOU. AND THIS, THIS, I SEE YOU, ALL RIGHT. (APPLAUSE) NOW LOOK, I LOVE MY KID, I LOVE MY FAMILY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A KID TO RELATE TO THIS. IT'S OVERW4E8 AMING. IT IS EXHAUSTING, RIGHT, OKAY.

SO HOW ARE WE DOING, JON? I ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK A FOREIGN LANGUAGE. I WAS GOING TO TAKE A COURSE, BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE. SO INSTEAD, YOU COULD USE THIS IDEA, I'M LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE BY READING THE OWNERS MANUALS TO MY ELECTRONICS. (LAUGHTER) YEAH.
