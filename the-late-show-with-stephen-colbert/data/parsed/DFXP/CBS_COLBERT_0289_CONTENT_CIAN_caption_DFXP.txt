LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE BEATLES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ OH, YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ♪ ♪ I THINK YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ♪
IS THIS APPROPRIATE FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT?
NO! WHAT'S WITH ALL THIS I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND STUFF? BEFORE MARRIAGE? WHEN DID MUSIC BECOME SO SEXUALLY CHARGED!
Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT IT. MY WIFE AND I DIDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT TILL OUR THIRD CHILD. THEN I CRIED AND WENT STRAIGHT TO CONFESSION.
AH, THIS IS JUST FOOLISH BEHAVIOR.
Stephen: THESE GIRLS ARE UNHINGED! YOU'RE UNHINGED! ( SCREAMING )
Stephen: WAIT! WHAT'S THIS? ( BIG BAND )
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES DAVID OYELOWO, TARAN KILLAM AND MUSICAL GUEST RAE SREMMURD, FEATURING "STAY HUMAN," JON BATISTE. NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON! HEY, CHRIS! WHAT'S UP? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! GOOD TO SEE YA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING! ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT. ESPECIALLY ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO BRAVED A SNOWSTORM TO BE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S GREAT. YEAH. ( PIANO RIFF ) THE GOOD NEWS IS NOW YOU'RE HERE IN THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER, WHERE IT'S ABOUT TWO DEGREES WARMER THAN IT IS OUTSIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR ANYONE WATCHING IN THE SUNNY SOUTH, THE NORTHEAST GOT SLAMMED WITH SNOW TODAY. HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, WE GOT TEN INCHES-- AND FOR ONCE, IT WASN'T A TEXT FROM ANTHONY WEINER. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S JEFFERSON. I THINK IT'S JEFFERSON. THAT MIGHT BE GENEROUS. MAYBE TWO TEXTS TOGETHER. THIS IS THE FIRST BIG WINTER STORM WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR. THE WEATHER CHANNEL CALLED IT WINTER STORM NIKO. NIKO, NAMED, OF COURSE, FOR THE TOUR GUIDE WHO GOT YOUR COUSIN PREGNANT ON HER SEMESTER ABROAD IN ATHENS. ( LAUGHTER ) NEW YORK'S NOT ALONE. SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED ALL OVER THE NORTHEAST. SHOULD HAVE NAMED IT "WINTER STORM BETSY DEVOS." ( LAUGHTER ) NIKO IS GOOD, TOO. ( PIANO RIFF ) FRIEND OF YOURS? WASHINGTON, D.C. ALSO GOT A DUSTING.
Jon: OH, WOW. DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN MAKING A SNOW MAN EARLIER TODAY. THEN BECAUSE IT WAS WHITE, HE APPOINTED IT TO HIS CABINET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MAN! IT'S COLD IN HERE! JUST GOT COLDER IN HERE! ( LAUGHTER ) ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY, I'M PRETTY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE NUMBER ONE TRENDING TOPIC ON TWITTER EARLIER TODAY WAS "HASHTAG SNOWSTORM." SNOWSTORM? WHERE'S YOUR IMAGINATION, TWITTER? IN YEARS PAST, WE HAD "HASHTAG SNOWPOCALYPSE" AND "HASHTAG SNOWMAGGEDON," BUT NOW WE'RE JUST GOING WITH "HASHTAG SNOWSTORM?" WE NEED SOMETHING FOR 2017. IT'S SO OBVIOUS: "HASHTAG FLAKE NEWS!" ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT SURE IT SNOWED TODAY. I DON'T BUY IT! ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP: YESTERDAY, I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE FEUD BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND NORDSTROM'S. DUE TO BAD SALES, THE DEPARTMENT STORE STOPPED SELLING IVANKA'S CLOTHES, SO THE PRESIDENT TWEETED THAT SHE WAS BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY. SO THIS MORNING, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SENT KELLYANNE CONWAY TO DEFEND IVANKA, INC. ON "FOX AND FRIENDS."
GO BUY IVANKA'S STUFF, IS WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU! I HATE SHOPPING, I WILL GO GET SOME MYSELF TODAY. THIS IS JUST A WONDERFUL LINE. I OWN SOME OF IT, I FULLY-- I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE A FREE COMMERCIAL HERE. GO BUY IT TODAY, EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN: AND YOU CAN TRUST KELLYANNE CONWAY'S FASHION ADVICE. MOST HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BANDS ALREADY DO. ( DRUM CADENCE )
Stephen: THAT WAS GOOD! ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS NICE. BUT WATCHING THAT IS WEIRD. DON'T YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE AGAINST THE RULES FOR A WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE TO SHILL PRODUCTS. ( APPLAUSE ) IT IS. THESE KINDS OF RULES CALLED "LAWS"-- SPECIFICALLY, THE LAW STATING "AN EMPLOYEE SHALL NOT USE HIS PUBLIC OFFICE FOR THE ENDORSEMENT OF ANY PRODUCT OR FOR THE PRIVATE GAIN OF FRIENDS OR RELATIVES." ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: YEAH. VERY IMPORTANT LAW. VERY IMPORTANT LAW. IT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR A LONG TIME. THAT WAS WRITTEN AFTER THE 1882 WHITE HOUSE ENDORSEMENT OF CHESTER A. ARTHUR'S MUTTONCHOP BANGLES! ( LAUGHTER ) GOT A LOT OF MONEY. ALL THE MEN WORE THEM. AND EARLIER TODAY SEAN SPICER ASSURED US THE WHITE HOUSE WAS TAKING THE APPROPRIATE STEPS.
KELLYANNE HAS BEEN COUNSELED, AND THAT'S ALL THAT WE'RE GOING WITH. SHE'S BEEN COUNSELED ON -- ON -- ON THAT SUBJECT, AND... THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WHAT KIND OF COUNSELING ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? IS THAT LIKE CAMP COUNSELOR? IS SHE WORKING ON HER MERIT BADGE IN ETHICS? OR IS THIS A EUPHEMISM FOR SOMETHING SLIGHTLY HARSHER? "YOU WON'T SEE KELLYANNE AROUND ANYMORE-- SHE'S COUNSELING WITH THE FISHES." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF YOU DO WANT TO BUY IVANKA'S PRODUCTS, YOU'D BETTER HURRY BECAUSE "T.J. MAXX AND MARSHALLS EMPLOYEES WERE INSTRUCTED TO STOP FEATURING IVANKA TRUMP MERCHANDISE AND TO THROW AWAY IVANKA TRUMP SIGNAGE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW IT'S NEVER A GOOD SIGN WHEN THEY WON'T SELL YOUR CLOTHES IN MARSHALLS, HOME OF THE LOOSE UNDERWEAR BIN. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S JUST THREE WEEKS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY AND HE'S ALREADY ATTACKING AMERICA'S ENEMIES STARTING WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. AFTER A FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKED HIS "DEFINITELY NOT A MUSLIM BAN," TRUMP ANGRILY TOOK TO TWITTER TO CALL HIM A "SO-CALLED JUDGE." OF COURSE, BEING FROM REALITY TV, TRUMP DOESN'T CONSIDER SOMEONE A REAL JUDGE UNLESS THEY'RE SITTING NEXT TO HOWIE MANDEL. EVEN TRUMP'S OWN SUPREME COURT PICK, NEIL GORSUCH, DOESN'T LIKE TRUMP ATTACKING A JUDGE. HE TOLD A U.S. SENATOR THAT TRUMP'S COMMENTS WERE "DISHEARTENING" AND "DEMORALIZING." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. ADDING, "GO NORDSTROM!" ( LAUGHTER ) GORSUCH'S COMMENTS WERE MADE TO CONNECTICUT SENATOR AND MAN CARVED FROM A SINGLE PIECE OF WOOD, RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER BLUMENTHAL SPILLED THE BEANS, TRUMP TWEETED, "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, WHO NEVER FOUGHT IN VIETNAM WHEN HE SAID FOR YEARS HE HAD-- MAJOR LIE-- NOW MISREPRESENTS WHAT JUDGE GORSUCH TOLD HIM? QUESTION MARK." NO, HE DID NOT. PERIOD. A SPOKESMAN FOR GORSUCH CONFIRMED THE JUDGE SAID IT. BUT, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS-- TRUMP IS RIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING. AAAGH. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I FEEL LIKE MY HEART IS CRYING. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL -- SENATOR BLUMENTHAL DID CLAIM HE SERVED IN VIETNAM WHEN, IN REALITY, HE WAS A MARINE RESERVE IN WASHINGTON D.C., WHERE DID THINGS LIKE FIXING A CAMPGROUND AND ORGANIZING A TOYS FOR TOTS DRIVE. SO HE DIDN'T SEE COMBAT, BUT HIS G.I. JOES DID. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, THEY WERE FIGHTING COBRA. BUT IF I WERE TRUMP I WOULDN'T BRING UP VIETNAM. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE WENT TO MILITARY SCHOOL AND KNOWS MORE THAN THE GENERALS, HE WAS GRANTED FIVE DRAFT DEFERMENTS, INCLUDING ONE FOR BONE SPURS IN HIS HEELS. TRUMP'S TRAGIC 'NAM STORY WAS CAPTURED IN THE FILM, "APOCALYPSE 'OW'." ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD FILM. SEEN THAT? ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: REAL NICE FILM.
Stephen: THE HORROR. TRUMP MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF ANY GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE, BUT PEOPLE ELECTED HIM BECAUSE HE'S A BUSINESSMAN. HE KNOWS MONEY... I ONCE IMAGINED. BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE HUFFINGTON POST, RECENTLY, "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE DOLLAR: WAS IT A STRONG ONE THAT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY? OR A WEAK ONE?" FOLLOW-UP: SHOULD A PRESIDENT KNOW STUFF OR NOT KNOW STUFF? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO -- ( PIANO RIFF ) NOW, TRUMP HAS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF ECONOMIC EXPERTS WORKING FOR HIM, BUT INSTEAD HE CALLED HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, MIKE FLYNN, AT 3:00 A.M. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN ANNOYING, BUT STILL, BETTER THAN FLYNN GETTING A 3:00 A.M. TEXT FROM TRUMP THAT SAYS "U UP?" ( LAUGHTER ) I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS UP LATE AT NIGHT CALLING THE WRONG PEOPLE. FOR ANSWERS TO BASIC QUESTIONS-- ( PHONE RINGING ) I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. THAT'S ME. I SHOULD HAVE TURNED THE PHONE OFF. I'M GETTING A CALL. HELLO?
STEPHEN, HI. DONALD TRUMP HERE.
STEPHEN: MR. PRESIDENT! THIS IS A SURPRISE.
YEAH. WELL, I WANTED TO ASK YOU: IS IT THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT OR FOUR?
STEPHEN: THAT'D BE THREE-- THE EXECUTIVE, THE LEGISLATIVE AND THE JUDICIAL.
HEY, GOT ANOTHER ONE. IS IT MORE ROCK AND LESS TALK? OR MORE TALK AND LESS ROCK?
Stephen: IT'S MORE TALK.
OKAY, LIGHTNING ROUND! WHEN PIZZA'S ON A BAGEL, CAN YOU HAVE PIZZA ANYTIME?
Stephen: YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT. I'M SURE YOU CAN HAVE PIZZA ANYTIME, SIR.
WHAT CAME FIRST, "FRASIER" OR "CHEERS?"
STEPHEN: "CHEERS."
OKAY, LAST ONE. THERE ARE TWO GUARDS -- ONE OF THEM ONLY TELLS THE TRUTH, AND ONE OF THEM ONLY TELLS LIES. WHICH ONE DO I MAKE MY PRESS SECRETARY?
STEPHEN: MR. PRESIDENT, I'M SORRY, BUT I'VE GOT A SHOW  TO DO.
THAT'S OKAY. I'VE GOT TO GO, TOO. I'M CALLING A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS TO FIND OUT WHY THERE ISN'T MOUNTAIN DEW IN THE WHITE HOUSE WATER FOUNTAINS. CLICK.
STEPHEN: DID YOU JUST SAY CLICK?
YEAH, I'M STILL HERE. ONE MORE QUESTION: HOW DO YOU HANG UP A PHONE?
STEPHEN: PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, EVERYONE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. DAVID OYELOWO IS HERE, AND, WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL REVEAL SOME OF MY DARKEST MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. AND TARAN KILLAM. STICK AROUND! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FOLKS, IF YOU'RE REGULAR WATCHERS OF THE SHOW, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW BY NOW, I'M A CATHOLIC. SORRY, LADIES. BUT I CAN'T ALWAYS FIND THE TIME TO GET TO CHURCH AND I REALLY MISS MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITION: CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
AUDIENCE: OF COURSE NOT!
STEPHEN: GREAT. THIS IS "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!" ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, WAIT RIGHT THERE. ( ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE. WHEN SOMEONE SENDS ME A "SAVE THE DATE" CARD, I DON'T EVEN SAVE THE CARD. ( LAUGHTER ) I LIKE BEING AN ADULT, BUT I WISH ALL MY SHOES WERE STILL VELCRO. I'M LESS CONCERNED WITH OVERFISHING THAN I AM ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF GOLDFISH CRACKERS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) THOSE SURE ARE SALTY. I'M A MAN IN HIS 50S WHO EATS LIKE A MAN IN HIS 20S WHO DOESN'T PLAN TO MAKE IT TO HIS 30S. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES I GO TO THE BATHROOM JUST TO CHECK MY PHONE WITHOUT SEEMING RUDE. ( FLUSHING SOUND ) ( APPLAUSE ) SOMETIMES WHEN I CHECK IN TO A HOTEL, I USE SOME SILLY MADE-UP NAME-- LIKE "TARAN KILLAM."
EXCUSE ME. THAT IS MY ACTUAL, GOD-GIVEN NAME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )Y ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT SPREADER TRUCK THAT COATS THE HIGHWAY IN A SNOWSTORM? THAT'S HOW MUCH SALT I PUT ON MY FRIES. SOMETIMES I BREW A POT OF COFFEE JUST FOR THE SMELL   AND EAT A PINT OF ICE CREAM JUST FOR THE MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T SAY "SPOILER ALERT" BEFORE GIVING AWAY THE ENDING TO A MOVIE. OR SERVING BAD CLAMS. ( LAUGHTER ) LAST WEEK, I OPENED MY NEIGHBOR'S MEDICINE CABINET, BUT ONLY BECAUSE I WAS DRUNK AND THOUGHT IT WAS THE DOOR. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK WOMEN LOOK GREAT IN STILLETO HEELS, BUT IF I WERE A WOMAN AND A MAN ASKED ME TO WEAR THEM, I WOULD MURDER HIM WITH MY SHOES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHEN THE TREADMILL ASKS ME TO ENTER MY WEIGHT, I DO... FROM THAT ONE TIME I HAD MONO IN COLLEGE. IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE 2,000 AUTHORS I'VE HAD ON MY SHOW OVER THE YEARS, I DIDN'T READ YOUR BOOK. ( APPLAUSE ) BED, BATH, AND BEYOND ARE MY THREE FAVORITE LOCATIONS TO HAVE SEX. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE?
AUDIENCE: WE FORGIVE YOU!
STEPHEN: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DAVID OYELOWO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATED ACTOR BEST KNOWN FOR PLAYING MARTIN LUTHER KING IN "SELMA" AND NOW STARS IN A "A UNITED KINGDOM."
WHAT'S THIS SONG SUPPOSED TO BE?
I DON'T KNOW BUT THEY ARE UTTERLY BUTCHERING IT. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK OUT THE MELODY SINCE THEY BEGAN. ( LAUGHTER )
I DO LOVE JAZZ BUT I'VE NEVER TRUSTED AN ENGLISHMAN TO PLAY IT. ( LAUGHTER )
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME DAVID OYELOWO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) THAT WAS A NICE THEATER BOW YOU GAVE. VERY NICE.
I'VE JUST BEEN DOING A PLAY, SO I FEEL AT HOME HERE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BEFORE WE GET STARTED WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT YOU AND A "A UNITED KINGDOM." I WANT TO SAY THE MOVIE AND YOUR PERFORMANCE IN "QUEEN OF KATWE" WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT IT'S A TREMENDOUS MOVIE ABOUT A TEACHER WHO BELIEVES IN STUDENTS, TEACHES THEM CHESS IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS OF POVERTY IN UGANDA AND IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE AND A TRUE STORY AND VERY UPLIFTING.
ROBERT KATENDE WHOM I PLAY IN THE FILM IS AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING. IT'S HUMBLING TO GET TO PLAY HIM.
Stephen: YOU ALL DO CURTAIN CALLS WITH THE PEOPLE YOU PLAY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE.
YES.
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU WERE BORN IN THE U.K.
YES.
Stephen: WENT BACK TO NIGERIA WHERE YOUR FAMILY IS FROM. HOW LONG DID YOU LIVE THERE?
FROM 6 TO 13.
Stephen: YOU CAME BACK TO THE U.K.
YES IS THAT HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THEATER?
IT ALWAYS INVOLVES A GIRL, DOESN'T IT?
Stephen: SOME OF THE BEST STORIES DO, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
NO, WE WERE GOING TO THIS CHURCH WHERE I LIVED IN NORTH LONDON AND I WAS OBSESSED WITH MY PASTOR'S DAUGHTER. OTHERS' WERE OBSESSED WITH THEIR PASTOR'S DAUGHTER AS WELL. I CAUGHT SOME RECOGNITION THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT HAVE ENJOYED ME BEING WITH HIS DAUGHTER. BUT SHE USED TO WORK THE OVERHEAD PROJECTOR AND I WOULD SIT IN THE BACK OF THE CHURCH. I DIDN'T LISTEN TO A SINGLE SERMON FOR PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR. ONE DAY, SHE CAME UP TO THE END OF THE SERVICE AND INVITED ME TO THE THEATER. I THOUGHT IT WAS TO GO ON A DATE TO SEE THE PLAY. I TURNED UP AT THE SUBWAY STATION WITH A ROSE PLUCKED FROM MY MOTHER'S GARDEN AND -- ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I KNOW. IT'S A TRAGIC ENDING, BY THE WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) I WALK UP TO HER WITH THE ROSE AND THE LOOK SHE GAVE ME CLEARLY STATES SHE DID NOT SEE THIS THE WAY I SAW THIS. SO I DROP THE ROSE, WE GET ON THE TRAIN, GO TO THE THEATER, AND SHE TAKES ME BACKSTAGE TO A ROOM WHERE IT'S A YOUTH THEATER WHERE THEY'RE LOW ON BOYS. I WALK INTO THIS ROOM AND THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF WARMING UP. ANY ACTORS HERE? ( CHEERING ) OKAY. SO YOU KNOW WHAT WARMING UP LOOKS LIKE ( SILLY NOISES ) SO I THOUGHT MY PASTOR'S DAUGHTER HAD TAKEN ME TO A CULT, BASICALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I KEPT GOING BECAUSE I LIKED HER THAT MUCH, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU KNOW, I CAUGHT THE BUG.
Stephen: WELL, YOUR PERFORMANCE IN "SELMA" AS MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS ALSO BEAUTIFUL. WHAT DID IT TAKE TO GET INTO THAT PERFORMANCE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: HOW LONG DID YOU SHOOT THAT? WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE IN CHARACTER AS MARTIN LUTHER KING?
WE SHOT THAT FOR TWO TO THREE MONTHS. YEAH, I MEAN, TO PLAY SOMEONE OF THAT MAGNITUDE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO THERE, SO TO SPEAK. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH FOR REST WHITAKER ON A FILM I DID CALLED "LAST KING OF SCOTLAND" AND DANIEL DAY LEWIS MY FAVORITE ACTOR OF ALL TIME IN LINCOLN, AND THOSE GUYS STAYED IN CHARACTER THE WHOLE TIME, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A LITTLE INDULGENT, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF FOR REST WHITAKER, BY THE WAY. HE WAS PLAYING A D UGANDAN DICTATOR. ( LAUGHTER ) I REMEMBER IN THE HOTEL IN UGANDA WHERE WE SHOT IT, A VERY YOUNG ACTOR AT THE TIME SAID, HI, FO FORREST! ( GROWLING ) ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU CAN'T DENY THE RESULTS.
Stephen: SO YOU WERE IN CHARACTER ALL THE TIME? ON AND OFF SET?
YEAH, WELL, WE SHOT A LOT OF IT IN ATLANTA, AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY DR. KING IN ATLANTA WHERE HE'S FROM, GOING AROUND SAYING, HI, I'M DAVID AND PLAYING DR. KING, DOESN'T ENGENDER MUCH CONFIDENCE. SO I DECIDED TO STAY IN CHARACTER.
Stephen: LIKE IN STARBUCKS -- I HAVE A DREAM OF A CINNAMON CHIP SCONE! GIVE IT TO ME NOW! GOT TO GET TO THE MOUNTAIN TOP, PLEASE. ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY, DIDN'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE?
WELL, IT WAS DISTRESSING FOR MY WIFE, SHALL WE SAY. NOT ONLY DID SHE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A HUSBAND WHO WAS SUDDENLY 30 POUNDS HEAVIER, BUT WE WERE MOVING HO HOUSE AT THE TIME AND  CALLED ME AND SAID, OKAY, DAVID, WHAT IS WE'RE GOING TO DO, THE BROWN OR THE GREY CURTAINS? WELL, I THINK, UH, WE NEED TO, UH -- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! I CANNOT TALK CURTAINS WITH DR. KING. WE ARE GOING TO PICK THIS UP AFTER THE SHOOT -- WHICH WE DID. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THE NEW FILM IS CALLED A "A UNITED KINGDOM." WHO WAS SERETSE KHAMA?
THE HARE TO THE THROWN OF BOTSWANA AND HE WAS IN LONDON STUDYING LAW SOON AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR. AFTER THAT, HE WAS GOING TO GO BACK AND BE KING OF HIS COUNTRY BOTSWANA.
Stephen: HE WAS THE CROWN PRINCE.
EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS WHITE GIRL, AND, UNDERSTANDABLY, HIS PEOPLE WERE NOT DOWN WITH HAVING A WHITE QUEEN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THEN AGAIN, NEITHER WAS SOUTH AFRICA WITH THE IDEA OF AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE.
Stephen: DID THEY HAVE SOME SAY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BOTSWANA?
NOT LITERALLY, BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH A POWERFUL NATION IN RELATION TO GREAT BRITAIN, THIS WAS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE COLD WAR WAS JUST STARTING UP. SOUTH AFRICA WAS SUPPLYING GREAT BRITAIN WITH URANIUM TO FIGHT THE WAR, SUPPLYING GREAT BRITAIN WITH GOLD AND THREATENING TO LEAVE THE COMMONWEALTH IF THEY ALLOWED A MARRIAGE TO TAKE PLACE JUST ACROSS THE BOARDER IN BOTSWANA TO HAPPEN. SO GREAT BRITAIN HAPPENED DISGRACEFULLY, IN MY OPINION, AND DECIDED TO EXILE THE TWO FROM THEIR COUNTRY.
SHE WAS A BRITISH SUBJECT? YES, SHE WAS.
Stephen: AND BRITAIN PUT THE PRESSURE ON THEM NOT TO MARRY?
INITIALLY.
Stephen: OKAY. THE CHURCH WOULDN'T ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A CHURCH WEDDING SO THEY ENDED UP HAVING A CIVIL WEDDING. ONCE THEY TRIED TO GO BACK TO BE IF BOTSWANA, THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE BOTSWANA WAS A PROTECT RAT OF THE U.K., THEY SAID, IN ORDER TO HELP YOU GUYS NOT HAVE ERUPTIONS IN YOUR COUNTRY WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU BY NOT LETTING YOU BE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
Stephen: SO IF YOU'RE A AN ACTOR -- ( BOOING )
I LOVE BEING BRITISH, BY THE WAY. OH, PI GOODNESS, THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO LET ME BACK IN THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE A METHOD ACTOR AND STAYED IN THE CHARACTER OF DR. KING FOR MONTHS ON END, HOW DO YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE CHARACTER AS A MEMBER OF AN AFRICAN ROYAL FAMILY WHO HAS AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. WHAT'S THAT CHOICE LIKE FOR YOU?
WELL, I AM ACTUALLY A PRINCE FROM NIGERIA. I KNOW, SOUNDS LIKE SHOWING OFF, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.
Stephen: YOU YOURSELF ARE A PRINCE FROM NIGERIA?
I MYSELF ARE A PRINCE. I COULD FEEL THE FACT YOU'RE, LIKE, YEAH, RIGHT!
Stephen: ARE YOU THE ONE SENDING US THE E-MAILS ASKING FOR THE CASH? BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MY WALLET ON ME. ( LAUGHTER )
HOW DO YOU THINK I CAN AFFORD THIS SUIT? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I'M IN AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE MYSELF, SO THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS --
Stephen: THIS IS YOU AND YOUR LOVELY FAMILY THERE.
YES, THAT'S MY FAMILY, MY WIFE.
Stephen: RIGHT THERE. YES. ( APPLAUSE ) HOW DID YOU GET THEM TO CALL WEAR THE SAME CLOTHES THAT YOU WERE WEARING IN THERE?
BRIBERY.
Stephen: NOW YOU JUST DID A PLAY -- YOU DID A FELLOW WITH DANIEL CRAIG?
I DID, HERE IN NEW YORK.
Stephen: OKAY. NOW, HE'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE BOND, RIGHT? WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE NEXT BOND IS GOING TO BE.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.
Stephen: WHAT? I HEARD HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT ANYMORE.
REALLY?
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I HEARD. I KNOW WHAT I HEARD, DAVID OYELOWO.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE BEEN IN A DRESSING ROOM FOR HIM FOR THREE MONTHS, SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I THINK WE'RE READY FOR A BLACK BOND.
OH, REALLY?
Stephen: IT MIGHT BE TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. DAVID, LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. A UNION COUNTY UNION CO-- A "A U THEATERS TOMORROW. BACK WITH TARAN KILLAM. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT FROM HIS WORK ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." HE CURRENTLY STARS AS KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON." PLEASE WELCOME, TARAN KILLAM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH! VERY NICE PEOPLE!
Stephen: VERY NICE. THE NICEST OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME IN THE CONTENSIONLE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Stephen: LONELY IN THERE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE BEEN JOINED IN THERE BEFORE.
JUST STARTED CRAWLING THERE FROM BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON" NOW.
YES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
Stephen: DID YOU TAKE IT JUST FOR THE PART OR IS IT THE ONLY WAY TO GET TICKETS TO "HAMILTON" AT THIS POINT?
BOTH A AND B AT THIS POINT.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A SINGER.
WHAT I STARTED OUT DOING. I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR MUSICAL THEATER AND THEN COMEDY TOOK OVER.
Stephen: STARTED IN MUSICAL THEATER AND DECIDED TO GO FOR THE BIG MONEY IN COMEDY!
IT HAS WORKED OUT AND IT'S AN HONOR. THE SHOW IS INCREDIBLE. YOU'VE ALLIN' IT, RIGHT? SORRY! SORRY TO RUB YOUR NOSE IN THAT. NO, IT'S SO AMAZING. I WAS A HUGE FAN OF IT AND I KNOW LYNN AND TOMMY AND THEY INVITED ME TO BE A PART OF THE SHOW.
Stephen: WE'VE HAD ANDREW REYNOLDS AND JOHN GRAF TO TALK ABOUT PLAYING THE PART BEFORE YOU. THE CROWN IS THE WORST PART OF IT.
IT STINKS. IT'S SO HEAVY. YOU'RE IN HEELS. AND FOR THE FIRST PART YOU HAVE A GIANT VELVET CAPE SWAYING TO AND FROE, LIKE TOSSING YOU IN A SHIP. IT'S JUST THE JOB TO WALK A STRAIGHT LINE. IT'S A SELF-DEFEATING ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO WARDROBE. I THINK I'M THE TALLEST. IN THE HEELS AND CROWN, I HAVE TO DUCK UNDER THE SET WHEN I MAKE MY ENTRANCES AND MY THIRD SHOW EVER, I DID NOT. IT KNOCKED THE CROWN TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD LIKE A PRECOCIOUS APPLE DUMPLING GANG CHARACTER.
Stephen: THE KING! YEAH, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN THERE'S THE PART WHERE I HAVE TO, LIKE, SKIP IN JOY, AND I DO THAT, AND FOR ME IT WAS LIKE SLOW MOTION, THE CROWN COMES OFF AND SMASHES ON THE STAGE.
Stephen: DID IT GET A LAUGH?
A HUGE LAUGH. IT WAS GREAT. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T FAIL IN THAT ROLE. IT'S SO NICE.
Stephen: EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THE SHOW AND PEOPLE PULL ALL KINDS OF STRINGS TO GET IN THERE. PEOPLE COME BACKSTAGE, LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MEETING THAT PERSON! NOT LIKE YOU DON'T MEET A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. LIKE WORLD LEADERS COME.
TRUE. FOR MESARA MICHELLE GELLAR CAME LAST WEEK.
Stephen: BUFFY? BUFFY.
Stephen: WORLD LEADER. WORLD LEADER. DIMENSIONAL LEADER, REALLY, IF WE'RE GETTING TECHNICAL. THE FIRST TIME, MAYBE THE ONLY TIME I'VE CRIED IN EARNEST AT NARRATIVE TELEVISION WAS ON BUFFY WHEN ANGEL LOSES HIS SOUL AGAIN AND SHE HAS TO STAB HIM THROUGH THE HEART TO CLOSE THE HELL MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I PLAYED IT MUCH COOLER THAN NOW. I WAS LIKE, THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE SHOW, I'M A HUGE FAN, BUFFY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! AND I RAN BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS. IMPRESSIONS THAT NOBODY HAD A HOOK FOR. NOBODY DID BRAD PITTT AND YOU HAD A HOOK FOR BRAD PITT. McConaughey is a very small needle to thread. YOU MUST RUN INTO THEM AFTER DOING THEIR IMPRESSIONS.
NO ONE LIKES THEIR IMPRESSION. SO THEY'LL QUICKLY SKIRT TO YOU DO THIS PERSON GREAT AND THAT PERSON GREAT, YOU REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ME. THAT IS WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY. BUT I WAS BACKSTAGE AT THE 40th, SOMEBODY WHO I GOT TO MEET AND NEVER GOT TO DO ON THE SHOW, IT WAS MY FAVORITE EXPERIENCE IN PASSING, 40t 40th WAS CRAZY. THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE THERE FROM ALL GENERATIONS OF THE SHOW.
Stephen: 40t 40th ANNIVERSARY.
OF "SNL," EXACTLY. I SEE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE JEFF GOLDBLUM WALKS UP AND AIM BIG FAN, HE SAYS, YES, YES, YES, YES, GOOD, VERY GOOD, THEN KEPT WALKING. I'M, LIKE, THAT'S IT. I'M DONE. THAT'S ALL I NEED, IF I DO NOTHING ELSE. THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS, THIS SEASON "SNL" IS HAVING AN AMAZING SEASON, THE RATINGS ARE GREAT, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT AND THE SHOW HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. ALEC BALD WITHIN, McCARTHY, SEAN SPICER IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE I'VE EVER SEEN. PEOPLE WHO COME IN WHO WEREN'T EVEN THE HOST THAT WEEK, WHEN NON-CAST MEMBERS COME IN AND DO THE IMPRESSIONS, DOES THE CAST THERE GO, HEY, WE'RE THE ENSEMBLE, WHY AREN'T WE DOING THOSE? I FEEL BAD FOR THE CAST WHO DON'T GET A CHOMP AT THAT.
NO, IT'S DONE WELL. I WAS THERE WHEN THEY HAD LARRY DAVID COME IN FOR BERNIE SANDERS, AND IT'S ALWAYS WITHIN SORT OF THE FAMILY OF COMEDY AND PEOPLE THAT WE RESPECT. SO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN ANYTHING JUST AS EXCITING FOR US. I MEAN, MELISSA WAS THE PERSON, I CAME FROM THE THEATER IN LOS ANGELES AND SHE DID AS WELL, AND MELISSA WAS THE PERSON WHO I WOULD GO OUT OF THE WAY TO SEE.
Stephen: SHE'S EXTRAORDINARY.
SHE'S A GENIUS.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER DO SCHWARZENEGGER?
I DIDN'T DO HIM ON THE SHOW BUT DIRECTED HIM IN A MOVIE THIS PAST SUMMER WHICH WAS VERY COOL, VERY EXCITING FOR ME. I DIRECTED A FILM WHY ARE WE KILLING DON'TER, A MOCKMENTRY ABOUT CONTRACT KILLERS TRYING TO KILL THE MOST FAMOUS HIT MAN TO USURP THE KING AND WE GOT ARNOLD TO BE GUNTHER, SPOILER ALERT. IT WAS CRAZY BECAUSE I FACETIMEED WITH HIM. MY ASSISTANT SAID I'M GOING TO HAND YOU TO ARNOLD NOW, HE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF A SIX FOOT DESK, SMOKING CIGAR BEHIND A PICTURE FROM HIS PUMPING IRON DAYS. HE SAID, HELLO, TARAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU! THIS WAS THE BEFORE, THIS THIS I AFTER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: TARAN KILLAM, ON BROAD WAY AT THE RICHARD RODGERS STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
