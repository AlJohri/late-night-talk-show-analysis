BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BUY THE ALBUM. HORKS LLA AT YOU, BOY.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES CHARLIE ROSE AND JESSICA WILLIAMS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! RIGHT THERE. NICE. VERY NICE. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? PLEASE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOW. THAT IS-- THAT IS-- MAKE NO MISTAKE-- MAKE NO MISTAKE, THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT IS A FRIDAY CROWD RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WISH WE COULD HAVE A CROWD LIKE THIS TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS, I WANT TO SAY THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THOUGH, I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE GOD'S THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN IN CONTROL THIS WEEK BECAUSE THE NEWS IS A HELLSCAPE. YOUR KNOW THEY CALL THE PRESIDENCY "THE BULLY PULPIT," SO FAR, DONALD TRUMP IS ONLY DOING THE BULLY PART. ONE OF HIS VICTIMS THIS WEEK IS ALASKA SENATOR AND SUMMERTIME MANAGER OF THE OVERLOOK HOTEL, LISA MURKOWSKI. ( LAUGHTER ) MURKOWSKI WAS ONE OF ONLY TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO VOTED AGAINST BRINGING THE G.O.P. HEALTHCARE BILL TO THE FLOOR ON TUESDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. THAT CLAPPING MEANS YOU'RE NOT DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE TRUMP TWEET-WEDGEIED HER: "AND WITH THIS TWEET, I JUST LET THEM DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER. TOO BAD!" OKAY, THAT'S TOUGH TALK. BUT SHE'S NOT UP FOR REELECTION UNTIL 2022, SO HE'S GOT NOTHING ON HER, HE CAN'T THREATEN HER. WHICH IS WHY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS THREATENED RETRIBUTION AGAINST THE ENTIRE STATE OF ALASKA OVER MURKOWSKI'S VOTES. HE'S GOT TO. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT BEING PRESIDENT IS LIKE BEING IN PRISON-- YOU'VE GOT TO WALK UP TO THE BIGGEST STATE IN THE UNION AND JUST JACK 'EM. OTHERWISE, THE SENATE SMELLS WEAKNESS AND TURNS YOU INTO THEIR SWEETMEATS FOR THE NEXT THREE AND A HALF YEARS. BUT I'M SURPRISED TRUMP WOULD THREATEN ALASKA. THEY'VE GOT A LOT IN COMMON. HE GOT HIS START ON REALITY SHOWS, JUST LIKE EVERY CITIZEN OF ALASKA DID. APPARENTLY, MURKOWSKI AND ALASKA'S OTHER SENATOR BOTH GOT A THREATENING CALL FROM INTERIOR SECRETARY AND MAN WHO WANTS TO GET YOU INTO A USED PICKUP TODAY, OKAY, WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE? RYAN ZINKE. HE CALLED THE ALASKAN SENATORS TO TELL THEM THAT THE VOTE HAD PUT ALASKA'S FUTURE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN JEOPARDY. OH, COME ON! YOU CAN'T SCARE ALASKANS. THEIR STATE MOTTO IS "IF YOU HAVE TO, EAT THE DOGS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO-- I THINK THAT'S TRUE. IT'S IN LATIN. IT SOUNDS BETTER IN LATIN. SO TRUMP SENT ONE OF HIS GOONS TO THREATEN PEOPLE WHO CROSS HIM. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS LIKE ORGANIZED CRIME, EXCEPT FOR THE ORGANIZED PART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S "NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS FELLAS." I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T TELL. IS DONALD TRUMP REALLY WILLING TO THROW AN ENTIRE STATE UNDER THE BUS JUST BECAUSE HIS FEELINGS ARE HURT? JIMMY, COULD WE LOOK AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY? CAN WE ZOOM IN ON THAT FLAG? OH, THAT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD. THAT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD. PUERTO RICO, POLISH UP YOUR RESUME. THIS MIGHT BE YOUR SHOT! ( LAUGHTER ) THE ONE PERSON IN WASHINGTON TRUMP HAS REALLY GIVIN' THE EXECUTIVE SWIRLIE TO THIS WEEK IS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND PIXIE WATCHING YOU HAVE SEX FROM BEHIND A CLOVER LEAF, JEFF SESSIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP IS STILL FURIOUS THAT SESSIONS RECUSED HIMSELF FROM THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. AND NOW HE DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT- HAND MAN AT JUSTICE WHO WILL FIRE MUELLER FOR HIM. AND WE HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN TALKING PRIVATELY ABOUT HOW HE MIGHT REPLACE SESSIONS AND POSSIBLY SIDESTEP SENATE OVERSIGHT WITH A RECESS APPOINTMENT. WOW, JUST REPLACING SESSIONS WHILE EVERYONE IS OUT ON VACATION? THAT IS COLD. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "HI, KIDDO. WELCOME BACK FROM SUMMER CAMP! BY THE WAY, THIS IS YOUR NEW SISTER, ALICE. SHE'S REPLACING YOUR OLD SISTER, MARTHA, WHO-- LET'S FACE IT-- WAS A LITTLE MOUTHY. ANYWAY, GET WASHED UP, BUDDY, COME ON! OR YOU'RE NEXT!" IT'S THE FIRST BABY GOOSE STEP SO A LOT OF SENATORS ARE TRYING TO STOP IT, LIKE ILLINOIS SENATOR AND BUG-EYED SQUEEZY TOY, DICK DURBIN, WHO SAID, "WE'RE EXPLORING THE WAYS RIGHT NOW TO KEEP THE SENATE FORMALLY IN SESSION THROUGH THE AUGUST RECESS." THEY MIGHT CANCEL RECESS? THAT MEANS MITCH McCONNELL WOULD HAVE TO SET UP HIS SLIP AND SLIDE ON THE SENATE FLOOR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, AND, IT'S NOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT LOOKS FUN. THAT LOOKS REFRESHING. IT'S NOT JUST THE DEMOCRATS. SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN AND OLDEST MAN IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PICTURE, LINDSAY GRAHAM, IS WARNING THE PRESIDENT NOT TO MESS WITH SESSIONS.
I'M 100% BEHIND JEFF SESSIONS. THERE WILL BE NO CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR A NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL IN 2017. IF JEFF SESSIONS IS FIRED, THERE WILL BE HOLY HELL TO PAY.
Stephen: "HOLY HELL. HOLY HELL. I DO DECLARE. HOLY HELL. IF YOU PERSIST, I WILL WHIP YOU WITH MY FIDDLESTICKS. HOLY HELL. AND GRAHAM WENT ON TO WARN:
ANY EFFORT TO GO AFTER MUELLER COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YES, AND-- THEN AGAIN, IF HE DOESN'T GO AFTER MUELLER THAT'S ALSO THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. SO EITHER WAY, THINGS ARE LOOKING UP. AND GRAHAM IS NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN STANDING UP TO TRUMP. CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND ANCIENT IDOL CARVED FROM POTATO, CHUCK GRASSLEY, TWEETED, "EVERYBODY IN D.C. SHOULD BE WARNED THAT THE AGENDA FOR THE JUDICIARY COMM IS SET FOR REST OF 2017. JUDGE'S FIRST SUBCABINET, SECOND A.G., NO WAY." WOW, I DID NOT KNOW CHUCK GRASSLEY WAS INTO SLAM POETRY! M.C., TAP THAT GRASSLEY. "A.G., NO WAY IN THE U.S.A. YOU OUGHTA KNOW THIS, POTUS: I'M THE O.G. OF THE G.O.P. IN THE SEN-NOT OF THE UNITED HATES OF A-SCAREICA." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SORRY. THESE ARE EXPENSIVE, I THINK. I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD HAVE DONE.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK THAT.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT PRESS SECRETARY AND MOTHER OF THE KID WHO BIT YOUR KID, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. IT'S BEEN A JAM-PACKED WEEK. REPORTERS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME GETTING STRAIGHT ANSWERS ABOUT JARED KUSHNER. ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSION, IN OR OUT. HIEWRG. SO WEDNESDAY HUCK-A-SANDERS CLEARED EVERYTHING BY READING A LETTER FROM A RANDOM KID.
AYE NAME IS DILLON BUT EVERYBODY CALLS ME PICKLE. I'M NINE YEARS OLD AND YOU'RE MY FAVORITE PRESIDENT. I LIKE YOU SO MUCH THAT I HAD A BIRTHDAY ABOUT YOU.
Stephen: HOLD ON. WHAT'S A TRUMP-THEMED BIRTHDAY LOOK LIKE? IS THERE A WALL AROUND THE PINATA? DO YOU-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT DO YOU-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU-- I DON'T KNOW. DO-- DO YOU BLOW OUT THE CANDLES OR DO SOME NICE RUSSIAN LADIES, LET'S SAY, EXTINGUISH THEM? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A WISH, PICKLE, BUT DEFINITELY CLOSE YOUR EYES. I'M SORRY, YOU WERE ANSWERING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS?
THEN DILLON GOES ON TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. "I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU?" ME, EITHER, DILLON. "YOU SEEM REALLY NICE. CAN WE BE FRIENDS?" I'M HAPPY TO SAY I DIRECTLY SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT, DILLON, AND HE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BE YOUR FRIEND.
Stephen: I'D BE CAREFUL, PICKLE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I KNOW ONE LITTLE BOY, LITTLE JEFFY SESSIONS, WHO WROTE THE SAME LETTER LAST YEAR AND HE REGRETS IT. ANYWAY, SARAH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. I KNOW YOU ONLY GIVE REPORTERS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME SO HOW ABOUT A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT JARED'S MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN.
GUYS, I HATE TO CUT IT SHORT. THE PRESIDENT HAS AN EVENT.
Stephen: WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT UNDERMINING OUR DEMOCRACY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE DEEP DIVE ON THAT PICKLE LETTER. TO DOLES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE'S JUST SHAMELESSLY, SHAMELESSLY RUNNING THE CLOCK OUT ON JOURNALISTS. WHAT'S NEXT, A COOKING SEGMENT WITH MARIO LOPEZ? ( LAUGHTER ) I WOULD WATCH THAT. I WOULD WATCH THAT. YEAH, I WOULD DEFINITELY-- I'D HAVE HIM ON HERE BUT I'D WANT HIM SHIRTLESS. SO-- UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE. SO ALL YOU FRUSTRATED REPORTERS, IF YOU WANT YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED, CLEARLY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT. COME ON OUT HERE, NORAH! NORAH, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP! THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO GREAT.
HI, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  HI, NORAH, ARE YOU READY TO HELP AMERICANS GET THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
SURE AM. DEAR PRESIDENT, MY NAME IS NORAH, BUT EVERYONE CALLS ME MUSTARD. YOU'RE MY FAVORITE CURRENT PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, I WAS WONDERING, DOES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ENJOY YOUR FULL SUPPORT? AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE BAN ON TRANSGENDER PEOPLE CURRENTLY SERVING IN THE MILITARY? WILL THOSE ON ACTIVE DUTY BE CALLED HOME? SOUNDS LIKE A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE MORE THING-- ARE YOU A PUPPET OF VLADIMIR PUTIN? ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE PUPPETS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE PUPPETS! I MADE ONE AT CAMP! LOVE, MUSTARD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) P.S.:  PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE THE SAME HANDS! ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: MUSTARD, EVERYBODY! MEANWHILE, LAST WEEK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS WATCHED THE SHOW, I HAD FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE ON THE SHOW TO PROMOTE HIS SCHEDULE TO "AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH," WHICH IS GREAT NEWS. IT TURNS OUT THERE IS STILL ENOUGH EARTH LEFT TO MAKE A SEQUEL. IT'S A GREAT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT I SUGGEST EVERYONE CHECK OUT. AFTER ALL, THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO SHOW YOU CARE ABOUT THE PLANET THAN SITTING IN A THEATER WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING BLASTING WHILE DRINKING OUT OF GIANT PLASTIC CUPS. PLUS, DURING OUR INTERVIEW, THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT UNVEILED AN INTERESTING MARKETING STRATEGY FOR THE DOCUMENTARY.
WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS. THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE. AND TO YOUNG PEOPLE, IN PARTICULAR, I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AS A DATE MOVIE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BECAUSE?
IT'S A HOT DATE MOVIE. IT'S AN AMAZINGLY HOT DATE MOVIE.
Stephen: BECAUSE IF THE END OF THE WORLD'S COMING, YOU MIGHT AS WELL HOOK UP WITH ME. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT, THAT DOES MAKE A GREAT PICKUP LINE. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, WE AT "THE LATE SHOW" WANT TO OFFER ANYONE INTERESTED IN FINDING A DATE FOR THIS MOVIE, AL GORE-APPROVED CLIMATE CHANGE PICKUP LINES.
ARE YOU CLIMATE CHANGE? BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, THE WORLD DISAPPEARS?
Stephen: I'M LIKE 97% OF SCIENTISTS-- I CAN'T DENY IT'S GETTING HOT IN HERE. ♪ ♪ ♪
LOOKING AT YOU, TWO THINGS ARE CLEAR-- HEAVEN IS MISSING AN ANGEL. AND THE U.S. IS MISSING ANY KIND OF VIABLE RESPONSIBLE CLIMATE POLICY.
Stephen: IS THAT AN ICEBERG THE SIZE OF DELAWARE BREAKING OFF THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF OR ARE YOU JUST HAPPY TO SEE ME?
I HOPE YOUR NOT POWERED BY FOSSIL FUELS, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND ALL DAY.
Stephen: TELL YOU WHAT-- SEA LEVEL'S NOT THE ONLY THING RISING AROUND HERE.
EITHER WASTEWATER DISPOSAL FROM FRACKING HAS CAUSED AN INCREASE IN EARTHQUAKES IN THIS AREA, OR YOU HAVE ROCKED MY WORLD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "AN INCONVENIENT SEQUEL" IS IN THEATERS TODAY. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. IT'S FRIDAY, SO THAT MEANS "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." STICK AROUND.
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY, RIGHT OVER THERE. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND RIGHT NOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'RE NEW TO THE SHOW, YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT I AM A CATHOLIC. BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING TO MASS SOMETIMES BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A CHURCH IN MY BEDROOM.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND I REALLY MISS SOME OF MY CATHOLIC TRADITIONS. THE ONE I MISS THE MOST IS CONFESSIONS. SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND, TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience: OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS"!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, I NEVER GO TO THE GYM, SO I BOUGHT A HOME GYM. NOW I NEVER GO HOME.  ( LAUGHTER ) I'M ABOUT EIGHT REMINDERS AWAY FROM CONSIDERING RESCHEDULING MY NEXT DENTAL VISIT.  ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, SOMETIMES WHEN I WAKE UP FROM A BEAUTIFUL DREAM, I FEEL A LITTLE SAD... WHEN I SEE THE CAR I JUST REAR- ENDED.  ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T ALWAYS DRINK BEER, BUT WHEN I DO, I MAKE UP FOR ALL THE TIMES I DON'T.  ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I HAVE NEVER PRE- HEATED THE OVEN A SINGLE SECOND LONGER THAN IT TAKES TO OPEN A ROLL OF COOKIE DOUGH.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( LAUGHTER )  ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, I TOOK A MUCH SMALLER BITE IN REHEARSAL.  ( LAUGHTER ) AH! IF YOU'RE HITCHHIKING AND I PICK YOU UP, IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I THINK I CAN TAKE YOU IN A KNIFE FIGHT.  ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, SOMETIMES I SECRETLY HOPE I GET THE FLU SO MY TO-DO LIST WILL SHRINK DOWN TO "FINISH BOWL OF SOUP." THEY SAY THERE'S NO WRONG WAY TO EAT A REESE'S, BUT I'M THINKING A WHOLE BAG WHILE YOU'RE IDLING IN THE DRIVEWAY IS CLOSE.  ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, MY HIPS LIE.  ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, I NEVER-- I NEVER TELL THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, BUT I AM NOT PREPARED TO HELP OUT IN THE EMERGENCY EXIT ROW.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THE DOOR AGAIN? DO I-- DO I RIDE IT DOWN THE WING LIKE A SURF BOARD? I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES I WRITE BOOZE INTO MY COMEDY BITS JUST AS AN EXCUSE TO DRINK.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MMMM. THAT TASTES "NECESSARY TO THE SCENE."  ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE.
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, JON! I LOVE THAT SONG. THAT'S YOURS, RIGHT?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: I LOVE THAT. MY FIRST GUEST HAS MADE A REMARKABLE CAREER ASKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON "CBS THIS MORNING," "60 MINUTES," AND "CHARLIE ROSE." MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES HE HAVE TIME TO BE SNEER PLEASE WELCOME CHARLIE ROSE. I LIKE THE FOOTBALL TROT. THAT'S VERY NICE. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THAT INTERVIEW WITH THE BOY SCOUTS KEEPS ON GIVING, DOESN'T IT.
Stephen: THE BOY SCOUT THICK IS EXTRAORDINARY. WERE YOU A BOY SCOUT?
I WAS, INDEED, BUT NEVER AN EAGLE SCOUT GLIFS AN EAGLE SCOUT FOR ONE DAY. I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT IT.
FOR ONE DAY IS A BIG THING.
Stephen: FOR ONE DAY, YEAH. I MARCHED THROUGH WOODS I ALREADY KNEW.
YOU WERE A SOUTH CAROLINA BOY. I WAS A NORTH CAROLINA BOY. THE BOY SCOUTS WERE A BIG THING.
Stephen: IT WAS. I WANTED TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS. I SAID CAN'T WE PLAY ALONE WITHOUT THE ADULTS AROUND AND THEN WE CAN SET FIRES WITHOUT SUPERVISION. IT'S MUCH MORE FUN.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY. THERE'S SORT OF A MORAL HERESY, I THINK, GOING TO CHILDREN AND POURING YOUR POLITICAL POISON IN THEIR EARS. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE, DON'T YOU THINK?
ABSOLUTELY. IT WAS AN INTERVIEW OR PIECE THAT KEPT ON GIVING-- ONE POSSIBILITY TO DO A JOKE AFTER ANOTHER. IT WAS LIKE, "I'M DOING THIS FOR STEPHEN, WRRCH HE, IS I HOPE YOU ARE LISTENING."
Stephen: WELL, IF YOU ARE LISTENING, SIR. STOP. ALL FULL, THANKS. WELL, LISTEN. HOW ARE YOU DOING? SINCE THE LAST TIME WE HAD YOU ON HERE YOU HAD HEART SURGERY.
I DID.
Stephen? FEBRUARY. ARE THEY BUILDING A BIGGER, BETTER, INDESTRUCTIBLE CHARLIE ROSE.
THE BIONIC MAN. I HAVE TWO ARTIFICIAL VALVES AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S NEXT BUT I'M READY.
Stephen: YOU'RE CERTAINLY TOUGH AS HELL. WE SHOWED THE VIDEO AT THE UP FRONT. ♪ GET A LOAD OF CHARLIE ROSE ♪ I GOT A BRAND NEW TICKER, SON
Stephen: I SAY "SIGN ME UP."
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO DO THAT?
Stephen: JUST INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. NOW, YOU'RE KNOWN SORT OF FAMOUSLY AS A GUY WHO LOVES TO WORK. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE "CBS THIS MORNING," YOU'VE GOT YOUR PBS SHOW. RERUNS ON BLOOMBERG. YOU DO "60 MINUTES." BUT THIS YEAR, YOU WERE FORCED TO TAKE A BREAK FOR THE SURGERY. THAT WAS HARD FOR YOU?
WELL, IT WAS NECESSARY. SO, THEREFORE, THE DOCTOR SAID, "YOU'VE GOT TO DO THIS." I HAD A WEEK IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY DID THE SURGERY.
Stephen: THAT'S IT A WEEK?
YEAH.
Stephen: THEY CRACKED THE RIBS?
THEY DID, OPENED IF UP AND WENT IN THERE AND GAVE ME A NEW VALVE. A COW VALVE.
Stephen: A COW VALVE.
A COW VALVE, THEY SAY BOVINE.
Stephen: OH, A COW VALVE! IT'S A COW IN YOU?
IT IS. ANOTHER ONE IS A PIG. SO I HAVE A EXPIG A COW COMPETING TO SEND BLOOD TO MY HEART.
Stephen: WOW. GOD, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT JEWISH.
NOT YET.
Stephen: NOT YET, OKAY, YOU'LL GET THERE.
THE IDEA OF WORK-- PEOPLE SAY, YDO YOU WORK SO HARD?" IT'S NOT WORK. IT'S PLAY IN A SENSE. I SPENT THE WEEKEND WORKING FOR "60 MINUTES." I WENT OUT TO SAN DIEGO AND A PLACE CALLED DEL MAR WHERE A HORSE CALLED AROGAIS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST HORSE IN THE WORLD, A RACE HORSE, AND EVERYBODY SAID IS CLOSE TO SECRETARIAT, HE'S THAT GOOD. I HUNG OUT WITH THE JOCKEY, HUNG OUT WITH THE TRAINER. THE HORSE LOST, BUT IT WAS GREAT FUN FOR ME. IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE WOULD WAY PAYTO DO.
Stephen: PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO PAY TO GO SEE HORSES.
EXACTLY. AND BET A LOT OF MONEY. AS I DID. I BET ON THE HORSE. HE DIDN'T WIN. I LOST A BUNCH OF MONEY.
Stephen: DO YOU NEED SOME CASH?
JUST FOR THE TAXI BACK EXPHOAM I'LL BE OKAY.
Stephen: I ALSO WANTED TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND EVERYBODY AT "CBS THIS MORNING." TELL ME IF I GOT THIS RIGHT, THIS MORNING, YOU, PERSONALLY, WERE NOMINATED FOR TWO NEWS EMMYS FOR THE "CBS THIS MORNING" COVERAGE OF THE ATLANTA SHOOTINGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND "CBS THIS MORNING" GOT SEVEN NOMINATIONS.
THEY DID.
Stephen: AND YOU GOT A NOMINATION FOR A "60 MINUTES" STORY YOU DID ON THE POPE'S CHOIR. WHAT IS THE POPE'S CHOIR.
THEY CALL IT THE SISTINE CHAPEL CHOIR, TOO. YOUNG BOYS, AND THEY ARE AMAZING. BUT I MUST SAY ABOUT THESE TWO NOMINATIONS. AS YOU KNOW, IN TELEVISION, IT'S A COLLABORATIVE ART-- NO, I KNOW, NOT FOR YOU.
Stephen: IT'S JUST AND YOU ME, FOLKS.
ALL THOSE JOKES I LISTENED TO TONIGHT, RIGHT OUT OF STEPHEN'S BRAIN.
Stephen: MY WRITERS WRITE THEM DOWN AFTER THE SHOW IS OVER.
AND SAY, "I WISH I'D WRITTEN THIS. BUT STEPHEN WROTE IT." IT'S A COLLABORATIVE ART, AND IT'S ABOUT THE POPE'S CHOIR AND YOU GOT TO SPEND FOUR DAYS IN ROME.
Stephen: SPEND TIME WITH THE POPE?
SAW HIM, MET HIM, SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM. PRETTY NICE. I'M PROTESTANT.
Stephen: YOU SHOOK THE POPE'S HAND. YOU'RE A CATHOLIC NOW.
IT'S THE FIRST STEP TO CONVERSION.
Stephen: IT'S A CONTACT HIGH.
YOU WENT TO A PLACE I LOVE, WHICH IS RUSSIA. I WENT TO ST. PETERSBURG AND WENT OVER TO INTERVIEW PUTIN.
Stephen: YOU HAVE INTERVIEWED PUTIN TWICE?
I HAVE, INDEED. ONCE IN ST. PETERSBURG AIR, WONDERFUL, LOVELY SEA.
Stephen: TAIS LOVELY CITY. YEAH, YEAH. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM. AFTER HAVING SAT DOWN AND TALKED TO HIM TWICE WHAT, IS HE LIKE AS A PERSON?
TO HIS CREDIT, HE WAS ENGAGED. HE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS. I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE ALL TRUTHFUL. I SAID THERE'S A SAYING IN MOSCOW, "ONCE A K.G.B. SPD AGENT, ALWAYS A K.G.B. AGENT." AND HE SAID, "THAT'S TRUE. THINGS I LEARNED IN THE K.G.B. HAVE NEVER GONE AWAY FROM ME.
Stephen: LIKE UNDERMINING THE UNITED STATES.
MAYBE. AND AFTER THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER HE SAID, "DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR A CUP OF TEA?" AND I SAID, "CERTAINLY, SIR." AND WE WENT INTO A CONFERENCE ROOM, NO VODKA, JUST TEA. MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS THERE AND MY PRODUCER WAS THERE. HE HAD ONE PERSON AND A TRANSLATOR AND WE TALKED FOR ANOTHER HO HOUR AND A HALF ABOUT EVERYTHING. BUT NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THIS WAS THREE YEARS AGO.
Stephen: DID YOU MAKE SURE HE SIPPED HIS TEA FIRST BEFORE--
I DID.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE NOW PICK UP AN EARLY LOVE OF YOURS THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE IN MANY YEARS. ARE YOU STARTING TO SURF AGAIN?
I'M STARTING TO FIND OUT. I HAVEN'T ASKED MY DOCTOR'S YET.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND THAT'S A CRUCIAL QUESTION.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO BE CLEARED BY YOUR VALVE DOCTOR.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO ASK THE COW AND THE PIG.
MOO, OR-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU STARTED-- YOU STARTED-- YOU STARTED SURFING WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.
I DID. BACK IN NORTH CAROLINA AT NAGS HEAD AND VIRGINIA BEACH. I LEARNED AT VIRGINIA BEACH.
Stephen: WOW. THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAY WHEN IT WAS LONG BOARDS.
BACK WHEN I WAS A CHILD, MAYBE 18, 19 YEARS OLD. I JUST THOUGHT-- SOME PEOPLE I KNOW ARE DOING IT, AND THEY'RE ADULTS AND THEY WENT TO IT AFTER HAVING A LIFETIME OF INTEREST IN OTHER SPORTS. AND THEY LOVE IT. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT. I THOUGHT IT MAY TAKE A WEEK AND FIND OUT IF THERE'S MEMBER SOMEBODY IN HAWAII WHO WILL GIVE ME A SHOT, SPEND A WEEK REALLY SEEING HOW MUCH I CAN PICK UP AND SEE IF I CAN BRING IT BACK, OR IN FACT THEY WILL SAY TO ME, "YOU'RE TOO OLD, SON. GO BACK TO GOLF."
Stephen: IS THIS FOR TV OR JUST FOR YOUR LIFE?
JUST FOR MY LIFE, MY EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: WELL, AT LEAST SEND US SOME PHOTOS, PLEASE.
OH, I WILL.
Stephen: IN THE SPEEDO.
WE'LL SEE. YOU DON'T CARE WHETHER THERE'S A SURF BOARD THERE OR NOT.
Stephen: NO, I DON'T.
JUST THE SPEEDO. I CAN SAY ONE THING ON THIS MAN, ALSO. ON MY 75th BIRTHDAY HE WAS VERY, VERY SICK, AND HE MEADE IT DOWN WHERE THEY WERE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY FOR ME, LIKE A TROOPER. SO ON HIS 75th BIRTHDAY, 30 YEARS FROM NOW, 40 YEARS FROM NOW.
Stephen: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU. A DEAL IS A DEAL GLAWL NEW VALVES AT THAT POINT. "CBS THIS MORNING" AIRS WEEK DAYS ON CBS. CHARLIE ROSE AIRS WEEK NIGHTS ON PBS AND BLOOMBERG. CHARLIE ROSE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JESSICA WILLIAMS. STICK AROUND. THANKS, CHARLIE. WELCOME BACK. WE'VE GOT A LITTLE SPECIAL THING THIS FRIDAY. WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU THE INTERVIEW THAT WE DID ON TUESDAY WITH JESSICA WILJAMS. FANTASTIC INTERVIEW. SHE'S A WONDERFUL GUEST AND HAS A GREAT STORY SHE'S ABOUT TO TELL ABOUT GETTING TO KNOW J.K. ROWLING AND I'M IN THE STORY IN A STRANGE WAY. AND I GOT MY TWITTER APP OPEN RIGHT HERE, BECAUSE WHEN THE INTERVIEW IS OVER, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THE ANSWER IS TO THE QUESTION I ASK. CHECK THIS OUT.
Stephen: YOU CAN TELL THE PEOPLE WHO YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND IS?
I RECENTLY GOT TO MEET J.K. ROWLING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I AM A HUGE HARRY POTTER FAN. I'M 27 AND I FEEL LIKE I GOT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF POTTER MANIA AT THAT AGE. MOM TAKE ME OUT AT MIDNIGHT. I WANT TO GET A BOOK. YEAH, I TOTALLY MET HER. HOW IT HAPPENED, MAYBE MY SECOND YEAR ON "THE DAILY SHOW," SHE STARTED FOLLOWING ME ON TWITTER. AND I GOT REALLY FREAKED OUT AND I WAS LIKE, MAYBE IT'S LIKE SHE'S FAKE FOLLOWING ME LIKE, WHEN BARACK OBAMA FOLLOWED, LIKE, A MILLION PEOPLE AND OKAY, WHATEVER. SHE HAD ACTUALLY FOLLOWED ME.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED YOU?
BECAUSE SHE ONLY FOLLOWED MAYBE 300 PEOPLE AT THAT TIME. I WAS LIKE OKAY, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. THIS IS VERY REAL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SO THEN I KIND OF STOPPED TWEETING. I GOT TWITTER SHY. IT'S LIKE WHAT DO YOU SAY AT THE ALTAR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, WHEN YOU GET THERE?
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HER?
YEAH, LIKE WHAT DO YOU SAY? WHAT DO I SAY TO HER? SHE ENDED UP D.M.''ING ME.
Stephen: WHAT DID SHE SAY?
I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS HARRY POTTER WHICH MEANS I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS HER AS BECAUSE BOTH OF OUR BIRTHDAYS ARE JULY 31. SHE WAS LIKE, "HEY, IT'S ME." AND IN MY HEAD I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW." SHE SAID I WAS LOOKING UP PEOPLE I SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY WITH AND I SAW YOU WERE ONE OF THEM AND I WAS GOING TO WISH YOU A HAPPY 'OUR BIRTHDAY" WHICH I BLOODY FORGET AND SHE PUT, WHICH IS TYPICAL ME. AND SHE SAID ANYWAY I THINK YOU ARE FUNNY, BRAVE, AND COURAGEOUS, AND I ALWAYS KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD "DAILY SHOW" WHEN YOU'RE ON. AND I WAS JUST, LIKE, SOBBING. I WAS-- I WAS LIKE-- LIKE, I WAS DEAD.
Stephen: SO WHAT DID YOU SAY BACK JIEFS JUST LIKE, "THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHY WHEREDO I START? I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOUR STORIES AND I JUST THINK YOU'RE AMAZING. ALSO, HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO WRITE BACK RIGHT AWAY.
I DIDN'T, ACTUALLY. I TOOK, LIKE A WEEK BECAUSE I WAS DRAFTING. I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS TRASH, THIS IS TRASH."
Stephen: DID YOU SHOW IT TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW FIRST?
I DID, I DID. I WAS, LIKE, REALLY WORKSHOPPING IT AROUND TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I WAS LIKE THER THERE ARE NOSBAD IDEAS AND THEN THERE WERE A LOT OF BAD IDEAS. THE MAIN THING I DID WANT TO KNOW WHAT HOUSE I WOULD BE IN IF I WENT TO HOG WART S.
Stephen:  I HEARD ABOUT THIS, TOO. WHAT DID SHE SAY?
I DIDN'T ASK HER VIA D.M., BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID TO TWEET AND ALSO IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH A BIG DEAL. IT'S TO BIG A DEAL TO SLIDE HER D.M.s ABOUT. MY BOYFRIEND WAS LIKE-- WE WERE AT A BAR, MAYBE A MONTH AND A HALF AGO, AND WE WERE DRINKING AND HE SAID, "SHUD.M. HER. AND I WAS LIKE WHAT? HE & HE SAID, "YOU SHOULD MESSAGE HER." AND I DID LIKE A SHOT. AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, JOJO."
Stephen: IS THAT YOUR NAME FOR HER OR IS THAT EVERYBODY'S--
IT'S MY NAME FOR HER. IT'S, LIKE, IGNORANT. IT'S MY NAME FOR HER. IT'S DEFINITELY JOANNE. I SAID, "HEY, JOJO, IT'S JESSICA. I WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU ARE DOING. AND SHE MESSAGED ME BACK A BUNCH OF STUFF AND SAID WHEN IS THE NEXT TIME YOU WILL BE IN LONDON. I PROMISE I'M NOT THIS BLABBY AFTER THE FOURTH COCKTAIL. I WAS VERY OVERWHELM GLD THAT LED TO THIS?
YES. SO HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND JOJO. IT'S AMAZING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S AMAZING. I WAS NERVOUS --
Stephen: GO ON AND TELL YOUR STORY. I JUST WANT TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT. I JUST WANT TO CHECK OUT IF SHE FOLLOWS ME.
WELL, SHE PROBABLY DOES. I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING HER. I WAS WORRIED IT WOULD BE,IC OF, LIKE A REALLY BAD TINDER DATE WHERE WE BIT INTO A PIECE OF SALMON AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER, BUT WHEN I MET HER SHE WAS REALLY, REALLY DOOL COOL. AND WE HAD A LOT IN COMMON WHICH RULED. SO MUCH SO, SHE WAS LIKE, WHAT, DO YOU LIKE TO DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME?" AND I WAS LIKE, "I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE TO PLAY THE CYNS." AND SHE WAS LIKE YOU PLAY THE CYMES, TOO. WHICH IS BANANA.
Stephen: WHAT'S HER TWITTER NAME. JKFOULING. FOLLOWS ME!
I'M GOING TO FOLLOW HER.
YOU HAVE TO. I'M GOING TO DRAG YOU FOR NOT FOLLOWING HER.
Stephen: LET ME HIT HER UP RIGHT HERE. I'LL SAY, "HEY, JOJO. HYPHEN, STEPHEN COLBERT HERE. COMMA. JUST HANGING WITH JESS. PERIOD. SHE SAYS YOU PUT HER IN... WHAT HOUSE?
SHE TOLD ME I WAS GRYFFINDOR.
Stephen: GRYFFINDOR HOUSE. PERIOD. HOLY (BLEEP). SIRI KNOWS HOW TO SPELL GRYFFINDOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
SHE'S LIKE, "I KNOW."
Stephen: I KNOW WE JUST MET. COMMA. NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. COMMA. BUT WHAT HOUSE WOULD I BE IN? QUESTION MARK. HOPE WE MEET SOME DAY. PERIOD. I LOVE YOU. STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT BEFORE THAT EVEN AIRED ON TUESDAY NIGHT? ON TUESDAY NIGHT, JO JOHIT ME BACK. SHE WROTE, "DEAR STEVIE, DEFINITELY RAVENCLAW, BUT WITH GRYFFINDOR UNDERTONES. BOOM! THERE IT IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH, J.K.! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH NEWS THIS WEEK, AND EVEN I CAN'T KEEP ON TOP OF ALL OF IT. THAT'S MY FAULT FOR NOT GETTING CABLE IN MY PANIC ROOM. SO TO HELP CATCH YOU FOLKS UP, I'D LIKE TO PRESENT THE VERY BEST MOMENTS FROM THIS WEEK'S "THE LATE SHOW"." IT'S SURPRISING THAT TRUMP WOULD HIRE THE MOOCH BECAUSE LOOK WHAT HE SAID ABOUT TRUMP DURING THE PRIMARIES.
POLITICIANS DON'T WANT TO GO AT TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH AND HE'S AFRAID HE'S GOING TO LIGHT THEM UP ON FOX NEWS AND ALL THESE OTHER PLACES. BUT I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. BRING IT, DONALD.
Stephen: YEAH, BRING IT, DONALD, OKAY. SPECIFICALLY THOSE SWEET BUTT CHEEKS BECAUSE THE MOOCH IS READY TO SMOOCH. SMOOCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
"NEW YORKER" REPORTER DETAILED A CONVERSATION HE WITH WITH SCARAMUCCI LAF NIGHT:  I'M NOT STEVE BANNON. I'M NOT TRYING SUCK MY OWN (BLEEP).
Jon: HE SAID THAT!
Stephen: LOOK, LOOK, IF BANNON COULD DO THAT, HE'D NEVER LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THOUGH, I GOTTA SAY, WE NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE. JEFF SESSIONS IS GETTING A LOT OF HEAT FROM THE PRESIDENT.
YEAH, WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE HE WAS HIS, LIKE, MAIN POLICY ADVISER, HIS BEST FRIEND IN THE CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: A LOT OF HIS EARLY STAFF WAS SESSIONS STAFF. JEFF GAVE THEM HIS OFFICE.
BEFORE THERE WAS TRUMPISM THERE WAS SESSIONISM BUT BEFORE THAT IT WAS JUST CALLED RACISM.
BY THE WAY, UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION YOU'LL BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING, BELIEVE ME. THEY'VE BEEN DOWNPLAYING THAT LITTLE BEAUTIFUL PHRASE.
Stephen: YES, THEY ARE DOWNPLAYING IT FOR SOME REASON. I'M JUST SPITBALLING HERE-- MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S JULY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE PENTAGON SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN UNAWARE THAT TRUMP HAS DECIDED TO BAR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM THE MILITARY. SO THE PENTAGON DIDN'T EVEN KNOW? WAIT A SECOND. TRUMP SAID HE CONSULTED WITH "MY GENERALS." I KNOW, I KNOW, THAT MUST BE A TYPO. HE MAEFN MEANT MY GENITALS. DAMN YOU, SIRI! DAMN YOU, SIRI. TIEFERL I WANT TO POINT OUT WHEN YOU CAME OUT HERE YOU JUST TOUCHED ME ON THE BUTT.
NO, I DIDN'T.
Stephen: YES, YOU DID.
YOU HAVE NO PROOF. STEPHEN COLBERT SAY LIAR.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE NO PROOF? IN FWE WORKED TOGETHER I WOULD HAVE TO REPORT YOU TO H.R.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. SOMEONE'S LYING. IF HE'S LYING, MAKE SOME NOISE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOUR VOCALIZATION IMPRESSION OF THE FIRST LADY I THINK IS FANTASTIC. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T TALK AT ALL, YOU JUST SMOLDER.
SURE.
Stephen: CAN I HAVE A HINT OF THE SMOLDER AT THE CAMERA.
SURE, SURE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'VE INTERVIEWED MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNICATIONS TEAM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL EVERYONE, WE HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD IDEA WHO THE LEAKERS ARE, WHO THE SENIOR LEAKERS ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: YES, I'VE ALSO DONE RESEARCH ON WHO IS SHARING INFORMATION DAMAGING ON THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THIS COMPOSITE POLICE SKETCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HIT IT! "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. JOIN ME NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE JOINED BY MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY, DAVE CHAPELLE, AND SENATOR AL FRANKEN. THAT'S A GOOD WEEK OF SHOWS. GOOD NIGHT.
