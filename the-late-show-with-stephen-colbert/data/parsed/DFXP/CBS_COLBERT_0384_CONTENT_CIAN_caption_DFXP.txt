Stephen: OKAY, BOYS, TIME TO TURN IN.
OH! COME ON, ONE MORE STORY!
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE STORY. HOW ABOUT A SCARY STORY?
OH, YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH? ALL RIGHT. ONCE THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME WHEN ALL THE BOY SCOUTS IN WEST VIRGINIA MET AT A JAMBOREE. I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO HERE. AND THEY WERE ALL HAVING FUN UNTIL OUT OF NOWHERE CAME THIS OLD BLOATED PUMPKIN MAN WITH HAIR LIKE MOLDY HAY.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED!
WELL, AT FIRST, HE SAID HE WASN'T GONNA TALK ABOUT POLITICS. AND THEN ALL HE TALKED ABOUT WAS POLITICS.
IN FRONT OF THE BOY SCOUTS?
YES.
DID THEY UNDERSTAND HIM?
NO. THEY WERE CONFUSED.
THAT'S SCARY!
OH, AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST PART. WHEN HE FINALLY STOPPED TALKING AND THE SCOUTS THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER, THE OLD PUMPKIN MAN SLOWLY LIFTED UP HIS ARMS, AND HE HAD DOLL HANDS!
AAAARRGGH!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES CHARLIE ROSE, JESSICA WILLIAMS, AND MAX BROOKS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY! HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON! WHAT'S UP? HEY! OH! THAT'S VERY NICE, EVERYBODY. HOW ARE YOU? THAT'S LOVELY. EVERYBODY SHOULD START THEIR WORK DAY LIKE THAT. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WELL, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT OUR ELECTED LEADERS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS. ( LAUGHTER ) I DO NOT HAVE THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. IT'S LIKE DESCRIBING A NEW COLOR THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND THIS COLOR IS MADE OF ALL THE OTHER COLORS DYING. LIKE, IF A RAINBOW GOT GANGRENE. FIRST, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SENATE AND WHAT THEY DID TODAY. YOU KNOW HOW THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE? WELL, SINCE TRUMP'S BEEN IN OFFICE, THEY'VE TRIED THREE TIMES, AND THEY'VE FAILED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT THEY FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHY THEY FAILED. THEY FAILED BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THEIR BILL. ( LAUGHTER ) HUGE MISTAKE. SO TODAY, THEY RAISED THE BAR ON LOWERING THE BAR, OKAY. HERE'S WHAT THEY DID. SENATOR MAJORITY LEADER AND RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, WITH HIS FACE MELTING, MITCH McCONNELL, CALLED FOR A VOTE ON THE NEW HEALTH CARE BILL BUT:
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'LL BE VOTING ON THE HOUSE BILL, THE FIRST VERSION OF THE SENATE BILL, THE SECOND VERSION OF THE SENATE BILL.
THIS IS A MISERABLE, TERRIBLE PROCESS, AND NOBODY'S HAPPY WITH IT. AND WE'RE BEING GIVEN NO INFORMATION.
THERE IS NO ONE WHO KNOWS.
Stephen: THE BILL, THE BILL WAS A TOTAL MYSTERY. IT'S LIKE "WESTWORLD--" NO ONE KNOWS EXACT PLEA WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A BAD THING FOR WOMEN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS TOTAL LACK OF INFORMATION, NOBODY KNOWS NOTHING. WAS NOT A MISTAKE. IT WAS THE PLAN. BECAUSE IF NONE OF THE SENATORS KNOW WHAT THEY VOTED FOR, IT'S POTENTIALLY BOTH GOOD AND BAD AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S A BLACK BOX WE CAN'T SEE INSIDE. IT'S SCHRODINGER'S HEALTHCARE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE CAT IS PROBABLY DEAD, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT MITCH McCONNELL ASSURED HIS COLLEAGUES IT WAS SAFE TO VOTE FOR IT.
IF IT WERE TO PASS WITHOUT ANY AMENDMENT AT ALL, THIS IS TWO-YEAR DELAY BEFORE IT KICKS IN. SO THE TAKEAWAY FROM WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS, NO HARM IS DONE BY GETTING ON THE BILL.
Stephen: YES! THAT'S THE SENATE'S HIPPOCRATIC OATH-- FIRST DO NO HARM... FOR TWO YEARS. THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THEY HELD THE VOTE TODAY. AND THE MOTION TO DEBATE THE BILL PASSED. WHICH MEANS THEY NOW HAVE 20 HOURS OF DEBATE TO FINE TUNE THE BILL THAT THEY DID NOT WRITE FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. IT SHOULD BE FINE. THEY DON'T KNOW THE BIG STUFF, LIKE IT WILL BE PRINTED ON PAPER, AND THAT'S IT. SO THAT'S PROFILE IN COURAGE NUMBER ONE. THE SECOND GOBSMACKER OF THE LAST 24 HOURS, WAS DONALD TRUMP'S APPEARANCE LAST NIGHT AT THE NATIONAL BOY SCOUT JAMBOREE. IT'S NO SURPRISE HE WENT TO THE BOY SCOUTS. WITH ALL HIS SCANDAL, HE'S GOOD AT PUTTING OUT FIRES. YOU'RE TOO KIND, REALLY. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS AN EVENT FOR CHILDREN FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND IT IS COMPLETELY NONPARTISAN EVENT SO TRUMP LEFT THE POLITICS BEHIND AND JUST TALKED ABOUT HIS HOPES FOR THEIR FUTURE. I'M JUST KIDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) HE DID HIS THING.
BOY, YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. THE PRESS WILL SAY IT'S ABOUT 200 PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT 45,000 PEOPLE. YOU SET A RECORD TODAY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO BE THERE ANYWAY, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S THEIR EVENT. NOT YOURS. ( LAUGHTER ) "I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THESE PEOPLE TURNED OUT FOR THE SUPER BOWL JUST BECAUSE I'M HERE. I'M ALSO I'VE GOT TO SAY-- AND I'LL SAY THIS-- I'M VERY HONORED THAT THERE ARE SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE ON EARTH RIGHT NOW. IT'S A NEW RECORD. JUST TO SEE ME. WEREN'T THAT MANY YESTERDAY. EVERY DAY." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "JUST TO SEE ME." AND, OF COURSE, TRUMP KNEW HOW TO WORK THAT CROWD.
THE UNITED STATES HAS NO BETTER CITIZENS THAN ITS BOY SCOUTS.
Stephen: TAKE THAT, GIRL SCOUTS! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: THE BOY SCOUTS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR LOVE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. WE HAVE BOY SCOUTS IN MY FAMILY. WE HAVE AN EAGLE SCOUT IN MY FAMILY. ONE OF THE NICE THINGS IS THEY DO BADGES ON THE GOVERNMENT. DONALD TRUMP TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO DROP A DEUCE IN THAT PUNCH BOWL.
YOU KNOW, I GO TO WASHINGTON AND I SEE ALL THESE POLITICIANS, AND I SEE THE SWAMP. AND IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE. IN FACT, TODAY I SAID WE OUGHT TO CHANGE IT FROM THE WORD "SWAMP" TO THE WORD CESSPOOL OR, PERHAPS, TO THE WORD SEWER.
Stephen: "KIDS, I COME HERE TO INSPIRE YOU: YOUR GOVERNMENT IS A FESTERING RIVER OF HUMAN WASTE, AND I'M THE MADMAN WHO RULES IT ON A THRONE OF TURDS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH!
Stephen: OKAY? BIGGEST EVER.
Jon: OH!
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE, ABSOLUTELY, I DON'T-- AS THEY SAY, I DON'T KNOW. AFTER INTRODUCING ACTUAL FORMER BOY SCOUT ENERGY SECRETARY RICK PERRY, TRUMP EXPLAINED TO THE BOYS WHAT A GREAT JOB HIS ADMINISTRATION IS DOING.
AND VERY SOON, RICK, WE WILL BE AN ENERGY EXPORTER. ISN'T THAT NICE?
Stephen: "OKAY, KIDS, WHO WANTS A MERIT BADGE IN FRACKING? ANYBODY?" THEN HE INTRODUCED ANOTHER MEMBER OF HIS CABINET:
SECRETARY TOM PRICE IS ALSO HERE, AND HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. AND HOPEFULLY, HE'S GOING TO GET THE VOTES TOMORROW TO START OUR PATH TOWARD KILLING THIS HORRIBLE THING KNOWN AS OBAMACARE. BY THE WAY, YOU GOING TO GET THE VOTES? HE BETTER GET THEM. HE BETTER GET THEM. OH, HE BETTER-- OTHERWISE, I'LL SAY, "TOM, YOU'RE FIRED."
Stephen: "I'LL FIRE HIM RIGHT NOW! I'LL FIRE HIM RIGHT NOW. KIDS, WHO WANTS TO SEE A GROWN MAN CRY? ANYBODY. COME HERE, SQUIRT HIM. COME ON, SQUIRT HIM." TRUMP THAN BEGAN CITING THE SCOUT LAW:
AS THE SCOUT LAW SAYS: "A SCOUT IS TRUSTWORTHY, LOYAL"-- WE COULD USE SOME MORE LOYALTY, I WILL TELL YOU THAT.
Stephen: WE COULD USE MORE LOYALTY! FOR INSTANCE, THAT GUY ON STAGE JUST THREATENED TO FIRE SOMEONE HE SAID WAS DOING A GOOD JOB. AND THEN, AS IF TRUMP'S INSECURITIES AND OBSESSIONS WEREN'T ENOUGH POISON TO POUR INTO THE EARS OF CHILDREN, HE TOLD THEM THIS STORY.
AND HE WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN, BECAME UNBELIEVABLE-- HE WAS A HOME BUILDER-- BECAME AN UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESS, AND GOT MORE AND MORE SUCCESSFUL. AND HE DID THIS FOR 20 YEARS, AND THEN HE WAS OFFERED A LOT OF MONEY FOR HIS COMPANY, AND HE SOLD HIS COMPANY FOR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND HE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A BIG YACHT, AND HE HAD A VERY INTERESTING LIFE. I WON'T GO ANY MORE THAN THAT, BECAUSE YOU'RE BOY SCOUTS SO I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT HE DID. ( CROWD CHANTING ) SHOULD I TELL YOU? SHOULD I TELL YOU? OH, YOU'RE BOY SCOUTS, BUT YOU KNOW LIFE. YOU KNOW LIFE.
Stephen: "YEAH, YOU'RE BOY SCOUTS BUT YOU KNOW LIFE, YOU KNOW, BILLION AIRS. INTERNATIONAL WATERS. NO WITNESSES. GAMBLING. COCK FIGHTS. SOME LADIES. EVERYONE'S WEARING LOOSE CLOTHING. I FORGOT WHERE I WAS GOING WITH THIS. ANYWAY, WORK HARD, KIDS." THEN TRUMP LAID OUT HIS BOLD VISION FOR THE FUTURE:
AND BY THE WAY, UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, YOU'LL BE SAYING "MERRY CHRISTMAS" AGAIN WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING, BELIEVE ME. ( APPLAUSE ) MERRY CHRISTMAS. THEY'VE BEEN DOWNPLAYING THAT LITTLE BEAUTIFUL PHRASE.
Stephen: YES, THEY ARE DOWNPLAYING IT FOR SOME REASON. I'M JUST SPITBALLING HERE. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S JULY. I DON'T. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND NOW THAT THEY'VE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT, THE SCOUTS HAVE UPDATED THEIR OATH. LET ME JUST-- ( CLEARS THROAT ) ON MY HONOR, I WILL DO MY BEST TO MAKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND BUY A SEX YACHT LIKE THAT OLD GUY THE PRESIDENT KNOWS, TO KEEP MYSELF PHYSICALLY STRONG WITH GOLF AND STEAK, AND REFER ALL QUESTIONS TO OUTSIDE COUNSEL. MERRY CHRISTMAS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MR. CHARLIE ROSE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I TELL YOU WHETHER JEFF SESSIONS STILL HAS A JOB. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND RIGHT THERE.
Jon: THANK YOU.
Stephen: FOLKS, I NEVER SAID-- THIS IS SOMETHING. I'M ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY.
Jon: WHAT'S THAT?
Stephen: BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SHOCKED GRANDMA JEFF SESSIONS. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN RIPPING INTO SESSIONS ALL WEEK. JUST THIS AFTERNOON HE SAID THIS:
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE RECUSED HIMSELF ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE TOOK OFFICE, AND IF HE WAS GOING TO RECUSE HIMSELF, HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME PRIOR TO TAKING OFFICE, AND I WOULD HAVE QUITE SIMPLY PICKED SOMEBODY ELSE. SO I THINK THAT IS A BAD THING, NOT FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT FOR THE PRESIDENCY. I THINK IT IS UNFAIR TO THE PRESIDENCY, AND THAT IS THE WAY I FEEL.
Stephen: YES, TRUMP FEELS THAT'S BAD FOR THE PRESIDENCY. HE'S AFRAID IS MIGHT LEAD TO IMPEACH-MENT. AND THAT'S JUST THE LATEST. YESTERDAY, TRUMP TWEETED, "SO WHY AREN'T THE COMMITTEES AND INVESTIGATORS, AND OF COURSE OUR BELEAGUERED A.G., LOOKING INTO CROOKED HILLARY'S CRIMES AND RUSSIA RELATIONS?" HE'S GOT A POINT. HE'S NOT LOOKING INTO HILLARY'S TIES TO RUSSIA. AND DURING THE DEBATES, WE KNOW SHE MET WITH KNOWN RUSSIAN SYMPATHIZER DONALD TRUMP THREE TIMES! SHARED THE STAGE WITH HIM. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. SOMETHING DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT. SO IF TRUMP HATES SESSIONS SO MUCH, IF HE DOESN'T TRUST HIM, WHY DOESN'T HE JUST FIRE HIM? WELL, ACCORDING TO CNN'S CHRIS CILLIZZA, TRUMP DOESN'T ACTUALLY LIKE TO FIRE PEOPLE AND "WANTS TO MAKE SESSIONS' LIFE SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT SESSIONS THROWS UP HIS HANDS AND WALKS AWAY." TRUMP'S LIKE A BAD BOYFRIEND WHO WHO'S TOO SCARED TO BREAK UP WITH YOU AND WHO'S DARING YOU TO BREAK UP WITH HIM. "OH, LOOKS LIKE YOU CAUGHT ME IN BED WITH YOUR SISTER. ALSO, SORRY I FORGOT YOUR BIRTHDAY, I WAS TOO BUSY SELLING YOUR JEWELRY FOR DRUGS. SO, YOU READY FOR DINNER?" TRUMP HAS PLANS TO REPLACE SESSIONS AND HAS FLOATED NAMES, LIKE FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR AND EMBALMER'S DISPLAY MODEL, RUDY GIULIANI.
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: AND HE'S EVEN CONSIDERING HIS FORMER RIVAL, TED CRUZ. WELL, OF COURSE! YOU KNOW YOU WANT CRUZ AT THE HEAD OF JUSTICE. WE ALL REMEMBER HOW TRUMP SPENT THE CAMPAIGN CALLING HIM "TRUTHFUL TED!" NOW, OBVIOUSLY THIS PUTS JEFF SESSIONS IN A TOUGH POSITION, AND TODAY, ONE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FRIENDS EVEN TOLD REPORTERS "SESSIONS IS TOTALLY PISSED OFF ABOUT IT." AND YOU COULD TELL BECAUSE EVERY TIME SESSIONS GETS ANGRY, THE BELLS ON HIS LITTLE CURLY SHOES START RINGING. IN FACT, HE'S SO ANGRY, HE'S I'M HONORED TO SAY THAT HE'S HERE TONIGHT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE PUBLICLY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, JEFFERSON BEAURAGARD SESSIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY, SIR? IF YOU ARE GOING TO DISPARAGE MY GOOD REPUTATION, AT LEAST HAVE THE COURTESY TO DO SO TO MY FACE AT MY ENCHANTED TREE. I AM DOUBLE-STUFFED WITH INDIGNITY! ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, I WILL NOT SURRENDER. I STAND FIRM... ON THE OUTSIDE. ON THE INSIDE, I AM CREAMY FUDGE, SIR. I SHALL NEVER BE REPLACED! OH, NO! OH, NO! IT'S RUDY GIULIANI! QUICK! QUICK! QUICK, STEPHEN. QUICK, STEPHEN. HIDE ME IN YOUR MOUTH! GONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CHARLIE ROSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, JON. I LOVE THAT SONG. THAT'S YOURS, RIGHT?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: I LOVE THAT. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST HAS MADE A REMARKABLE CAREER ASKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON "CBS THIS MORNING," "60 MINUTES," AND "CHARLIE ROSE." MY QUESTION IS: HOW DOES HE HAVE TIME TO BE HERE? PLEASE WELCOME CHARLIE ROSE!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THE INTERVIEW WITH THE BOY SCOUTS KEEPS ON GIVING, DOESN'T IT?
Stephen: THE BOY SCOUT THING IS EXTRAORDINARY. WERE YOU A BOY SCOUT?
I WAS INDEED, BUT NEVER A MERIT SCOUT.
Stephen: I WAS A BOY SCOUT FOR ONE DAY.
FOR ONE DAY IS A BIG THING GR WE MARCHED THROUGH WOODS I ALREADY KNEW AND I SAID I CAN DO THIS MYSELF.
YOU WERE A SOWK CAROLINA BOY AND I WAS A NORTH CAROLINA BOY, AND BOY SCOUTS WAS A BIG THING.
Stephen: I WANTED TO BE WITH MY FRIENDS AND I SAID CAN'T WE PLAY WITHOUT THE ADULTS AROUND? THEN WE CAN SET FIRE WITH NO SUPERVISE. IT'S SO MUCH FUN. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. THERE IS A SORT OF MORAL HERESY, I THINK, GOING TO CHILDREN AND POURING YOUR POLITICAL POISON IN THEIR EAR. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE, DON'T YOU THINK?
ABSOLUTELY. BUT IT WAS AN INTERVIEW OR SPEECH THAT KEPT ON GIVING-- ONE POSSIBILITY TO DO A JOKE AFTER ANOTHER. IT'S LIKE I'M DOING THIS FOR STEPHEN. WHEREVER HE IS, I HOPE YOU'RE LISTENING.
Stephen:  WELL, IF YOU ARE LISTENING, SIR, YOU CAN STOP. ALL FULL, THANKS. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, LISTEN, HOW ARE YOU DOING? SINCE LAST TIME WE HAD YOU ON HERE, YOU HAD HEART SURGERY.
I DID.
Stephen: IN PB. ARE THEY BUILDING A BIGGER, BETTER, INDESTRUCTIBLE CHARLIE ROSE?
A BIONIC MAN. I'VE GOT TWO ARTIFICIAL VALVES AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S NEXT, BUT I'M READY.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY TOUGH AS HELL. WE SHOWED THIS VIDEO AT THE UP-FRONTS WHEN WE WERE TALKING TO ALL THE ADVERTISERS THIS STRENGTH ♪ GET A LOAD OF CHARLIE ROSE ♪ ♪ I HAVE A BRAND NEW TICKER, SON
Stephen: I SAY SIGN ME UP.
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO DO THAT?
Stephen: MAN, THAT'S INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. NOW, YOU'RE KNOWN SORT OF FAMOUSLY AS A GUY WHO LOST TO WORK. OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE "CBS THIS MORNING." YOU HAVE YOUR PBS SHOW. RERUNS ON BLOOMBERG. YOU DO "60 MINUTES." BUT THIS YEAR, YOU WERE FORCED TO TAKE A BREAK FOR THE SURGERY. THAT WAS HARD FOR YOU?
WELL, IT WAS NECESSARY. SO, THEREFORE, THE DOCTOR SAYS, "YOU'VE GOT TO DO THIS." SO I HAD A WEEK IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY DID THE SURGERY.
Stephen: THAT'S TA WEEK?
YEAH.
Stephen: THEY CRACK THE RIBS AND IT'S ONLY A WEEK?
THEY DID. OPENED IT UP AND WENT IN THERE AND GAVE ME A NEW VALVE. A COW VALVE.
Stephen: A COW VALVE?
A COW VALVE. THEY SAY A BOVINE.
Stephen: OH, A COW VALVE? HONEST TO GOD, IT'S A COW IN YOU?
IT IS. AND THE OTHER ONE IS A PIG. SO I'VE GOT A EXPIG A COW COMPETING TO SEND BLOOD TO MY HEART.
Stephen: WOW. GOD, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT JEWISH. ( LAUGHTER )
NOT YET.
Stephen: NOT YET, OKAY, YOU'LL GET THERE, YEAH.
BUT THE IDEA OF WORK-- PEOPLE SAY, YDO YOU WORK SO HARD?" IT'S NOT WORK. IT'S PLAY, IN A SENSE. I SPENT THE WEEKEND WORKING FOR "60 MINUTES." I WENT OUT TO SAN DIEGO AND A PLAY CAWLS DEL MAR, WHERE THE HORSE CALLED AROGAY, IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST HORSE IN THE WORLD, RACE HORSE, AND EVERYBODY HAS SAID IS CLOSE TO, LIKE, SECRETARIAT. HE'S THAT GOOD. I WENT OUT AND HUNG OUT WITH THE JOCKEY, HUNG OUT WITH THE TRAINER. THE HORSE LOST BUT IT WAS GREAT FUN FOR ME. IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO DO.
Stephen: RIGHT, PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO PAY TO GO SEE HORSES.
EXACTLY, AND BET A LOT OF MONEY, AS I DID. I BET ON THE HORSE. HE DIDN'T WIN. I LOST A BUNCH OF MONEY.
Stephen: WOW, DO YOU NEED TO BORROW SOMEONE.
JUST FOR THE TAXI BACK HOME AND I'LL BE OKAY.
Stephen: I ALSO WANTED TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND TO EVERYBODY AT "CBS THIS MORNING." TELL ME IF I HAVE THIS RIGHT. YOU PERSONALLY WERE NOMINATED FOR TWO NEWS EMMYS FOR "CBS THIS MORNING" COVERAGE OF THE ATLANTA-- AND "CBS THIS MORNING" GOT SEVEN NOMINATIONS.
THEY DID.
Stephen: AND YOU GOT A NOMINATION FOR THE "60 MINUTES" STORY YOU DID ON THE POPE'S CHOIR. WHAT IS THE POPE'S CHOIR?
IT'S CALLED THE SISTINE CHAPEL'S CHOIR, TOO. YOUNG BOYS, AND THEY ARE AMAZING. BUT I MUST SAY ABOUT THESE TWO NOMINATIONS, AS YOU KNOW IN TELEVISION, IT'S A COLLABORATIVE ART-- NO, I KNOW. NOT FOR YOU.
Stephen: JUST YOU AND ME, FOLKS.
ALL THOSE JOKES I LISTENED TO TONIGHT, RIGHT OUT OF STEPHEN'S BRAIN.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. MY WRITERS WRITE THEM DOWN AFTER THE SHOW IS OVER.
AND THEY SAY I WISH I'D WRITTEN THIS. IT'S A COLLABORATIVE ART. IT'S ABOUT THE POPE'S CHOIR AND GOT TO SPEND, AGAIN, FOUR DAYS IN ROME.
Stephen: DID YOU SEE THE POPE?
I SAW HIM, MET HIM, SHOOK HANDS, PRETTY NICE. I'M PROTESTANT.
Stephen: YOU'RE A CATHOLIC NOW.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S FIRST STEP TO CONVERSION.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A CONTACT TIE DISWHR.
EXACTLY. YOU JUST WENT TO A PLACE I LOVE, ACTUALLY, WHICH IS RUSSIA. I WENT TO ST. PETERSBURG AND WENT OVER TO INTERVIEW PUTIN.
Stephen: YOU HAVE INTERVIEWED PUTIN TWICE, RIGHT?
I HAVE, INDEED. ONCE IN ST. PETERSBURG, A WONDERFUL, LOVELY CITY.
Stephen: IT IS A LOVELY CITY, YEAH, YEAH. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM? HAVING MET HIM AND SAT DOWN AND TALKED WITH HIM TWICE, WHAT IS HE LIKE AS A PERSON?
TO HIS CREDIT, HE WAS ENGAGED. HE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS-- I'M NOT SURE THEY WERE ALL TRUTHFUL. FOR EXAMPLE I SAID TO HIM, "THERE'S A SAYING IN MOSCOW, ONCE A K.G.B. AGENT, ALWAYS A K.G.B. AGENT." HE SAID, "THAT'S TRUE. THINGS I LEARNED IN THE K.G.B., HAVE NEVER GONE AWAY FROM ME."
Stephen: LIKE UNDERMINING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?
EXACTLY. WHATEVER HE MEANT. BUT HE WAS ENGAGED. AND AFTER THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER HE SAID, "DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR A CUP OF TEA?" AND I SAID, "CERTAINLY, SIR." WE WENT INTO A CONFERENCE ROOM, NO VODKA, JUST TEA. AND WE SAT DOWN AND HAD A LONG CONVERSATION, MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS THERE, MY PRODUCER WAS THERE, AND HE HAD ONE EXPRN A TRANSLATOR AND WE TALKED AN HOUR AND A HALF ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. >.
Stephen: DID YOU MAKE SURE HE SIPPED HIS TEA FIRST?
I DID.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE NOW PICKING UP AN EARLY LOVE OF YOURS THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE IN MANY YEARS. ARE YOU STARTING TO SURF AGAIN?
I'M STARTING TO FIND OUT. I HAVEN'T ASKED MY DOCTORS YET. AND THAT'S A CRUCIAL QUESTION.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO BE CLEARED BY YOUR VALVE DOCTOR.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO ASK THE COW AND THE PIG.
RIGHT, HOW ABOUT MOO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU STARTED -- YOU STARTED-- YOU STARTED SURFING WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.
I DID.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING BACK TO SOMETHING.
IN NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA BEACH. I LEARNED AT VIRGINIA BEACH.
Stephen: THAT'S BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THERE WERE LONG BOARDS.
WHEN I WAS A CHILD, 18, 19 YEARS OLD. I JUST THOUGHT-- SOME PEOPLE I KNOW ARE DOING IF AND THEY'RE ADULTS AND THEY WENT TO IT AFTER HAVING A LIFETIME OF INTEREST IN OTHER SPORTS. AND THEY LOVE IT. AND I THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT. I THOUGHT IT MAY TAKE A ATTACK OF WEEK AND FIND OUT IF THERE IS SOMEBODY IN HAWAII WHO WILL GIVE ME A SHOT, SPEND A WEEK, SEEING HOW MUCH I CAN PICK UP AND SEE IF I CAN BRING IT BACK. OR IN FACT THEY WILL SAY TO ME, "YOU'RE TOO OLD, SON. GO BACK TO GOLF. GLVMENT IS THIS FOR TV OR JUST FOR YOUR LIFE?
JUST FOR MY LIFE, MY EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: WELL, AT LEAST SEND SOME PHOTOS, PLEASE.
OH, I WILL.
Stephen: IN THE SPEEDO.
WE'LL SEE. YOU DON'T CARE WHETHER THERE'S A SURF BOARD THERE OR NOT.
Stephen: NO, I DON'T.
JUST A SPEEDO. I CAN SAY ONE THING ABOUT THIS MAN, ALSO. ON MY 75th BIRTHDAY HE WAS VERY, VERY SICK, AND HE MADE DUNT DOWN TO A LITTLE PARTY FOR ME AND WAS LIKE A TROUPER. ON HIS 75th BIRTHDAY-- 30 YEARS FROM NOW, 40 YEARS FROM NOW. I'LL BE 105, AND I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU. A DEAL IS A DEAL.
Stephen: THANK YOU, CHARLIE. ALL NEW VALVES AT THAT POINT. "CBS THIS MORNING" AIRS WEEK DAYS ON CBS. "CHARLIESE" AIRS WEEK NIGHTS ON PBS AND BLOOMBERG. CHARLIE ROSE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JESSICA WILLIAMS. STICK AROUND. THANKS, CHARLIE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT MY NEXT GUEST. SHE WAS "THE DAILY SHOW'S" YOUNGEST CORRESPONDENT EVER AND NOW STARS IN "THE INCREDIBLE JESSICA JAMES." PLEASE WELCOME JESSICA WILLIAMS. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT.
OH, BOY.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
OH, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I APPRECIATE IT.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN ABOUT A YEAR THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ON HERE. SINCE THEN, YOU'VE LEFT "THE DAILY SHOW." THINGS ARE BLOWING UP FOR YOU. I UNDERSTAND-- AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT THINGS TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF YOUR CAREER-- BUT THE MOST EXCITING THING I'VE HEARD IN ALMOST ANYONE'S LIFE HAS HAPPENED TO YOU. CAN YOU TELL THE PEOPLE WHO YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND IS.
SO I RECENTLY GOT TO MEET J.K. ROWLING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I AM A HUGE HARRY POTTER FAN. I'M 27 AND I FEEL LIKE I GOT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF POTTER MANIA AT THAT AGE.
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
I WAS LIKE, "MOM, TAKE ME OUT AT MIDNIGHT. I WANT TO GO, LIKE, GET A BOOK." YEAH, I TOTALLY MET HER. AND HOW IT HAPPENED WAS MAYBE MY SECOND YEAR ON "THE DAILY SHOW," SHE STARTED FOLLOWING ME ON TWITTER. AND I GOT REALLY FREAKED OUT, AND I WAS LIKE MAYBE IT'S LIKE, SHE'S, LIKE, FAKE FOLLOWING ME, LIKE WHEN BARACK OBAMA FOLLOWED A MILLION PEOPLE AND YOU'RE LIKE, WHATEVER. SHE HAD ACTUALLY FOLLOWED ME.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU KNOW SHE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED YOU?
BECAUSE SHE ONLY FOLLOW MAYBE 300 PEOPLE AT THAT TIME. I WAS LIKE OKAY, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. THIS IS VERY REAL. SO THEN, I KIND OF STOPPED TWEETING. LIKE, I GOT TWITTER SHY. IT'S LIKE WHAT DO YOU SAY AT THE ALTAR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, WHEN YOU GET THERE?
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HER?
YEAH, LIKE WHAT DO YOU SAY! WHAT I DO SAY TO HER? SHE ENDED UP DM''ING ME.
Stephen: WHAT DID HE SAY?
I ALWAYS KNEW I HAD THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS HARRY POTTER WHICH MEANS I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS HER BECAUSE BOTH OF OUR BIRTHDAYS ARE JULY 31. SHE WAS LIKE, "HEY, IT'S ME." IN MY HEAD I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW." AND SHE WAS LIKE, "I WAS LOOKING UP PEOPLE THEY SHARE THE SAME BIRTHDAY WITH, AND I SAW THAT YOU WERE ONE OF THEM AND I WAS GOING TO WISH YOU A HAPPY HOUR BIRTHDAY BUT I BLOODY FORGET." AND THEN SHE PUT, "WHICH IS TYPICAL ME." AND SHE SAID, "ANYWAY, I THINK THAT YOU ARE FUNNY, BRAVE, AND COURAGEOUS.
AND ALWAYS KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD "DAILY SHOW" WHEN YOU'RE ON."
Stephen: WOW.
I WAS JUST, LIKE, SOBBING. I WAS LIKE-- LIKE I WAS DEAD.
Stephen: SO WHAT DID YOU SAY BACK?
I WAS JUST LIKE, "THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHERE DO I START? I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOUR STORIES, AND I JUST THINK YOU'RE AMAZING. ALSO, HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO WRITE BACK RIGHT AWAY.
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY. I TOOK, LIKE A WEEK BECAUSE I WAS DRAFTING. I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS TRASH. THIS IS TRASH."
Stephen: DID YOU SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW FIRST?
I DID. I WAS WORKSHOPPING IT AROUND TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I WAS LIKE THERE WERE NO BAD IDEAS AND THERE WERE A LOT OF BAD IDEAS. I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HOUSE I WOULD BE IN IF I WENT TO HOG WARTS GLI HEARD ABOUT THIS, TOO. WHAT DID SHE SAY?
I DIDN'T ASK VIA D.M. I WAS AFRAID TO TWEET AND IT SEEMED LIKE A BIG DEAL, TOO BIG A DEAL TO SLIDE HER D.M.s ABOUT. MY BOYFRIEND WAS LIKE-- WE WERE AT A BAR MAYBE, LIKE, A MONTH AND A HALF AGO, AND HE WAS LIKE, "SHUD.M. HER." I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?" AND HE SAID, "YOU SHOULD MESSAGE HER." I DID A SHOT. AND I MESSAGED HER. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, JOJO."
Stephen: IS THAT YOUR NAME FOR HER?
YEAH, IT'S MY NAME FOR HER. IT'S, LIKE, IGNORANT. IT'S MY NAME FOR AMERICAN IT'S DEFINITELY JOANNE. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, JOJO, IT'S JESSICA. I JUST WANTED TO SAY 'HEY' AND SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING?" AND SHE MESSAGED BACK A LOT OF STUFF. AND SHE SAID, "WHEN IS THE NEXT TIME YOU WILL BE IN LONDON. I PROMISE I'M NOT THIS BLABBY AFTER FORCOCKTAILS." VERY OVERWHELMED.
Stephen: THAT LED TO THIS?
YES, HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND JOJO. IT'S AMAZING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S AMAZING. I WAS NERVOUS.
Stephen: SO GO ON, TELL YOUR STORY. I WANT TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT.
OKAY GREAT.
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO CHECK OUT IF SHE FOLLOWS ME.
WELL, SHE PROBABLY DOES. I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING HER. I WAS WORRIED IT WOULD BE LIKE A REALLY BAD TINDER DATE OR SOMETHING WHERE WE BIT INTO A PIECE OF SALMON AND HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER. BUT WHEN I MET HER SHE WAS REALLY, REALLY COOL. AND WE HAD A LOT IN COMMON, WHICH RULED. SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME?" AND I SAID, "I ACTUALLY LOVE TO PLAY THE SIMS." AND SHE FEELS LIKE, "YOU PLAY THE CYMES, TOO." JKROWL-- HERE IT IS.
Stephen: J.K. ROWLING FOLLOWS YOU! WAIT, WAIT. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW HER.
YOU HAVE TO.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO FOLLOW HER. LET ME HIT HER UP RIGHT HERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: OKAY, SO I'LL SAY HEY, JOJO. HYPHEN. STEPHEN COLBERT HERE. COMMA. JUST HANGING WITH JESS. PERIOD. SHE SAYS YOU PUT HER IN...
SHE TOLD ME I WAS GRIFFENDORF.
Stephen: GRIFFIN DORPH HOUSE. PERIOD SIRI KNOWS HOW TO SPELL GRIFFINDORF." I KNOW WE JUST MET. COMMA. NOT TO PUT OW THE SPOT. COMMA. BUT WHAT HOUSE WOULD I NUMBER? QUESTION MARK. HOPE WE MEET SOME DAY. PERIOD. I LOVE YOU. STEPHEN. ( APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT TO WAIT ON THAT, OBVIOUSLY. WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I FIND OUT.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE CALLED...
"THE INCREDIBLE JESSICA JAMES."
Stephen: OKAY, AND IS THIS YOUR LIFE? ARE YOU JESSICA JAMES OR HOW MUCH OF JESSICA JAMES IS YOU?
WELL, JESSICA JAMES AND I ARE SIMILAR IN THAT BOTH BOTH SIX FEET TALL AND WE'RE BOTH BLACK WOMEN, WHICH IS CORRECT. AND, ALSO, WE ARE SIMILAR-- IT'S NOT BASED ON MY LIFE. DITHIS MOVIE WITH THIS WRITER AND DIRECTOR JIEMED JIM STROUSE, AND I DID THIS MOVIE "PEOPLE, PLACES AND THINGS" A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND IT WAS REALLY FUN. AND THE NICE THING THAT HE SAID, HE WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY WRITES YOU A MOVIE." BECAUSE I WAS A SUPPORTING CHARACTER. AND HE SAID, "I CAN WRITE HER A MOVIE." WE WORKED TOGETHER FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE IDEA. WE SHOT IT AND I BECAME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MOVIE. AND JESSICA JAMES IS BASICALLY THIS 25-YEAR-OLD PLAYWRIGHT WHO IS LIVING IN BROOKLYN WHO IS GOING THROUGH A REALLY BAD BREAKUP AND REALLY WANTS TO SUCK SEEPED IN HER CAREER AND IT'S A COMEDY WITH A LOT OF ROMANCE IN IT.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE CLIP?
, I DO, ACTUALLY. IT'S WHERE JESSICA JAMES IS SET UP ON A BLIND DADE WITH CHRIS O'DOWD'S CHARACTER.
TASHA THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME TO GET OVER THIS GUY I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE WITH. BUT TO BE HONEST, THIS WHOLE THING IS MAKING ME THINK ABOUT HIM MORE INTENSELY.
HOW SO?
I'M JUST REMINDED OF HOW MUCH HIM YOU'RE NOT.
COOL. I MEAN, I GET IT. UM... YOU ARE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE TO MY EX-WIFE.
WHAT IS SHE DUMB, SHORT, AND (BLEEP)?
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW FILM.
I APPRECIATE THAT, THANK YOU. "THE INCREDIBLE JESSICA JAMES" IS ON NETFLIX ON FRIDAY. CHECK OUT HER PODCAST. JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH AUTHOR MAX BROOKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY NEXT GUEST IS THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF "THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE" AND "WORLD WAR Z." PLEASE WELCOME MAX BROOKS. HEY, MAX. COME ON UP. THERE YOU GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" CALLED YOU "THE ZOMBIE ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LAUREATE" OF THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE ZOMBIES HAVE BEEN POPULAR, YOU KNOW, FOR A LONG TIME, BUT YOU'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT THEM SINCE 1997. WHAT DRAWS YOU TO THE ZOMBIE GENRE?
WELL, I DON'T THINK IT SO MUCH DRAWS ME AS REPEL MEAS. IT'S FEAR. BECAUSE I GREW UP IN A PRETTY NERVOUS HOUSEHOLD.
Stephen: RIGHT. YOUR FATHER IS THE GREAT MEL BROOKS AND YOUR MOTHER WAS THE GREAT ANNE BANKROFT. AMAZING.
THANK YOU. MY MOTHER IS ADDITION TO BEING THE GREAT ANNE BANE KROFT, SHE GOT DEATH THREATS IN THE 60s WHEN SHE KISSED SIDNEY PORTIER AT THE OSCARS. IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE WHOEVER WAS GIVING AWAY THE OSCAR GIVES THE WINNER A PECK ON THE CHEEK. THAT HAPPENED. SIDNEY PORTIER CAME OUT, AND NEXT DAY, A MOUNTAIN OF MAIL THREATENING HER LIFE. SO SHE WAS A LITTLE JUMPY, AND SHE WAS A LITTLE WORRIED I WOULD BE KIDNAPPED. NOW, HERE'S THE THING. MOST OF US HAVE MOMS OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, WHO ARE WORRIED WE'RE ANYTHING TO BE KIDNAPPED. BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS AN OSCAR AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS ACTING OUT HOW YOU WOULD BE KIDNAPPED. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE FAVORITE SCENARIOS YOU REMEMBER?
OH, YES, MY MOTHER WOULD ACT IT OUT. IT WOULD BE A PLAY, THE CURTAIN WOULD GO UP AND SHE'D SAY, "ALL RIGHT, YOU'LL BE AT A FIELD TRIP AND YOU'LL BE OUT AND SOME GUY WILL COME UP AND SAY 'HEY, KID. YOU WANT A CHOCOLATE BAR'?" MY MOTHER GREW UP IN THE 30s. SO NOT ONLY WOULD I BE KIDNAPPED BUT BY A PROHIBITION MOBSTER JIMMY CAGNEY. COME HERE, KID. WE'RE FLIPPING A COIN. THAT WAS MY CHILDHOOD.
Stephen: AND DID YOUR DAD LIGHTEN TAT ALL OR WAS HE JUST LIKE, "I LEAVE THAT TO YOUR MOTHER."
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MY DAD YOU THINK OF HIM AS MEL BROOKS THE GENIUS, I KNOW HIM AS A MAN WHO SPENT HIS FORMATIVE YEARS DEFUSION MINE S.
Stephen:  SO ALSO JUMPY.
A LITTLE JUMPY IN MY FAMILY.
Stephen: YOU GREW UP IN "THE HURT LOCKER."
I DID, AND MY MOTHER WAS A SURVIVALIST. SHE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE QUAKE. I BROUGHT HOME MY GIRLFRIEND AND MY MOTHER SAID CASUALLY, "WELL, WE CAN EAT THE DOG." "HAS A LOT OF MEAT ON IT. IT COULD BE A WEEK OR TWO."
Stephen: SO YOU'RE TOTALLY SET UP TO WRITE THE "THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE."
YES, I TOOK IT ALL AND PUT IT IN BOOK S.
Stephen:  AS SOMEONE WHO HAS THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS, YOU SEE PEOPLE ONLINE A LOT OF TIMES POSTING WHAT THEY THINK WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL LAIR, LIKE A HOUSE OR LOCATION OR MOUNTAIN OR FORTRESS THAT COULD SURVIVE A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE HOUSE OR DESIGN THAT YOU THINK WOULD SURVIVE THE SHAMBLING MASS?
YES. I DESIGNED A ZOMBIE-PROOF HOME. NEVER PUBLISHED IT.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, "BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS" ACTUALLY HAS A SOFTWARE WHERE YOU CAN DESIGN YOUR DREAM HOUSE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY INTENDED. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR HOUSE LIKE?
ROUND. BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICS. BECAUSE --
Stephen: ROUND!
EXACTLY!
Stephen: AS IF THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE PHYSICS? ZOMBIE CAN'T GRAB ROUND THINGS.
YOU HAVE A FLAT SURFACE IT CHANNELS ALL THE FORCE TO CRACK IT BUT IF IT'S ROUND, IT EVENLY DISTRIBUTES THE PRESSURE.
Stephen: OH, I SEE, I SEE.
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WAY TOO MUCH.
Stephen: YES, THIS IS ALL-- IT'S ALL CLEAR NOW. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. ( LAUGHTER ).
YES.
Stephen: WELL, YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "MINECRAFT: THE ISLAND," "MINECRAFT" SECOND BIGGEST SELLING VIDEO GAME OF ALL TIME, LIKE BUYING TETRIS. WHY A BOOK OF A VIDEO GAME? DO YOU THINK VIDEO GAMES ARE A GATEWAY TO READING?
THEY CAN BE. THIS ONE CAN BE. BECAUSE I AM A PARENT. YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EDUCATE YOUR KIDS BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THIS POOR GENERATION COMING UP, THEY DON'T HAVE THE ROLE MODELS THAT WE GREW UP WITH. YOU KNOW, THE KIDS OF TODAY, THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD, SOLID ROLE MODELMODELS TO TEACH THEM HOW TO THEIR LIVES LIKE WE DID. WE HAD MEL GIBSON, O.J.
Stephen: YES.
SO YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW LESSONS. AND I STARTED PLAYING "MINECRAFT" WITH MY KID, AND I REALIZED OH, MY GOD. THIS GAME TEACHES YOU EVERYTHING. IT TEACHES YOU PLANNING. IT TEACHES YOU PREPARATION. IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO RECOVER FROM FAILURE. WHAT DOES TETRI TEACH YOU, ANGER MANAGEMENT.
Stephen: WHAT TO DO WITH AN "L-"SHAPED PIECE OF THING?
THAT'S IT. "MINECRAFT" LITERALLY TRAINS YOU HOW TO BE CREATE AND I HAVE SURVIVE THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21st CENTURY.
Stephen: THE GREAT GREAT GEORGE ROMERO, WHO INVENTED THE MODERN CONCEPT OF A ZOMBIE AS AN UNDEAD THAT EATS YOU OR BITES YOU. YOU TURN INTO A ZOMBIE YOURSELF. HE JUST DIED LAST WEEK.
HE DID, GOD BLESS HIM.
Stephen: SADLY. DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW HIS MOVIES, LIKE WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?
YES, OF COURSE, I DID. I WAS YOUNG. SOME TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL AND "NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD" CAME ON. I WAS VERY SCARED OF ZOMBIES BUT ROMERO GAVE ME HOPE. THIS WAS A WAY TO FIGHT THEM. YOU JUST HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WAY WAS. YOU COULD SURVIVE. HOW WERE YOU GOING TO DO IT? AND THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH A GREAT METAPHOR FOR LIFE.
Stephen: YES, FIRE AND HIDING IS HOW YOU DO IT IN THAT ONE.
YOU JUST NAMED MY 20s.
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, MACK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE BOOK "MINECRAFT: THE ISLAND" IS IN STORES NOW. MAX BROOKS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE ) "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE MICHAEL MOORE, SUTTON FOSTER, AND MUSICAL GUEST, BLACK. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, JULIE CHEN AND EDIE FALCO. GOOD NIGHT!
