IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES FELICITY HUFFMAN JURNEE SMOLLET-BELL AND COMEDIAN ANTHONY DeVITO. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, CHRIS. WHAT'S UP, PAUL? HEY! THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELL, FOLKS, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY FRIDAY. YOU GUYS READY FOR THE WEEKEND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE A FRIDAY CROWD. I LOVE A FRIDAY CROWD. THEY'RE ELECT. NOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS GOOD WEEKENDS DOWN IN MAR-A-LAGO, ALL THE TIME. EVER SINCE HE BECAME THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD, WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS GUY AND HIS POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST OVERSEAS. WELL, THERE'S A NEW ONE. THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT TRUMP MAY HAVE VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION TO TRADEMARK MASSAGE PARLORS AND ESCORT SERVICES IN CHINA. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon: WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: THIS IS TRUE. AND UNLIKE THESE MASSAGES, THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY MAY NOT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. NOW-- SO I HEAR. SO I HEAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE.
Stephen: I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THE CONSTITUTION IS TOUGH ON MASSAGE PARLORS. THAT'S WHY GEORGE WASHINGTON HAD TO CLOSE "PAPA GEORGE'S YE OLDE TANNERY AND TUG SHOPPE." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HIS MOTIVES HERE. EVIDENTLY, "MANY COMPANIES REGISTER TRADEMARKS IN CHINA TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM USING THEIR. NAMES." SO WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE KIND OF PRESIDENT WHO OPENS CHINESE ESCORT SERVICES, BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE THE KIND WHO KNOWS HIS NAME WOULD BE PERFECT FOR ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE IS ALSO-- THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROVERSY SWIRLING AROUND TRUMP'S NEW HEAD OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, FORMER OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND BARGAIN BIN GEORGE W. BUSH, SCOTT PRUITT. HE IS A MAN WHO KNOWS THE E.P.A. EXTREMELY WELL, BECAUSE HE'S SUED IT 14 TIMES. AND YESTERDAY, PRUITT MADE HEADLINES FOR WHAT HE SAID IN THIS INTERVIEW.
LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER THING, JUST TO GET TO THE NITTY-GRITTY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN PROVEN THAT C.O.-2 IS THE PRIMARY CONTROL KNOB FOR CLIMATE? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
NO, I WOULD NOT AGREE THAT IT'S A PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE GLOBAL WARMING THAT WE SEE.
Stephen: YEAH, IT'S NOT A PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE GLOBAL WARMING WE SEE, JUST THE KIND WE FEEL, AS IT GETS HOTTER AND HOTTER EVERY YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN'T SEE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE HEAD OF THE E.P.A. MIGHT WANT TO READ? THE E.P.A.'S OWN WEBSITE, WHICH STATES CLEARLY THAT "HUMAN ACTIVITY, LIKE BURNING FOSSIL FUELS, RELEASE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE, THE PRIMARY GREENHOUSE GAS CONTRIBUTING TO RECENT CLIMATE CHANGE." YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T CONTRADICT YOUR OWN WEBSITE. THAT'S LIKE BUZZFEED SAYING THEY DON'T BELIEVE A QUIZ CAN TELL YOU IF YOU'RE A LUMIERE OR A COGSWORTH. ( LAUGHTER ) LUMIERE, BY THE WAY.
Jon: OH, YEAH, UH-HUH.
Stephen: BUT MAYBE PRUITT IS RIGHT. MAYBE C.O.-2 ISN'T THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING. MAYBE IT'S THE HEAD OF THE E.P.A. BLOWING SMOKE UP THE OIL INDUSTRY'S ASS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, TOM BRADY IS BACK IN THE NEWS. YOU ALL KNOW TOM BRADY. I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT GUY FROM THE SUPER BOWL.
Jon: HUT! HUT!
Stephen: THRU HAVE IT, WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM, THOSE ARE DEFINITELY THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS. AND NOW THE THING IS, TOM BRADY IS ENDORSING A MEAL SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE CALLED PURPLE CARROT, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS NAMED AFTER ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST EUPHEMISMS FOR A PENIS. AND THE COMPANY IS OFFERING A NEW LINE OF MEALS THAT FOLLOW BRADY'S NOTORIOUSLY HEALTHY DIET, INCLUDING:  BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE NOT GINGERING YOUR AMORANTH, YOU'RE AN IDIOT. DO YOU, JON?
Jon: I CAN'T SAY THEY DO.
Stephen: HOW MANY SUPER BOWL RINGS DO YOU HAVE?
Jon: I DON'T HAVE ANY.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY. BRADY CLEARLY EXCITEDLY ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP RELEASING THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: OKAY, BUT HERE'S THE THING-- EATING LIKE TOM BRADY ISN'T THE PART OF HIS LIFE THAT YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT. ( LAUGHTER ) PLEASE, LET ME KNOW WHEN THERE'S A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE THAT MAILS YOU A SUPER MODEL, CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS AND $24 MILLION A YEAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF NOT, IF NOT, I MIGHT JUST STICK TO WATCHING FOOTBALL AND DRINKING MY WAY TO NACHO CHEESE. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S A GREAT STORY OUT OF DELIVER BLIFFIA. ANY BLIFFIANS HERE.
Audience: YEAH!
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS STORY. THAT ONE GUY IS GOING TO LOVE THIS STORY HERE. WE ALWAYS HAVE ONE EVERY NIGHT, ONE BOLIVIAN EVERY NIGHT. HERE'S A GREAT STORY OUT OF BOLIVIA, WHERE A FRANCISCAN MONASTERY RECENTLY ADOPTED A STRAY DOG AND NAMED HIM FRIAR BIGOTON, LITERALLY TRANSLATES TO "FRIAR MOUSTACHE." THAT'S THE CUTEST CATHOLIC DOG NAME SINCE POPE PEANUT XIV. HE RADICALIZED THE CHURCH'S STANCE ON "WHO'S A GOOD BOY?" UPON RECEIVING HIS NEW TITLE, FRIAR MOUSTACHE ALSO RECEIVED HIS OWN ROBE AND HOOD! AW, WHO'S A DEVOUT PUPPY? YOU ARE! YES, YOU ARE! REMEMBER YOUR VOW OF CELEBACY. NO LEG HUMPING. NO HUMPING THE LEG. ANYWAY, IT'S A CUTE STORY. SORRY, WOMEN, STILL NO ROOM IN THE PRIESTHOOD. BUT THIS GIVES ME AN IDEA. PEOPLE LOVE FRIAR MOUSTACHE AND PEOPLE LOVE HBO DRAMAS ABOUT REVOLUTIONARY RELIGIOUS FIGURES, SO GET READY FOR MY NEW PROJECT. "DOG MONK. THIS SPRING: DOG IS GOD SPELLED. BACKWARDS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ DO YOU HAVE A DOG?
Jon: OH, NO, NO DOG.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A DOG?
Jon: NO.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER HAD A DOG?
Jon: I HAD A DOG WHEN I WAS A KID. I HAD A GERMAN SHEPPARD.
Stephen: NAME?
Jon: I FORGOT HIS NAME.
Stephen: OH, OKAY. MAN'S BEST FRIEND, INDEED. YOU DON'T REMEMBERLET COG'S NAME? A. I WAS VERY YOUNG.IT WAS MY OL
Stephen: ANOTHER SO IT WASN'T REALLY YOUR DOG.
Jon: IT WASN'T REALLY.
Stephen: I HAVE A DOG NAMED COOKIE, THE BEST DOG IN THE WORLD. FOR THE RECORD. I HAD IT NOTARIZED. THERE'S AN EXCITING NEW OPTION FOR OLDER AMERICANS BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, JIMMY BUFFETT IS OPENING A SERIES OF RETIREMENT HOMES. NOW SENIOR CITIZENS CAN LITERALLY WASTE AWAY IN MARGARITAVILLE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ACCORDING TOO-- ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE, THESE ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES ARE "INSPIRED BY THE LEGENDARY MUSIC AND LIFESTYLE OF JIMMY BUFFETT." ALTHOUGH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADAPT "CHEESEBURGER IN PARADISE" TO "GREEN JELLO IN THE DAY ROOM." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY SENIOR SUFFERS FROM EARLY-ONSET PARROTHEAD, AND OUR ELDERLY OF COURSE NEED OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING THE MUSICIAN-AFFILIATED NURSING HOME THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, SAMMY HAGAR'S "CABO WABO RETIREMENT BEACH." YOUR KIDS HAVE TO PUT YOU SOMEPLACE AFTER YOU TURN 55. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND FOR REBELLIOUS OLD PEOPLE WHO DON'T FIT IN AT THOSE CONFORMIST RETIREMENT FACILITIES, THERE'S "THE AGE AGAINST THE MACHINE COMMUNITY OF SCOTTSDALE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Jon: YEAH, I LIKE THAT ONE! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR TONIGHT. FELICITY HUFFMAN IS HERE! BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL GOT. UPDATE ON THE GREAT WALL OF TRUMP. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. JON, YOU KNOW WHO I MISS ON TV RIGHT NOW? OUR DEAR FRIEND CHARLIE ROSE.
Jon: OH, YEAH GR HE'S BEEN OFF "CBS THIS MORNING" A COUPLE, TWO, THREE, FOUR WEEKS RIGHT NOW? BECAUSE HE WENT AND HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT IT'S MONDAY, RIGHT, MODERN OF MONDAY MORNING, CHARLIE ROSE WILL BE RETURNING TO "CBS THIS MORNING." CHARLIE, WELCOME BACK.
Jon: WE SNEA NEED HIM. WE NEED HIM.
Stephen: OTHER THAN THAT, HE'S GOING TO LIVE FOREVER. FANTASTIC. I'M GOING TO GET THE SAME WORK MYSELF. YEAH. WELL, IT'S DAY 50 OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY-- ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT A JOKE YET. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HIS SIGNATURE PROJECT, THE WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER, IS MOVING RIGHT ALONG. THE DUE DATE FOR CONTRACTORS TO SUBMIT PROTOTYPES IS TODAY. BECAUSE THE WALL IS ABOUT TO BECOME A REALITY, I DECIDED TO MEET WITH SOME ACTUAL EXPERTS ON BUILDING TO LEARN WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE IT? AMERICA'S SOUTHERN BORDER HAS BEEN A HOT BUTTON ISSUE FOR YEARS AND NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUSHING FORWARD ON HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO BUILD A WALL, BUT THIS IS PRETTY MUCH ALL WE KNOW ABOUT IT:
THAT WALL IS GOING TO BE SO BIG AND SO STRONG, AND SO POWERFUL, IMPENETRABLE, PHYSICAL, TALL, POWERFUL. IT WILL BE A BIG WALL, A BEAUTIFUL WALL, AND WE'RE GOING TO NAME IS TRUMP SOME DAY, MAYBE, RIGHT? AND MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL.
Stephen: SO I SAT DOWN WITH FOUR EXPERTS TO LEARN WHAT A 2,000-MILE BORDER WALL LOOKS LIKE AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS.
I'M AN ARCHITECT. I PRACTICE IN NEW YORK CITY.
I'M A LISCENCED ENGINEER IN NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT.
I'M A CONCRETE GUY. I OWN A CONCRETE BUSINESS.
I'M AN INTERIOR DESIGNER IN NEW YORK.
Stephen: AS YOU ALL KNOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS SIGNED THE ORDER TO CREATE THE BORDER WALL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE. NOW, DURING THE G.O.P. DEBATE IN HOUSTON, TRUMP SAID THIS:
THIS IS A WALL THAT'S A HECK OF A LOT HIGHER THAN THE CEILING YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THIS IS A WALL THAT'S GOING TO WORK.
Stephen: OKAY, NOW, THE CEILING OF THE VENUE HE WAS IN WAS ABOUT 80 FEET HIGH, OKAY, SO A HECK OF A LOT HIGHER THAN 80 FEET. NOW, I'M NOT AN ARCHITECT. DO YOU  HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT "A HECK OF A" REPRESENTS?
100 FEET IS PROABLY A "HECK OF A" LOT HIGHER THAN 80 FEET.
Stephen: "A HECK OF" A IS ONE-HALF AN ASSLOAD. ONE-HALF AN ASSLOAD EQUALS 20 FEET. OK, SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A 100-FOOT-TALL WALL. CHRISTINE, YOU'RE AN ENGINEER. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO CREATE A WALL 100 FEET HIGH?
IF IT'S 100 FEET HIGH, THEN YOUR POSTS WOULD ENTER THE EARTH ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THAT. AND THEN IN BETWEEN, YOU WOULD RIG UP PRE-CAST CONCRETE PANELS, WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE THE CHEAPEST.
Stephen: AND CONCRETE GUY. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH CONCRETE THAT IS.
YEAH, WE WOULD CALCULATE SOMETHING ABOUT, UH, 200 MILLION CUBIC YARDS OF CONCRETE.
Stephen: WHAT DOES A YARD OF CONCRETE COST?
WELL, THIS AREA? PROBABLY ABOUT $2,000.
Stephen: 200 MILLION TIMES $2,000 A YARD.
YOU'VE GOT $400 BILLION.
Stephen: $400 BILLION.
AND THAT'S ALL IN CONCRETE
NO, I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT, BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE CONCRETE, WE CAME UP IN A PRIOR EFFORT THE NUMBER OF APPROXIMATELY $985 BILLION TOTAL.
Stephen: NOW, WAIT A SECOND. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?
ALL THE LABOR INVOLVED, ALL THE OVERHEAD.
EXCAVATION.
PORTABLE CONCRETE PLANTS.
DEWATERING.
SWAMPS, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
YOU MIGHT HAVE A MOBILE FORGE.
WHEN A WALL STICKS UP OUT OF THE GROUND--
Stephen: HMMM. I DON'T THINK WE CAN SHOW THAT ON CBS, BY THE WAY.
IF A WALL STICKS UP OUT OF THE GROUND--
Stephen: AGAIN, I DON'T THINK-- I'LL PICTURE IT. SO WHAT'S YOUR NEW NUMBER?
ABOUT A TRILLION, CLOSE TO.
Stephen: CALL IT $1 TRILLION.
I HAD READ THAT LESS THAN HALF OF THE LENGTH OF THE BORDER IS ACTUALLY COVERED ON OUR SIDE WITH PARALLEL ROADS.
Stephen: PROBABLYICISM TO JUST BUILD A $2,000 HIGHWAY WHILE WE'RE DOING IT. ANY IDEA WHAT IT WOULD COST?
I WOULD SAY ABOUT THE SAME PRICE IT WOULD COST TO BUILD A WALL.
Stephen: OKAY, SO PLUS ANOTHER TRILLION, BECAUSE WHAT IS A HIGHWAY, IF NOT A WALL ON ITS SIDE? SO IF WE DO JUST ONE CREW OF 40 LABORERS, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD THE WALL?
742 YEARS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: LET'S TRY TO GET THAT NUMBER DOWN. WE GOTTA GET THAT DOWN.
IF WE GOTTA DO IT IN FOUR YEARS--
Stephen: WE GOT THREE YEARS AND 11 MONTHS, RIGHT? WE HAVE THREE YEARS AND 11 MONTHS OF THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
THAT WOULD BE 8,000 PEOPLE.
Stephen: HOW MANY WORKERS DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD THE HIGHWAY?
PROBABLY HALF OF THAT, 4,000.
Stephen: 4,000? LET'S MAKE THIS 12,000 WORKERS ALL TOGETHER.
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
Stephen: THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA RESULTED IN 400,000 DEATHS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON IT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE MAKING THIS?
YOU PROBABLY CAN KEEP IT DOWN TO MAYBE, LIKE, 100 A MONTH.
Stephen: 100 A MONTH IS THE MOST YOU'D WANT.
100 TIMES 12 TIMES-- HOW MANY YEARS?
Stephen: CALL IT FOUR YEARS, YEAH.
ABOUT 4,800
Stephen: 4,800 PEOPLE DIE. 4,800 PEOPLE DEAD. THAT'S MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE WORK FORCE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY HAS TO DIE. NOBODY IS GOING TO DIE.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, NOBODY WANTS ANYONE TO DIE. WE JUST HAVE TO BE REALISTIC HERE. LET'S BUMP THIS UP TO, LIKE, 20,000, JUST TO HAVE SOME SPARES.
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.
Stephen: PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA. DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THAT THIS WILL BE A BIG, BEAUTIFUL WALL, OKAY? ROBERT, WHAT IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE CONCRETE LOOK BEAUTIFUL?
ONE OF OUR DESIGN CONCEPTS WAS TO MAYBE TURN THIS UGLY WALL INTO AN OUTDOOR RECREATION PARK, AND WE THOUGHT A BIG ROCK- CLIMBING WALL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT ELSE MIGHT YOU DO WITH A 100-FOOT WALL?
Stephen: I LOVE THE IDEA OF A ROCK-CLIMBING WALL, EXCEPT IT'S ANTITHETICAL TO A WALL YOU CAN'T CLIMB TO MAKE IT INTO A CLIMBING WALL. SO THANK YOU, BUT LET'S MOVE ON.
SO, ONE OTHER IDEA COULD BE TO WALLPAPER THE WALL.
Stephen: I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
IT MIGHT BE PRETTY.
Stephen: I LOVE PRETTY
I DID A CALCULATION ON NUMBER OF ROLLS OF WALLPAPER AS WELL.
Stephen: PLEASE.
I CAME OUT WITH ABOUT 27 MILLION ROLLS FOR ONE SIDE.
Stephen: WE GOTTA DO BOTH SIDES HERE.
THAT'S ABOUT 54 MILLION ROLLS.
Stephen: 54 MILLION ROLLS
BUT I WOULD JUST SAY IF WE NEED TO DO SOME PATTERN MATCHING, FORGET IT. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO MATCH THE REPEAT OF THE WALLPAPER PATTERN SO THAT THE SEAMS MATCH UP. SO LET'S ADD ANOTHER 50% ON TO THAT JUST TO BE SAFE.
Stephen: 50% MORE PAPER? CALL IT 100 MILLION ROLLS. NOW THAT WE KNEW HOW MUCH THE WALL COSTS, WE HAD TO GET SOMEBODY TO PAY FOR IT.
HELLO, MEXICAN CONSOLATE. CAN I HELP YOU? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HI, IS THIS MEXICO?
YES, CAN I HELP YOU?
Stephen: HI, YES, THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT FROM "THE LATE SHOW" AT CBS. CAN I SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER, PLEASE?
NO, I'M SORRY. JUST GIVE ME YOUR MESSAGE, PLEASE.
Stephen: SURE. THE MESSAGE IS THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT FROM "THE LATE SHOW." WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH JUST SOME ROUGH NUMBERS. OBVIOUSLY, DON'T HOLD MY FEET TO THE FIRE OVER THIS, BUT WE HAVE A ROUGH NUMBER OF ABOUT $2 TRILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD THE BORDER WALL, AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD THAT IN PETTY CASH RIGHT NOW, OKAY?
OKAY...
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IF YOU COULD JUST TELL MEXICO, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) MAN, MEXICO IS GOING TO BE PISSED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH FELICITY HUFFMAN.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST WON AN EMMY AS A "DESPERATE HOUSEWIFE," AND CURRENTLY STARS IN THE NEW SEASON OF "AMERICAN CRIME."
SHE'S MY SISTER.
AND WE TRIED TO HELP HER ONCE.
HOW MANY TIMES DOES SHE HAVE TO SAY SHE'S SORRY.
IF YOU WANT-- IF YOU WANT, YOU KNOW, SEND HER A CHECK.
I WANT TO GET HER A JOB. I WANT TO GET HER A DECENT JOB.
YEAR, WELL IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ON THE FARM.
WELL, IF YOU TALK TO HER AND YOU JUST--
I'M NOT DOING THAT. YOUR SISTER STOLE MONEY. SHE STOLE MONEY FROM MY DAD AFTER HE GAVE HER WORK. SHE DID THAT TO HIM. SHE DID THAT TO YOU.
SHE WASN'T WELL. I MEAN, SHE HAD PROBLEMS. SHE--
PROBLEMS. I MEANT WHAT I SAID. IF YOU WANT TO WRITE HER A CHECK.
JUST GIVING HER MONEY ISN'T THE SAME AS HELPING HER.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME FELICITY HUFFMAN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. WE MET ONCE BRIEFLY BACKSTAGE AT THE EMMYS MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, AND, OF COURSE, I TALKED TO YOUR HUSBAND MANY TIMES. WILLIAM H. MACY.
YES, HE'S BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO TALK TO YOU BUT I HAVE NOT. HERE I AM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE MY FAVORITE CELEBRITY COUPLE NAME WHICH IS PHILLIP H. MUST HAVEMAN.
DIDN'T YOU DRAET IT?
Stephen: YES.
AND WE HAVE T-SHIRTS THAT SAY IT. EVERY NIGHT WE SLEEP IN THEM.
Stephen: AND WE MADE UP A MOVIE YOU GUYS DID TOGETHER. WELL, HERE YOU ARE, YOU GRIEZ GETTING MORE AND MORE ALIKE AS THE YEARS GO ON. HE'S GOT YOUR HAIR, AND YOU'RE BUYING THE SAME LEATHER JACKETS AT THIS POINT.
THAT'S TRUE. YOU KNOW HOW SOME PEOPLE LOOK LIKE YOUR DOG? WE LOOK LIKE EACH GLRG VERY NICE, VERY NICE. WHERE ARE YOU FROM ORIGINALLY?
I'M FROM COLORADO.
Stephen: REALLY, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD, VERY SPECIFIC ACCENT YOU'RE DOING IN THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO COUNTRY ACCENTS OVER-DIAL IT. THAT'S BEAUTIFULLY PLACED.
THAT'S KIND OF YOU. I TOOK A LONG TIME LEARNING THAT. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TEXAS, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO MISSISSIPPI AND I SHOWED UP AT THE FIRST READ-THROUGH AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH AN ACCENT. AND JOHN RIDLEY WAS LIKE, "YOU HAVE TO BRING IT WAY DOWN." I WAS THAT (BLEEP) HUE ACHIEVER KIND OF PERSON.
Stephen: WELL, YOU LIKE THOSE PEOPLE'S WORK.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: WELL, ONE THING IS THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND, AS--
ENOUGH WITH THE PHOTO!
Stephen: ONE MORE. IS THAT YOU GUYS SORT OF EMBODY, AS ONE OF MY PRODUCERS SAID THE HASHTAG RELATIONSHIP GOALS. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU-- HE ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES AND YOU SAID NO.
I-- I DID. I THINK I SAID-- I FINALLY SAID YES THE THIRD TIME. AND IT WAS MANY YEARS. BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS --
Stephen: WHY DID YOU DO THAT? HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE FELLA.
OH, HE'S THE BEST FELLA. BECAUSE, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I THINK WOMEN SORT OF DISAPPEAR IN MARRIAGE. FOR SOME REASON MEN'S STOCK GOES UP, AND I THINK WOMEN TEND TO DISAPPEAR.
Stephen: OKAY, WELL, I DON'T THINK YOUR STOG HAS GONE DONE. I'M VERY BULLISH ON FELICITY HUFFMAN.
YOU ARE, OKAY. I THINK IT WAS A FEAR I HAD AND MAYBE I DIDN'T REALIZE IT.
Stephen: HOW DID HE TAKE IT?
HE TOOK IT-- HE TOOK IT-- HE SORT OF TOOK IT. HIS FEELINGS GOT HURT AND THEN HE GOT DETERMINED.
Stephen: WOW.
I MEAN, FINALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS, I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO-- I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE OUT THE DOOR AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE THIS GUY. AND I SAID YES. AND HE SAID, "GREAT." AND I SAID, YES, BUT WE CAN'T TELL PEOPLE." AND HE SAID, "NO, THAT'S NOT OKAY. WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE." AND I SAID, OKAY, YES, WE CAN TELL PEOPLE BUCIALGHT I DON'T WANT TO WEAR A RING." AND HE SAID, "NO, THAT'S NOT OKAY. WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE TO WEAR A RING." FINALLY IT WAS, "HERE'S THE DRESS, HERE'S THE DATE, JUST SHOW UP."
Jon: THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO PLAN IT. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST OF A BIG FAMILY AS AM I.
YES, I'M THE YOUNGEST OF EIGHT. I KNOW YOU HAVE ME BEAT. YOU HAVE 15 OR SOMETHING?
Stephen: 11, 11.
THERE'S A GUY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO IS ONE OF NINE OUT THERE.
CATHOLIC?
Audience: YES.
YES. HE WAS GOING TO BE CATHOLIC OR MORMON.
Stephen: SURE. WHERE DO YOU FALL?
I'M THE YOUNGEST.
Stephen: OH, BABY!
I KNOW!
Stephen: BABY OF 11.
DO YOUR SIBLINGS HATE YOU?
Stephen: YES!
YOU GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.
MY MOM WAS SO TIRED. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU'RE GOING TO YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE? JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE THERE SAFE. I MEAN, I WAS AT MY BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE WHEN I WAS 13.
Stephen: WOW. MY MOM WASN'T THAT LAX. BUT I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A FREE-RANGE CHICKEN. "YOU'RE FINE. GO TO BED. ARE YOU STILL UP? STAY UP. I LIKE YOUR COMPANY."
WHAT ABOUT THE CLOTHES? YOU'RE ALWAYS SCRAMBLING THROUGH SOMEBODYALCY'S DRAWERS FOR CLOTHES AND YOU NEVER HAVE SOCKS THAT MATCH.
Stephen: SOMEBODYALCY BLAZER. HOW MANY BOYS, HOW MANY GIRLS?
WE HAD SEVEN GIRLS AND ONE BOY.
Stephen: WOW!
AND ONE-- ONE BATHROOM.
Stephen: OH, MY-- DID HE EVER GET INTO THE BATHROOM? ( LAUGHTER ).
I DON'T EVER REMEMBER MY BROTHER BEING IN THE BATHROOM. ( LAUGHTER ) I WONDER WHAT HE DID. YEAH, WE WOULD ALL-- BUT, YOU KNOW, SUNSHINE IT'S SEVEN GIRLS, ALL GIRLS HANG OUT IN BATH ROOMS TOGETHER SO THAT REALLY WASN'T AN ISSUE. WE'D ALL, YOU KNOW, SILT ON THE COUNTERS AND SMOKE CIGARETTES CI AND BLOW THEM OUT THE WINDOW AND SOMEBODY'S TAKING A EXPHOWR SMAEN DOING THEIR MAKEUP AND EVERYONE'S TALKING. I LOVED IT.
Stephen: CAN YOU SAY THEM FAST.
YES, I BET YOU CAN, TOO.
Stephen: I'LL DO 11 WHILE YOU DO EIGHT. FROM THE TOP DOWN OR HOW YOU WANT TO DO IT.
SHOW OFF. I'M DOING IT FROM THE TOP TOWN. ONE, TWO THREE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU BEAT ME. YOU BEAT ME. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I WISH I HAD SOMETHING FOR YOU. I'VE GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF YOU--
DID YOUR MOM CALL YOU EVERY NAME BUT YOUR OWN?
Stephen: SLIEWCIALGTHS ABSOLUTELY.
EVEN THE DOG'S NAME.
Stephen: WE DIDN'T HAVE A DOG. WE DIDN'T HAVE A DOG. MY MOM SAID, "NO DOGS UNTIL MORE PEOPLE MOVE OUT AND GET MARRIED." WE DIDN'T GO TO CAMP BECAUSE WE LIVED AT CAMP, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT WAS LIKE. AND NO DOGS EQUAL "YOU PEOPLE ALL CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES."
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE WHICH I SAW YOU WHEN YOU DID THAT TROIBT YOUR MOM AND THAT REALLY WAS WONDERFUL. I WATCHED IT A LOT OF TIMES AND I THINK EVERYBODY FOR MOTHER'S DAY SHOULD WATCH IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. I WAS VERY LUCKY.  ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, YOU HAVE-- SPEAK OF MOMS, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PARENTING SITE. EXPLAIN THIS NAME FOR ME. IT'S "WHAT THE FLICKA?" WHAT IS "WHAT THE FLICKA?"
MY NICKNAME IS FLICKA. BEING THE EIGHTH KID MY MOM RAN OUT OF FAMILY CATHOLIC NAMES, SO MY SISTERS WERE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONVENT WITH THIS WOMAN NAMED FLAKE SO SHE NAMED ME FLICKA. AND THE LOCAL PRIEST SAID IT'S NOT CATHOLIC. I THINK SHE GOT DEBUNKED. SO IT'S ST. FELIFT. WHAT THE FLICKA IS A SITE I CREATE WHEN I HAD STARTED HAVING KIDS BECAUSE I FOUND IS SO ALIENATING AND DIFFICULT AND HORRIBLE DISPPT ONLY CONVERSATION OUT THERE WAS LIKE, "ISN'T IT THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER DONE?" AND I KEPT GOING, "NO!"
Stephen: YOUR CHILDREN AREN'T WATCHING TONIGHT ARE, THEY?
NO.
Stephen: YOU'RE IN THE THIRD SEASON NOW OF "AMERICAN CRIME." AND THIS IS SORT OF SET UP IN AN INTERESTING WAY. IT'S AN ENSEMBLE EXPERVEG YEAR, YOU ALL PLAY DIFFERENT PARTS IN THE STORY. IT'S NOT BASED ON AN INDIVIDUAL CRIME BUT THE IDEA OF-- IT'S NOT RECREATING A CRIME.
NO.
Stephen: BUT IT'S-- IT DEALS WITH A ONE-CRIME ISSUE. WHAT IS IT THIS YEAR?
THIS YEAR, ODDLY ENOUGH, IN SEASON ONE AND TWO, IT WAS A CRIME THAT WAS THE INCITING INCIDENT, AND THE STORY FOLLOWED FROM THERE. AND THIS IS SORT OF THE FABRIC OF MANY DIFFERENT CRIMES. I THINK IT'S ILLEGAL IMGRAICIALGZ FORCED LABOR, SEX TRAFFICKING. IT'S A COMEDY. ( LAUGHTER ) THOSE ARE THE ISSUES.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST CRIME IN AMERICA IS RIGHT NOW?
GOSH, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SO MANY. BUT I THINK IT'S THAT WE'VE STOPPED-- THERE'S NO DIALOGUE. WE'VE STOPPED TALKING TO EACH OTHER. I THINK EVERYONE'S STUCK IN THEIR OWN-- AND I AM, TOO-- THEIR OWN IDEOLOGY AND WHAT'S WRONG AND WHAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IT MAKES IT HARD TO FIX THINGS, I SUPPOSE. FLES TEE, IT WAS VERY NICE TO MEET YOU
Stephen: THE NEW SEASON OF "AMERICAN CRIME" PREMIERES THIS SUNDAY ON ABC. FELICITY HUFFMAN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JURNEE SMOLLETT-BELL. STICK AROUND.

WELL, YOU HAVE TO SIT PRETTY, AS I'M TRYING TO DO RIGHT NOW IN THIS DRESS.
Stephen: DID YOU GET A LIFETIME SUPPLY OR SOMETHING JEW KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I WISH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKED INTO MY DEAL, BECAUSE NOW I'M A MOM. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN, LIKE, VERY HELPFUL FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. HOW OLD IS YOUR CHILD?
HE'S FOUR MONTHS OLD.
Stephen: FOUR MONTHS OLD! WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE, CONGRATULATIONS ON NOT SEEMING EXHAUSTED.
YOU KNOW, I'M AN ACTRESS. WE KNOW HOW TO LIE.
Stephen: YEAH. BECAUSE WE JUST HAD FELICITY HUFFMAN OUT HERE AND SHE SAYS SADE IT'S HORRIBLE.
DUDE! LITERALLY, WE'VE BEEN PROMOTING SEASON TWO OF "UNDERGROUND," AND MY SON SOUNDS DISOOIDZ NOW HE'S GOING TO STAY UP THROUGH THE NIGHT ON THE PROMO TOUR.
Stephen: THEY WERE SMALL BUT RELENTLESS OPPONENTS?
OH, MY GOSH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
Stephen: WHAT'S HIS NAME.
HUNTER ZION BELL.
Stephen: NO "J"?
DONE WITH IT. I WAS LIKE ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Stephen: YOU'RE BREAKING THE CHAIN?
LISTEN, THE CYCLE HAS TO STOP, PEOPLE!
Stephen: NOW, ON "UNDERGROUND," YOU PLAY A CHARACTER NAMED ROSALEE.
YES.
Stephen: WHO IS-- UNDERGROUND REFERS TO THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD IN THE SHOW. WHO IS ROSALEE.
ROSALEE IN SEASON ONE WAS A YOUNG HOUSE SERVANT WHO WORKED, IN THE HOUSE AND, YOU KNOW, HER FATHER WAS THE PLANTER, WAS A PLANTATION OWNER. DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE, OBVIOUSLY, THAT HE WAS. AND IN SEASON ONE, WE SEE ROSALEE ESCAPES THE PLANTATION AFTER HAVING NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE IN HER LIFE.
Stephen: WHERE IS THE PLANTATION?
MACON, GEORGIA. SHE RUNS 600 MILES TO FREEDOM, WITH THE MACON SEVEN, HER COMRADES. SHE MAKES IT TO THE NORTH AT THE END OF THE SEASON ONE, AND MEETS UP WITH HARRIET TUBMAN, WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING BACK. AND IN SEASON TWO, WHICH PREMIERED THIS PAST WEDNESDAY, WE SEE ME FIVE OR SIX-- YEAH, YOU CAN CLAP. WE HAY GOOD PREMIERE.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CLIP?
SO, IN THIS CLIP, FIVE MONTHS HAVE PASSED. I'VE BEEN TRAINED UP BY HARRIET TUBMAN TO LEARN HOW TO TRANSFER CARG OH, WHICH ARE HUMAN BEINGS, TO FREEDOM. AND IN THIS CLIB CLIP, I'M TRYING TO GET THIS GIE GOOI WHO'S INJURED TO GET UP OFF OF HIS FEET. >FEET.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, JIM.
MOVE! THROUGH THE TREES! GO, GO, GO! COME ON NOW! COME ON! WE'RE ALMOST THERE! COME ON.
I CAN'T.
YES, YOU CAN! NOW, LISTEN TO ME. YOU GOT TWO CHOICES. YOU GOT LIFE. YOU GOT DEATH. YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS RIGHT NOW. THAT ANIMAL, THAT ANIMAL INSIDE OF YOU, THAT FEAR, IT BE POWERFUL. IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR EYES BLINK WIDER, MAKE YOUR HEART BEAT FASTER. YOU HAVE TO TIEWZ RIGHT NOW. IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. ( GASPING ) RUN!
Stephen: WOW. WHAT ARE YOU-- ( APPLAUSE )
I DO-?
Stephen: THAT LOOKS LIKE A SCENE FROM "PULP FICTION." WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM THERE?
I'M GIVING HIM A SHOT OF ADRENALINE.
Stephen: WHAT? THEY HAD ADRENALINE BACK THEN?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, MY CHARACTER IN THE DAYTIME, I WORK AT A HOSPITAL UNDER AN ALIAS, SO I'M CONSTANTLY, LIKE, STEALING MEDICINE.
Stephen: WOW.
SO, YOU KNOW, I-- I'M GIVING HIM THIS BECAUSE HE'S BEEN INJURED AND WE GOTTA-- WE GOTTA KEEP THE MISSION GOING.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU RESEARCH-- HOW DO YOU PRIEP TO PLAY A ROLE IN A STORY SO INTENSE?
YOU KNOW, IT REQUIRES A LOT OF RESEARCH IN ORDER FOR YOU TO SATURATE YOURSELF INTO THIS WORLD. I WAS READING A LOT OF BOOKS, A LOT OF SLAVE NARRATIVES LIKE "THE BULLWHIP DAYS" READING A FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A SLAVE, AND IT BROUGHT A LEVEL OF TRUTH TO ME. THERE'S ONE STORY THAT REALLY BLEW ME AWAY IS THE STORY OF ELLEN AND WILLIAM KRAFT. SHE WAS AN ENCLAVED WOMAN, FAIR SKINNED, MARRIED TO WILLIAM KRAFT, WHO WAS DAERK SKINNED. THEY ESCAPED ON A TRAIN BY HER PRETENDING LIKE SHE WAS A WHITE MAN.
Stephen: WHAT?
YES.
Stephen: LIKE SHE PUT HER HAIR UP IN A HAT?
SHE CUT HER HAIR OFF. HE DISGUISE-- SHE DRESSED AS A MAN AND DECIDES HER AS A WHITE MAN AND HER HUSBAND WAS DISGUISED AS HER MANSERVANT. AND THEY GOT ON THE TRAIN AND RODE TO FREEDOM ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WOW.
THESE MEN AND WOMEN WERE GENIUS. YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY WERE GENIUS. AND THEY USED THEIR INSTINCTS. THEY USED WITS. THEY WERE SO BRILLIANT. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD THESE CHAINS BINDING THEM, THEY REALLY USED THEIR HUMAN WILL TO GET THEIR FREEDOM.
Stephen: THEY SCREENED THIS THE FIRST SEASON AT THE WHITE HOUSE, I UNDERSTAND.
LAST SEASON.
Stephen: LAST SEASON AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
LAST SANE.
Stephen: LAST SEASON AT THE WHITE HOUSE. ANY CHANCE YOU'RE GOING TO SCREEN THIS TAKEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE?
YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN INVITATION!
Stephen: GOOD LUCK, GOOD LUCK.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YOU.
Stephen:  NEVER KNOW, YOU NEVER KNOW. "UNDERGROUND" AIRS WEDNESDAY NIGHTS ON WGN AMERICA. JURNEE SMOLLETT-BELL, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH COMEDIAN ANTHONY DeVITO. STICK AROUND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS A NEW YORK COMEDIAN MAKING HIS NETWORK TELEVISION DEBUT. PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY DEVITO. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
SO, THIS IS WHAT I LOOK LIKE. ( LAUGHTER ) ETHNICALLY AMBIGUOUS. WHICH MEANS I'M WHITE, BUT I GET TO THE AIRPORT PRETTY EARLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY. 8:30 FLIGHT-- I'M THERE AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING. I DO THINK RACISM WILL DIE OUT EVENTUALLY, JUST BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S HAVING SEX WITH EVERYBODY. SO-- YEAH, MORE AND MORE RACES ARE MIXING. IN 100 YEARS, RACISTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SO SPECIFIC. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE LIKE THESE (BLEEP) MEXICAN, HALF JEW, QUARTER KOREANS ARE RUINING THIS COUNTRY, THEIR TACO THINK ABOUT LAUNDROMATS. IT'S NOT RIGHT. ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY. COOL. I ALSO DON'T GET HOMOPHOBIA. ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS I EVER HEARD, TOLD TO ME BY A BLACK, FLAMBOYANT, OVER-THE-TOP GAY COWORKER. WE WERE JUST TALKING, I WAS MAKING CONVERSATION. I WAS LIKE, "IT'S COLD IN HERE." HE WAS LIKE COLD? IT'S CHILI WILLY PENGUIN BONES. HOW ARE YOU NOT A WEATHERMAN? YOU DESCRIBE THE ROOM TEMPERATUREAISE GREAT IDEA FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK? WOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I KIND OF JUST HAVE TO BE WITH WHOEVER. I JUST KEEP GETTING HAIRIER. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW AT WHAT POINT YOU'RE LEGALLY A CAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHOA, OKAY. AND NONE OF THE HAIR IS DISTRIBUTED EVENLY ON MY BODY. IF YOU'RE A GIRL AND YOU LOOK AT MY FACE, AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, IF THAT'S A PREVIEW OF WHAT LIES BENEATH, NO THANK YOU." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHEN I TAKE OFF MY SHIRT, MY CHEST ISN'T THAT BAD. BUT THEN I TAKE OFF MY PANTS, AND I AM STILL WEARING PANTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHERE IT'S ALL KEPT. IT'S LIKE A CENTOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) A FRIEND OF MINE WAS TALK TO ME ABOUT SEX. AND HE WAS LIKE, "HOW MANY GIRLS HAVE YOU EVER SLEPT WITH? WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?" AND MY NUMBER WAS SO LOW, HE SAID, "HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE EVER SEEN YOUR PENIS?" I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT, BUT THAT'S A WAY MORE INTERESTING GROUP. YOU PUT MY MOM..., DR. MICHAEL SCOPETULLO. SOME RANDOM GAP EMPLOYEE. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL IN THE SAME ROOM, THAT'S ALL THEY'D HAVE IN COMMON. THAT'S HOW I'M ORGANIZING ONE TABLE AT MY WEDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) OH! JUST ONE. WATCH THEM FIGURE IT OUT OVER TIME. COLLEGE ROOMMATE, SOME GUY THAT WORKS IN MY GYM. MY AUNT'S DOG. JUST BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING, THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIKE, "HOW DO WE ALL KNOW ANTHONY?" BUT THEN TWO HOURS INTO IT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIKE,"HAVE WE ALL SEEN IT? THAT EXPLAINS THE AFGHAN HOUND." ( LAUGHTER ) MY GRANDMA IS ACTUALLY GETTING MARRIED. 90 YEARS OLD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. HER BOYFRIEND IS 62. YEAH, RIGHT? NOT EVEN A COUGAR. THAT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. IT'S LEAK A WATER BUFFALO. SHE'S 90, HE'S 62. SHE'S ALSO DEAF. HE'S BLIND. HE HAS ONE LEG. IT'S AN INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIP. AND THEY MET IN A NURSING HOME. AI YEAH, WELL, ALL RIGHT, WELL.  ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, I NEVER FELT MORE PRESSURE TO WRITE A JOKE. IT'S A LOT OF THINGS. THE FIRST TIME WE EVER MET HIM, I WAS TALKING TO MY MOM ABOUT IT. I WAS LIKE, ISN'T THAT CRAZY?" MY MOM'S LIKE, "I KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S MARRYING A BLACK GUY." I WAS LIKE, "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE PART YOU CAN'T BELIEVE." "WE JUST MET A DUQUESNE PIRATE." YOU'RE HUNG UP ON THAT. HOLY HELL. MY GIRLFRIEND IS ACTUALLY EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME. I'M 34, BUT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DATING, I WAS 30. SHE WAS 22. I KNEW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO. EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE'D ACT HER AGE. WHEN SHE DID, I LET IT SLIDE. BUT FRIENDS OF MINE WOULD GET SO MAD. THEY'D BE LIKE, "YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LET HER BEHAVE LIKE THAT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY SOMETHING." I WOULD BE LIKE, "DON'T TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY GIRLFRIEND. DON'T YOU DARE." ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
