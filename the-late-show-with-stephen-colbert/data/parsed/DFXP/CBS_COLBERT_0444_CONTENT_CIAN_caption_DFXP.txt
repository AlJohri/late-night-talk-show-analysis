PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FLYING HOME FROM ASIA THIS MORNING AFTER A 12-DAY TRIP. THE PRESIDENT TWEETED FROM MANILA LAST NIGHT "WHITED TO BE HEADING HOME." ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪  (  LAUGHTER  ) ♪ ♪ ♪  (  LAUGHTER  )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TRUMP'S TWITTER TEAR. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES JORDAN PEELE ALIA SHAWKAT AND COMEDIAN PAUL MECURIO. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY! HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU, JOE! THANK YOU, LOUIS. THANK YOU, MATTY. WHAT'S GOING ON? PLEADS, HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, FOLKS, DONALD TRUMP IS BACK IN THE U.S.A., AND HE WENT ON TV TODAY TO BRAG ABOUT HOW GREAT HIS ASIA TRIP WAS. AND IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T JUST ATTENTION HE WAS THIRSTY FOR.
JAPANESE COMPANIES HAVE ANNOUNCED INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES WORTH MORE THAN $8 BILLION, 17,000 JOBS. THEY DON'T HAVE WATER? THAT'S OKAY.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHAT? THAT'S OKAY. OH.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: WOW. THAT IS HARD TO WATCH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) YOU KNOW THAT, AFTER WATCHING THAT, I NEED A DRINK. WHERE IS THE-- WHERE IS THE-- THEY DON'T HAVE IT. THEY DON'T HAVE IT. THAT'S-- THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S GOOD. WHAT THAT? OKAY, THEY GOT THAT. THEY GOT THIS.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT FAIR, OKAY. EVERYBODY GETS DRY MOUTH. I CAN'T STAND HERE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND MAKE FUN OF A POLITICIAN FOR DRINKING WATER. THAT IS CHILDISH, AND TRUMP ALREADY DID IT WAY BETTER WITH RUBIO.
HE'S LIKE THIS: "AND WE WILL-- HUH, HUH-- I NEED WATER! HELP ME! I NEED WATER! HELP! AND HE'S-- THIS IS ON LIVE TELEVISION! THIS TOTAL CHOKE ARTIST!  (  LAUGHTER  ) UNBELIEVABLE!"
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE! THAT YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNBELIEVABLE! AFTER 12 DAYS IN ASIA, HE'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND HARD AT WORK WATCHING TV AND TWEETING ABOUT IT. "DOT @FOXANDFRIENDS WILL BE SHOWING MUCH OF OUR SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO ASIA, AND THE FRIENDSHIPS AND BENEFITS THAT WILL ENDURE FOR YEARS TO COME!" OH, FRIENDSHIPS AND BENEFITS?  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT MEETING WITH PUTIN DID GO WELL. AND WHILE TRUMP LOVES PROMOTING FOX NEWS, HE GAVE EQUAL TIME TO OTHER NETWORKS. "WHILE IN THE PHILIPPINES, I WAS FORCED TO WATCH @CNN, WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE IN MONTHS, AND AGAIN REALIZED HOW BAD AND FAKE IT IS. LOSER!" OH, BABY, HE'S BACK, AND HE'S PLAYING THE HITS. DO-- DO-- DO "MUSLIM BAN." DO "BUILD THE WALL!" DO "LOCK HER UP!" "LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!" I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT BACK IN MY POCKET NOW. AND TRUMP DIDN'T ATTACK JUST TV. "THE FAILING @NYTIMES HATES THE FACT THAT I HAVE DEVELOPED A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH WORLD LEADERS LIKE XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA, DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT." HEY, THE DOTS ARE BACK! I MISSED YOU LITTLE GUYS! YOU'RE THE ONLY PART OF TRUMP'S TWEETS THAT AREN'T LIES.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH, WOW! DOT, DOT. HE CONTINUED, "DOT, DOT, DOT, THEY SHOULD REALIZE THAT THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE A GOOD THING, NOT A BAD THING. THE U.S. IS BEING RESPECTED AGAIN. WATCH TRADE!" "WATCH TRADE! HEAR COMMERCE! SMELL BUSINESS!" BUT TRUMP DID ACCOMPLISH ONE THING WHILE HE WAS IN ASIA. SEE, WHILE THEY WERE ON TOUR IN CHINA, THREE PLAYERS ON THE U.C.L.A. MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM WERE ARRESTED FOR STEALING SUNGLASSES FROM A LOUIS VUITTON STORE. OH, COME ON-- YOU DON'T STEAL LOUIS VUITTON. YOU JUST BUY A KNOCKOFF. I'M PRETTY SURE CHINA HAS A CHINATOWN. SOMEBODY DOWNTOWN BEIJING WHERE ALL THE CHINESE PEOPLE LIVE. WHEREVER THE CHINESE PEOPLE LIVE OVER THERE, YOU'LL FIND IT. DURING HIS VISIT, TRUMP TALKED TO XI, AND YESTERDAY WE LEARNED THAT THE U.C.L.A. BASKETBALL PLAYERS WERE RELEASED AND FLEW HOME FROM CHINA. SO, JOB WELL DONE. YOU GOTTA GIVE IT TO HIM. THEN THE PRESIDENT MOVED ON TO MORE PRESSING MATTERS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, LIKE DE-ESCALATING THE NUCLEAR STANDOFF WITH NORTH KOREA. I'M JUST KIDDING.  (  LAUGHTER  ) HE TWEETED, "DO YOU THINK THE THREE U.C.L.A. BASKETBALL PLAYERS WILL SAY 'THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP'? THEY WERE HEADED FOR TEN YEARS IN JAIL!" YES, WHERE IS THE GRATITUDE? IT REMINDS ME OF LINCOLN IN THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WHEN HE SAID, "THE SLAVES ARE NOW FREE. YOU'RE WELCOME! WOULD IT KILL YOU TO SEND AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT?"  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) COME ON.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: HERE'S SOMETHING, SPEAKING OF POLITICS. THERE'S AN UPDATE TO THE STORY OF ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE AND GUY WHO JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK THIS LONG TO GET CAUGHT, ROY MOORE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW OR BLOCKED IT OUT OR BLACKED OUT, ROY MOORE WAS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WITH A MINOR, ONE WHO SAID HE ASSAULTED HER WHEN SHE WAS JUST 14. MANY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE DENOUNCED MOORE, BUT MANY STAND BY THEIR MAN. LIKE ALABAMA CONGRESSMAN AND MAN WHO COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED IN A LINEUP OF ONE, MO BROOKS. BROOKS WAS ASKED BY A REPORTER YESTERDAY IF HE BELIEVED ROY MOORE'S ACCUSERS, AND BROOKS LOOKED THAT REPORTER IN THE EYE AND THEN RAN AWAY.
DO YOU BELIEVE ROY MOORE OVER THE WOMEN?
I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS WILL DO GREAT DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY.
SO YOU STILL BELIEVE ROY MOORE?
I BELIEVE DEMOCRATS WILL DO GREAT HARM TO OUR COUNTRY ON A MYRIAD OF ISSUES.
Stephen: RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL? I THINK WE'VE GOT A NEW REPUBLICAN METAPHOR.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT MO BROOKS ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO BELIEVES IN ROY MOORE, AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE PULLING A FEW DIRTY TRICKS, INCLUDING A CURIOUS NEW ROBOCALL SEEKING DAMAGING INFORMATION ON MOORE. NOW, THE ROBOCALL ISN'T ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR DIRT ON MOORE. IT IS A FAKE MESSAGE DESIGNED TO DISCREDIT "THE WASHINGTON POST," WHO BROKE THE STORY, AND MAKE THE LISTENER THINK THE ACCUSATIONS ARE JUST PART OF A CONSPIRACY, BECAUSE THE RECORDING IS-- WELL, LET'S SAY IT'S NOT PRO-SEMITIC. TAKE A LISTEN.
Stephen: COME ON! A JEWISH JOURNALIST PART OF A MEDIA CONSPIRACY. THE ONLY WORSE STEREOTYPE WOULD BE A FAMILY VALUES SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL WHO TURNS OUT TO BE A SECRET PERV.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, "THE WASHINGTON POST" RELEASED A STATEMENT TODAY-- RELEASED A STATEMENT TODAY, RESPONDING TO THIS CALL,IZATION:
YOU'RE SHOCKED? YOU KNOW IT'S 2017, RIGHT? ANTI-SEMITIC ROBOCALLS ARE PRETTY MUCH PAR FOR THE COURSE. AND THIS IS THE COURSE. BY THE WAY, "ANTI-SEMITIC ROBOCALL" WAS THE WORST "ROBOCOP" SEQUEL. AND I'M BEING TOLD WE'VE OBTAINED A RECORDING OF A SECOND ALABAMA ROBOCALL THAT REALLY UPS THE ANTE.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JORDAN PEELE IS HERE. BUT, WHEN WE RETURN, "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE'S GOT A NEW SEXIEST MAN ALIVE, AND I'VE GOT SOME ISSUES WITH IT. STICK AROUND!  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE! MAKING IT HAPPEN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, MY GOODNESS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW, I TRY TO KEEP UP ON THE NEWS. AND, YOU KNOW, I LOOK AT THE WEBSITES. I READ THE NEWSPAPERS. I WATCH THE TV. AND, OBVIOUSLY, I READ "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE. AND LAST NIGHT, "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE DEBUTED THEIR "SEXIEST MAN ALIVE," AND IT'S BLAKE SHELTON! WHAT? WHAT? WHAT! REALLY? DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT? ABOUT I MISS SOMETHING? IS MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY DEAD? HE CAN REPEAT. IT'S BEEN SINCE 2005 SINCE MATTHEW WAS ON THE COVER. THERE'S YOUR SCANDAL RIGHT NOW. SOMEBODY PLEASE CHECK ON HIM. I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE'S OKAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. NO OFFENSE TO BLAKE. HE'S A SOLID SEVEN, NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF THERE. BUT SEXIEST MAN ALIVE? MORE LIKE THE SEXIEST MAN AT THE HOME DEPOT. AND THAT'S IF IT'S NOT A SATURDAY. OKAY. AND SEXY MEN, WE SEXY MEN-- IF I MAY.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I THINK-- IT'S MY SHOW. I THINK I MAY.
Jon: YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT! SEXY MEN HAVE SUCH A DEEP BENCH RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T NEED TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE GUY FROM "THE VOICE" WHO'S NOT ADAM LEVINE. WE'VE GOT IDRIS ELBA. WE'VE GOT LIAM NEESON. LIAM IS, LIKE, 90 NOW. HELL, IF YOU'RE THREE APPLETINIS IN AND HE PROMISES NOT TO TALK ABOUT AYN RAND, WE'VE EVEN GOT PAUL RYAN, FOR PETE'S SAKE. OH, LISTEN, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ALONE WITH HIM. LISTEN, I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED A LOT IN THE PAST YEAR: UP IS DOWN, DOWN IS UP. THERE'S CANDY-CORN-FLAVORED OREOS. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THERE ARE NO STANDARDS ANYMORE, BUT SEXY IS STILL SEXY, DAMMIT! NOW, LISTEN, BLAKE, I LIKE YOU. ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE A JUDGE ON THAT SINGING SHOW-- NOT THE FIRST ONE, THE OTHER ONE. BUT I'M TAKING A STAND. A LINE IN THE SAND RIGHT NOW. I DO NOT RECOGNIZE BLAKE SHELTON AS OUR CROWNED SEXINESS KING. HE MAY HAVE WON THE SEXINESS ELECTORAL COLLEGE, BUT NOT THE SEXY POPULAR VOTE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? ♪ WE TALKING ABOUT THE POPULAR VOTE ♪
Stephen: NO! THIS IS IMPORTANTMENT?  I HAVE TO TAKE A STAND. THEY'RE OVER THERE! THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO CUT THIS OUT OF THE SHOW TONIGHT! I WALK! SO, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, WE NOW LIVE IN A LEADERLESS SEXY REPUBLIC. IT'S COMPLETE SEXY ANARCHY-- WHICH ACTUALLY SOUNDS PRETTY HOT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IS IT I'M SORRY-- LISTEN, I KNOW I'M GOING TO UPSET SOME PEOPLE WITH THIS, AND I DON'T WANT TO UPSET ANYBODY, AND I HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE HERE. BUT FOR MALE SEXINESS, THERE IS NO GREATER HONOR THAN "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE'S "SEXIEST MAN ALIVE," EXCEPT MAYBE FOR "GQ'S "MAN OF THE YEAR."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT! WHAT IS THIS? WAIT! WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHO ASKED THE PROPS DEPARTMENT TO PUT THIS OUT HERE. AND I'M BEING TOLD THAT I DID. WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE ME "BAD HOMBRE OF THE YEAR" RIGHT THERE. SEE THAT. "BAD HOMBRE OF THE YEAR." THERE IT IS. MORE ON THAT LATER. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A LONG-- OVER HERE? WHERE ARE AM I TALKING? OVER HERE? IT'S BEEN A LONG, SEXY YEAR SINCE TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, AND IN THAT TIME, HE'S NOT DONE A LOT. HE'S FAILED TO PASS A HEALTH CARE PLAN. HE'S FAILED TO BUILD A WALL. BUT ONE THING TRUMP HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD AT IS APPOINTING JUDGES. SO FAR, HE'S PLACED 13 JUDGES, WITH ANOTHER 46 AWAITING CONFIRMATION, WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY AS OBAMA HAD AT THIS POINT IN HIS PRESIDENCY. MAKES SENSE THAT TRUMP WOULD APPOINT AS MANY JUDGES AS HE CAN. ODDS ARE, HE'S GOING TO APPEAR BEFORE ONE OF THEM SOONER OR LATER.  (  LAUGHTER  ) SO, WHO EXACTLY--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ WHO EXACTLY ARE TRUMP'S JUDICIAL NOMINEES? WELL, THEY'RE NOT JUST WHITE MEN, OKAY. SOME OF THEM HAPPEN TO BE WHITE MEN WHO ARE UNQUALIFIED AND INSANE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) I'D LIKE TO PROFILE ONE OF THEM IN MY NEW SEGMENT: "STEPHEN COLBERT'S BENCH WARMERS." TONIGHT'S BENCH WARMER: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ADVISOR AND ESCAPEE FROM THE DAY ROOM, BRETT TALLEY. TRUMP JUST APPOINTED TALLEY TO SERVE AS A DISTRICT JUDGE IN ALABAMA. NOW, HE'S NOT THE MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE TO BE A FEDERAL JUDGE, SEEING AS HOW HE HAS PRACTICED LAW FOR LESS THAN THREE YEARS AND HAS NEVER TRIED A CASE, WHICH IS PERFECT:  YOU DON'T WANT SOME UPTIGHT JUDGE WHO'S PREJUDICED BY ALL HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE COURTROOM. JUST LIKE GETTING SOME KNOW-IT-ALL SURGEON WHO CAN NAME EVERY ORGAN. BIG DEAL. BUT WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY? WELL, WHEN CONSIDERING HIS NOMINATION, THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION GAVE TALLEY A RARE "NOT QUALIFIED" RATING. JOKE'S ON YOU, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION! IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, "NOT QUALIFIED" IS THE NEW BLACK.  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT TALLEY'S NOMINATION IS NOW GETTING A LOT OF SCRUTINY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT "HE IS MARRIED TO A WHITE HOUSE LAWYER," A FACT TALLEY "DIDN'T DISCLOSE IN HIS QUESTIONNAIRES SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE." SO TALLEY IS STILL WAITING TO BE CONFIRMED, WHICH GIVES HIM TIME TO FOCUS ON HIS OTHER JOB. HORROR NOVELISTS. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF: GUH, IT'S ALIVE! AND THERE'S MORE, BECAUSE TALLEY IS ALSO A GHOST HUNTER. ACCORDING TO A RECENT PROFILE OF TALLEY, HE AND HIS FELLOW GHOST ENTHUSIASTS WOULD EXPLORE OLD PLANTATION HOMES OR ABANDONED INSANE ASYLUMS TO SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF THE SUPERNATURAL. OH, GOOD. MAYBE HE CAN EXPLAIN THAT SPINNING SOUND COMING FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S GRAVE. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR "STEPHEN COLBERT'S BENCH WARMERS." JOIN ME NEXT TIME WHEN WE PROFILE TRUMP'S NEXT JUDICIAL NOMINEE: CARL, THE OWNER OF A PAINTBALL COURSE WHERE HELMETS ARE OPTIONAL. FOR THE RECORD, CARL HAS LOTS OF COURTROOM EXPERIENCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JORDAN PEELE.  ( BAND PLAYING )    ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST STARRED IN THE HIT TV SHOW "KEY & PEELE" AND DIRECTED THE SMASH HIT MOVIE, "GET OUT."
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?
I CAN'T MOVE.
YOU'RE PARALYZED? NOW SINK INTO THE FLOOR.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT--
SINK.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JORDAN PEELE!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
DID YOU TELL THEM TO STAND?
Stephen: NO, WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
THAT'S NOT A THING?
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A THING.
YEAH! THANK YOU!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU JUST GOT A STANDING OVATION. YEAH. WELL, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE WE SHOT A LITTLE PIECE FOR THE SUPER BOWL SHOW TWO YEARS AGO.
WE DID.
Stephen: AND WHILE WE WERE SHOOTING THAT YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THIS MOVIE YOU WERE WORKING ON.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I SAID, "WHAT IS IT ABOUT?" AND YOU SAID, IT'S KIND OF CRAZY TO EXPLAIN."
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.
Stephen: HE SAID IT'S CALLED 'GET OUT'" AND YOU TOLD ME WHAT THE MOVIE WAS ABOUT. AND I SAID I WILL DO SEE IT. YOU MADE YOUR DEBUT WITH "GET OUT," HIGHEST GROSSING DEBUT FILM BASED ON ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY EVER. CONGRATULATIONS.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S INFLATION. IT'S INFLATION.
Stephen: NO, NO, HIGHEST EVER. DID YOU GETTIER BEAK WET ON THAT ONE?
DISOME COCAINE ON SET.
Stephen: OH, GOOD. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT.
YOU DID NOT GET MY BEAK WET.
Stephen: YOU DID NOT GET YOUR BEAK WET ON THIS ONE?
NO.
Stephen: LET ME REP YOU NEXT TIME.
FAIR ENOUGH.
Stephen: IT'S GOT 99% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES WHICH IS NEARLY UNHEARD OF. BUT I HAVE TO ASK WHAT WHO IS THE 1% WHO WENT, "I'M OUT."
RACISM IS...
Stephen: RACISM GETS TO REVIEW THINGS NOW?
RACISM HAS A COLUMN, AND REVIEWS THINGS, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT 1%.
Stephen: OH, WOW.
BUT, YEAH, LOOK, I'M JUST-- I'M HAPPY TO GET THAT HUMBLE 99.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU'LL GET THEM NEXT TIME, MAN.
I'LL GET THEM NEXT TIME. I'M HOPING FOR THAT ONE DONUT, DONUT NEXT TIME.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE ONE DONUT, DONUT?
ONE DONUT, DONUT.
Stephen: THE ONE DONUT, DONUT.
IT'S 100.
Stephen: OH, ONE DONUT, DONUT. I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW.
IT'S A BLACK THING. THAT'S-- IT'S AN URBAN --
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A BLACK THING.
IT IS.
Stephen: THAT'S A BLACK THING?
YEAH!
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T KNOW. SPOILER ALERT:  NOT BLACK. I KNOW I SEEM SUPER WOKE AT TIMES. I CAN IMAGINE YOU MISTAKING ME FOR BLACK.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN WHITE FACE WHEN I CAME OUT HERE.
Stephen: NO, I DON'T PLAY LIKE THAT.
GOOD, THAT'S NOT 2017.
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE SUBMITTED THIS TO THE GOLDEN GLOBES AS A COMEDY.
I-- I SUBMITTED IT AS A DOCUMENTARY.  (  LAUGHTER  ) I DIDN'T KNOW-- YOU KNOW, IT WAS-- IT WAS SUBMITTED. AND I --
Stephen: IT WAS SUBMITTED?
IT WAS SUBMITTED. IT WAS --
Stephen: DON'T USE THE PASSIVE TENSE. YOU'RE A BETTER WRITER THAN THAT.
IT HAD BEEN SUBMITTED. I TONIGHT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
Stephen: IT WILL HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED?
I THOUGHT-- HERE'S THE THING.
Stephen: YES. YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE, IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND AT THIS POINT.
THE MOVIE IS TRUTH. THE THING THAT RESONATED TO PEOPLE IS TRUTH. SO I THINK-- FOR ME, IT'S MORE OF, LIKE, A HISTORICAL BIOPIC.
Stephen: OKAY.
THE ORIGINAL TITLE WAS "GET OUT:  THE KANYE WEST STORY." BUT I HAD TO LOP OFF THE END.
Stephen: IS THE TITLE A REFERENCE TO THE RICHARD PRYOR JOKE?
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: DO YOU MIND TELLING THE PEOPLE THE JOKE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PRYOR OR EDDIE MURPHY I THINK THE ONE YOU ARE REFERENCEs IS THE "AMTIVEAL HORROR." IF THE BLACK PERSON WAS THE PROTAGONIST OF A HORROR MOVIE IT WOULD BE A VERY SHORT MOVIE. AND AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO GET A PRIOR LAUGH. SO THAT'S WEIRD. BUT, YEAH, THE BIT WAS THE BLACK FAMILY COMES INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE-- I THINK IT'S EDDIE MURPHY-- "THESE GRAPES DRAIPS ARE GREAT." "GET OUT!" "TOO BAD WE CAN'T STAY, BABY." IT'S NOT MY BIT. IT'S NOT MY BIT. BUT, YEAH, IT WAS LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET A BLACK PERSON BE THE PROTAGONIST IN A HORROR MOVIE, AND IT TURNS OUT YOU HAVE A MOVIE THAT HAS A-- A PROTAGONIST THAT IS AWARE THAT HORROR IS GOING DOWN.  (  LAUGHTER  ) THERE'S NO WALKING BACKWARDS INTO A DARK ROOM IN THIS MOVIE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, I MEAN, IT IS A FUNNY MOVIE, BUT IT'S ALSO A SCARY MOVIE. DID YOU-- DO YOU-- DO-- DO WHITE AUDIENCES AND BLACK AUDIENCES GET FRIGHTENED BY THIS MOVIE IN THE SAME WAY? DO THEY EXPERIENCE THE HORROR IN THE SAME WAY?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN, I THINK BLACK PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THE SECOND-- THE MOVIE COMES UP, AND, LIKE ARE THE PROTAGONIST IS DATING A WHITE GIRL. THEY GO, "OH, HE'S IN TROUBLE. I DON'T LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING! HE'S IN AN INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIP. GET OUT, BROTHER."
Stephen: UH-HUH. WHITE AUDIENCE GOES, "THAT'S VERY PROGRESSIVE. THAT'S VERY PROGRESSIVE."
YEAH, THAT'S COOL. IT'S NOT UNTIL LATER IN THE MOVIE THAT WHITE PEOPLE GET FREAKED OUT. THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. I THINK I'VE SAID THAT. I THINK I SAID THAT THING THAT THE VILLAINS ARE SAYING IN THIS MOVIE." SO IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING. AND IT IS, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE-- IT DOESN'T FIT INTO A GENRE. YOU KNOW, IT SORT OF SUBVERTS THE IDEA OF GENRE. BUT IT IS THE KIND OF MOVIE THAT, LIKE, BLACK PEOPLE CAN LAUGH AT, BUT WHITE PEOPLE NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE BIT.
YOU LAUGHED A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: NOT AS MUCH AS PROBABLE YOU DO.
NO, NO.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE WRITING PAPERS ABOUT THIS MOVIE. KIDS IN COLLEGE ARE WRITING PAPER.
THERE ARE COLLEGE COURSES --
Stephen: WHOLE COURSES?
YES THERE IS A BLACK CORE COURSE --
Stephen: OKAY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "OKAY?"
Stephen: WHEN YOU SAID, "THERE ARE WHOLE COURSES?" AND I SAID "ON THIS MOVIE." AND YOU SAID "BLACK HORROR MOVIES.
THIS IS THE ONE.
Stephen: THERE IS NO OTHER BLACK HORROR.
BASICALLY NO. THERE IS PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS. THERE'S CANDY MAN, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD-- THERE ARE A COUPLE.
Stephen: NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THERE IS ONLY ONE BLACK GUY. IT'S NOT BLACK HORROR.
HE'S THE MAN.
Stephen: HE'S THE REASONABLE CHARACTER IN IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: HE'S THE REASONABLE CHARACTER IN IT.
IN "NIGHT OF THE LIGDEAD," HE IS THE GUY WHO IS READY TO FIGHT ZOMBIES BECAUSE HE'S BEEN FIGHTING WHITE PEOPLE OFF HIS WHOLE LIFE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NO! NO! NO! OKAY. OKAY.
OKAY?
Stephen: SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU WENT TO ONE OF THESE CLASSES.
YES. SO I --
Stephen: DID THEY KNOW YOU WERE THERE?
SO I WENT IN WITH A HOOD. LIKE, THEY WERE PLAYING THE MOVIE-- U.C.L.A., THEY WERE PLAYING A CLIP FROM THE MOVIE. AND I KIND OF SNUCK IN. I WAS IN THE HOOD. AND THEN AT SOME POINT, YOU KNOW, THE TEACHER SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DIRECTOR WAS THINKING WHEN...?" AND I JUST RAISED MY HAND AND I WAS LIKE, "I HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT MATTER." AND THEY TURN IT WAS LIKE-- IT WAS, LIKE, THE BEST WELCOMING I EVER HAD. THEY WENT CRAZY.
Stephen: WOW.
I GOT EYE GOT IN FRONT OF HIM THEM, I WAS LIKE TEACHING THE LECTURE, AND THEY STARTED SAYING THINGS, RAISING THEIR HANDS SAYING, "LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED THIS TYPE OF OPPRESSION-- WAS THAT WHAT YOU MEANT?" LIKE SOME REALLY SMART THINGS.
Stephen: THAT'S EXCITING.
I HAD TO BE LIKE, "YEAH... THAT'S... WHAT I MEANT WHEN I DID THAT."
Stephen: WAS THIS THE MOVIE YOU INTENDED FROM THE BEGINNING OR DID IT SORT OF LIKE CHANGE IN THE CREATION?
NO. IT WAS THE MOVIE. THIS IS THE MOVIE-- THIS IS THE MOVIE I WANTED TO MAKE. I WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE THAT WAS FOR A VERY LOYAL BLACK HORROR FAN BASE THAT WE GO TO SEE HORROR MOVIES, AND WE-- YOU KNOW, WE DON'T GET REPRESENTED. AND THIS WAS THE MOVIE I FELT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE WERE WAITING FOR. AND I'M THRILLED THAT EVERYBODY ENJOYS IT. BUT TO BE HONEST, IT WAS-- IT WAS-- IT WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN.
Stephen: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN.

Stephen: OKAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT SEASON 5. DOES IT INCREASE ITS TRUMPINESS, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
IT DOES. I KNOW THAT SOME REWORKING OF THE WRITE HAD GONE TO HAPPEN AFTER HE WAS ELECTED, BECAUSE IT WAS KIND OF SHOCKING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND I THINK THERE WAS A MOMENT LIKE, "WAIT, WHAT? HOLD UP. WE HAVE TO DO" --
Stephen: THEY HAVE TO KNOW THE TRUMPS. THEY HAVE TO HAVE CROSSED OVER.
I THINK THEY'RE VERY CLOSE.
Stephen: DO THEY GET ANY OF THEIR MONEY FROM THE RUSSIANS?
NO, CHINA IS DEFINITELY A THEME. AND THE WALL IS DEFINITELY STILL BEING ATTEMPTED TO BE BUILT.
Stephen: IF A SEASON--
WE WERE TRYING TO BUILD A SONG. IT WAS TERRIFYING. I GUESS INCENT AND TRYING TO SELL BANANAS WOULD BE THE NEXT THING TO COME OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULDN'T BE AS SHOCKING.
Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN SORT OF FIXATEATED ON DONALD TRUMP, E BEFORE THAT. BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY GIFTED ARTIST.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: I LOVE THESE. WHEN DID YOU DO THESE BEFORE I SHOW THEM TO PEOPLE?
YOU KNOW, I DID THEM, LIKE, SIX YEARS AGO. I WAS OBSESSED WITH HIM AND JUST KEPT DRAWING HIS FACE.
Stephen: THIS IS A REALLY FANTASTIC DONALD TRUMP. SIX YEARS AGO.  ( APPLAUSE ).
HE'S GOT NICE NIPPLE S.
Stephen:  YES. HE'S GOT A LOVELY SET OF MAN BREASTS DOWN THERE. A COUPLE OF HIGH, HARD ONES. AND THEN THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY-- SO THIS ONE-- NOW, THIS ONE, IS THIS ALSO FROM, LIKE, SIX YEARS AGO?
YES.

YEAH, WITH THE LONG TIE AND THE-- YEAH.
Stephen: SO WHAT WAS, LIKE--  ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT WAS THE PROCESS LIKE? HOW DID YOU GET STARTED WITH HIM? AND, LIKE, WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU WORK WITH FIRST? IS IT THE BODY? IS IT THE FACE?
I HEARD YOU WERE A FAN OF RALPH STEDMAN.
I LOVE STEDMAN. I HAVE A SIGNED STEDMAN UPSTAIRS.
HE IS MY FAVORITE ARTIST, AND I HAVE INK, AND SPLOTS COME OUT WHEN YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THEM AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE A FACE AROUND THEM. I WAS OBSESSED WITH THE NATURE OF HIS SKIN AND, LIKE, HOW EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE LIKE A BALLOON SHOOTING OUT OF IT. SO I WAS JUST DRAWING-- HE WAS LUKE PERFECT FOR THIS KIND OF SKETCHY, ANGRY, INK-BASED DRAWINGS.
Stephen: HE DOES LOOK HASTILY PUT TOGETHER.
HE REALLY DOES, YEAH.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND ALL THE, LIKE, THE WAY I WAS DRAWING WITH THE INK, LIKE THE HAIR JUST CAME OUT, YOU KNOW, WITH WITHIN SWOOP. AND I WAS LIKE, "WELL, THERE IT IS." IT WAS REALLY EASY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN ACTING SINCE YOU WERE NINE YEARS OLD.
YES, VERY TRUE.
Stephen: AND YOU SEEM LIKE A VERY GROUNDED PERSON.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: FAIRLY HEALTH YOU. HOW DID YOU NAVIGATE, LIKE, A CHILDHOOD IN HOLLYWOOD WITHOUT SPINNING OFF?
I KNOW. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S MORE THE SURPRISING QUESTION NOW. PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "HOW ARE YOU OKAY?" YOU KNOW, IT'S MAINLY MY FAMILY LOOKING BACK ON IT, WHO HOPEFULLY ARE WATCHING THIS PROGRAM.
Stephen: MOM AND DAD TAKE CARE OF YOU.
AND TWO BROTHERS. I GREW UP IN, LIKE, PALM SPRINGS. SO I NEVER LIVED IN L.A. UNTIL I WAS A FORMALLY FORMED ADULT.
Stephen: YOUR FOLKS WERE NOT IN SHOW BUSINESS?
THEY ARE NOT, NO. MY FATHER AND MOTHER OPENED UP A STRIP CLUB IN CATHEDRAL CITY.
Stephen: THEY MUST NOT HAVE LET YOU IN WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.
I WAS NOT ALLOWED IN UNTIL I WAS 29, EVEN THOUGH THEY OWNED IT MY WHOLE LIFE AND PAID FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL AND DINNER.
Stephen: WOW, AND DINNER, BOTH.
ALWAYS HAD DINNER.
Stephen: GO TO SCHOOL AND EAT AT THE SAME TIME.
I LIVED A VERY PRIVILEGED LIFE.
Stephen: THE NEW SHOW YOU'RE DOING-- IS IT SEASON TWO NOW?
SEASON TWO.
Stephen: OF "SEARCH PARTY." WHAT IS IT ABOUT?
IT'S KIND OF A NOIR MYSTERY SHOW. THE FIRST SEASON IS ABOUT A GIRL KIND OF LOOKING FOR HIMSELF AND OBSESSED WITH A MISSING FRIEND SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WELL.
Stephen: SHE'S LOOKING FOR HERSELF AND THEN STARTS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE JEELS YES, BUT IN IT, SHE'S FINDING HERSELF KIND OF IN A COMEDIC, BEAUTIFUL WAY.
