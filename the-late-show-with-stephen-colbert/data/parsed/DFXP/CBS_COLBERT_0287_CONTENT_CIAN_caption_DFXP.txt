DID YOU HEAR TRUMP IS PLANNING TO ELIMINATE THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS.
WHAT A BOOB.
THIS IS HORRIBLE JIEK I'M CONFUSED. DOESN'T THE N.E.A., ONLY MAKE UP A TEENY TINY PART OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET. HOW IS THAT GOING TO SAVE MONEY.
DON'T TALK WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL.
IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO SAVE MONEY, EVEN MY MONKEY AGREES, RIGHT, MONKEY?
I DO CONCUR.
HOW CAN TRUMP DO THIS? HE'S AN ARTIST. I MEAN, THIS WHOLE PRESIDENCY THING OF HIS IS, LIKE, A PERFORMANCE ART PIECE, RIGHT.
NO, IT'S REAL.
OH, WE ARE SO SCREWED.
CALM DOWN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE FINE "P" IT'S ONLY FOUR YEARS.
NOOOO!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JOHN OLIVER. ISABELLE HUPPERT. AND MUSICAL GUEST, THE AVETT BROTHERS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO!
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD OF THIS STEVE BANNON FELLA IN THE WHITE HOUSE. ( BOOING ) EVIDENTLY, HE'S DONALD TRUMP'S--
Jon: WOW.
Stephen: A FRIENDLY CROWD. ( LAUGHTER ) HE IS DONALD TRUMP'S SENIOR STRATEGIST. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT HE'S THE GUY REALLY RUNNING THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE THAT, BECAUSE THERE'S NO PROOF THAT ANYONE'S RUNNING THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. BUT THESE RUMORS . ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THESE RUMORS HAVE GOTTEN UNDER TRUMP'S-- I WANT TO SAY SKIN. BECAUSE YESTERDAY HE TWEETED, "I CALL MY OWN SHOTS, LARGELY BASED ON AN ACCUMULATION OF DATA, AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT." YES. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU TWEET AT 7:00 A.M. THINGS EVERYBODY KNOWS. I DON'T THINK TRUMP LIKES THIS THING. SO IF HE DOESN'T LIKE THESE BANNON RUMORS, HE'S REALLY NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS. YOU GUYS SEE THE NEW "TIME" MAGAZINE? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS YET? IT'S GOT BANNON ON THE COVER. AND IF YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN IN THE ROOM-- ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST, EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT A MAGAZINE IS. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN GET THEM OUT, BECAUSE HERE GOES. RIGHT OVER HERE. OVER HERE? OKAY. THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. YEAH. GOOD LORD. HE LOOKS LIKE HELMETLESS DARTH VADER ON METH. I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GUY-- ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GUY'S CALLING ALL THE SHOTS. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE HE'S DOING ALL THE SHOTS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, STEVE, STEVE, I JUST-- JUST QUICK, AND I MEAN THIS, YOU KNOW, SINCERELY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER WORKED FOR A POWERFUL GUY OR A TV PERSONALITY BEFORE, BUT THEY KIND OF LIKE TO BE THE ONES ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE TWO WEEKS INTO THE JOB. STOP HOGGING THE LIMELIGHT-- OR WHATEVER LIGHT SOURCE THEY'RE USING FOR THIS PHOTOGRAPH HERE, ALL RIGHT. A GLOWING CORPSE. WHATEVER THEY USED. A ZOMBIE. TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS. DONALD'S NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS. REMEMBER, HIS NEW BEST FRIEND IS VLADIMIR PUTIN. SO IF TRUMP OFFERS YOU SUSHI, DON'T EAT IT. HAVE THAT PUT IN A SECURE CONTAINER, PLEASE. MEANWHILE, WHAT'S THE BIG NEWS. OH, TODAY, THE SENATE CONFIRMED EDUCATION SECRETARY AND WOMAN AHEAD OF YOU AT STARBUCKS WITH A REALLY COMPLICATED ORDER, BETSY DEVOS. NOW, THERE ARE 100 SENATORS. SHE GOT THE VOTES OF ONLY HALF OF THEM. SO HER FIRST ACT IS TO MAKE 50 COUNT AS A PASSING GRADE. NOW, DEVOS, OUR SECRETARY OF EDUCATION-- HAS NEVER ATTENDED, WORKED IN, OR SENT HER KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL. SO HOW DID SHE GET THE NOMINATION? WELL, THERE'S A TINY CHANCE THAT MONEY PLAYED A ROLE, SINCE DEVOS' FAMILY GAVE AROUND $200 MILLION TO REPUBLICAN CAUSES, INCLUDING DONATIONS TO FOUR SENATORS ON THE COMMITTEE OVERSEEING HER CONFIRMATION. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) OOOH, THAT REMINDS ME OF A MATH PROBLEM! "BETSY HAS $200 MILLION. SHE NEEDS 50 VOTES. HOW MUCH MONEY CAN SHE GIVE TO EACH SENATOR TO MAKE SURE PUBLIC SCHOOLS GET LESS?" BUT, WHATEVER-- WHATEVER WHAT HAPPENS, HAPPENS.  ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) THANK YOU. PEOPLE, PEOPLE LOVE MATH PROBLEMS. I'VE SAID IT FOR MANY YEARS. SO, WHATEVER. SHE'S NOW BEEN CONFIRMED. REPUBLICANS PUT EVERYTHING ON THE LINE ON THIS ONE. THIS WAS THE HILL TO DIE ON. FOR REPUBLICANS, CLEARLY, NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GETTING THE RIGHT LEADER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, WHICH TODAY THEY INTRODUCED A BILL TO ELIMINATE. "CONGRATULATIONS, BETSY. YOU'RE THE NEW PILOT OF THE "HINDENBERG." GOT A LIGHT?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S SEE, LAST NIGHT, BILL O'REILLY PLAYED MORE OF HIS SUPER BOWL INTERVIEW WITH TRUMP, AND THE PRESIDENT MADE A SHOCKING CLAIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS FASCINATING? TO WATCH YOU AT THE INAUGURATION WITH BARACK OBAMA. YOU GUYS SEEM TO GET ALONG, ALL RIGHT. WOULD THAT BE ACCURATE?
IT'S A VERY STRANGE PHENOMENA. WE GET ALONG. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'LL ADMIT THIS, BUT HE LIKES ME.
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE LIKES YOU?
I LIKE HIM. BECAUSE I CAN FEEL IT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I DO IN LIFE. IT'S CALLED, LIKE, I UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: "IT'S CALLED, LIKE, I UNDERSTAND." TRUMP HAS A SENSE WHEN PEOPLE LIKE HIM. AND HE DOESN'T FIND OUT HE'S WRONG UNTIL THE LAWSUIT. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN TRUMP, IT'S CALLED, LIKE, CONTINUED TALKING ABOUT HIS LIMO RIDE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ON INAUGURATION DAY.
WE DRIVE DOWN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE TOGETHER. WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. POLITICS IS AMAZING.
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?
WE TALKED ABOUT THE COUNTRY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY. I ASKED HIM ABOUT, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS?" AND HE TOLD ME, "I CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT IT'S A PROBLEM." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YES. OBAMA SAID, "I CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT HERE'S A HINT-- IT'S SITTING NEXT TO ME IN THE LIMO RIGHT NOW." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY! OH!
Stephen: HE LIKES HIM.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: HE LIKES HIM. THEY'RE GREAT FRIENDS NOW. LET'S SEE. BUT ASIDE FROM ORAILY, TRUMP'S WAR WITH THE MEDIA CONTINUES. YESTERDAY, HE SAID THAT THE MEDIA DOESN'T REPORT ON TERROR ATTACKS, AND LAST NIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE FOLLOWED UP TRUMP'S CLAIM BY RELEASING A LIST OF 78 UNDER-REPORTED TERROR ATTACKS. NUMBER FIVE WILL SHOCK YOU. HERE'S THE THING-- THE LIST INCLUDES THE TERROR ATTACKS IN SAN BERNARDINO, PARIS, NICE, AND ORLANDO THAT WERE EXTENSIVELY COVERED FOR WEEKS. MEANWHILE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ATTACK THEY LEFT OFF. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE. YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CAN'T BELIEVE IT. JUST ERASED, ERASED FROM THE OFFICIAL LIST BEFORE IT EVEN HAD THE CHANCE TO HAPPEN. IT'S NOT FAIR. ( LAUGHTER ) PLUS-- AND THIS IS INTERESTING-- THE LIST IS LOADED WITH TYPOS, LIKE: "ATTAKER" INSTEAD OF "ATTACKER" AND "DENMAKR" INSTEAD OF "DENMARK." SO AT LEAST WE KNOW STEVE BANNON ISN'T A GRAMMAR NAZI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALSO-- HE'S NOT. HE'S NOT. HE'S NOT. THAT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO CALL HIM THAT. ALSO, LAST NIGHT ON THE SHOW IF YOU WERE WATCHING THE SHOW LAST NIGHT, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" EXPOSE OF THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE THAT HAD A LOT OF BIZARRE DETAILS, LIKE THE FACT THAT "WHEN MR. TRUMP IS NOT WATCHING TELEVISION IN HIS BATHROBE, HE WILL SOMETIMES SET OFF TO EXPLORE THE UNFAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS OF HIS NEW HOME." THE STORY REALLY UPSET TRUMP, SO HE UNLEASHED WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND MELISSA McCARTHY'S RETIREMENT PLAN, SEAN SPICER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TO DEBUNK IT.
THERE WERE JUST LITERALLY BLATANT FACTUAL ERRORS. AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO SEE THAT KIND OF REPORTING, OR SO-CALLED REPORTING. THAT IS LITERALLY THE EPITOME OF FAKE NEWS.
WHAT WAS THE DETAIL?
WHAT WAS NAKERATE?
I-- I MEAN, START AT THE TOP. I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT OWNS A BATHROBE, DEFINITELY DOESN'T WEAR ONE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, SAYING TRUMP "DEFINITELY" DOESN'T WEAR A BATHROBE CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING: SEAN SPICER HAS SEEN DONALD TRUMP NAKED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW-- NOW WE KNOW WHY HE'S ALWAYS SO ANGRY ALL THE TIME. I'M SHOCKED THAT TRUMP DOESN'T OWN A BATHROBE BECAUSE WE KNOW HE LOVES THEM. HE LOVES THE YELLOW ONES. THE LOVES THE EX-WIFE MATCHING ONES. AND THE SEXY SHORT ONES. I BELIEVE-- I THINK THAT'S AN AMERICAN APPARELAE RIGHT THERE. DON'T JUDGE. HE WAS YOUNG. A LOT OF PEOPLE START THEIR CAREERS IN ROBE PORN. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WHILE I MAY NOT AGREE WITH DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICS, I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'M GOING TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE MY PRESIDENT WANDERS OUT ON THE FRONT LAWN IN HIS BOXERS TO PICK UP THE MORNING COPY OF THE FAILING "NEW YORK TIMES." SO, MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU. JIMMY, LET'S SHOW HIM WHAT IT IS! FEAST YOUR EYES ON "ROBE FORCE ONE." YES. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, YES, MR. PRESIDENT. YES, HERE WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SIR, THIS SUPER ABSORBANT TERRY WILL PROTECT YOU FROM ANY MATTRESS SPILLS. AND, REMEMBER, IT'S TRUMP BRAND, SO PROUDLY NOT MADE IN AMERICA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND SINCE IT'S FOR YOU, DONALD TRUMP, WE'VE MADE IT ADJUSTABLE.  ( CHEERS ) THERE YOU GO. YES! LET-- LET FREEDOM BREATHE. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING-- IS OUR TRUMP MANNEQUIN ANATOMICALLY CORRECT? YES, IT IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY. STICK AROUND, BECAUSE WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH OUR OLD FRIEND JOHN OLIVER. OOOH! OH, THIS IS LOVELY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS THE EMMY-WINNING HOST OF "LAST WEEK TONIGHT" ON HBO. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN OLIVER! ♪ HIGHER, HIGHER ON A MOUNTAIN HIGHER, HIGHER ON A MOUNTAIN ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING.
Stephen: GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING TO ALL.
Stephen: GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND, I VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE WITH YOU, BUT I UNDERSTAND. AT SOME POINT IT BECOMES UNEARNED, AND THAT POINT WAS ABOUT 50 SECONDS AGO.
Stephen: WELL, THEY'RE EXCITED BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN YOU AROUND. YOU'VE BEEN OFF THE AIR SINCE MID-NOVEMBER.
I HAVE.
Stephen: NOT A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN.
NO, NO. IT'S PRETTY MUCH-- SOME COSMETIC DIFFERENCES. THE COSMETIC DIFFERENCE REALLY BEING FLAMES AND THE FACT AMERICA IS IN IT.
Stephen: OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, SINCE DONALD TRUMP WON AND TAKEN OFFICE, HAVE YOU-- HAS THE FEELING MORE LIKE, "OH, I WISH I COULD BE TALKING ABOUT THIS?" OR "THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS."
IT'S A "B," AN EMPHATIC CAPITAL "B" THERE.
Stephen: LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS FOR RIGHT NOW.
BECAUSE NOTHING IS REALLY-- UNTIL INAUGURATION DAY, YOU KNOW, NOTHING WAS REALLY HAPPENING. IT WAS JUST BEING TIED TO A TRAIN TRACK, WATCHING THE TRAIN COMING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN, OF COURSE, INAUGURATION DAY IS THE TRAIN HITTING YOU AND YOU'RE THINKING, "YUP, THAT FELT PRETTY MUCH HOW I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE."
Stephen: WE SAW EACH OTHER-- YOU WERE VERY NICE TO DO A BENEFIT WITH ME IN DECEMBER. AND YOU WERE PRETTY UPSET AT THE TIME.
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW BECAUSE THIS IS THE COVER OF "ROLLING STONE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT MIGHT BE-- I MEAN--
Stephen: FIRST TIME ON THE COVER OF "ROLLING STONE?"
IT'S ACTUALLY MY SECOND TIME ON THE COVER.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
SO... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YEAH, I REMEMBER MY SECOND COVER. ALL RIGHT.
OH!
Stephen: A LONG TIME AGO. ANYWAY... NOW, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THIS MAN FOR A SECOND?
WOW.
Stephen: DOES THIS FILL YOU WITH ANY FEELINGS ( AUDIENCE BOOING ).
OKAY, IT'S NOT WRESTLING.
Stephen: HE IS IN THE WWE HALL OF FAME MY FRIEND.
IS HE.
Stephen: YES. WHY WOULDN'T HE BE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I EXPRESSED CURIOSITY THERE. YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. I COULD HAVE GONE AND GOOGLED IT AND REALIZED YOU WERE. STEVE BANNON-- TO BE HONEST, HE BELONGS ON THE COVER MORE THAN I DO, AND ARGUABLY, HE HAS A MORE PHOTOGENIC FACE AS WELL. ACTUALLY-- YOU KNOW WHAT? I TAKE THAT BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, HE'S-- HE'S A TERRIFYING INDIVIDUAL. WHICH I'M STILL-- I'M STILL, TO BE HONEST, HURT TODAY BY BEING ON THE INAUGURATION DAY OF BETSY DEVOS.
Stephen: YES.
HERE'S THE THING, HERE'S THE THING, CHILDREN. I ACTUALLY THINK SHE MIGHT AND SHOULD SERVE AS AN INSPIRATION TO SCHOOL KIDS IN AMERICA, BECAUSE SHE SHOWS THAT THEY COULD BE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION ONE DAY. IN FACT, NOT JUST ONE DAY, NOW. THEY COULD DO IT NOW. THEY'RE ABOUT AS WELL QUALIFIED NOW AS SHE IS. AND SPENT ARGUABLY LONGER IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL.
Stephen: THE LAST THING-- ON YOUR LAST SHOW, YOU DID A FANTASTIC DESK PIECE ABOUT "DON'T GET USED TO THIS. DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AS A VARIETY OF THINGS AS THE NEW NORMAL."
RIGHT.
Stephen: HAVE THINGS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAT YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, "BOY, I WISH THAT HADN'T BEEN ACCEPTED?" OR "THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL"--
I DON'T THINK-- I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL FEELING VISCERALLY REPELLED BY THINGS. I THINK THE PROBLEM REALLY ARISES WHEN YOU START NOT-- WHEN YOU GET PUNCH DRUNK, RIGHT. WHERE YOU HEAR SOMETHING-- IF YOU HEAR OF A BETSY DEVOS CONFIRM EXPAIGZ GO, "WELL, THAT'S THE WAY THE WORLD IS NOW."
Stephen: SO MANY, SO MANY-- LIKE SO MANY PICTURES ARE COMING OVER THE PLATE. SO MANY MEAN BALLS ARE COMING OVER THE PLATE. "A," YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO SWING AT. YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT TO PAY ATTENTION TO. AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PLAN OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, DO SO MANY THINGS AT ONCE--
IT'S EXHAUSTING. IT FEELS LIKE HIS INAUGURATION DAY WAS 114 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: A LITTLE OVER TWO WEEKS AGO.
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD-- IT'S EASY TO BE ANGRY ON ADRENALINE, RIGHT, BUT IT IS MUCH, MUCH HARDER WHEN YOU ARE JUST TIRED. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE EXHAUSTING.
Stephen: YEAH, FOUR YEARS. YEAR, THAT'S WHAT I--
FOUR YEARS MAYBE.
Stephen: OR EIGHT.
OR 12, OR 12. OR NOT 12. WORDS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING ANYMORE. WHY WOULD NUMBERS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING HERE. DONALD TRUMP.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS ABOUT SAYING AMERICA IS GOING TO PROJECT POWER AROUND THE WORLD IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, BUT ALSO PULLING BACK WITH ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR ALLIES. YOU'RE FROM ENGLAND, AND YOU-- YOUR COUNTRY ONCE HAD A GREAT EMPIRE.
WE DID. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND TOO WISTFUL, WE DID. WE DID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS, AND WE DID THEM WITH REAL COMMITMENT. ASK INDIA. ASK THEM. THEY REMEMBER.
Stephen: 83, YOU DON'T GET AN EMPIRE FROM NECESSARILY BEING NICE GUYS.
YOU DON'T. BUT WE DID IT WITH THAT CERTAIN GENTLEMANLY SWAGGER.
Stephen: YOU DID IT WITH A GIN AND TONIC IN ONE HAND.
BANG!
Stephen: BUT ENGLAND DOESN'T HAVE AN EMPIRE ANYMORE? DO YOU THINK AMERICA IS FACING SORT OF A RETRENCHMENT, LIKE DRAW THE BORDERS AND THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE AND THE HELL OF THE REST OF THE WORLD?
LOOK, IF YOU'RE AT A TIPPING POINT OF EMPIRE, ENJOY THE DESCENT. THAT'S THE KEY THING. YOU GET BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING WHEN YOU'RE NUMBER ONE. NO ONE'S POINTING AT US ANYMORE. WE'RE IRRELEVANT. AND, YES, THAT HURTS ON THE SURFACE, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A RELEASE IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. NOTHING'S OUR FAULT ANYMORE, OTHER THAN HISTORICALLY, EVERYTHING IS STILL FUNDAMENTALLY OUR FAULT. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE YOU --
Stephen: YOU DID EVERYTHING.
WE BASICALLY DID EVERYTHING. BASQUELY EVERY FLASH POINT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO A MUSTACHEIOD MAN SAYING, "THERE WE GO. LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT." ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THE ONE THING-- THE ONE THING THAT ENGLAND STILL HAS, EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE THE EMPIRE ANYMORE-- YOU HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. DON'T GET ME WRONG.
AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS AND "BOSTON HERALD." ISLANDS ANDBERMUDA.
DON'T MESS WITH BERMUDA. ONE TOE IN THOSE PINK SANDS AND WE WILL TURN INTO PINK GLAZ.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU GUYS HAVE JAMES BOND. IS THAT AN ENGLISH FANTASY THAT YOU MAY NO LONGER BE A WORLD POWER BUT YOU HAVE THE SINGULAR MOST BAD-ASS MAN ON THE PLANET WHO SINGULARY CAN ACTUALLY FIX EVERYTHING?
THAT'S RIGHT. AND OUR BELIEF IN HIM IS LIKE OUR BELIEF IN THE EMPIRE, A WONDERFUL FICTION. HE IS MURDERING HIS WAY AROUND THE GLOBE, SLEEPING WITH THE FINEST WOMEN IN HIS EYES, AND THEN REPORTING DIRECTLY TO JUDI DENCH. THAT'S-- THAT'S-- IT'S A SIMPLER WORLD, ISN'T IT? THAT'S AN EASY WORLD TO UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: YEAH.
AND HE JUST-- HE REGENERATES LIKE DR. WHO. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PIERCE BROSNAN, AND YOUR HAIR WILL NEVER CHANGE.
Stephen: NOW, NO ONE KNOWS WHO THE NEXT JAMES BOND WILL BE. THERE'S A LOT-- A LOT OF SPECULATION. HAS YOUR NAME EVER-- ( LAUGHTER ) IT WOULD BE A BOLD CHOICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO ONE WOULD SEE THAT COMING.
WHO WOULD-- FAIR POINT, PAIR POINT. IF THEY REALLY WANT TO THROW A CURVE BALL-- IF THEY REALLY WANT TO SAY TO THE WORLD, LISTEN, IF IF WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING DIFFERENT, HERE'S YOUR (BLEEP) BOND HERE.
Stephen: IAN FLEMING CHOSE THE NAME JAMES BAND BOND. YOU KNOW WHEN HE CHOSE IT? HE WANTED THE MOST BORING NAME HE COULD THINK OF.
IN THAT CASE, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE MOST BORING, YOU CAN THINK OF BA-BA-BOOM. IF YOU WANT A BOND WHO IS NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN, I'VE GOT YOU HERE. "OH, SHE'S SO PRETTY AND THE COCKTAIL DRESS IS SLINKY."
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN RIGHT NOW.
NO. YOU'R
Stephen: YOU'RE A GREEN CARD. ARE YOU WORRIED AT ALL BECAUSE TRUMP IS DETERMINED TO SLAM THE BORDER SHUT, THAT YOU MIGHT BE TOSSED OUT. WHEN IS YOUR GREEN CARD UP?
TOSSED OUT LIKE TEA.
Stephen: YEAH, A TEA BAG.
TEA BAG BEEN TOSSED OUT.
Stephen: EXACTLY NO EXTRA CHARGE.
YOU KNOW, THE CRAZY THING IS, IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. RIGHT? BUT THERE IS A NON-ZERO CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING NOW. SO, YEAR, I AM SLIGHTLY CONCERNED. I HAVE AN AMERICAN WIFE AND AN AMERICAN SON NOW, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT'S ENOUGH? HAVING A GREEN CARD USED TO BE ENOUGH, AND YET WHAT WE SAW WITH THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION, THAT DEBACLE, THINGS ARE NOT WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. WE HELD UP TRANSLATORS, AFGHAN AND IRAQI TRANSLATORS AT THE BORDER WHO HAVE BLED FOR A COUNTRY THEY'VE NEVER VISITED. HAVE SACRIFICED FAMILY MEMBERS FOR THIS COUNTRY. THIS PRESIDENT HAS DIDN'T NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SWALLOW HIM TELLING PEOPLE WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE A BENEFIT TO AMERICA OR NOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT TO-- ALL I'M SAYING IS--
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE COMMERCIAL BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JOHN OLIVER, DON'T GO AWAY. DON'T GO AWAY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE BACK HERE WITH OUR FRIEND JOHN JOHN, WE WERE TALKIN TALKING BEFORE THE GREAT YOU'RE ON THE GREEN CARD AND YOU HOPE TO STAY HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A WIFE AND A KID WHO ARE AMERICAN.
THAT WOULD BE NICE.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT IS THIN SKINNED AND THERE'S A CHANCE YOU MIGHT GET THE HEAVE-HO, THE BUM'S RUSH, THE 23 SKIDDOO.
A CHARMING WAY TO DEPORT SOMEONE.
Stephen: EXACTLY. IF YOU WERE SENT BACK TO ENGLAND, WHAT'S HOME FOR YOU? LONDON?
NO, I GREW UP IN A TOWN CALLED BEDFORD IN ENGLAND.
Stephen: NOT LIKE ONE OF THE BIG CITIES.
NOT A BIG CITY, A TOWN, BUT A SCRAPPY TOWN.
Stephen: SCRAPPY LITTLE TOWN.
YOU BACK IT INTO A CORNER, IT WILL SHOOT YOUR FACE OFF.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU. THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE LOVE SMALLER TOWNS HERE.
YOU DO.
Stephen: OH, WE LOVE THEM.
EVEN BRITISH TOWNS?
Stephen: I MEAN, SURE, BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. SURE, WHY NOT? ( LAUGHTER ) WE OCCASIONALLY-- WE LIKE TO DO THIS THING CALLED "COMMUNITY CALENDAR" ON THE SHOW, WHERE WE CELEBRATE SMALLER TOWNS, AND THE CULTURAL EVENTS THEY HAVE TO OFFER.
HERE'S THE THING-- AND THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE REQUEST Q.
Stephen: YES.
I WOULD LOVE IT-- HAIL MARY POINT HERE-- IF YOU COULD DO ONE OF THOSE ON MY TOWN BEDFORD, BUT FORGET IT.
Stephen: THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY WE COULD HAVE PREPARED FOR THAT REQUEST, JOHN OLIVER.
CAN'T BE DONE.
Stephen: SHOULD WE DO IT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
CAN'T BE DONE.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE ANYTHING? LET'S TRY TO DO IT. IT'S TIME FOR "BEDFORD'S COMMUNITYICAL DAR." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "COMMUNITY CALENDAR," YOUR SOURCE FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AND AROUND BEFORD-- THE COUNTY TOWN OF BEDFORDSHIRE-- AND THE GREATER REGION OF...

Stephen: ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, THE BEDFORD CORN EXCHANGE IS HOSTING IT'S CIRCUS OF HORRORS. THIS YEAR'S THEME IS "THE NEVER-ENDING NIGHTMARE." IT'LL LEAVE YOU WITH TERRIFYING QUESTIONS LIKE, "WHY DO PEOPLE IN BEDFORD KEEP DOING HALLOWEEN STUFF IN FEBRUARY?" ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION WITH NO GOOD ANSWER. ON FEBRUARY 15, "READY STEADY ROLL" HOSTS A BOARD GAME NIGHT AT THE BEDFORD PARK PAVILLION. RELAX AND EASE YOUR MIND OFF THE STATE OF THE WORLD WITH FUN GAMES LIKE "TERROR IN MEEPLE CITY," "SURVIVE: ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS," AND, OF COURSE, "PANDEMIC."

SO STOP ON DOWN FOR A LITERAL (BLEEP) SESSION. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THEN, ON FEBRUARY 22, HEAD TO ROGAN'S BOOKS FOR A CLASS ON UPCYCLED BOOK CRAFTS. LEARN HOW TO TURN YOUR OLD BOOKS INTO FUN CRAFT PROJECTS, SUCH AS DECOUPAGE, ORIGAMI, PAPER FLOWERS AND THE ART OF BOOK FOLDING. OR AS IT'S MORE COMMONLY KNOWN: CLOSING A BOOK.
IT'S AN ART IF YOU DO IT WELL. NOW, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26, BEDFORD CEMETARY WILL HOST A PRESENTATION ON WORLD WAR I CALLED "THE GREAT WAR THROUGH THE MAGIC LANTERN." BECAUSE IN ENGLAND, IT SEEMS EVERYTHING MUST SOUND LIKE A (BLEEP) HARRY POTTER TITLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

NOW, FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW YOUR CAREER, YOU'VE DONE OVER 100 FILMS IN FRANCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE A GRAND DAME OF FRENCH FILM. PEOPLE CALL YOU SORT OF THE FRENCH MERYL STREEP. OKAY? YES?

s I LOVE AMERICA.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. AMERICA HAS THIS STRANGE-- PLAWZ THAT'S NICE. FRANCE IS OUR FIRST ALLY, YOU KNOW. FRANCE IS THE FIRST COUNTRY THAT SUPPORTED THE UNITED STATES AFTER WE SPLIT FROM ENGLAND, AND WE HAVE A STRANGE LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH FRANCE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
MORE LOVE THAN HATE.
Stephen: YOU GIVE UP THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, WHICH WE'RE FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR, UNTIL WE'RE NOT.  ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK WE ADMIRE YOUR SOPHISTICATION, AND YOUR CULTURE. BUT WE ARE SUSPICIOUS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE US. ( LAUGHTER ).

WELL, I THINK WE LIKE YOU VERY MUCH. NO?
Stephen: YES?
YES DON'T YOU FEEL IT?

WELL, I'M NOT.

YOU'RE NOT, EITHER.
Stephen: I'M NOT FAT, EITHER, BECAUSE I'VE GOT A VERY GOOD TAILOR.
I CAN TELL. YEAH, VERY NICE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW YOUR NEW MOVIE, WHICH YOU WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE FOR IS "ELLE," AND AS I SAID, IT IS-- ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM. BUT IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE VIEWER BECAUSE YOU PLAY A CHARACTER WHO HAS SUFFERED SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND RESPONDS TO IT IN A WAY THAT'S THA SURPRISES ALL OF HER FRIENDS. SHE ENDS UP HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH THE MAN WHO ORIGINALLY ASSAULTED HER.
AN AFFAIR --
Stephen: A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP.
A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS. SHE HAS A PLAN, ACTUALLY. SHE WANTS TO TAKE REVENGE.
Stephen: AND SHE DOES IN, AGAIN, WAYS THAT ARE ALSO VERY CHALLENGING.
VERY UNPREDICTABLE.
Stephen: YOU'VE DONE OTHER ROLES WHERE YOU PLAYED AN INCESTUOUS MOTHER, A PIANO TEACHER INTO S.&M.AND SELF-MUTILATION. TRUE?
YES.
