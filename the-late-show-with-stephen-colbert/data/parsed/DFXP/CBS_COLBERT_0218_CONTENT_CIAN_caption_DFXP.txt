IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES SEAN PENN. SUTTON FOSTER. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY REGINA SPEKTOR. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (  Captioning sponsored by CBS  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY!
Jon: I SEE THAT. I SEE THAT.
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE THE SHOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS VERY MUCH. THANKS, HEY, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, FOR JOINING US IN HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD, MR. AND MRS. AMERICA, AND ALL SHIPS AT SEA. LAST NIGHT, OF COURSE,-- YOU GUYS WATCH THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE LAST NIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, WE'VE NOW HAD TIME TO DIGEST IT, AND TASTE IT AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE DEBATE BURPS. THOSE ARE ROUGH. PEOPLE REALLY-- I DID-- BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED THIS DEBATE TO BE DECISIVE, TO CHANGE SOMETHING, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST POLLS, TRUMP AND HILLARY ARE TIED. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: A TIE IS JUST LIKE KISSING YOUR SISTER, IN THAT IT MAKES BOTH SIDES WANT TO THROW UP. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TODAY, EVERYONE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WON, WHICH IS KIND OF A SILLY QUESTION TO ASK, OKAY. BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO SAY THEY WON. EVERYBODY IS GOING TO SAY THEY WON. THERE ARE NO POINTS. THERE'S NO PENALTIES. THIS ISN'T THE OLYMPICS. THERE ARE NO JUDGES. BECAUSE IF THERE WERE, THE RUSSIANS WOULD HAVE GIVEN TRUMP A TEN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- THEY'RE VERY GOOD FRIEND. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL GIVE TRUMP THIS MUCH, HE STARTED OFF STRONG LAST NIGHT BY DOING SOMETHING NOBODY EXPECTED: REACHING OUT TO WOMEN AND MINORITIES. IT WAS A CHANGE OF PACE, A REAL CHANGE OF PACE FOR HIM. YOU GOTTA GIVE IT TO HIM.
Jon: TECHNICALLY SPEAKING.
Stephen:  THAT IS FACTUALLY ACCURATE. ANOTHER THING THAT WAS OBVIOUS EARLY ON WAS CLINTON'S PLAN TO GET UNDER DONALD TRUMP'S SKIN, AND I GOTTA SAY SHE BROUGHT THE ORANGE PEELER. SHE GOT IN THERE, MAN, FIRST BY USING HER NASTY NEW NICKNAME FOR TRUMP.
YOU KNOW, DONALD WAS VERY FORTUNATE IN HIS LIFE. DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD; DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD. DONALD IS UNFIT TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
Stephen: APPARENTLY, DONALD DOESN'T LIKE BEING CALLED DONALD. DO YOU, DONALD? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I BET HE REALLY HATES IT WHEN HE SEES "DONALD" ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING. "YOU GUYS STAYING AT TRUMP TOWER?" "NO, WE'RE STAYING AT THE DONALD DUMP." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) REALLY, IS THAT NICE? "NOT REALLY, NO." BUT TRUMP ALSO GOT UNDER HILLARY SKIN, EVIDENTLY, LIKE WITH THIS STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS ACCUSATION THAT I'M SURE MEANT SOMETHING.
WAIT. THE A.F.L.-C.I.O. THE OTHER DAY, BEHIND THE BLUE SCREEN-- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. I SAID, "THERE'S A PERSON WITH A TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT A PROBLEM."
SECRETARY CLINTON?
WHOO! OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WOW. WHOOO! WHOOO! I DON'T KNOW WHAT EMOTION THOSE MOVEMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO CONVEY, BUT I GOTTA SAY, THEY'RE A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS. SHE MAY NOT HAVE PNEUMONIA, BUT SHE'S SHOWING ALL THE SIGNS OF DANCE FEVER.
WHOO! OKAY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: GET DOWN!
Stephen: THAT FEELS REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY. SHAKE THEM UP. AND TRUMP HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE TRUTH. APPARENTLY, TRUMP MADE MORE THAN 34 COMMENTS THAT WERE EITHER LIES OR MISSTATEMENTS. CLINTON WAS TAGGED WITH FOUR. NO SURPRISE. BEFORE THE DEBATE, POLITICO ANALYZED A WEEK'S WORTH OF TRUMP SPEECHES AND FOUND THAT "TRUMP AVERAGED ABOUT ONE FALSEHOOD EVERY THREE MINUTES AND 15 SECONDS." WHICH IS DAMNING. THOUGH, ON THE PLUS SIDE, YOU CAN USE TRUMP'S LIES TO TELL IF YOUR MICROWAVE POPCORN IS DONE. ( DING ).
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID TRUMP DIDN'T SEEM PREPARED, POSSIBLY BECAUSE HE WASN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) APPARENTLY, TRUMP'S ADVISERS SAW IT AS A WASTE OF TIME TO TRY TO FILL HIS HEAD WITH FACTS AND FIGURES. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A WASTE OF TIME. THERE'S NO ROOM IN THERE. IT'S ALREADY FULL OF ETHNIC SLURS AND DIFFERENT WIVES' NAMES. WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON. SO THE QUESTION IS, ONCE AGAIN, QUESTION OF THE DAY, WHO ONE? AGAIN, IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW FOR SURE, BUT THE MARKETS TODAY THOUGHT TRUMP LOST BECAUSE THE MEXICAN PESO WENT UP IN VALUE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRUE.  ( CHEERS ) WENT UP. THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR MEXICO. NOW IT'LL BE EASIER FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THE WALL. PLUS-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- THE THE PRICE OF GOLD WENT DOWN DURING THE DEBATE. SO, NOT ONLY DID TRUMP POSSIBLY LOSE. HE GOT HOME TO FEEBD OUT HIS TOILET WAS SO MUCH LESS VALUABLE. BUT TRUMP DID NOT TAKE THIS SQUATTING DOWN. JIM?
THERE'S, LIKE, SEVEN POLLS, AND, OTHER THAN CNN-- WHICH IS MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT'S A DEMOCRATIC POLL-- OTHER THAN CNN, I WON EVERY POLL, EASILY. YOU KNOW, I WON CBS.
Stephen: YEAH! HE WON THE CBS POLL. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT CBS DID NOT CONDUCT A POST-DEBATE POLL. DUH! THAT CLOSE! THAT CLOSE! CLEAR CHEAPER WHAT ARE ODDS? WHAT ARE ODDS? THE ONE POLL YOU WIN DOESN'T EXIST! JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T WIN IT. HE'S DOING VERY WELL IN NARNIA, AND HE GOT A FIRM ENDORSEMENT FROM THE LOLLIPOP GUILD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DOESN'T RUDY GIULIANI KIND OF LOOK LIKE HE'S IN THE LOLLIPOP GUILD. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) SO, TRUMP THINKS HE WON. BUT IF WE DIDN'T, WE KNOW WHO'S FAULT IT WAS. IT WAS LESTER HOLT'S FAULT.
I'D GIVE HIM A "C", "C+." I THOUGHT HE WAS OKAY. I THOUGHT HE WAS FINE, NOTHING OUTSTANDING.
YOU CAN CAN CHECK THE BOX.
I THOUGHT HE GAVE ME VERY UNFAIR QUESTIONS AT THE END, THE LAST THREE, FOUR QUESTIONS.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. LESTER HOLT DID ASK TRUMP AT LEAST ONE TRULY UNFAIR QUESTION AT THE END. HE ASKED THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE THE NATION'S BITTER RACIAL DIVIDE.
MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. HOW DO YOU HEAL THE DIVIDE?
Stephen: LESTER! WHAT THE HELL? TWO MINUTES TO HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE. TWO MINUTES TO HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE. AFTER THAT, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO EXPLAIN WHY GOD TOOK MY AFTER THAT, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO EXPLAIN WHY GOD TOOK MY NANA. WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE? YOU HAVE 15 SECONDS. DOESN'T SEEM FAIR TO ME. TRUMP DIDN'T BLAME HIS WHOLE PERFORMANCE ON THE MODERATOR. HE ALSO BLAMED THE EQUIPMENT.
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH A MICROPHONE THAT DIDN'T WORK. MY MICROPHONE WAS TERRIBLE.
Stephen: YES, THERE WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG WITH HIS MICROPHONE. I MEAN, WHO LEFT THAT THING ON? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY DAMNING. IS THERE NO SWITCH? YOU GOTTA TOGGLE IT OFF.
Jon: OH!
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO SWITCH IT OFF. NEVER A GOOD SIGN. BUT WHILE PEOPLE DIDN'T NECESSARILY LIKE WHAT TRUMP SAID, HE WANTS CREDIT FOR WHAT HE DID NOT SAY.
I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING EXTREMELY ROUGH TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY. AND I SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT'S NOT NICE. I WAS GOING TO HIT HER WITH HER HUSBAND'S WOMEN, AND I DECIDED I SHOULDN'T DO IT I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING IT. I THINK I DID THE RIGHT THING, IT'S NOTE WORTH A POINT. I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING IT WITH CHELSEA IN THE ROOM.
Stephen: YES, HOW GRACIOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SURE CHELSEA HASN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT STUFF YET. IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT, ELSE, WHAT ELSE HAVE THEY KEPT FROM THEIR CHILD? HAS SHE HEARD ABOUT THE TOOTH FAIRY, OR THE EASTER BUNNY, OR SANTA CLAUS HAVING SEX WITH HER FATHER? ( LAUGHTER ) SO MANY PEOPLE, SO MANY PEOPLE WATCHED LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE IT.
THEY'RE NOW CALLING IS THE SUPERBOWL OF DEBATES.
I GUESS WE CAN CALL THIS THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS.
IT'S KIND OF THE SUPER BOWL OF THE CAMPAIGN SEASON.
THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS.
THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS.
WELL, LET'S CALL IT THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS.
Stephen: YES, THE SUPER BOWL OF POLITICS, WHERE YOU YANKS PLAY YOUR FOOTING BALL. ( LAUGHTER ) YES, THIS DEBATE WAS JUST LIKE A THE THE SUPER BOWL:  YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME SCREAMING AT THE TV. THE TEAM YOU REALLY LIKE ISN'T EVEN THERE. AND AT HALF TIME, LESTER HOLT EVEN HAD A WARDROBE MALFUNCTION. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: WOW! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE HAVE SEAN PENN AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM "CATS," MAYBE FEATURING ME. STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HOW ABOUT IT FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU, JON. JON, I AM SUPER EXCITED ABOUT OUR FIRST GUEST TONIGHT. THE GUY DOES NOT DO LATE-NIGHT TV. HE IS A TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNING ACTOR, HUMANITARIAN, AND EXPEERENTIAL JOURNALIST. PLEASE WELCOME THE GREAT SEAN PENN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ARE YOU GOOD? ARE YOU GOOD WITH ME CALLING YOU "THE GREAT SEAN PENN." I DON'T CALL EVERY GUEST THE GREAT. YOU HAVE TO EARN IT. BUT YOU REALLY ARE ONE OF OUR GREAT ACTORS. ARE YOU OKAY WITH BEING CALLED GREAT?
I THINK IT'S AN AFFIRMATION OF YOUR DISCERNMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO WARN MY PRODUCERS, I MIGHT NEED A THESAURUS FOR THIS INTERVIEW. SEAN PENN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU DID A LATE NIGHT SHOW.
DON'T REMEMBER.
Stephen: YOU DON'T REMEMBER. SO IT COULD BE LAST WEEK OR IT'S JUST BEEN A LONG TIME YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU.
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE.
Stephen: YOU ARE HERE FOR A PURPOSE, THOUGH. THIS IS NOT JUST HANGOUT TIME.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO A BOOK THAT'S COMING OUT.
CORRECT.
Stephen: AND THE BOOK IS CALLED-- IT MIGHT TAKE ME A SECOND TO DESCRIBE IT HERE. DO YOU WANT TO JUMP IN AND DESCRIBE IT. THE BOOK IS CALLED:
"BOB HONEY WHO JUST DO STUFF." ONE MIGHT THINK YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT.
NO.
Stephen: YOU DID NOT WRITE IT.
NO, THIS IS SORT OF AN INTERESTING THING.
Stephen: I HOPE SO. ( LAUGHTER )
OR IT WILL BE MY LAST TIME ON LATE NIGHT TV.
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. THERE ARE A LOVE THINGS WE CAN TALK.
IN 1979 I WENT AS A KID TO THIS WRITERS' CONFERENCE IN KEY WEST, FLORIDA. AND THIS WRITER, JAMES LEO HURL HE WAS DOING A SEMINAR, AND I WENT TO THAT. AFTER EVIDENCE GOING DOWN TO MY ROOM-- I HAD DRIVEN DOWN THERE FROM LOS ANGELES.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU?
I WAS 19.
Stephen: OKAY, DIG IT.
AND YOU COULD DRINK ON THE COAST AT THAT TIME AT 18.
Stephen: IN KEY WEST, YOU CAN DRINK ANY TIME YOU WANT.
YOU CAN CAN DO ANYTHING. SO I WENT TO THE PASSION PIT BAR AT THE LAVENDER FARM.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS MADE UP. GO AHEAD.
THIS IS ALL GOING TO SOUND MADE-UP IS THERE OKAY.
LISTEN, IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE WERE WATCHING IN THE DEBATES LAST NIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THE FACT CHECKERS. I WANT POLITIFACT FACT CHECKING THIS. OKAY. PASSION PIT BAR AT THE FAN DJANGO DWRIL.
AT THE LAVENDAR FARM. THERE WAS A TERRIBLE PIECE OF COMMERCIAL ART. IT WAS A FIBERGLASS, FULL-SIZE BAR PATRON WITH A GLASS SITTING IN A SEAT. AND I WONDERED AT THE TIME LOOKING AT IT-- I MEAN, A TERRIBLE PIECE OF ART. AND I WONDERED AT THE TIME LOOKING AT IT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE PLACE WAS CROWDED, WERE PEOPLE FRUSTRATED THAT THIS PIECE OF ART WAS PERMANENTLY EMBEDDED IN THAT SEAT? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, MAYBE A DATE HAD TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT, FIRST THINKING MAYBE IT WAS THE ALCOHOL. BUT THIS WAS NOT A COMMERCIAL PIECE OF ART. IT WAS A HUMAN BEING WITH VERY LITTLE CAPACITY FOR ANIMATION. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO THERE WAS ACTUALLY A MAN SITTING THERE.
IT WAS A MAN IS THERE THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A HIDEOUS PIECE OF ART? ( LAUGHTER ).
WHICH-- WHICH WAS A FASCINATING THING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I WENT AND I SIDLED UP NEXT TO HIM. WE ENDED UP IN CONVERSATION THAT I QUICKLY HAD TO TRANSLATE FROM LYRICS TO MELODY BECAUSE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING. THOUGH IT SOUNDED LIKE INTELLIGENT ENGLISH. HE WAS SPEAKING A LOT OF ACRONYMS, AND SOME IN METAPHOR, SLANGS, SCIENTIFIC TERMS. AND EITHER CASE, MY MOTHER WAS MAKING GREETING CARD THAT WERE KIND OF INTERESTING AT THE TIME. AND I BROUGHT UP THAT IN SMALL TALK. HE GOT FASCINATED BY THAT. AND I KIND OF THREW HER UNDER THE THE BUS BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM THE CONVERSATION BY GIVING HIM HER ADDRESS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE COULD CORRESPOND --
YOU WERE JUST PIMPING OUT YOUR MOM'S ADDRESS IT TO A GUY SO HE WOULD STOP TALKING TO YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU APPROACHED HIM?
YEAH, I APPROACHED HIM, AND THEN I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO-- IT'S FASCINATING, BUT I CAN'T BE IMMEDIATELY RESPONSIVE TO THIS. I NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS GUY IS SAYING. SO ANYWAY, I NEVER HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN. BUT MY MOTHER HAD CORRESPONDED WITH HIM. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: SINCE 1979.
NO, THEN. ASK SHE SOLD HIM ABOUT 500 GREETING CARDS.
Stephen: ASK YOUR MOM STILL MAKE GREETING CARDS?
NO, SHE STOPPED WITH GREETING CARDS THING, TOO MANY STRANGERS ASKING FOR THEM. ANYWAY, SO WHAT HAPPENED THEN, IS, LIKE, MAY, THIS YEAR, MY MOTHER CALLED, AND SAID THAT A MANILA ENVELOPE, SOMETHING LIKE FAN MAIL GOT TO HER ADDRESS. I SAID,"THROW IT AWAY SM. AND SHE SAID, "WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY I REMEMBER. PAPPY PARIAH." AND I REMEMBERED THAT NAME.
Stephen: RIGHT, IT'S ON THE BOOK RIGHT HERE. ( LAUGHTER ).
AND WHAT-- WHAT CAME IN THIS ENVELOPE.
Stephen: PAPPY PARIAH, WRITTEN BY PAPPY PARIAH.
AND WHAT CAME IN THIS ENVELOPE WAS A MANUSCRIPT WITH A DEDICATION TO ME SAYING HE WANTED ME TO BE THE EXECUTOR OF IT.
Stephen: IS HE DID DEAD?
THIS IS WHAT'S INTERESTING. NO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE-- THE RETURN ADDRESS WAS A LAWYER'S ADDRESS IN THE CAYMEN ISLANDS. SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT AUDIBLE, YOU KNOW WHO DO KIND OF BOOK ON TAPE THING FOR AMAZON.
SURE, SURE, SURE, DIGITAL BOOKS.
THEY CAME INTO THIS THING. AND HE HAD WANTED ME TO TRY TO GET IT, YOU KNOW, HEARD BEFORE THE THE ELECTION. AND THEY CAME IN GREAT, AND IT'S KIND OF --
IT'S A QUICK WAY TO PUBLISH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY PRINT IT. YOU JUST DO AN AUDIO BOOK.
AND IT'S THE NEW AGE OF LITERATURE. UP PEOPLE TO HAVE INFORMATION-- I CLEARLY WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE WHAT I READ WAS SOMETHING I FELT WAS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR NOW. HE DEMANDED IT BE BEFORE THE ELECTION.
Stephen: I READ THE BOOK, TOO. I GOT A SIMILAR-- I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY VACATION IN AUGUST, AND IT WAS, LIKE, A GRAVELLY VOICE, LOS ANGELES PHONE NUMBER, SOMEBODY SAID, "WOULD YOU READ THIS BOOK?"
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I SAID, "I'D LOVE TO, SEAN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND HE GOES-- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I TONIGHT KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND SO I READ THE BOOK AND IT'S LIKE A BIT OF A MYSTERY, SOMETHING OF A THRILLER. THE MAIN CHARACTER, BOB HONEY, WHO JUST DO STUFF, MIGHT BE A MURDERER, MIGHT BE AN ASSASSIN, MIGHT BE C.I.A., MIGHT BE INSANE.
YEAH.
Stephen: MIGHT BE ONE OF OUR GREATEST LIVING ACTORS. IS THERE ANYTHING-- IS AND OF THIS BASED ON-- DID PAPPY PARIAH KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH THROUGH YOUR MOTHER'S LETTERS THAT ANY OF THIS REFLECTS YOUR OWN LIFE, SEAN PENN?
I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT WILL REFLECT EVERYBODY'S LIFE, OR I WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO SHARE IT.
Stephen: BUT NOT EVERYBODY-- BECAUSE THIS CHARACTER ALSO HAS SPENT TIME, LIKE, IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS CHARACTER HAS ALSO SPENT TIME WITH DRUG LORDS WHO ARE FASCINATED BY ESCAPE TUNNELS. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT RELATE TO OF THIS MAIN CHARACTER.
OH, THERE'S FOE QUESTION I RELATE TO A LOT OF IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WELL, I WANT TO GET INTO SOME OF THE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT TO THIS BOOK WHEN WE COME BACK. BUT WE HAVE TO SERVE SOME CORPORATE MASTERS. ARE YOU DOWN WITH THAT?
YES, WHICH IS LARGELY WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT, CORPORATE MASTERS. SO LET'S HIT IT.
Stephen: WE'LL BOW DOWN TO OUR CORPORATE MASTERS AND BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE SEAN PENN.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH SEAN PENN, WHO IS HERE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE BOOK "BOB HONEY WHO JUST DO STUFF," WRITTEN BY THE THE MYSTERIOUS PAPPY PARIAH, NARRATEED BY SEAN PENN WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AUDIBLE. YOU CAN CAN PREORDER IT.
IT'S A FREE DOWNLOAD BECAUSE AUDIBLE SAW FIT TO GET THESE WORDS OUT THERE.
Stephen: FREE.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S FREE. LET ME ASK YOU. IT'S FREE. DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH THE MONEY? ( LAUGHTER )
LISTEN YOU'RE TALKING TO AN AMERICAN WHO SPENT THEIR TIME WATCHING THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT. IF THAT WAS WORTH WATCHING --
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT? YOU'RE POLITICALLY... ( DEEP BREATH ) NOT SHY. YOU'RE NOT SHY ABOUT YOUR POLITICS, LET'S SAY.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A POLITICAL DEBATE GOING ON. SO I DIDN'T WATCH IT. IT'S A SOCIAL DEBATE.
Stephen: THAT'S SOMING BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SEE WHO WON IT, AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SEE WHO SCORED POLITICAL POINT. YOU THINK IT'S MORE SOCIAL POINTS?
IT'S IN THE BOOK, ACTUALLY. PAPPY PARIAH PUT IT IN A WAY THAT HIT ME. IT'S BASICALLY THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS. EITHER YOU CAN DECIDE TO DIVORCE YOURSELF FROM LOVING YOUR CHILDREN, AND PISS ON A TREE AND SHOW THAT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO PISS ON A TREE. OR YOU CAN GO OUT AND VOTE IN A VERY BIG WAY FOR SOMEONE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WHO THEN YOU CAN CHALLENGE AND SUPPORT, CAN WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY THAT ANY KIND OF PRESIDENT CAN HAVE ANY SUCCESS, AND YOU STICK IT OUT FOR FOUR YEARS. OR WE CAN JUST MASTER BAIT OUR WAY INTO HELL WITH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A GUY WHO --
GO BACK TO THAT OPTION ONE MORE TIME. THAT WAS VERY APPEALING.
A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY BLOND MAGICIAN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO TRUMP, I DON'T THINK TRUMP COULD ACTUALLY MASTURBATE HIS WAY TO HELL BECAUSE HIS HANDS ARE TOO SMALL. I'M NOT SURE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
PROPORTIONAL MATCH.
Stephen: OH. I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. LET ME ASK YOU-- LET ME-- LET ME ASK YOU THIS. YOU ARE-- YOU HAVE SAT DOWN WITH SOME-- SOME DICTATORS. YOU HAVE SAT DOWN WITH HUGO CHAVEZ. YOU SAT DOWN WITH THE CASTROS. WHY DID YOU DO THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE PEOPLE END UP GETTING MAD AT YOU AND GOING, "SEAN PENN LOVES OUR ENEMIES." AND "SEAN PENN HATES AMERICA" WHY DO YOU DO THAT? I'M ASKING FOR A FRIEND WHO IS TRYING TO INTERVIEW YOU. ( LAUGHTER ).
LOOK, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AWARE IN ADVANCE THAT IT MAKES ME DISMISSIBLE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE-- TO DISMISS. BUT AGAIN, LIKE IN THE FACT CHECKING OF ALL THIS TH-- AND I KNOW YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT CHECKING YOUR FACTS-- BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD "DICTATOR," HUGO CHAVEZ WENT THROUGH 14 OR 16 INTERNATIONALLY-OBSERVED ELECTIONS, MORE THAN ANY LEADER WE HAVE GOES THROUGH. THAT HAD NOT BEEN MY PRIMARY INTEREST. MY PRIMARY INTEREST HAS BEEN THE UNITED STATES-- OR I SHOULD SAY ITS MEDIA THE AT LARGE-- WHEN THEY DEMONIZE FOREIGN LEADERS AND, THEREFORE, DEMONIZE IN MANY CASES, THEIR POPULATIONS, THIS GETS ME INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THAT-- FROM THAT PLACE. AS THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND IT STRANGE THAT OUR CHIEF OF SECRET POLICE WHO BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD A SON WHO WAS BEING VOTED IN FLORIDA WITH THE GOVERNOR AS THE BROTHER, AND SOME THINGS WENT WRONG WITH OUR ELECTION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THOSE COUNTRIES, IT SEEMS KIND OF BANANA REPUBLIC, AND WE LOOK THE SAME OTHER WAY. SO I'VE JUST BEEN INTERESTED TO TRY TO SEE IT WITHOUT WATCHING IT ON FOX NEWS OR CNN OR THE "NEW YORK TIMES," AND TO SEE IF I SAW SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND I'VE WRITTEN WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT. AND I'M WILLING TO BE CALLED THE NAMES THAT I'VE BEEN CALLED. SO THAT'S IT. I'M JUST INTERESTED.
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU ALSO CAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A VIRTUE. CURIOSITY IS A VIRTUE. YOU'RE ALSO A LUDDITE. LIKE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY AT ALL.
NOTA ALL.
Stephen: WOULD YOU KNOW HOW TO DOWNLOAD THIS BOOK ON TO YOUR OWN PHONE OR LISTEN TO ON A LAPTOP?
IF I'M TOO CLOSE TO THE MACHINE, NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD IT. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S AN --
DO YOU HAVE A HEX ON THE MACHINE?
BUT I HAVE STAFF SO, --
YOU HAVE STAFF.
I HAVE STAFF. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: "I HAVE STAFF. I HAVE STAFF. POWER TO THE PEOPLE AND TO MY STAFF."
AND TO MY STAFF. I'VE CREATED A HUGE AMOUNT OF JOBS, HUGE.
Stephen: OR YOU'RE A JOB CREATOR? YOU'RE NOT A-- YOU'RE NOT A-- GOOD. YOU'RE NOT ON TWITTER.
I AM NOT.
Stephen: WELL, WE-- WE SIGNED YOU UP. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. THIS IS-- IT'S SEAN PENN. IT'S CALLED SEAN PENN. AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR FIRST TWEET RIGHT NOW? I'LL HELP. YOU CAN DICTATE IT. I'LL TYPE, YOUR FIRST TWEET.
PAPPY, WHERE ARE YOU?
Stephen: "PAPPY, COMMA, WHERE ARE" WE'LL PUT "ARE" BECAUSE WE'RE DOWN IN MILLENNIAL. WHERE ARE YA, QUESTION MARK? IS THAT GOOD.
EXCELLENT.
Stephen: HASHTAG. WHAT HASHTAG?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT A HASHTAG IS.
Stephen: IT'S THE FUTURE, SEAN. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S HOW WE-- HASHTAG, IT'S A SEARCHABLE ITEM IN TWITTER. SO YOU PUT THIS DOWN, AND PEOPLE CAN SEARCH FOR THAT HASHTAG, AND OTHER PEOPLE CAN TAG THEIR TWEET, IF THEY LIKED YOUR TWEET. AND THIS HASHTAG MIGHT TREND, MEANING A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING IT. AND THEN PEOPLE WILL GO, "HEY LOOK AT THE-- LOOK AT THE CULTURAL IMPACT THIS ONE TWEET THAT SEAN PENN MADE REGARDING HIS BOOK." #BOBHONEY. IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY OF INCLUDING INFORMATION. BOB HONEY, AND THERE IT IS. #BOB HONE. YOU READY TO DO IT?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE BUPON. READY?

BACK IN THE NOONTIMEs I WAS ON TOUR WITH "GREECE "THE MUSICAL, AND WE WOULD GO TO YOUR LATE-NIGHT SHOWS AT SECOND CITY.
Stephen: YOU GUYS WERE IN CHICAGO AND YOU SAW ME ON STAGE THERE?

Stephen: NO, NO IT WAS CALLED THE ENERGY DANCE, NOT THE GINSENG DANCE.
BUT SOMEBODY WOULD BE LIKE-- AAHHH! I WOULD DO A CRAZY DANCE.
Stephen: IT WAS LEAK'S STALL. WHEN YOU HAD A STALL WAYING FOR THE NEXT SCENE-- IS THIS IT? LET ME TRY IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS IT. OKAY, IF THIS IS IT. CAN I DO IT TOW DOWN HERE?

ONCE I HAD TO TRAVEL MY TONYS ONCE FROM LOS ANGELES BACK TO NEW YORK. AND I HAD THEM IN MY CARRY-ON BAG, AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE THE METAL DETECTOR, AND THE GUY WAS LIKE, "I GOTTA RECHECK YOUR BAG." AND HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT ARE THESE?" AND I WAS LIKE, "THOSE ARE MY TONYS," "MY TONYS." AND HE WAS LIKE-- COMPLETELY UNIMPRESSED ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE GOT A NEW TV SHOW CALLED "YOUNGER," WHERE YOUR PRESENT AGE, CAN WHICH I CANNOT BELIEVE IS-- IS IT 40?
