NO, YEAH, THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.
COME ON! I THINK WE'VE RUN THE GAMUT ON WHITE PEOPLE. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?
HE, WAIT A SECOND, MAYBE HE'S ON TO SOMETHING.
COMING THIS SUMMER, HBO'S "POPEY! THE PUPPY POPE."
OH, COM!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JUDE LAW. GABRIELLE UNION. AND THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! GOOD TO SEE YOU! HOW ARE YOU! GOOD TO SEE YOU. CHRIS! MARK! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: WHAT'S UP, JON? GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. LAST NIGHT WE WITNESSED HISTORY AS BARACK OBAMA DELIVERED HIS STIRRING FAREWELL ADDRESS, JOINING THE PANTHEON OF PRESIDENTS IN CELEBRATING NOT ONLY WHAT THEY'VE DONE FOR AMERICA, BUT THEIR VISION OF WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR OUR GREAT COUNTRY. IT WAS A TRULY MOVING EXPERIENCE. AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP FOR A SECOND. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE, THERE'S A STORY AHU, IT CAME OUT IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. AND PARDON THE EXPRESSION, IT IS JUICY. ( LAUGHTER ) LAST NIGHT-- HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED-- CNN REPORTED THAT LAST FRIDAY INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS PRESENTED TRUMP WITH CLAIMS OF RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO COMPROMISE HIM. I GOTTA SAY, THAT IS AN AWKWARD FIRST MEETING WITH YOUR NEW BOSS. "HEY, LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER. WATER COOLER'S DOWN THE HALL. WE HEARD THAT YOU'RE THE PUPPET OF A HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. BARBARA VALIDATES PARKING ANY TIME YOU NEED IT. ANY QUESTIONS?" WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET ALONG. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT! INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS PREPARED A TWO-PAGE SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS THAT RUSSIAN OPERATIVES CLAIM TO HAVE COMPROMISING PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT MR. TRUMP. TRUMP RECEIVED THESE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF HIS INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING, SO WE KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE: HE DIDN'T READ THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) A LOT OF EFFORT, A LOT OF EFFORT. AND TRUMP IMMEDIATELY DENIED THE REPORT, TWEETING, "INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SHOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED THIS FAKE NEWS TO LEAK INTO THE PUBLIC. ONE LAST SHOT AT ME. ARE WE LIVING IN NAZI GERMANY?" SO TRUE. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! HE'S GOT-- THAT IS SO TRUE. WE ALL REMEMBER HOW UNFAIR NAZI GERMANY WAS TO THEIR CHARISMATIC LEADER. THOSE PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS GOING "TALK TO THE HAND!" ( APPLAUSE ) SO RUDE. NO! NO! BUT TRUMP IS RIGHT IN THIS ONE WAY: EVERYONE ADMITS THIS REPORT IS UNVERIFIED. THIS MAN IS ABOUT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO I'M NOT GOING TO VALIDATE THAT REPORT BY SHARING THE MOST SALACIOUS DETAILS FROM IT, EVEN THE DETAIL EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT. YOU MIGHT CALL IT THE NUMBER ONE DETAIL. I THINK THIS IS JUST AN UNFORTUNATE LEAK. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S MAKING A HUGE MESS. AND I KNOW I'M BEING A WET BLANKET, BUT REPORTING ON THIS IS THE WORST KIND OF YELLOW JOURNALISM. EVEN THOUGH JOKES ABOUT THIS STORY ARE A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY, I WON'T DO IT. NOT TO SAY THE STORY DIDN'T MAKE A HUGE SPLASH. IT DID. IT FLOODED TWITTER. WE'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED AS FACTS TRICKLE IN. ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAVE OUR BEST RESEARCHER WORKING ON IT. SHE'S A REAL WHIZZ. AND ONE THING IS FOR SURE-- THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IS A GOLDWATER REPUBLICAN WHO BELIEVES IN TRICKLE-DOWN. HE HAS THE RESPECT OF OUR EMERGENCY SERVICE WORKERS WHO GAVE HIS PLANE A WATER SALUTE. TRUMP HAS EVEN DENIED ALLEGATIONS LIKE THIS BEFORE IN THE STRONGEST OF TERMS.
NO P.P.
Stephen: SO NO, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY JOKES, NOT EVEN A WEE ONE. SO I'M CUTTING IT OFF NOW. I AM FINISHED. WAIT! A LITTLE MORE IS COMING OUT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES. IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES. BUT AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF LISTENING TO TRUMP MAKE UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS ABOUT OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE, I DON'T THINK THIS MATTERS IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT, BECAUSE THE FACT IS, IT'S OUT THERE, AND THAT MEANS, MR. TRUMP, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. OKAY, THAT'S IT. WE'RE DONE. AND IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THIS CRAZINESS TODAY, TRUMP HELD HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE IN 168 DAYS. FUN FACT: THE LAST TIME TRUMP HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE, HE ASKED HIS FRIENDS TO HELP HIM BY HACKING HILLARY CLINTON.
I WILL TELL YOU THIS, RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
Stephen: THOSE WERE SIMPLER TIMES. REMEMBER THAT? NO, NO, THOSE WERE LOVELY-- THOSE WERE SIMPLER TIMES WHEN WE THOUGHT RUSSIA TOOK ORDERS FROM TRUMP. IT'S JUST-- I MISS THEM. WHEN TRUMP TOOK TO THE PODIUM, HE WAS QUICK TO ATTACK WHOEVER PRODUCED THE UNVERIFIED REPORT.
IT WAS A GROUP OF OPPONENTS WHO GOT TOGETHER, SICK PEOPLE, AND THEY MUTT THAT CRAP TOGETHER.
Stephen: SIR, NOT CRAP, BUT CLOSE.
Jon: OOOH! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND TRUMP, OF COURSE, DEFENDED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA.
IF PUTIN LIKES DONALD TRUMP, I CONSIDER THAT AN ASSET, NOT A LIABILITY.
Stephen: SIR, AT THIS POINT, I THINK WE ALL CONSIDER YOU A RUSSIAN ASSET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND-- THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? I THINK THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S POSITIVE. AND HE EXPLAINED JUST WHY HE WANTS TO WORK WITH RUSSIA.
RUSSIA CAN HELP US FIGHT ISIS, WHICH IS, BY THE WAY, IS NUMBER ONE TRICKY.
Stephen: "NUMBER ONE TRICKY," BY THE WAY, IS THE OFFICIAL NAME FOR WHAT THOSE WOMEN DID IN THAT RUSSIAN HOTEL ROOM, ALLEGEDLY. ALLEGEDLY! IT'S ON THE ROOM SERVICE MENU: "I'LL HAVE THE NUMBER ONE TRICKY AND A COBB SALAD, PLEASE. HOW LONG WILL THAT BE? WILL THAT BE A LONG TIME?" BUT TRUMP QUICKLY MOVED BEYOND THE ALLEGATIONS TO REMIND US WHY WE VOTED FOR HIM-- BECAUSE HE'S A GREAT NEGOTIATOR.
WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DEALS ANYMORE.
Stephen: YEAH, LIKE HOW WE TRADED OBAMA FOR THE WORLD'S LOUDEST TROLL DOLL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TERRIBLE DEAL. TERRIBLE. THE PROBLEM WITH UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS LIKE TRUMP BEING RUN BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY DISPEL THEM? AND HERE'S THE THING. I-- I-- I ONLY FEEL FOR DONALD TRUMP A LITTLE BIT HERE BECAUSE HE BROUGHT THIS ON HIMSELF. AND I HAVE A SUGGESTIONS, MR. TRUMP, OF HOW TO GET RID OF IT. JUST DO THE THING YOU HAVE NEVER DONE, WHICH IS SAY ANYTHING PUTIN WOULDN'T LIKE, ALL RIGHT, THAT WOULD PROVE THEY'RE NOT RUNNING YOU. BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING PUTIN DOESN'T LOVE. CRITICIZE THE INVASION OF UKRAINE.  ( APPLAUSE ) CRITICIZE TAKING AWAY THE CRIMEA. CRITICIZE HIM KILLING JOURNALISTS. RAISE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. SAY PUTIN'S NIPPLES LOOK LIKE PENCIL ERASERS. SAY ANYTHING, ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT HIM. I DARE YOU, BECAUSE I BET YOU WON'T! , OF COURSE, TRUMP COULD IMMEDIATELY CLEAR UP ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA IF HE JUST RELEASED HIS TAX RETURNS.
I'M NOT RELEASING TAX RETURNS BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THEY'RE UNDER AUDIT.
Stephen: SIR, I REALLY, REALLY DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE AUDIT ANYMORE. ONCE YOU GET THE LAUNCH CODES, YOU CAN DO THE E-Z FORM. ALTHOUGH, I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO MEET THE I.R.S. AGENT WITH THE BALLS BIG ENOUGH TO AUDIT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS, BUT HE WOULDN'T EVEN NEED A DESK. HE COULD JUST REST THE FORMS ON HIS SCROTUM.
Jon: OH!
Stephen: THEY'RE NOT GOING TO AUDIT YOU. WHERE WAS I? WHAT I TALKING ABOUT? OH, BARACK OBAMA. RIGHT. LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE NATION, WHICH WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE REPUBLICANS' FAREWELL ADDRESS TO EVERYTHING HE DID. IT WAS A GRACIOUS SPEECH, AND OBAMA REAFFIRMED HIS COMMITMENT TO THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER.
I COMMITTED TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP THAT MY ADMINISTRATION WOULD ENSURE THE SMOOTHEST POSSIBLE TRANSITION, JUST AS PRESIDENT BUSH DID FOR ME.
Stephen: AND JUST AS PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL FOR VLADAMIR PUTIN. ABSOLUTELY SMOOTH. GREASE THE SKIDS. THE PRESIDENT REMINDED US OF HIS MANY FOREIGN POLICY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, I'VE WORKED TO PUT THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM ON A FIRM LEGAL FOOTING. THAT'S WHY WE'VE ENDED TORTURE, WORKED TO CLOSE GITMO.
Stephen: HOLD ON A SECOND. YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SOME STUFF, BUT, "WORKED TO CLOSE GITMO?" DOES HISTORY GIVE PARTIAL CREDIT? SORRY, YOU DON'T GET A PRIZE FOR GOOD INTENTIONS. I MEAN, OTHER THAN THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER TO THE VERY LAST, HE URGED PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED.
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF ARGUING WITH STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET, TRY TALKING WITH ONE OF THEM IN REAL LIFE.
Stephen: YEAH! GET OFF THE INTERNET AND TALK TO EVERYONE IN REAL LIFE.
Jon: I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: TALK TO PEOPLE IN REAL-- TALK TO PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY WAY THE RUSSIANS CAN'T HEAR YOU. AND THAT WASN'T THE PRESIDENT'S ONLY CALL TO ACTION.
ALL OF US, REGARDLESS OF PARTY, SHOULD BE THROWING OURSELVES--
Stephen: OFF OF A CLIFF AND INTO THE OCEAN? YOU GOT IT, CHIEF! IT'S BEEN AN HONOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SORRY WAS-- I'M SORRY, WAS THERE MORE OF THAT.
--SHOULD BE THROWING OURSELVES INTO THE TASK OF REBUILDING OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.
Stephen: OOOO! THAT SOUND LIKE A LOT OF WORK. THAT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER. CAN'T I JUST RETWEET A PETITION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? OF COURSE, PRESIDENT OBAMA, TOTAL CROWD PLEASER, HAD TO NAME-DROP THE MOST POPULAR PERSON IN THE WORLD...
MICHELLE, YOU MADE THE WHITE HOUSE A PLACE THAT BELONGS TO EVERYBODY. AND A NEW GENERATION SETS ITS SIGHTS HIGHER BECAUSE IT HAS YOU AS A ROLE MODEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO YOU HAVE MADE ME PROUD AND YOU HAVE MADE THE COUNTRY PROUD. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO SAY TO MY WIFE, HONEY? WHAT HE SAID. I SHOULD'VE SAID IT FIRST. ALSO, I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN OUT THE RECYCLING THIS MORNING. JIMMY, CAN WE SEE THAT LAST MOMENT AGAIN. THIS YOU GO. HERE COME THE WATER WORKS... IS ANOTHER PHRASE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO HEAR IN THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION. ALLEGEDLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JUDE LAW IS HERE. STICK AROUND!
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW. WOW. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST IS AN ACADEMY AND TONY AWARD-NOMINATED ACTOR. HE NOW PLAYS THE YOUNG POPE IN HBO'S "THE YOUNG POPE."
THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE IS MY NEED FOR A CUP OF AMERICAN COFFEE. YOU CAN MAKE ME ONE, YOUR EMINENCE?
CERTAINLY.
I DIDN'T ASK HIM. I ASKED YOU.
IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE AND AN HONOR FOR ME TO BRING YOU COFFEE, YOUR HOLINESS.
THANK YOU, YOUR EMINENCE.

WOW!

THANK YOU.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THERE'S MY "HEY JUDE." DID YOU THINK THAT SONG WAS ABOUT YOU AS A CHILD?
STUPIDLY.
Stephen: DID YOU REALLY?
THANK GOODNESS I WAS NAMED AFTER A GREAT SONG. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING NAMED AFTER A REALLY BAD SONG?
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. NAMING YOUR CHILD "FREE BIRD." YOU'RE THE YOUNG POPE. SHOULD I KISS YOUR RING?
THAT MEANS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IN THE U.K.
Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN THE U.K.?
DON'T SAY THAT-- DON'T EVEN-- DON'T SAY THAT TO PEOPLE IN ENGLAND. THE RING, THE SORT OF HOLY RING OF THE REAR IS WHAT IT MEANS IN THE U.K.
Stephen: WHAT CHAWSER CALLED THE NE-EYE. YOU WERE HERE IN JUNE THIS PAST YEAR, AND WE HAD A LOVELY TIME TOGETHER. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SINCE THEN?
NOTHING.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU CAN EXPLAIN-- CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
WELL, NO, I HAD A WONDERFUL TRIP-- I LIVE IN LONDON. I HAD A TRIP BACK TO NEW YORK WITH MY FAMILY. AND WE HAD A GREAT PRE-CHRISTMAS-- IT WAS THE FIRST SNOWFALL. WE WERE THERE THAT WEEKEND, AND WE WENT ICE SKATING.
Stephen: NECESSARY CENTRAL PARK?
CENTRAL PARK. AND I ASSUMED-- I ICE SKATED WHEN I WAS 13, 14, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE RIDING A BIKE. I WAS QUITE GOOD THEN BECAUSE I WAS 13, 14. SOY TOOK THE KIDS AND I GOT OUT THERE. I WAS AWFUL.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW?
44.
Stephen: 44, SO 30 YEARS LATER YOU WENT, "YEAH, JUST STRAP ON THE ICE SKATES. IT WILL BE FINE. HOW HARD COULD IT BE?
I'LL TELL YOU HOW HARD THE FLOOR IS.
Stephen: YOU HAD ARTHROSCOPIC SURGERY ON YOUR ANKLE? IT'S A DARING CHOICE TO WEAR PANTS WITH THE CROTCH DOWN TO THE KNEE.
IT DIDN'T GIVE ME MAXIMUM MOVEMENT. IT WAS FUN. I'VE BEENITE SKATING AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING.
Stephen: SINCE JUNE. THAT'S NICE. YOU LIVE IN LONDON AND YOU'RE ONLY HERE FOR WORK.
I CAME FOR PLEASURE AND WORK. YEAH, I LOVE NEW YORK. I COME AS OFTEN AS I CAN.
Stephen: DID YOU ACTUALLY SHOOT "THE YOUNG POPE" ON LOCATION IN ROME?
I LIVED IN ROME FOR SEVEN MONTHS. WE FILMED IN AROUND THE VATICAN, NOT IN THE VATICAN.
Stephen: THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU?
NO, BUT THEY WERE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL.
Stephen: THEY MIGHT. YOU NEVER KNOW.
THEY OWN-- I HEARD A THIRD OF ROME. SO A LOT OF THE PALAWSUITOS, THE PRIVATE GARDENS WERE VATICAN OWNED. AND WE DID SOME WORK AT THE STUDIOS WHERE WE RECONSTRUCTED TO SCALE THE SISTINE CHAPEL AND THE PRIVATE OFFICES OF THE POPE.
Stephen: THE LAST PERSON TO DO THAT WAS MICHELANGELO. ABSOLUTELY TO SCALE. WHEN YOU GOT THE GIG, WAS IT LIKE, WHAT IS-- WHAT IS THE THING? "THE YOUNG POPE"? WHERE DOES IT SHOOT? ROME? I'M IN.
I DID.
Stephen: DID YOU REALLY?
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS THAT AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE WONDERFUL PAOLO SORRENTINO, OUR WRITER AND DIRECTOR WHO MOST OF YOU WOULD KNOW, HE DIRECTED THE ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING "GREAT BEAUTY." AND HE IS A MASTER. AND I JUMPED ON BOARD BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK WITH THIS GUY BECAUSE HE'S BRILLIANT.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK BUT WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE JUDE LAW. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE BACK HERE WITH JUDE LAW, WHO IS THE STAR OF HBO'S NEW SHOW "THE YOUNG POPE." LET'S TALK ABOUT THE YOUNG POPE HIMSELF. HOW OLD OF A POPE? IS HE YOUR AGE OF A POPE?
I THINK WE SET HIM AT AROUND 47, JUST A TOUCH OLDER.
Stephen: THAT'S YOUNG FOR A POPE.
IT IS.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE POPE AVERAGE?
GOSH, I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD GUESS 70-PLUS.
Stephen: YEAH.
SO HE'S YOUNG.
Stephen: POPE JOHN PAUL II WAS PRETTY YOUNG. HE WAS IN HIS 50s. THAT WAS CRAZY HE WAS SO YOUNG THERE.
HE'S THE YOUNGEST POST AND ALSO THE FIRST AMERICAN POPE. AND THE PIECE IS-- IT STARTS OFF WITH A CONCLAVE-- A CONCLAVE OF CARDINALS WHO VOTED HIM IN, TRYING TO WORK OUT WHO VOTED FOR HIM. NO ONE KNOWS HOW HE GOT THIS POSITION. ISN'T THAT INTERESTING? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IS THERE ANY CHANCE-- IS THERE ANY CHANCE THE RUSSIANS WERE BEHIND IT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
ALL THOSE RUSSIAN CARDINALS.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
AND THEN-- AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE LENNY BELARDO, THE POPE'S PEDESTRIAN NAME, WHO IS --
SO THE GUY'S NAME IS LENNY BELARDO.
LENNY BELARDO.
Stephen: WHAT POPE NAME IS IT HE TAKE?
PUS XIII. SO HE'S STEPPING INTO SOME HOT SHOES. FUNNY, TALKING ABOUT SHOES. OBVIOUSLY, THEY WEAR WHITE VESTIMENTS. AND THE ONE THING THEY GET TO CHOOSE BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS THE COLOR OF THEIR SHOES.
Stephen: BENEDICT XVI HAD BEAUTIFUL SHOES.
AND THE RED SHOES ON THE WHOLE HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE QUITE CONTROVERSIAL POPES. THEY GO IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM AT THE SISTINE CHAPEL KNOWN AS THE ROOM OF TEARS. THEY'VE JUST BEEN ELECTED AND THEY WEEP. THEY'RE GIVEN THE VESTAMENTS AND EVERYONE LOOKS TO SEE WHAT COLOR THE SHOES ARE. FRANCIS WEARS WHITE SHOES.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS, WHITE, BLACK, RED, STRAPPY. THIS IS KIND OF THE FUN PART OF IT IS THE PRESENT POPE, FRANCIS, VERY SIMPLE.
YES.
Stephen: GOT RID OF THE THRONE, WEARS VERY SIMPLE STUFF. GOT RID OF THE POPE MOBILE, DRIVES A CHEVETTE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HONEST TO GOD A USED--
THEY WERE THERE IN ROME, AND NO ONE KNEW WHERE HE WAS. HE LEFT THE VATICAN TO GET HIS GLASSES CHANGED AND BY ALL BELIEVES WAS HORRIFIED WHEN HE CAME OUT AND THERE WERE, LIKE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: HE WENT TO A LENS CRAFTERS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
YEAH.
Stephen: THIS IS ONE OF YOUR OUTFITS. THIS POPE IS VERY DIFFERENT. HE'S NOT AS HUMBLE. THIS IS ONE OF THE OUTFITS YOU'RE WEARING AS THE POPE. THAT IS FABULOUS! THAT IS AMAZING.
I UNDERSTAND NOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT AGE, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT POPES YOU KNOW WALKED LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE OLD. THEY'RE WALKING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT STUFF WEIGHS SO MUCH. IT'S LIKE WEARING SIX CARPETS ON TOP OF YOU AND THEN A BIG-- A BIG METAL MITER.
Stephen: THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
WONDERFUL OUTFIT S.
Stephen:  THESE ARE ACTUAL SORT OF POPE OUTFITS?
OH, YES, OH, YES.
Stephen: THESE ARE ACCURATE?
THE DETAIL, HISTORICALLY, BUT ALSO IN HOW THEY WERE HAND WOVEN AND WE HAD VATICAN EXPERTS WORKING ON IT WITH US. YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: BOY, HOW DO YOU TAILOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
I DON'T THAN THEY NIP AND TUCK IT PARTICULARLY. THEY JUST PUT IT ON AND SEW ON JEWELS. THAT'S ABOUT IT.
Stephen: I LIKE IT. IF I'M GOING TO HAVE A POPE, FOR MY BUCK I THROW IN THE COLLECTION PLATE, I WANT SOME--
THE THEATER OF THE CLALG CHURCH--
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT A CATHOLIC.
I'M NOT A CATHOLIC, NO.
Stephen: BUT THE CHALG CHURCH IS LIKE THEATER BECAUSE EVERY MASS IS LIKE, IT'S A PLAY THAT REPRODUCES THE LAST SUPPER. THE PRIEST IS CHRIST AND WE'RE THE DISCIPLES.
ABSOLUTELY. WITH GREAT COSTUME S.
Stephen:  ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. WE ALSO, "THE YOUNG POPE" HAS BECOME QUITE A HIT ON THE INTERNET OTWITTER, WITHOUT IT EVER BEING RELEASED. PEOPLE LOVE THE IDEA "THE YOUNG POPE" SO MUCH, THEY'VE MADE A MEME OF REPLACING LYRICS TO SONGS WITH THE STORY "THE YOUNG POPE." HERE'S ONE I'M TALKING ABOUT. HERE'S ONE: HERE'S ONE: ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I LOVE THIS. I LOVE THIS. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I ONLY LEARNED WHAT A MEME-- IS IT MEME?
Stephen: MEME, M-E-M-E.
I OWNER LEARNED WHAT A MEME WAS YESTERDAY BUT I'M THRILLED.
Stephen: YOU NOT BEING A CATHOLIC, DID YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHUMP OR THE POEM HIMSELF OR-- I'M THE POPE OF TELEVISION. I AM THE MOST CATHOLIC HOST ON TELEVISION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU HAVE-- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAPACY THAT I COULD INFORM YOU, ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER YOU MIGHT NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?
I STARTED-- I'LL BE HONEST. THAT WAS THE FIRST PORT OF CALL. I THOUGHT I HAVE TO LEARN-- I'M PLAYING THE POPE. I HAVE TO READ THE BIBLE. I HAVE TO LEARN-- AND I STARTED AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, IT DIDN'T-- IT DIDN'T PARTICULARLY HELP ME. SO I CALLED THE DIRECTOR AND I WAS GOING, "OKAY, WHAT'S THE ANGLE? HOW AM I GOING TO FIND THIS CHARACTER?" AND HE-- HE-- AS ANY GREAT WRITER SHOULD, HE SAID, "JUST STICK TO THE SCRIPT. STICK TO THE CHARACTER."
Stephen: AND, YOU KNOW, LET THE CAPE DO A LOT OF WORK.
LET THE COSTUME DO ALL THE WORK.
Stephen: JEWELED, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

Stephen: NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CLAIM THAT YOU'RE FROM THE LARGEST AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY IN NEBRASKA.
WE ARE. AS FOR THE LATEST CENSUS DATA. WE ARE THE LARGEST BLACK FAMILY IN THE STATE OF NEBRASKA.
Stephen: AS PER THE LATEST CENSUS DATA, ARE THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY IN NEBRASKA? BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN NEBRASKA, THERE AREN'T A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES.
NOT A LOT OF COMPETITION S.
Stephen:  HOW BIG ARE WE TALKING HERE?
THOUSANDS, THOUSANDS.
Stephen: THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR FAMILY.
THOUSANDS.
Stephen: THERE ARE 88,000 AFRICAN AMERICANS IN NEBRASKA AND THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE YOUR FAMILY.
AND THEY'RE ALL A MATCH FOR MY KIDNEY. SO IT GLORKZ BE NICE TO THOSE PEOPLE. HOW LONG HAS YOUR FAMILY BEEN IN NEBRASKA?
GOSH, SINCE RECONSTRUCTION. IT'S SHOCKING, I KNOW.
Stephen: I'M FROM 11 CHILDREN. I DON'T HAVE THOUSANDS OF RELATIVES. YOUR SECRET SANTA MUST BE CRAZY. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU--
WE GIVE THE GIFT OF JOY. WE DON'T GIVE GIFTS ANYMORE.
Stephen: DO YOU ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE RELATED TO EACH OTHER?

Stephen: SO DATING MUST BE A REAL HAZARD.
IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY. IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY.
Stephen: THAT MUST BE TOUGH.

IT WAS SO WORTH IT.
Stephen: DID YOU LIKE THE SPEECH?
I LOVED THE SPEECH. I CRIED THROUGH MOST OF IT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
Stephen: THAT MICHELLE MOMENT WAS NICE. THAT MISHOAL MOMENT WAS LIKE YOU REALLY KIND OF SCREWED IT FOR THE REST OF THE HUSBANDED OUT THERE.
I WAS LOOKING AT DWAYNE SAYING REALLY, REALLY, YOU DON'T GIVE MY FULL GOVERNMENT NAME WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT ME. I JUST-- I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S THE LAST TIME WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT KIND OF INTELLIGENCE AND GRACE, BUT OH!
Stephen: HE'S UNIQUE. I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE HIS LIKE AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS, THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU WAS AT THE BAR AT THE WHITE HOUSE DURING POTUS' BIRTHDAY.
Stephen: YOU AND I WERE BOTH THERE. HOLD ON. BANG! SPEAKING OF BAR, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WINE.
YES, I DO.
Stephen: THAT WAS A FUN PARTY.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: THAT WAS A REALLY FUN PARTY. YOU DON'T SEE THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, POPPING AND LOCKING AT EVERY PARTY.
HE'S NOT EXAGGERATING. THERE WAS POPPING-- HE WAS ELECTRIC BUGLY, HE WAS BOOGOLO SLUMP.
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR WINE CALLED VANILLA PUDDING.
IT'S GOT HINT OF VANILLA.
Stephen: MMM! YOU COULD FROST A CAKE WITH THAT. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.
THANKS.
Stephen: IN THE SHOW YOU PLAY-- NOW YOU'RE PLAYING A-- YOU'RE A MORNING NEWS REPORTER, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY AN ANCHOR, BUT YOU'RE THE GIRL WHO STANDS OUT IN THE COLD.
YES. I RECENTLY GOT FIRED FROM MY HOSTING GIG ON A CABLE SHOW.

Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE OLD HOME WEEK, HAVEN'T TALKED IN A LONG TIME, MR. "WORLD IS FLAT," MR. "GLOBALIZATION." LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION BEFORE WE GET ON TO YOUR BOOK HERE. THE IDEA THAT RUSSIA HAS USED CYBER WARFARE TO INTERVEER WITH OUR ELECTION OVER HERE AND THE RUMORS THAT HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED, EVEN BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THAT DONALD TRUMP MIGHT BE UNDER THE THUMB OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. DO YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THAT IN ANY WAY, THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, WHAT STRUCK ME, STEPHEN, LISTENING TO YOUR OPENING, TRUMP MIGHT BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO HAS TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM DEALING WITH THE WHOLE COUNTRY. YOU REALLY DO WONDER HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT AT THEIR FIRST MEETING. AND THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IS SO WEIRD IN THE SENSE THAT THIS ALL STARTED, STEPHEN, WITH PUTIN THINKING HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN, AND HE HATED HILLARY, SO TO TWEAK HER, HE PRAISED TRUMP, AND TRUMP CAME BACK AND SAID, "THAT GUY LIKES ME. I THINK HE'S OKAY, TOO. HE'S A STRONG LEADER. I'D BE A STRONG LEADER, TOO, IF I ELIMINATED ALL MY OPPONENTS WITH POISON-TIPPED EXWRAELS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YOU CAN BE STRONG. AND THE THING HAS SORT OF CASCADED NOW TO THE POINT WHERE YOU REALLY WONDER, TRUMP SAID HE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH RUSSIA. I'M ALL FOR WORKING WITH RUSSIA. THEY HAVE A LOT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE'LL WORK TOGETHER TO FIGHT ISIS AND SYRIA. RUSSIA'S ALLIES FIGHTING ISIS IN SYRIA ARE HEZBOLLAH, IRAN, AND JIHADISTS FROM CENTRAL ASIA. ARE WE GOING TO BE ALLIES WITH THEM? AND IT'S WHY, STEPHEN, WHEN I LISTEN TO HIM, YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO SECOND PARAGRAPH. THERE'S ALWAYS JUST THE FIRST PARAGRAPH. BUT HE HASN'T THOUGHT AROUND THE CORNER, YOU KNOW ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ).
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY? WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY? BECAUSE ISN'T IT THE PRESS' JOB TO GET TO THAT SECOND PARAGRAPH, TO SAY OKAY WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID? HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT IT WITH ANY ACTION OR ANY PLAN? I HEARD A LOT OF FIRST PARAGRAPHS BUT NO PLANS BEYOND ANYTHING. HE WAS ASKED HOW DO YOU REPLACE OBAMACARE? "IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT."
"WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE LINES" I THINK I RECALL, BETWEEN THE STATES. THIS IS WHAT I WORRIED ABOUT HIM FROM THE VERY DPING BECAUSE ALL WE'VE HEARD FROM HIM NOW-- TRUMP TWEET EXPAWLG OF THIEVES THINGS-- IT HAS ONE CHARACTER BEFORE YOU'RE PRESIDENT, BUT BEGINNING ON JANUARY 20, THAT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TWEETING, TWEETING AT NORTH KOREA, TWEETING ABOUT RUSSIA, TWEETING ABOUT PUTIN. AND THAT HAS WHOLLY DIFFERENT IMPLICATION S.
Stephen:  DO YOU IMAGINE THAT WILL CHANGE?
BOY, I HOPE SO. I MEAN --
DO YOU WANT TO LAY A BET?
OH!
Stephen: NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER THINGS TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT, OR TO BE HAPPY ABOUT-- I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE YET. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "THANK YOU FOR BEING LATE:AN OPTIMIST'S GUIDE FOR THRIVING IN THE AGE OF ACCELERATION." FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THE AGE OF ACCELERATION? ARE WE IN IT RIGHT NOW?
THE BOOK ARGUE WIERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THREE EXPONENTIAL ACCELERATIONS, THE MARKET, MOTHER NATURE, AND MOORE'S LAW. MOTHER NATURE, CLIMATE CHANGE, IF YOU FUT ON A GRAPH, IT LOOKS LIKE A HOCKEY STICK. THE MARKET FOR ME IS DIGITAL GLOBALIZATION. EVERYTHING IS BEING DIGITALIZED, FACEBOOK, TWITTER, PAYPAL.
Stephen: THE INTERNET OF THINGS.
ALL OF THAT. AND MOORE'S LAW, COINED BY GORDON MOORE, SAID THE SPEED IN POWER MICROCHIPS WILL DOUBLE IN ROUGHLY 24 MONTHS. IT'S NOW ABOUT 30, BUT IT'S KEPT UP. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE THREE ACCELERATIONS. I TELL THE STORY OF INTEL TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE POWER OF ACCELERATION IN TECHNOLOGY. THEY TOOK THE 1971 W.V. BEATLE AND SAID WHAT IN THIS CAR IMPROVED AT THE SAME RATE MICROCHIPS HAVE OVER THE LAST 52 YEARS. THEY DETERMINED THAT CAR WOULD GO 300,000 MILES AN HOUR. IT WOULD GET TWO MILLION MILES A GALLON AND COST FOUR CENT. SO THAT'S THE POWER OF THE EXPONENTIAL THAT'S REALLY DRIVING ALL THE TECHNOLOGY FORWARD.
Stephen: HOW DO WE SURVIVE IN IT, THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN.
WHAT I REALLY ARGUE FOR IN THE BOOK AND THE REASON THE BOOK NENDZ MINNESOTA, WHERE I GREW UP, IS FINDING A WAY TO ANCHOR YOURSELF IN THE WORLD. THE BOOK ACTUALLY, STEPHEN, IS THE CELEBRATION OF EVERYTHING OLD AND SLOW. IT ARGUES --
LIKE CROCK POTS, SLOW COOKING?
A LITTLE BIT. IT REALLY ARGUES THAT I THINK EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS TODAY IS ACTUALLY ALL THE STUFF YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD. IT'S THE STUFF YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, ONE HUMAN BEING TO HONOR.  ( APPLAUSE ) ONE OF MY FAVORITE --
LIKE WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING, GET OFF THE INTERNET AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY.
LISTENING TO THAT REMINDED ME I HAVE A QUOTE IN THE BOOK FROM OUR SURGEON GENERAL, AN AMAZING GUY. AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS THE MOST PREVALENT DISEASE IN AMERICA, CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE? HE SAID IT'S NONE OF THOSE. IT'S ACTUALLY ISOLATION. WE'RE IN THE MOST CONNECTED AGE IN HISTORY AND THE SURGEON GENERAL SAYS THE THING THAT IS REALLY AILING SO MANY PEOPLE IS THE SENSE OF BEING DISCONNECTED. AND THE BOOK REALLY-- THE BOOK HAS A KIND OF THEME SONG. I'M A BIG FAN OF BRANDY CARLISLE. AND THE SONG IS CALLED "THE EYE." I WRAP MY LOVE AROUND THE FRAME, YOU CAN DANCE IN A HURRICANE, BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE STANDING IN THE EYE." I THINK TRUMP IS SELLING A WALL TO THE HURRICANE, AND I'M ARGUING FOR AN EYE, THAT'S THE HEALTHY COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE ANCHORED IN THE WORLD, FEEL CONNECTED, PROTECTED, AND RESPECTED AND I THINK POLITICS HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS GOING TO BE REALLY A BATTLE BETWEEN THE WALL PEOPLE AND THE EYE PEOPLE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: GOOD LUCK, GOOD LUCK. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. THE BOOK IS "THANK YOU FOR BEING LATE." THE MAN IS THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE TOM SELLECK, CRAIG ROBINSON, AND MUSICAL GUEST ASAP MOB. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, KHLOE KARDASHIAN PHARRELL WILLIAMS, AND CAMERON DALLAS. GOOD  Captioning sponsored by CBS
