Stephen: HI. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. DONALD TRUMP RECENTLY SAID THAT INSTALLING GENDER-NEUTRAL BATHROOMS WOULD COST "HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS." I BROUGHT MY ACCOUNTANT ALONG TO SEE IF HE'S CORRECT. ARE YOU READY TO CHECK HIS NUMBERS?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: OKAY. HOW MUCH DID THAT COST?
$200 BILLION.
Stephen: DAMN IT!
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JAMES MCAVOY NICK SWARDSON AND BRIAN GREENE FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! HEY! GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. DOWN HERE, UP THERE, EVERYWHERE. THAT'S NICE. ( APPLAUSE ) THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. I HAVE TO GET TO THIS QUICKLY BECAUSE WE FOUND OUT JUST BEFORE TAPING THE SHOW TONIGHT-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT TO LAUNCH A SECRET PLAN TO ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON OVER THE WHITEWATER SCANDAL FROM THE 90s. AND WE KNOW HE'S GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY ACCIDENTALLY E-MAILED THE SECRET PLAN TO A REPORTER. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH MEANS THAT, SHOCKINGLY, HILLARY CLINTON MIGHT BE THE CANDIDATE WITH THE SECOND WORST USING OF E-MAIL. SPEAKING OF WHICH, THIS MORNING, THE STATE DEPARTMENT FINALLY RELEASED THEIR REPORT ON HER USE OF A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. THEY FOUND THAT SHE DID NOT ASK PERMISSION, AND IF SHE HAD, THE ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN NO. WHICH IS ONE OF THE TOP REASONS TO NOT ASK PERMISSION, BY THE WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE THING, HERE'S THE THING. AND EVEN WHEN YOU DO GIVE HILLARY CLINTON A CLEAR NO, WHAT SHE HEARS IS, "TRY AGAIN IN EIGHT YEARS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. THE REPORT DID NOT STATE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ILLEGAL, BUT IT CRITICIZES THE LAST FIVE SECRETARIES OF STATE FOR DOING THE SAME THING. HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS CORRUPT, YOU JUST HAD ALL OF YOUR SUSPICIONS VALIDATED. AND IF YOU THOUGHT THIS WHOLE THING WAS NO BIG DEAL, YOU JUST HAD ALL OF YOUR SUSPICIONS VALIDATED. SO PROBLEM, SAIMED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SPEAKING OF LEADERS OF THE FREE WORLD, THERE IS NOW AN ONLINE CAMPAIGN TO #GIVECAPTAINAMERICA A BOYFRIEND, WHICH WOULD BE GREAT. THEN WE COULD LOOK FORWARD TO "CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL UNION." FANS HAVE EVEN PICKED OUT THE LUCKY FELLA: CAP'S OLD PAL/MORTAL ENEMY BUCKY BARNES, A.K.A. THE WINTER SOLDIER. THEY CLAIM BECAUSE CAP KEEPS SACRIFICING OTHER RELATIONSHIPS TO SAVE BUCKY, THAT PROVES THOSE GUYS ARE HOT FOR EACH OTHER. FIRST OF ALL, CAN'T GUYS JUST BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER WITHOUT IT BEING ABOUT SEX? I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS I HAVEN'T HAD SEX WITH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SECOND, HAVE THESE FANS CONSIDERED THAT MAYBE CAPTAIN AMERICA IS ALREADY SEEING SOMEONE? MAYBE IT'S SOMEONE HE FEELS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THAT HE CAN LEAVE HIS SHIELD AT THEIR PLACE. YOU KNOW, IDENTIFY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'VE SAID TOO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF MOVIES, WE'RE, EVIDENTLY, GOING TO NEED A NEW JAMES WOND BECAUSE DANIEL CRAIG IS OFFICIALLY OUT. IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE TO REPLACE HIM. BEFORE THEY GET THEIR 007 LICENSE TO KILL, THEY HAVE TO SPEND SIX MONTHS WITH A LEARNER'S PERMIT TO KILL. THEN YOU CAN ONLY KILL WHEN YOU'RE ACCOMPANIED BY A LICENSED KILLER OR YOUR PARENTS. AND YOU CAN'T KILL AFTER 11:00 AT NIGHT. IT'S A LONG PROCESS. NOT AS LONG AS THAT JOKE TOOK, BUT STILL A VERY LONG PROCESS. AND THERE ARE SOME VERY INTERESTING CANDIDATES UP FOR THE JOB BECAUSE ACTRESSES PRIYANKA CHOPRA AND GILLIAN ANDERSON HAVE BOTH COME FORWARD SAYING THEY THINK THERE SHOULD BE A FEMALE JAMES BOND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO! WHOOO! I AGREE. WITH WHATEVER WHOOO MEANS, I AGREE. THEY'RE NOT ALONE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BELIEVE WE'RE LONG OVERDUE FOR A FEMALE BOND, SO IT'LL PROBABLY END UP BEING DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAD A JANE BOND, OKAY. AND SHE'S BEDDING SOME BOND BOYS. FOR YEARS, WE'VE HAD BOND GIRLS WITH SEXY NAMES LIKE HOLLY GOODHEAD, PLENTY O'TOOLE, AND PUSSY GALORE. AND I HAVE BEEN INFORMED IF THOSE WERE NOT CHARACTER NAMES I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THEM ON CBS. BUT THEY ARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY ARE. SO I HOPE WE DO HAVE A FEMALE BOND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A NEW GENERATION OF SEXY BOND BOYS OUT TO SEDUCE THE FEMALE 007. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HELLO, MS. BOND. MY NAME? ROD HARDMORE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DOSVEDANYA, I AM DIMITRI G'SPOTOVICH. HOWDY. MS. BOND, I'M KENNY. KENNY LINGUS. NICE TO MEET YOU, MS. BOND. I'M COMMITMENT GALORE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO ME? I'M ALEXANDER MOMMYISSUES. WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MISBOND? HEY, YOU KNOW WHO WOULD MAKE A GREAT BOND? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW WHO WOULD MAKE A GREAT JAMES BOND? JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: HEY! ( APPLAUSE ) I WATCH SO MANY VIDEOS ONLINE THESE DAYS THEY HAVE ALMOST LOST THE ABILITY TO READ. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING GOOD. YOU CAN ALWAYS CLICK ON SOMETHING ELSE OR SOMEBODY SENDS YOU SOMETHING, AND IT HAPPENED TODAY. BECAUSE TODAY I AM LOVING A VIRAL VIDEO I SAW ABOUT A HAIRY, LOVABLE MONSTER. NO, NOT THE LAUGHING CHEWBACCA MOM. REMEMBER, FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DRIVE CHEWBACCA. NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT A NEW AD FOR THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION, FEATURING COUNTRY MUSIC LEGEND CHARLIE DANIELS. NOW, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER CHARLIE DANIELS, HE'S KIND OF LIKE WILFORD BRIMLEY WITH MORE... JUST MORE. ( LAUGHTER ) LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER WILFORD BRIMLEY, YOU ARE OUR TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC. CAN I INTRODUCE YOU IN A FRUIT-FLAVORED DIET LAGER. ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE VIDEO, TAKE A LOOK.
TO THE AYATOLLAHS OF IRAN AND EVERY TERRORIST YOU ENABLE. LISTEN UP. YOU MIGHT HAVE MET OUR FRESH-FACED FLOWER CHILD PRESIDENT AND HIS WEAK-KNEED, IVY LEAGUE FRIENDS, BUT YOU HAVEN'T MET AMERICA. YOU HAVEN'T MET THE HEARTLAND, OR THE PEOPLE WHO WILL DEFEND THIS NATION WITH THEIR BLOODY, CALLOUSED, BARE HANDS, IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. YOU HAVEN'T MET THE STEELWORKERS AND THE HARDROCK MINERS, OR THE SWAMP FOLKS IN CAJUN COUNTRY WHO CAN WRESTLE A FULL-GROWN GATOR OUT OF THE WATER. NO, YOU'VE NEVER MET AMERICA. AND YOU OUGHT TO PRAY YOU NEVER DO. I AM THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, AND I'M FREEDOM'S SAFEST PLACE.
Stephen: NOW, I'M NOT SURE-- PRETTY EXCITING. NOW, NOT SURE WHY CHARLIE APPEARED IN THIS AD. I ASSUME IT'S BECAUSE HE LOST A FIDDLE CONTEST WITH AN AD EXECUTIVE. I HAVE TO SAY, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE THREATEN THE AYATOLLAHS IN A LONG TIME. IT REALLY BRINGS ME BACK. NEXT HE WILL BE GOING AFTER NEW COKE AND TEDDY RUXPIN. THE ODD THING ABOUT THE AD IS THAT AYATOLLAHS ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET THE REAL AMERICANS HE'S TALKING ABOUT, BECAUSE ALL THE REAL AMERICANS CHARLIE LISTS-- THE STEELWORKERS, THE HARD ROCK MINERS, THE SWAMP FOLKS-- THOSE ARE ALL REALITY SHOWS. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, HE'S SETTING A VERY HIGH BAR. CHARLIE, YOU HAVE GOT TO EASE UP ON THE REST OF US. NOT EVERYONE CAN HAVE A TOUGH, MANLY JOB, LIKE PLAYING THE VIOLIN. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS JUST THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF ADS CHARLIE'S DOING FOR THE N.R.A., AND WE HERE AT "THE LATE SHOW" WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET AN ADVANCE COPY OF THE NEXT ONE.
I WANT TO A SOMETHING TO THE AYATOLLAHS, THE YASSER ARAFATS, THE IDI AMINES, RUSSIAN CZARS AND THE GREAT WHITE SHARKS. YOUR TIME IS OVER. SHUT YOUR PIE HOLES AND LISTEN UP. YOU MIGHT HAVE MET OUR TIE-DYED HIPPIE-DIPPY GRANOELY CHOMPING ARTIE-FARTSY, PRESIDENT, AND WINE-SIPIN, NBR-BAG TOTEN CIRCLE OF WIMPO-CRATES. BUT YOU AIN'T MET AMERICA BECAUSE YOU WOULD REMEMBER IF YOU MET HER. SHE'S HOT. I'M TALKING BEER POSTER HOT. LADY LIBERTY'S GOT A BUTT YOU CAN BOUNCE A QUARTER OFF AND GET TWO DIMES AND A SHEKEL, OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU USE OVER IN IRANIA. YOU HAVEN'T MET OUR AMERICAN PICKERS, ICE ROAD TRUCKERS, THE SWAM LOGGERS, THE POND STARS AND CUPCAKE WARRIORS. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU HAVEN'T MET THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY BECAUSE THOSE BITCHES WOULD SCRATCH YOUR EYES OUT. NO, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN FORMALLY INTRODUCED TO THE U.S. OF A, AND YOU OUGHT TO PRAY YOU NEVER DO. I AM THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, AND FREEDOM'S SAFE WORD IS PUMPKIN PATCH. ( LAUGHTER ) BOY, WE LIKE IT ROUGH
Stephen: DAMN, CHARLIE LOOKS GOOD. WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING, SIR, KEEP DOING IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JAMES McVOY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST IS AN ACCLAIMED ACTOR KNOWN FOR HIS ROLES IN "ATONEMENT," "THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND," AND "WANTED." THIS FRIDAY, HE RETURNS AS PROFESSOR XAVIER IN "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE."
I MEAN TO TURN IT INTO A REAL CAMPUS, UNIVERSITY, NOT JUST FOR MUTANTS, EITHER. FOR HUMANS, TOO, LIVING AND WORKING. GROWTH TOGETHER.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY BELIEVED THAT ONCE. I REALLY BELIEVED WE COULD CHANGE THEM.
WE DID.
JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A WAR DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S PEACE. YOU WANT TO TEACH YOUR KIDS SOMETHING, TEACH THEM THAT. TEACH THEM TO FIGHT. OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT AS WELL LIVE IN THIS HOUSE FOR THE REST OF THIF LIVES.
I STILL SOUND LIKE HIM. YOU SOUND JUST LIKE ERIC.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. HE'S RESURFACED.
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE LOOKING FOR HIM.
YOU CAN HELP ME FIND HIM BEFORE THEY DO.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JAMES McAVOY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO!
Stephen: HELLO.
HELLO! THIS IS LOVELY.
Stephen: ISN'T THIS PRETTY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S NICE TO BE IN A REAL THEATER, ISN'T IT?
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO BE IN A REAL THEATER. I FEEL AT HOME.
Stephen: YOU SAY YOU FEEL AT HEME IN A THEATER.
YES.
Stephen: YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF STAGE WORK, HAVEN'T YOU?
I HAVE DONE A LOT OF STAGE WORK. I HAVE DONE MACBETH. ARE WE ALLOWED TO SAY IT? YES WE ARE, ONE, TWO, THREE.
MACBETH!
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. I DID MACBETH AND QUITE OFTEN WORK WITH THE SAME GUY, JAILY LLOYD, A DIRECTOR, WHO IS WONDERFUL. I'M JURY LUCKY.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF THE SCOTTISH PLAY, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND BUT WHEN I MET YOU BACKSTAGE I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THE FACT I KNOW YOU FROM, LIKE, "ATONEMENT," AND OBVIOUSLY AS PROFESSOR XAVIER. I THINK OF YOU AS ENGLISH.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL ENGLISHMAN. BUT-- I HELP THEM OUT WHEN THEY'RE BUSY, BUT IN MY SPARE TIME, I'M SCOTTISH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT PEOPLE THINK OF YOU AS ENGLISH INSTEAD OF SCOTTISH? HOW SCOTTISH ARE YOU?
I'M THE REAL DEAL, THE FULL SQUARE SAUSAGE.
Stephen: I'M SORRY.
ANYBODY SCOTTISH? DO YOU KNOW WHAT SQUARE SCOTTISH IS? IT'S NOT A EUPHEMISM FOR A KIND OF BIG, SEXUAL THING.
Stephen: THE SQUARE SAUSAGE?
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T PUT A SQUARE THING NAY ROUND HOLE-- NO. YEAH, NO, A SQUARE SAUSAGE IS A BEEF PATTY THAT WE TRADITIONALLY HAVE AS A BREAKFAST SAUSAGE, AND PEOPLE FROM SCOTLAND ARE WILD ABOUT IT. PEOPLE FROM ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD ARE WILDLY RUNNING AWAY FROM IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: SO WHY WHEREIN SCOTLAND ARE YOU FROM?
I'M FROM GLASGOW, WHICH IS ON THE WEST SIDE.
Stephen: PEOPLE FROM LIVERPOOL ARE LIVERPUD LIANNES. WHAT ARE PEOPLE FROM GLASGOW CALLED?
WE'RE GLASSWEEJIANS. OTHER PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND CALL US OUIJAS, BUT WE NEVER CALL OURS THAT. WE'RE GLASSWEEJIAN.
Stephen: DID YOU GROW UP IN A WORKING CLASS FAMILY GEE, DI. I GREW UP IN A COUNCIL OF STATE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT CALLED?
I THINK YOU GUYS CALL A PROJECT.
Stephen: OH, A HOUSING PROJECT.
WE CALL IT COUNCIL OF STATE. THERE WAS AN AREA CALLED THE GARBLES AND IT WAS SLUMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT PARCH THE WAR, THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THEY BUILT NEW PLACES, KIND OF MORE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN AND THEY MOVED EVERYBODY OUT THERE TO THERE. IT WAS QUITE A BIG STATE.
Stephen: YOU WERE OFTEN KNOWN FOR PLAYING WELL-- NOT JUST ENGLISH CHARACTERS BUT SORT OF POSH ENGLISH CHARACTERS. DO YOUR FRIENDS BACK FROM THE COUNCIL OF STATES THINK YOU'RE TOO BIG FOR YOUR BRITCHES OR ARE THEY HAPPY ABOUT IT?
MY FRIENDS FROM WHERE I USED TO RUN ABOUT AND GO TO SCHOOL, EVEN WHEN I'M IN MY OWN SCOTTISH ACCENT THINK I HAVE BECOME CREDIBLE POSH, I THINK. I'VE BEEN IN LONDON FOR 16 YEARS NOW AND YOU KNOW YOUR ACCENT CHANGES. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I GOT FED UP WITH PEOPLE GOING,"WHAT'S HE SAYING? IS HE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT SQUARE SAUSAGE? I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING."
Stephen: IS THAT THE-- IS THAT THE THE LONDON ACCENT?
THAT'S THE LONDON ACCENT.
Stephen: HEY, Y'ALL, WE'RE FROM LONDON.
SOME FISH AND CHIPS. AND SO I GOT TIRED OF THAT, AND YOU JUST-- YOU JUST MOLD-- YOU JUST MELD AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF MORE UNDERSTANDABLE TO PEOPLE SLOWLY OVER TIME.
Stephen: YOU CAN EXPLAIN SOMETHING I HAVE READ ABOUT IN ENGLISH ACTING RIGHT NOW, NOT A CONTROVERSY BUT AN ISSUE CALLED THE CLASS CEILING?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. THERE'S A LOT OF --
DID YOU SAW UCK?
I DID.
Stephen: THAT'S THE MOST SCOTTISH EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.
REALLY.
Stephen: YEAH.
YOU SHOULD COME BACK WITH ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU ALL THE LEPRECHAUNS AS WELL. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK-- THIS THING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF, OR PROPORTION OF ACTORS IN OUR INDUSTRY COMING OUT OF GREAT BRITAIN WHO HAPPEN TO BE FROM VERY SPECIFICALLY PRIVATE, EXPENSIVE SCHOOLS, LIKE YOUR HARROWS, LIKE YOUR EATONS WHERE THEY SIT KIDS DOWN AT THE AGE OF SEVEN AND SAY, "ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER." I HAVE NO PROBLEM ABOUT THAT. SOME OF THOSE ACTORS ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. AND I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF ALL THE ACT ROARS POSH GUYS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN IF ALL THE ORS ARE POSH ACTOR ACTORS IT'S A SYMPTOM OF SOMETHING WRONG IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T ALLOWING STATE PEOPLES, PEOPLES THAT GO TO NORMAL SCHOOL, AND NOT THE EXPENSIVE SCHOOLS TO HAVE ACCESS TO ART AND EDUCATIONAL ART. AND I DON'T REALLY CARE IF YOU BECOME AN ACT ON, BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE CHILDREN ARTISTICALLY, BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THING THAT I THINK INCREASES THE CHANCE OF SOCIAL MOBILITY AND STOMS YOU FROM JUST STICKING WHERE YOU ARE. AND I TRULY BELIEVE IF YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN YOU'VE GOT, A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DO IT IS TO EXPOSE THEM TO THE ART BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM SEE BEYOND THEIR LIMITATIONS AND THEIR NEW HORIZONS EVEN IF THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY LEAVE THE TOWN WHERE THEY WERE BORN. I THINK IT'S A SYSTEM OF CONTROL TO KEEP PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE TO CUT FUNDING OF THE ARTS AND EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY. BUT POSH ACTORS, I DON'T CARE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY ENGLISH OCIALGY, DOESN'T IT? POSH ACTORS COMING UP ON THE OF EVERY HOME.
Stephen: MORE ON THE POSH ACTORS COMING OUT OF EVERY HOLE, WITH JAMES McAVOY, WHEN WE COME RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH JAMES McAVOY. JAMES IS HERE BECAUSE OF "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE" WHICH IS COMING OUT ON FRIDAY. I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. I LOVED IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
COULD I FIX MY TIE IN YOUR CAMERA.
Stephen: GO AHEAD. YOU LOOK VERY NICE.
THANKS VERY MUCH. I'M REPRESENTING.
Stephen: YOU LOOK VERY POSH.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I'VE INTERVIEWED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE FROM THESE MUTANT MOVIES, AND I TRULY ENJOY THESE MOVIES AND VERY GOOD ACTORS LIKE YOURSELF, BUT IF SOMEONE HAS BEEN TRAINED IN METHOD ACTING, HOW DO YOU CONNECT TO A TRUTH OF A CHARACTER WHO IS A SUPER HUMAN MUTANT? LIKE WHAT, DO YOU POSSIBLY HAVE IN COMMON WITH, LIKE PROFESSOR XAVIER?
I LOOK A LOT LIKE HIM.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. Y SAW THE MOVIE. YOU DO LOOK A LOT LIKE THAT GUY.
I DO. NO, WELL, I CAN READ MINDS AS WELL.
Stephen: REALLY?
I CAN READ MINDS.
REALLY, THAT'S CRAZY BECAUSE I CAN READ MINES, TOO, HOW DID YOU--
OH...
Stephen: REALLY? THAT'S CRAZY, BECAUSE I ALS

Stephen: I DO IT TWO FUNGER. I DO TWO FINGER. AUDIENCE PREPARE YOUR MINDS TO BE PROBED. IT WAS IN THE DISCLAIMER YOU SIGNED BEFORE YOU CAME IN HERE. AND BEGIN.
YEAH, NO, I THINK I'M PICKING SOMETHING UP. OOOH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THERE HE IS. OH, HE'S FINGERING HIMSELF, TOO. HE'S THINKING, HE'S THINKING. "LAST NIGHT I HAD ANOTHER SEX DREAM ABOUT FLO, THE PROGRESSIVE LADY, AND I WONDER IF SHE HAD THE SAME DREAM ABOUT ME?
Stephen: I PICK UP THAT THOUGHT ALL TIME FROM PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHAT DOES IT FOR ME? THAT GEICO DPEKO. KIND OF SEXING. I'M PICKING UP SOMEONE'S BRAIN THOUGHT. SHE'S THINK AGO HE'S THINKING. SORRY, THE HAIR THREW ME. HE'S THINKING, "I AM BECKY WITH THE GOOD HAIR." YOU GOT ANOTHER?
YEAH, YEAH, ONE'S COMING IN HERE. THIS ONE'S THINKING, "IF WE BECAME TRAPPED IN THIS THEATER, I WONDER WHO I'D EAT FIRST." YEAH. "PROBABLY THAT GUY." THAT MEANS HE'S GOT GOOD PROTEIN COB TENT.
Stephen: GOOD MARBLING. HERE'S ANOTHER, A VERY STRONG SIGNAL. I'M HEARING SOMEONE THINK, ," I HAVE THE BEATLES SONG 'HEY JUDE' STUCK IN MY HEAD, BUT IF I THINK ABOUT THE TUNE, IT WILL PROBABLY COST THE SHOW A LOT OF MONEY." I'M SO GLAD SHE DIDN'T THINK OF IT. YOU CAN'T DO MORE THAN THREE NOTES OF THAT SONG.
AFTER YOU SPENT MONEY GETTING ME ON THE SHOW, YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT. HONESTLY, TENS DOLLARS TO GET ME ON THIS. OH, SUGAR ALLEY! EAVE GOT A STRONG ONE.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU SAY, SUGAR ALLEY?
SUGAR ALLEY.
Stephen: SUGAR ALLEY? AGAIN, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PORN MOVIE. SUGAR ALLEY. WHAT'S SUGAR ALLEY THINKING?
SUGAR ALLEY IS THINKING, "HOW COME ONLY HUMANS TURN INTO GHOSTS? I'D LOVE TO SEE A GHOST GIRAFFE."
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS SPOOKY. THAT'S SPOOKY. I'M GOING TO SWITCH MY FINGERING. I HAVE A FRESH ONE.
YOU SHOULD WRAP UP NEXT TIME YOU SWITCH FINGERS. EVERY TIME YOU SWITCH FINGERS, WE SHOULD BE SAFE.
Stephen: DOUBLE BAG IT? OKAY. THIS ONE'S THINKING, "I'M GOING TO NAME MY NEW BABY STAR WARS. THAT WAY WHEN I ASK PEOPLE, "HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE THE NEW STAR WARS" THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT MY BABY.
WAIT, WAIT.
Stephen: WAIT, WAIT.
I'M GETTING A SIGNAL. SHE'S-- OH, HERE WE GO. WHAT IS SHE? COME ON NOW, COME ON NOW. COME TO ME. THERE YOU ARE. OH, THAT'S NAUGHTY. NO, SHE'S THINKING-- NO, WE'LL DO THAT LATER. SHE'S THINKING-- SHE WAS THINKING, BEFORE THAT, BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS THINKING IT'S WEIRD HOW OKAY AMERICANS ARE BUYING HAMBURGERS FROM A CLONE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I LIKE HOW YOU SAY CLOWN.
Stephen: OH, OH, OH, HOLD ON! THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL SIGNAL I HAVE GOTTEN. NO ONE KNOWS I HAVE TATTER TOTS HIDDEN IN MY BEARD. WOW, THAT WAS--

I CARE ABOUT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.
Stephen: YOU HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP.

I WORKED WITH ADAM FOR 13 YEARS NOW WE'VE COLLABORATED. HE'S A GOOD DUDE TO WORK WITH.
Stephen: YEAH, HE'S A VERY SOLID GUY.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS IT LIKE JUST HANGING OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AT THIS POINT AND OCCASIONALLY PEOPLE TURN ON THE CAMERA?
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF-- YEAH, IT IS. WE'VE BECOME KIND OF BROTHERLY, AND WE KNOW EACH OTHER SO WELL, NOW WE FIGHT. I'LL BE LIKE, "ADAM, DAVID STOLE MY HAT." AND HE'LL BE LIKE, "SPADE, GIVE IT BACK." WE'RE LIKE BABIES. JUST KIND OF RUNNING AROUND. ADAM'S LIKE--

HE OVERSEES THE MADNESS. BUT, YEAH, THEY'RE ALL GOOD PEOPLE.
Stephen: SO WHEN YOU GUYS GET TOGETHER TO DO A MOVIE DO YOU AT LEAST PICK A FUN PLACE TO DO IT? I WOULD SAY OKAY IF I'M GOING TO DO A MOVIE WITH MY FRIENDS. I'D LIKE TO GO SOME PLACE FUN. WHERE DID YOU DO THIS ONE?
WE SHOT ALL OVER, L.A., NEW YORK, HAWAII --
THAT'S A GREAT CHOICE.
I SHOULD JUST MOVE THERE, IT'S SO NICE. YEAH, SO WE SHOT IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA, WHICH IS VERY COOL.
Stephen: THAT'S GREAT.

Stephen: YEAH. I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA ON THE COAST. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TOWN YEAR, IT'S GREAT.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO I WAS LOOKING STUFF UP. AND THEIR BIG CLAIM TO FAME IS "EVERYTHING IS HAUNTED." WHEN I GOT THERE, EVERYWHERE YOU WENT,"A LITTLE TIDBIT, THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED." AND IT WAS COOL WHEN IT WAS, LIKE, AN OLD MANSION.
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL OLD PLAESES DOWN THERE.
AND I'D BE LIKE, "OH, IT'S HAUNTED." AND THEY SAID, "OH, YEAH." BUT EVERYBODY WAS DOING IT EVERYWHERE. YOU GO TO OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE, AND THEY'D GO, "JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS IS HAUNTED. CORNELL CHICKEN FINGERS WAS SLAUGHTERED HERE, THE BATTLE OF BLIENL' ONION." OH, ALL RIGHT. NO, THAT DOESN'T WORK.
Stephen: IF YOU HEAR ANY KNOCKING BY THE SALAD BAR, GET OUT OF THERE.
JUST RUN. UBERS WERE LIKE A HEARSE. IT WAS WEIRD. THEY PLAYED INTO IT WAY TOO MUCH.
Stephen: WELL, THAT CITY IS KNOWN-- IT'S NOT ONLY A CITY OF HOSPITALITY, BUT IT'S' PARTY CITY, SAVANNAH.

( LAUGHTER ) NO, WE WERE TRYING TO FOCUS, AND YOU TRY TO FIND THINGS WHERE YOU'RE NOT DRINKING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE EVERYBODY I TALKED TO-- AND THIS IS LITERALLY-- I WOULD GO AROUND AND BE LIKE, "HEY, WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO FOR ACTIVITIES AND STUFF?" AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, GET DRUNK. YOU KNOW, WE GET DRUNK." "ANOTHER IF YOU DIDN'T COTHAT." THEY'D BE LIKE, "YOU KNOW, GO TO THE MOVIE, MAYBE, GET DRUNK." IT ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT. AND THEIR BIG CLAIM TO FAME, WHICH I'M SURE YOU KNOW, THE OPEN CONTAINER LAW. THEY GO, "WE GOT OPEN CONTAINER. YOU CAN DRINK WHEREVER. GO TO THE LIBRARY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? JUST DRINK IT UP. RUN AROUND THE STREETS WITH ALL THE SPIRITS AND JUST GET GHOST DRUNK." IT WAS, LIKE, SO WEIRD.
Stephen: YOU'RE KNOWN IN-- YOU'VE CENTERED A FAIR AMOUNT OF YOUR ACTING ON THE FACT YOU LIKE A COCKTAIL OR TWO.
YEAH.
Stephen: PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND SAY, "LET'S PARTY. OF.
IT HAPPENS A LOT. MY FIRST ALBUM WAS CALLED "PARTY." AND I HAVE THIS REPUTATION FOR BEING A DRINKER, WHICH I UPHELD.
Stephen: LEGAL REASONS, YOU HAVE TO. FALSE ADVERTISING.
EXACTLY. BUT, YEAH, NO, IT'S HARD BECAUSE PEOPLE-- ONCE YOU SET THAT REPUTATION, SO I WOULD GO TO BARS-- LIKE, I LIKE GOING TO BARS AND WATCH SPORTS. I'M A BIG SPORTS FAN. PEOPLE WOULD BUY ME SHOTS, AND I REALLY DON'T DO SHOTS ANYMORE. IT JUST CHANGING GAME. YOUR NIGHT IS CHANGED WHEN YOU START DOING SHOTS. I KIND OF STOPPED DOING THEM, BUT THE BARTENDER WOULD BE LIKE, "THAT COUPLE SENT YOU A SHOT." "WHAT IS IT?" "WILD TURKEY." AND I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW, TELL THEM THANKS BUT I TONIGHT WANT TO --
THEY'RE DOING THIS?
YEAH, THEY'RE LIKE CRANING LIKE-- ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'D BE LIKE, "NO, THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU." AND THEY'D COME OVER MAD, "OH, YOU'RE TOO GOOD? TOO GOOD TO DO A SHOT?" "YEAH, I'M TOO GOOD TO DO WILD TURKEY AT NOON." EVERYBODY SHOULD BE.

BRIAN, IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO TALK TO YOU. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES, THE DISCOVERY FINALLY OF THE BENDING OF SPAIRKS THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME. AND WHAT ARE WE EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE-WISE TONIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU EXPLAINING?
TONIGHT, WE ARE BASICALLY THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF AN AMAZING DISCOVERY IN ASTRONOMY, THE MOST POWERFUL EXPLODING STAR, THE MOST POWERFUL SUPERNOVA EVER DETECTED IN HUMAN HISTORY.
Stephen: WHAT IS A SUPER NOVA, FIRST OF ALL?
A SUPERNOVA IS AN EXPLODING STAR. AND THE ONE THAT WAS FOUND IS 570 BILLION TIMES BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN AT ITS PEAK LUMINOS ET. JUST IMAGINE THAT. A POINT OF LIGHT IN THE SKY HALF A BILLION TIMES-- YOU KNOW, 500 BILLION TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN THE SUN.
Stephen: OKAY, AND WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? , IT HAPPEN HAPPENED 3.8 BILLION YEARS AGO. BUT IT WAS DISCOVERED ONE YEAR AGO. IT'S FUNNY HOW IT WORKS, TIME--
Stephen: IT IS, IT IS, IT IS, BECAUSE IT'S 3.8 BILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: DO WE SEE A FLASH OF LIGHT? IF IT'S THAT BRIGHT WHY DON'T I LOOK UP AT NIGHT AND SEE THE SKY COMPLETELY BLOTTED OUT BY A SUPERNOVA?
IF IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO US, YOU WOULD HAVE. IN FACT, IF THIS SUPERNOVA HAPPENS, SAY, AT THE DISTANCE OF PLUTO, IT WOULD HAVE WIPED EVERYTHING OUT. WE WOULD ALL BE GONE. SO IT'S CEEND OF GOOD THAT IT HAPPENED 3.8 BILLION LIGHTYEARS AWAY.
Stephen: SURE, SURE. WHY WAS IT SO HUGE? WHY THIS-- WHAT'S THE NAME, HYPERNOVA.
HYPERNOVA.
Stephen: WHAT CAUSES ONE?
LET'S LOOK AT A STAR BEFORE IT EXPLODES TO GET A SENSE-- YOU CAN BRING IT UP ON THE SCREEN HERE. IF WE DIVE INTO A STAR RIGHT, WE PENETRATE, SAY, INTO THE SURFACE, AND WE GO DEEPER, LAYER BY LAYER, ULTIMATELY WE GET TO THE STAR'S CORE. AND THE CORE, BECAUSE OF ITS ENORMOUS TEMPERATURE, TENS OF MILLIONS OF DEGREES, IS ACTUALLY A NUCLEAR FURNACE, WHERE SIMPLE ATOMS FUSE TOGETHER TO BUILD THE MORE COMPLICATED ONES, LIKE ONES NEEDED FOR LIFE. THE THING SAS THESE ATOMS FUSE, THEY GIVE OFF ENERGY, AND THAT ENERGY STREAMED OUTWARD AND IT PROMS THE STAR UP. THAT'S HOW THE STAR SUPPORTS ITS OWN WEIGHT. AND THIS IS VITAL BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER, A STAR USES UP ALL ITS NUCLEAR FUEL. NO MORE FUSION, NO MORE OUTWARD FLOWING ENERGY. AND THEN, OF COURSE, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE STAR WILL COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF. MATTER RUSHES IN AND REBOUNDS LIKE A BALL BOUNCING OFF A VERY STIFF SURFACE, SENDS A SHOCK WAVE GOING THROUGH THE STAR, RIPPLES OUTWARD LAYER BY LAYER. AND THE STAR EXPLODES.
Stephen: TOW IS COLLAPSES IN AND THEN BURSTS BACK OUT WITH THE FORCE OF REBOUND.
EXACTLY. AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL DISPLOAGZ. WE DO HAVE A DEMONSTRATION TO GIVE A SENSE OF HOW THE ENERGY OF THE CORE IS TRANSMETTED LAYER BY LAYER THROUGH THE STARS.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS CALLED?
THIS IS CALLED THE GAL LAYAN CANNON.
Stephen: DID GALILEO COME UP WITH THIS?
I DON'T THINK SO. BUT HE DROPPED A LOT OF STUFF, AND WE'RE GOING TO CROP SOME STUFF HERE. THE IDEA HERE IS THAT EACH OF THESE BALLS REPRESENTS A LAYER OF A STAR. SO THIS BIG ONE HERE IS THE CORE, AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO DROP THIS STACK, AND THIS BALL BOUNCING OFF THE BASE HERE IS LIKE THE CORE REBOUNDING AFTER THE STAR COLLAPSES.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND THEN AFTER IT BOUNCES UP, IT'S GOING TO HET THE NEXT LAYER, WHICH IS GOING TO TRANSMIT THAT ENERGY LAYER BY LAYER UNTIL WE GET TO THIS LITTLE GUY OVER HERE. AND WE'LL SEE HOW ALL THE ENERGY WILL BE CONCENTRATED IN THIS YELLOW BALL, AND WILL FLY UP WITH --
THIS REPRESENTS THE OUTER LAYER OF THE STAR?
THIS IS LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE STAR. IF I JUST DROP THIS BY ITSELF, NOT MUCH HAPPENS. BUT IF I DROP THE WHOLE STACK --
OKAY, BEFORE YOU DO THAT, BEFORE YOU DO, THAT I'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT THIS GALILEOAN CANNON, THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE HAVE DONE BEFORE BUT NO ONE HAS DONE A GALILEOAN CANNON THIS TALL BEFORE AND WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE FROM THE GUINNESS RECORDS PEOPLE RIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW. AND YOU'RE GOING TO DROP THE TALLEST GALILEOAN CANNON OF ALL TIME, AND WE'LL KNOW YOU'VE BROKEN THE RECORD IF THAT YELLOW BALL GOES THROUGH MY MOUTH UP THERE.
THAT'S RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OKAY?
THAT'S OUR TARGET.
Stephen: THAT'S OUR TARGET. ALL RIGHT, AND THIS-- OKAY, SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NOW, REPRESENTING A SUPERNOVA AND THE RAPID EXPANSION OF THE OUTER SHELL OF A STAR AND BREAKING A WORLD RECORD, MR. BRIAN GREEN. WOOOO! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THE WORLD RECORD GALILEOAN CANNON, HYPERNOVEMBER. THE "WORLD SCIENCE FESTIVAL" IS JUNE 1-5 IN NEW JUNE 1-5 IN NEW YORK CITY. TICKETS AVAILABLE AT world science festival.com BRIAN GREENE EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE LIZZY CAPLAN, NEIL YOUNG, AND MIKE EPPS.
