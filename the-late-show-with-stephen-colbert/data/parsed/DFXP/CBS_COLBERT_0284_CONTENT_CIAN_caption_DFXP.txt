( RINGING )
COME ON, PICK UP. GOOD DAY. LOOK, MR. PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR STUPID REFUGEES. I WON HUGE. BIG LEAGUE. MY INAUGURATION CROWD WAS THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I TALKED TO ALL THE BEST, MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE, AND YOU'RE BY FAR THE WORST.
LOOK -- NO, YOU LOOK, YOUR COUNTRY IS FULL OF JUMPING RATS AND YOUR TOILETS GO THE WRONG WAY. GARBAGE. ACDC IS OVERRATED, THAT'S NOT A NIGHT. THIS IS A NIGHT.
I'M SORRY. THIS IS AN OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE.
OH, WELL THEN I'LL TAKE THE BLOOMIN' ONION.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES DR. PHIL, MICHAEL BOLTON AND USICLE GUEST MARREN MORRIS, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! HEY, JON! GOOD TO SEE YA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME! HEY, EVERYBODY! HOW ARE YA? HI, CHRIS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WE CAN WITHUM, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH! THAT'S A THURSDAY CROWD. THAT'S ELECTRIC! THOSE ARE PEOPLE ALIVE ON THIS PLANET RIGHT NOW. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," FOLKS. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY GROUNDHOG DAY! HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING ON GROUNDHOG DAY! I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE LATE-BREAKING NEWS, BUT TODAY, AMERICA'S FOREMOST PSYCHIC RODENT, PUNXATAWNY PHIL CAME OUT OF HIS HOLE AND INDEED SAW HIS SHADOW. SO THE BAD NEWS IS SIX MORE WEEKS OF WINTER. THE GOOD NEWS -- WE HAVE SIX MORE WEEKS! ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP STARTED HIS DAY AT THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST. I'VE ALWAYS SAID THE PRAYER BREAKFAST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRAYER MEAL OF THE DAY. TRUMP TOOK A MOMENT TO SHOW A TENDER SIDE.
WHAT I HEAR MOST OFTEN AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE FIVE WORDS...
STEPHEN: PLEASE. DON'T. GRAB. MY. (BLEEP) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT FIVE? I KID ABOUT THIS, BUT AS A CHRISTIAN MYSELF, I KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST HAS BEEN, SINCE EISENHOWER, A SOLEMN OCCASION AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENTS TO BRING PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS TOGETHER AND SHARE WHAT IS MOST SACRED TO THEM.
BUT WE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS ON "THE APPRENTICE." AND WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT, I HAD TO LEAVE THE SHOW. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW FOR SURE I WAS DOING IT.
STEPHEN: YEAH, THAT'S WHEN PRESIDENTS KNOW FOR SURE. JUST LIKE WHEN PRESIDENT WINK MARTINDALE HAD TO LEAVE "WIN, LOSE, OR DRAW." HE JUST KNEW, THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME SERIOUS. OF COURSE, THE REST IS HISTORY.
AND THEY HIRED A BIG, BIG MOVIE STAR, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, TO TAKE MY PLACE. AND WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNED OUT. THE RATINGS WENT RIGHT DOWN THE TUBES. IT'S BEEN A TOTAL DISASTER. AND I WANT TO JUST PRAY FOR ARNOLD, IF WE CAN, FOR THOSE RATINGS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: YOU HEARD HIM CORRECTLY. YOUR EARS DO NOT DECEIVE YOU. THE PRESIDENT USED THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST TO INSULT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. AND TOMORROW, HE'S GOING TO ROAST ROSIE O'DONNELL AT THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER. ( LAUGHTER ) IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER HAD A RESPONSE.
HEY DONALD, I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. WHY DON'T WE SWITCH JOBS? YOU TAKE OVER TV BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH AN EXPERT IN RATINGS, AND I TAKE OVER YOUR JOB, AND THEN PEOPLE CAN FINALLY SLEEP COMFORTABLY AGAIN. HMM? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OW! OH! OH! DAMN, IS THIS THE WAR OF 1812? BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE JUST GOT BURNT! ( LAUGHTER ) AND ARNOLD ISN'T THE ONLY WORLD LEADER TRUMP IS FEUDING WITH. ON SATURDAY, OUR PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER AND FRIENDLIEST GUY IN THE SAUNA, MALCOLM TURNBULL AND LASHED OUT AT TURNBULL ON THE PHONE CALL. PLEASE DON'T PICK A FIGHT WITH AUSTRALIA! THEY'LL CUT OFF OUR SUPPLY OUR UGGS, KOALA JERKY AND HUGH JACKMAN. TRUMP WAS UPSET ABOUT A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT FOR THE U.S. TO ACCEPT OVER A THOUSAND REFUGEES BEING HELD IN AUSTRALIA, TWEETING, "DO YOU BELIEVE IT? THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO TAKE THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM AUSTRALIA. WHY? I WILL STUDY THIS DUMB DEAL!" WHAT? DON'T YOU KNOW HUMANITARIAN AID IS NOT A DEAL? OKAY? UNICEF DOESN'T GO TO REFUGEE CAMPS AND SAY, "ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRADE YOU THIS BAG OF RICE FOR YOUR JUICE BOX AND A CAPTAIN AMERICA PENCIL." AND SOME OF THOSE LOSING SUPER BOWL T SLITS. COME ON.
Jon: OH, OH, OH.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF LOOMING WARS,  SAYS IT HAS TEST-FIRED A NEW BALLISTIC MISSILE, AND THIS MORNING PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED A STERN RESPONSE -- "IRAN HAS BEEN FORMALLY PUT ON NOTICE FOR FIRING A BALLISTIC MISSILE." ON NOTICE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? BECAUSE NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. BECAUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MICHAEL FLYNN "DID NOT SIGNAL THAT THE U.S. WOULD TAKE ANY CONCRETE ACTIONS, WHETHER MILITARY OR DIPLOMATIC." SO WHEN WE SAY "ON NOTICE," WE JUST MEAN, "WE NOTICED." AND YOU KNOW WHAT I NOTICED? TRUMP KEEPS STEALING FROM ME. ON MY OLD SHOW, I PUT PEOPLE "ON NOTICE" ON MY ON-NOTICE BOARD. AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME DONALD TRUMP HAS PLAGIARIZED ME. I CAME UP WITH THE WHOLE OVER THE TOP TV CHARACTER WHO'S DESPERATE TO BE LOVED, DOESN'T BELIEVE IN FACTS AND HAD A PET EAGLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S MINE! THAT'S MINE. PLUS, WE BOTH RAN FOR PRESIDENT. ONLY ONE OF US KNEW IT WAS A JOKE. ( LAUGHTER ) SO FOR STEALING MY OLD ACT, I AM PUTTING DONALD TRUMP ON NOTICE! BRING OUT THE ON NOTICE BOARD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE IT IS! STILL GOT IT. RIGHT UP HERE. THANK YOU, GOOD MAN. EVERYBODY SAY HI TO MY SCENIC DESIGNER BRENDAN. BRENDAN, EVERYBODY, SAY HI. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, BRENDAN, I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO DO THIS BIT YESTERDAY AND I COULDN'T. WHY NOT?
WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE ON NOTICE BOARD.
STEPHEN: WHY? WHERE WAS IT?
IN MY PARENTS HOUSE IN MASSACHUSETTS.
Stephen: WHERE DO WE DO THE SHOW?
HERE IN NEW YORK.
STEPHEN: THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE HAVE IT NOW. I HAVEN'T CLEANED THIS THING IN A WHILE. WHAT THE (BLEEP) IS A MIKE HUCKABEE? GOES RIGHT THERE. OKAY. LET'S FILL THIS IN. LET'S SEE... DONALD DUCK, DON GIOVANI, OUR GAY APPAREL COMMA DON WE NOW, HERE WE ARE... DONALD TRUMP! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT! LET'S GET THIS IN HERE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP -- WHAT DO I DO? IT'S BEEN SO LONG. DONALD TRUMP -- FOR STEALING MY "ON NOTICE" BIT-- AND A COUPLE OTHER THINGS-- DONALD TRUMP, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY ON NOTICE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOOM! HOW'S THAT FEEL? DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT THAT JUST HAD? EXACTLY THE AMOUNT AS YOU PUTTING IRAN ON NOTICE. ZERO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. DR. PHIL IS HERE. SO STICK AROUND!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!
STEPHEN: MY FIRST GUEST GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! HOW YOU, MY FRIEND? YOU FEELING GOOD?
Jon: FEELING GOOD.
Stephen: FEELING FREE?
Jon: FINE JUST BEING ME.
Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF  TELEVISION'S NUMBER ONE RATED DAYTIME TALK SHOW. PLEASE WELCOME DR. PHIL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ DR. PHIL, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE HERE JUST IN TIME. I FEEL LIKE OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY IS A FIGHTING, SQUABBLING FAMILY ON YOUR SHOW.
REALLY? I HADN'T NOTICED.
Stephen: HEAL A NATION FOR US, DR. PHIL. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO HEAL THE DIVIDE IN AMERICA, OR IS IT TIME TO BREAK UP?
I DON'T THINK IT'S TIME TO BREAK UP.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
BECAUSE I'M FROM TEXAS, AND YOU KNOW WHERE TEXAS WOULD GO IF THEY SECEDE. WE WOULD BE O ON THE OTHER SIDE  THE DAMN WALL.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE TRUE.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK NOBODY CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE?
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S TRYING TO GET ALONG RIGHT NOW. EVERYBODY ISED OFF, AND IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T WANT TO GET ALONG. IF I'M NEGOTIATING WITH SOMEBODY, IF I'M NEGOTIATING WITH YOU, THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE MOST OF WHAT YOU WANT I POSSIBLY CAN.
Stephen: YOU WANT TO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT WHEN WE'RE NEGOTIATING.
I SAID I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MOST OF WHAT YOU WANT I POSSIBLY CAN.
Stephen: IF I TAKE EVERYTHING YOU GIVE ME AND GO, YOU GET NOTHING, DID I WIN? BECAUSE TRUMP SAYS WE'RE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN, WIN, WIN. IS NEGOTIATING ALL ABOUT WINNING?
OF COURSE -- WELL, CERTAINLY YOU WANT TO WIN, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO DEFINE "WIN." IF WIN IS ALL ONE-SIDED, THAT'S NOT GOING TO LAST VERY LONG. IF YOU AND I MAKE A DEAL AND I SAY, HERE'S THE DEAL, YOU DO ALL THE WORK, I GET ALL THE MONEY, I MIGHT TALK YOU INTO THAT TODAY, BUT THREE OR FOUR DAYS LATER, EXCUSE ME, KISS MY AS, I'M NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE. NO ONE GOES ALONG WITH THAT. LET'S START BY SAYING WHAT DO WE AGREE ON.
Stephen: WHAT DO WE AGREE ON? BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE RIGHT NOW DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND RIGHT NOW, TOO, PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE AGREEING ON REALITY. WHAT IS -- I'M SERIOUS.
NO, YOU'RE --
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE AGREEING ON WHAT IS A FACT, WHAT IS AN ALTERNATIVE FACT. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING, DOCTOR?
NO, ANYTIME THERE'S A DISPUTE -- AND I'VE DONE THIS. THIS IS WHAT I DO.
Stephen: I'VE SEEN YOUR SHOW. NUMBER ONE DAYTIME SHOW, DR. PHIL.
AND I DID THESE THINGS BEFORE THAT. ANYTIME THERE'S A DISPUTE, FIRST THING I DO IS SAY LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT WE AGREE ON BECAUSE WE MIGHT AGREE ON MORE THAN WE THINK AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THE THINGS TO THE SIDE WE DISAGREE ON. YOU SAY, WHAT DO WE AGREE ON? EVERYBODY AGREES WE'RE ALL AMERICANS, THAT WE ALL ENJOY THE FREEDOMS THAT WE WANT, WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE. EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: IT'S THE PRICE WE PAY FOR THAT.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE DON'T AGREE ON YET. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE DO AGREE ON.
Stephen: SURE, EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SAFE, AMERICA'S A GREAT COUNTRY, I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY AGREES EVERYBODY IS AMERICAN BECAUSE PEOPLE ACCUSE EACH OTHER OF NOT BEING A REAL AMERICAN ALL THE TIME.
WELL, WE ALL LIVE HERE, LET'S SAY THAT AND WE ALL WANT TO BE SAFE HERE.
Stephen: AS LONG AS WE GET PAST THE VAN AT THE AIRPORT.
AS LONG AS WE DON'T LEAVE AND CAN'T COME BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. YOU HAVE TO SAY, WHAT DO WE AGREE ON. YOU SAY, WHAT DO WE NOT AGREE ON? OKAY, NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DISAGREEMENTS, BUT WE AT LEAST HAVE SOME COMMON GROUND. NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THAT. THE PEOPLE OUT DEMONSTRATING, MORE POWER TO THEM, LISTEN, THIS IS AMERICA, YOU CAN DO THAT IF YOU WANT TO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I THINK IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, GREAT. I THINK, AT SOME POINT, THE DIALOGUE HAS TO START.
Stephen: OKAY. UM -- OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
I ABSOLUTELY DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TALK INTELLIGENTLY ABOUT POLITICS. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT THE GEOECONOMIC IMPACT OF THINGS HAPPENING OVERSEAS VERSUS HERE. I'M NOT COMPETENT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THE DIFFERENCE IS I JUST KNOW IT.
Stephen: THAT'S REFRESHING. THAT'S REFRESHING.
MY DAD USED TO SAY -- AND I CAN HEAR HIM SAYING IT JUST LIKE IT WAS TEN SECONDS AGO -- HE USED TO SAY, BOY, YOU BETTER SPEND 5% OF YOUR TIME DECIDING WHETHER YOU GOT A GOOD DEAL OR A BAD DEAL, AND 95% OF THE TIME DECIDING WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. AND THAT WAS REAL GOOD ADVICE.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION -- THE ELECTION'S OVER. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? OKAY. IT'S NOT -- PEOPLE ARE DEBATING THE ELECTION LIKE IT'S NOT OVER. THE ELECTION IS OVER.
Stephen: OH, IT'S DEFINITELY OVER, YEAH.
SO THE QUESTION IS --
Stephen: HE'S DEFINITELY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? THAT'S WHY I SAY I HOPE PEOPLE START A DIALOGUE, START A NARRATIVE AND TRY TO INFLUENCE THINGS THAT SEEM, IF THEY ARE HOW THEY APPEAR, REALLY RADICAL. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO START A NARRATIVE SO WE PULL THIS BACK TO SOME SENSE OF NONIDIOCY.
Stephen: WITHOUT NAMING ANY NAMES. ( APPLAUSE )
I MEAN AT MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS, IT'S NOT JUST AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON ABOUT HEALTHCARE, IMMIGRATION, ALL SORTS OF THINGS.
Stephen: YOU HAD A GUEST ON YOUR SHOW RECENTLY THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME FASCINATED WITH. THE GUEST WAS ON THERE A FEW MONTHS AGO BUT FOR SOME REASON IT'S REALLY TAKEN OFF IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. DO YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT?
I DO.
Stephen: A YOUNG LADY, I DON'T KNOW HER NAME, BUT SHE HAS A CATCH PHRASE THAT HAS GONE VIRAL, AND IF I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY --
THEY ALL KNOW IT.
Stephen: -- IT'S -- LET'S SEE SOME OF THE MAGIC.
DID YOU SEE THE HO'S ARE LAUGHING.
YEAH. SO THE AUDIENCE IS A BUNCH OF HOS.
YEAH. CATCH ME OUTSIDE HOW ABOUT THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I SAID. >. SHE'S 12.
Stephen: I WOULDN'T WANT ME TO CATCH HER OUTSIDE.
SHE'S A 12-YEAR-OLD.
Stephen: COULD YOU HELP ME WITH SOMETHING -- YOU LIKE TO HEAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IF FRIENDS HAVE FALLEN OUT. YOU'RE GREAT AT GETTING PEOPLE BACK TOGETHER. ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD WORKS AT THE SHOW, NAMED PAUL DENELLO. HE AND I HAVE A PROBLEM AND I WOULD LOVE IF YOU COULD HELP US. COULD YOU DO THAT FOR US?
WELL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
Stephen: HIS DOG IS THE PROBLEM. HIS DOG DOESN'T HAVE RESPECT PERSONAL SPACE. HE'S RIGHT HERE. COULD WE --
WELL, THE STORY GOES A LOT BETTER IF YOU'RE THE ONE TELLING IT. COULD WE GET HIM OUT HERE?
Stephen: PAUL, WOULD YOU JOIN US? PAUL DENELLO, EVERYBODY.
PAUL, WHAT'S UP. HOW YOU DOING?
Stephen: DO YOU MIND DOING THIS? PAUL, HOW LONG HAVE WE KNOWN EACH OTHER.
30 YEARS.
Stephen: HOW OLD IS YOUR DOG?
NINE.
Stephen: YOU HAD 21 GOOD YEARS.
H-- YOU HAD 2 IS GOOD YEARS.
Stephen: HE HAD ANOTHER DOG BEFORE THIS.
HE'S LONG HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY DOG.
Stephen: I LOVE HIS DOG. I MADE A DEAL WITH CBS WHEN I STARTED THE SHOW BECAUSE WE MAKE OUR OFFICE A DOG-FRIENDLY OFFICE, AND THEY SAID OKAY. ALMOST ENTIRELY FOR PAUL. AND WHEN HE BRINGS RILEY TO WORK, RILEY LOVES PAUL, ALWAYS WANTS TO BE WITH HIM. PAUL OFTEN FORGETS THAT RILEY IS AT THE OFFICE BECAUSE HE'LL LEAVE MY OFFICE AND RILEY WILL STAY IN MY OFFICE WHEN PAUL LEAVES AND WHINE AND SCRATCH AT THE DOOR, AND WHILE I LOVE RILEY, RILEY'S NOT MY PROBLEM. RILEY'S PAUL'S PROBLEM.
WHAT KIND OF POLICY IS THAT IF IT'S AN OPEN-DOOR POLICY FOR DOGS AND HE'S PUTTING RESTRICTIONS ON US?
YOU'RE CLOSING THE DOOR WHEN YOU LEAVE AND THE DOG CAN'T COME OUT, IT'S NOT AN OPEN DOG POLICY FOR DOGS.
Stephen: HE SAID I LOVE RILEY, BUT -- BUT MEANS FORGET WHAT I JUST SAID, NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I REALLY THINK.
THANK YOU. YOU DON'T REALLY LOVE RILEY, YOU TOLERATE HIM BECAUSE HE'S YOUR FRIEND.
Stephen: I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE BUT YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG.
IS RILEY HERE?
Stephen: COULD RILEY COME OUT?
COME HERE, RILEY. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: NOW, THIS ISN'T FAIR BECAUSE RILEY IS CUTER THAN I AM. OKAY. NOW, RILEY -- I LOVE RILEY, AND --
AND.
Stephen: I LOVE RILEY AND RILEY IS YOUR DOG. HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE RILEY BECAUSE YOU NEVER SEEM TO KNOW WHERE HE IS.
DON'T THEY USE DOGS AS THERAPY DOGS BECAUSE YOU PET THEM AND THEY REDUCE STRESS? RILEY IS A GIFT. IT'S AN INTERVENTION.
HE'S A GIFT TO YOU. THANK YOU, PHIL. I'VE SAID THIS A MILLION TIMES, YOU SHOULD NOT FIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOG. IT UPSETS THE DOG. YOU KNOW, NO TELLING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE DOG.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A DOG? I I DO AND TAKE IT TO WORK EVERY DAY SO I SHOULD PROBABLY RECUSE MYSELF.
Stephen: I'M STILL ANGRY. I DON'T FEEL ANY BETTER. WHAT DO I GET OUT OF THIS THERAPY SESSION AND HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?
YOU SHOULD SCUFF UP THE DOG'S EARS, YOU WON'T BE SO ANGRY.
Stephen: SCUFF UP? YEAH, SHOW HIM HOW TO SCUFF UP THE DOG'S AIRS.
IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO?
THAT'S IT. DOES THE DOG LOOK HAPPY?
Stephen: RILEY ALWAYS LOOKS A LITTLE SAD. A LITTLE SAD. DOGS LOOK LIKE THEIR OWNERS. ( LAUGHTER ) PAUL LOOKS A LITTLE SAD MOST OF THE TIME.
HAD IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO BATHE THAT DOG?
THIS IS HER BATHED STATE. OH, THIS IS IT. THIS IS AS GOOD AS SHE GETS. I'M STARTING TO COME OVER TO YOUR SIDE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME BACK ANYTIME, DR. PHIL. THANK YOU PAUL. THANK YOU, RILEY, I LOVE YOU. BUT IT'S TIME TO GO. DR. PHIL AIRS WEEK DAYS NATIONWIDE. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! BACK WITH A SPECIAL "LATE SHOW" ON THE ROAD.
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY IS A TIME OF STUNNING CHANGE. OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW, UP WITH THE LUNCH. AND NOT JUST IN WASHINGTON. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A PAINFUL PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION IN PENNSYLVANIA, AS WE DISCOVERED IN THIS  SPECIAL "LATE SHOW" INVESTIGATIVE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION. JIM? ♪ ♪ ♪ GETTYSBURG, A NAME WE ALL LEARNED AS CHILDREN FOR ONE HISTORIC REASON.
THE HALL OF PRESIDENT'S WAX MUSEUM. A 60-YEAR-OLD TOURIST ATTRACTION FEATURING ALL 44 PRESIDENTS. BUT TRAGICALLY THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION HAS KILLED AMERICA'S LONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH WAXED-BASED ENTERTAINMENT. THE MUSEUM HAS CLOSED ITS DOORS AND RECENTLY ALL OF OUR FORMER PRESIDENTS WERE SOLD ON THE AUCTION BLOCK.
FINALLY, A CHANCE TO PURCHASE YOUR VERY OWN ABRAHAM LINCOLN. HONEY GLAZED REAGAN. JIMMY CARTER, BILL CLINTON ON PREDNISONE OR YOUR DAD'S FRIEND FROM WORK. BUT ONLY ONE PRESIDENT FOR ME, MARTIN VAN BUREN, OUR MOST EIGHTH PRESIDENT, THE NOTORIOUS M.V.B. WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAIL OF TEARS. HE CAUSED THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 1837, AND WAS BELOVED FOR HIS NICKNAME "THE LITTLE MAGICIAN." I KNEW I HAD TO DROP EVERYTHING AND GO GET HIM. BUT IT WAS A SATURDAY. SO I SENT OUT MY MOST SINGLE AND CHILDLESS STAFF MEMBER, AERIAL.
AHHH! HOPEFULLY, SOMEONE FED HER CATS. AERIAL'S MISSION, BRING BACK MARTIN VAN BUREN AT ANY COST UNDER $2,000.
YUM. BUT FIRST CHECK OUT THE COMPETITION.
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE? I HAVE BEEN COMING TO THE MUSEUM 40 YEARS, SO I'M A HISTORY BUFF. I HOPE THEY DON'T GET HACKED UP FOR HAUNTED FIGURES AND DUMMIES LIKE IN THE LAST MUSEUM.
THAT HAPPENED? YEAH, SOLD THE CIVIL WAR WAX MUSEUM THREE YEARS AGO. NOT ALL, BUT A GOOD MANY WERE CHOPPED UP INTO HAUNTED HOUSES AND THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THAT'S TERRIFYING.
Stephen: FOR SOME BIDDERS, THIS AUCTION HIT CLOSE TO HOME.
I AM THE GREAT, GREAT -- A GREAT NEPHEW OF RUTHERFORD B. HAZE. SO I'M HOPING TO KEEP RUTHERFORD IN THE FAMILY TODAY.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY?
CAN YOU PUT A PRICE ON RUTHERFORD?
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO GET NASTY IN THE AUCTION?
I THINK IT'S GOING TO GET NASTY.
I THINK IT COULD BE NASTY. OH, YEAH, THINGS GOT NASTY. GETTYSBURG HAD NEVER SEEN A BATTLE LIKE THIS, THE MONEY GUNS WERE BLAZING.
MARTIN VAN BUREN. FINALLY, IT WAS MARTIN'S TIME TO SHINE AND WE WERE READY TO SNATCH UP THE ONE-TERM PRESIDENT OF OUR DREAMS. WHAT THE (BLEEP), $3,300 FOR THE LITTLE MAGICIAN? SCREW THAT NOISE BECAUSE WE GOT THE ONLY PRESIDENT BETTER THAN VAN BUREN.
SOLD! THE ONE THAT WAS LEFT. SAY IT WITH ME, ZACHARY TAYLOR. OUR TWELVE PRESIDENT CAME WITH AN INSPIRING STORY.
THOUSANDS HEADED WEST OVER THE PLAINS AND PRAYERIES TO CALIFORNIA. SHOULD CALIFORNIA BE FREE OR SLAVE.
DEATH CAME TO ZACHARY TAYLOR BEFORE THE CONTROVERSY WAS DECIDED.
Stephen: YES, JUST 16 MONTHS INTO OFFICE, HE DIED LIKE A TRUE AMERICAN, OF ACUTE INDIGESTION.
DO YOU THINK I'M CRAZY FOR SPENDING $2,000 ON ZACHARY TAYLOR?
I THINK THAT'S A BUY. OKAY. THANK YOU. I THINK SO, TOO. HE IS ONE OF THE PRESIDENTS. DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ZACHARY TAYLOR DID?
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW SLOPPY HE WAS.
HE WAS A SLOPPY MAN. THAT'S TRUE.
AND, NOW, HE WAS OUR SLOPPY MAN. WE SALUTE YOU, PRESIDENT ZACHARY TAYLOR. YOU WERE A DECORATED HERO IN THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN WAR. A MEMBER OF THE WIG PARTY, AND YOU ATE A FATALLY LARGE MEAL.

THE ELVES WENT CRAZY.
Stephen: AM I GIVING ANYTHING AWAY WHEN I SAY THE POINT OF THE SPECIAL IS FOR YOU TO GET PEOPLE ALL SEXIED UP SO THEY'LL MAKE BABIES ON VALENTINE'S DAY SO THERE WILL BE ENOUGH CHILDREN TO GIVE PRESENTS TO NINE MONTHS LATER AT CHRISTMASTIME.
OR TEN MONTHS, YOU'RE CORRECT.
Stephen: WELL, IF IT'S THE FIRST BABY, IT COULD BE LATE.
THAT'S NOT MY JOB. THAT'S NOT MY AREA.
Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW BABIES ARE MADE, MICHAEL BOLTON?
I JUST KNOW WHAT SANTA TOLD ME.
Stephen: WELL, YOU WERE -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE BEEN A MUSICAL ICON SINCE THE 1980s, BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR FIRST HIT TILL YOU WERE 34 YEARS OLD. WHAT WERE YOU DOING UP TO THAT POINT?
STARVING.
Stephen: HOW WERE YOU PAYING THE BILLS?
I WAS SIGNED WHEN I WAS 16 TO EPIC RECORDS, AND I THOUGHT I MADE IT. MY MOTHER HAD TO ACTUALLY SIGN THE CONTRACT. I WAS TOO YOUNG. AND I GOT TO NEW YORK AND I SAW CBS RECORDS, AND I THOUGHT, I MADE IT, AND THEN 18 YEARS LATER, I HAD MY FIRST HIT RECORD.
Stephen: WOW. I WAS OFF BY 18 YEARS.
Stephen: DID YOU THINK LIKE, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN?
I DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN B.
Stephen: SAME HERE. I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE -- I HAD A PANIC IN MY LATE 20s BECAUSE IF THIS DIDN'T WORK OUT MY LIFE WOULD BE SCREWED. KANYE LIKED YOUR WORK. WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO SING WITH PAVAROTTI? ONE TO HAVE THE GREATEST VOICES EVER.
I THINK OF ALL TIMES. GREATEST TENOR.
Stephen: DID YOU THINK OF YOURSELF, HE'S A SEX SYMBOL AND HE WEIGHS A LITTLE MORE THAN I DO, KILLED YOU EVER THINK MAYBE I COULD JUST EAT A LOT OF FETTUCCINE ALFREDO BEFORE I GO TO BED AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY?
THAT NEVER CROSSED THROUGH MY BRAIN. I WAS TERRIFIED BUT IT WAS SO EXCITING.
Stephen: WHERE? HIS HOMETOWN. IT WAS PAVAROTTI AND FRIENDS. PRINCESS DI WAS IN THE FRONT ROW. IT WAS AN UNFORGETTABLE, SURREAL NIGHT, AND HE GAVE ME THE BIG NOTES. HE WAS VERY GENEROUS, AND HE APPRECIATED THAT I HAD WRITTEN EVERYTHING OUT PHONETICALLY. HE SAID I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS VERY AMUSING, I LIKE THIS, YES. AND I WAS JUST WHATEVER YOU SAY, WHATEVER YOU WANT. HE SAYS, YOU TAKE THESE NOTES, IT'S GOOD. HE WAS LIFE ALTERING FOR ME.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE KNOWN FOR YOUR VOICE, BUT YOU'RE ALSO KNOWN FOR HOW LOW YOU UNBUTTON YOUR SHIRT. WHY IS THE SHIRT SO LOW? YOU TRY TO OPEN IT UP BUT THE SINGING BURSTS THE BUTTONS WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE?
THE POWER TO HAVE THE LUNGS.
Stephen: THE BUTTONS BURST OPEN WHEN YOU DID THAT?
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED.
Stephen: YOU DO A LOT OF COMEDY.
CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW.
Stephen: YEAH. THAT IS THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING.
Stephen: YEAH. BUT THE THING IS IN COMEDY, YOU NOTICE COMEDIANS DON'T SHOW AS MUCH SKIN AS THIS.
THA TRUE?
Stephen: I'M WEARING A SUIT AND I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN SEE TOO MUCH OF MY BODY.
YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET SOME ADVICE FROM YOU AFTER THIS. I LOVE COMEDY, THE JACK SPARROW I VENT OPENED DOORS FOR ME TO DO SOME PRODUCTION AND THE VALENTINE'S DAY SPECIAL WITH NETFLIX. IT WAS AMAZING TO WORK WITH.
Stephen: SO YOU'VE DONE MUSIC, COMEDY, AND SOME PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW THIS, BUT YOU'VE ALSO DONE SPORTS. YOU'RE VERY COMPETITIVE ABOUT SPORTS. WE FOUND THIS OUT, IN 1993, YOU PUT OUT -- AND I THOUGHT THIS COULDN'T BE TRUE AT FIRST -- YOU PUT OUT AN INSTRUCTIONAL SOFTBALL VIDEO, MICHAEL BOLTON'S WINNING SOFTBALL. WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS TRUE. HE TIME TO PUT ALL THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER, EVERYTHING DAVE HAS TAUGHT US. THE POWER ZONE, THE PATIENCE, THE WRIST SNAP AND THE EXPLOSION THROUGH THE BALL. MAKE IT WORK IN BATTING PRACTICE AND IT WILL WORK FOR YOU IN YOUR GAME.
Stephen: THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
THEY APPROVE.
Stephen: OF COURSE, THEY DO. THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS WHY, MICHAEL BOLTON, DID YOU MAKE AN INSTRUCTIONAL SOFTBALL VIDEO? WAS THERE A HUGE CALL FOR THAT IN THE 1990s I DON'T REMEMBER?
I STARTED THE BOLTON BALL GAME WHERE WE USED TO CHALLENGE RADIO STATIONS.
Stephen: DID THE VIDEO SELL WELL?
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ON MY WALL AS PLATINUM ANYTIME SOON. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T BUY A COPY.
Stephen: NO, I THINK WE STOLE IT OFF THE INTERNET. ALL VIDEO IS NOW. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE VALENTINE'S DAY SPECIAL.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT'S GREAT THAT, OBVIOUSLY, WE CELEBRATED VALENTINE'S DAY, EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN LOVE, EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET SEXY. MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH NOT SO MUCH YOUR SPECIAL BUT VALENTINE'S DAY ITSELF IS IT'S THE ONLY DAY OF THE YEAR WHERE WE GET TO CELEBRATE SEXINESS. IT'S THE ONLY SEXY HOLIDAY.
THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY TRUE.
