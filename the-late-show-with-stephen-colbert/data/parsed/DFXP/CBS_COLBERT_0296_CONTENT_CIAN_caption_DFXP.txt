IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES UMA THURMAN! JASON JONES! AND MUSICAL GUEST ALISON KRAUSS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: NICE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) HAPPY PRESIDENT'S DAY. HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR DAY OFF. JON, DID YOU ENJOY YOUR DAY OFF?
Jon: YES, YES.
Stephen: I ENJOYED MY DAY OFF, TOO. YEP. WE DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. JUST MAKING ALL THIS STUFF UP RIGHT NOW.
Jon: YEP, IT'S A DREAM.
Stephen: NOW, THIS AFTERNOON, A LOT OF PEOPLE SPENT THEIR DAY OFF AT "NOT MY PRESIDENT" RALLIES. TO WHICH I JUST WANT TO SAY, SORRY, BUT, YEAH, 'YOUR' PRESIDENT. DEAL WITH IT. OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS NOT MORE PRESIDENT THAN DONALD TRUMP. ABRAHAM LINCOLN EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. SO NO MARCHING OFF TO YOUR FANTASY WORLD. DON'T LEAVE US ALONE WITH THIS GUY. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT? STAY HERE! ENOUGH WITH THE SIGNS, LIKE "TINKLE TINKLE LITTLE CZAR, PUTIN PUT YOU WHERE YOU ARE." THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) I TAKE IT ALL BACK. THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. YEAH.
Jon: MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
Stephen: SO LET'S SEE WHAT YOUR PRESIDENT'S BEEN DOING. FRIDAY, HE WENT AFTER THE MEDIA WITH A BOLD ACCUSATION, "THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA -- FAILING @NYTIMES, @NBCNEWS, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN-- IS NOT MY ENEMY, IT IS THE ENEMY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!" ( AUDIENCE BOOING )
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL BAD FOR? I.S.I.S.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: THEY TRY SO HARD. SORRY, ISIS, IF YOU WANT TO GET ON THE LIST, PUBLISH PHOTOS OF TRUMP'S INAUGURATION CROWD. THEN HE'LL BE REALLY ANGRY AT YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, SO SAD. YEAH. WELL, CALLING THE PRESS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE ISN'T SITTING WELL WITH SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN.
IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FREE AND MANY TIMES ADVERSARIAL PRESS. AND WITHOUT IT, I AM AFRAID THAT WE WOULD LOSE SO MUCH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES OVER TIME. THAT'S HOW DICTATORS GET STARTED.
Stephen: OKAY, NOW, JUST TO BE CLEAR. HE'S NOT SAYING TRUMP'S A DICTATOR. HE'S SAYING GETTING RID OF THE PRESS IS HOW DICTATORS GET "STARTED." SO MCCAIN ISN'T CALLING TRUMP A FULL DICTATOR. HE'S MORE OF A BITE-SIZED, A DICTATOR-TOT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I COULD GO FOR SOME. CRUNCHY?
Jon: OH, MAN...
Stephen: YOU MAY REMEMBER, LAST WEEK, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MICHAEL FLYNN STEPPED DOWN BECAUSE HE DEFINITELY DID NOT BREAK THE LAWS. YOU KNOW, HOW YOU'RE FIRED FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, EVER SINCE, TRUMP HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE TO REPLACE HIM. GIVEN HOW MUCH CABLE NEWS TRUMP WATCHES, MY MONEY WAS ON NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER "TRAVELOCITY GNOME." ( LAUGHTER ) FOR A WHILE, TRUMP WAS COURTING RETIRED VICE ADMIRAL BOB HARWARD, WHO TURNED THE OFFER DOWN BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO FRIENDS, HARWARD THOUGHT THAT THE CHAOS IN THE WHITE HOUSE MADE THE OFFER A REAL "( BLEEP ) SANDWICH". ( LAUGHTER ) BY THE WAY, TRUMP TOWER SERVES A MEAN ( BLEEP ) SANDWICH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE TACO BOWL, THOUGH IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE. ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE, IN THAT PHOTO -- CAN WE PUT THAT BACK UP? CAN WE PUT THE PHOTO BACK UP? TRUMP REALLY DOES HAVE A TACO-EATING GRIN. WELL, TODAY, TRUMP MADE HIS CHOICE: LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND MAN GRAVELY THRILLED, H.R. MCMASTER. HE CHOSE MCMASTER BECAUSE HE HAD THE STRONGEST-SOUNDING NAME. "IS GENERAL THRUST MC-POWERHOUSE NOT AVAILABLE? THEN LET'S GO WITH MCMASTER." THIS AFTERNOON, THE PRESIDENT INTRODUCED MCMASTER FROM THE OFFICIAL COMMAND COUCH.
I'D LIKE TO ASK H.R. TO SAY A COUPLE OF WORDS.
STEPHEN: I'M SURE THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT H.R. HAS HAD A COUPLE OF WORDS FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND MCMASTER GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED THE POST.
I LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO ADVANCE AND PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
STEPHEN: "I SWEAR TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO PROTECT THE NATION FROM AMERICA'S ENEMIES... WHICH I'M BEING TOLD ARE CBS AND THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES. WOW. THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE I WAS IN THE ARMY FIVE MINUTES AGO." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT TRUMP NAMED MCMASTER AT HIS MAR-A-LAGO RESORT -- OR, AS HE'S CALLING IT NOW, "THE SOUTHERN WHITE HOUSE." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) IT'S THE SOUTHERN WHITE HOUSE NOW BECAUSE, WHEREVER THE PRESIDENT GOES, THAT IS A WHITE HOUSE. "OOO, I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE BURGER WHITE HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ) I GOTTA GO HIT THE PORCELAIN WHITE HOUSE." ( APPLAUSE ) AND TRUMP'S WEEKEND JAUNTS TO MAR-A-LAGO ARE NOT CHEAP. COMBINED WITH OTHER TRIPS HIS FAMILY TAKES, HE'S ALREADY COST TAXPAYERS $11.3 MILLION IN ONE MONTH. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TRAVEL EXPENSES AVERAGED $12.1 MILLION EACH YEAR. IT HELPS THAT OBAMA'S "WINTER WHITE HOUSE" WAS THE WHITE HOUSE. AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST EXPENSES FOR TAXPAYERS ARE THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION'S BUSINESS TRIPS. IN JANUARY, ERIC TRUMP TOOK A TRIP TO URUGUAY THAT COST TAXPAYERS $97,000 IN HOTEL BILLS. IT WAS $10,000 FOR THE SECRET SERVICE, AND $87,000 FOR A BOTTLE OF VOSS WATER FROM THE MINI BAR. ERIC WAS IN URUGUAY TO PROMOTE THE STILL-UNDER CONSTRUCTION TRUMP TOWER, PUNTA DEL ESTE, WHICH I BELIEVE TRANSLATES TO "THE PROSTITUTE OF THE EAST." ( LAUGHTER ) SOUNDS LOVELY. ( APPLAUSE ) AND IT'S NOT SLOWING DOWN. LATER THIS MONTH, WE'LL ALSO BE SUBSIDIZING ERIC AND DONALD JR. TRIP TO ATTEND THE GRAND OPENING OF THE NEW TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL AND TOWER IN VANCOUVER. IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN WHEN EVEN THE PRESIDENT'S SONS ARE LOOKING AT REAL ESTATE IN CANADA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) CANADA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE LOVE CANADA. HUGE CANADA FANS. AND WHILE TRUMP WAS DOWN THERE AT MAR-A-LAGO, TRUMP HELD A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN A FLORIDA AIRPORT AND OVER 9,000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP. IT'S THE BIGGEST CROWD TRUMP'S DRAWN TO AN AIRPORT WITHOUT DETAINING ANYONE. THE POINT OF TRUMP'S RALLY WAS TO SHOW HE WAS MAN OF THE PEOPLE, AND TO PROVE IT HE HAD A REAL LIFE PERSON JOIN HIM ON STAGE.
I JUST SAW HIM ON TELEVISION. HE SAID, I LOVE TRUMP! LET TRUMP DO WHAT HE HAS TO DO. THAT'S MY GUY RIGHT THERE. COME ON UP HERE. COME ON UP. THIS GUY WAS GREAT. HOP OVER THE FENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YES.
STEPHEN: NOTHING SCREAMS STRONG BORDERS AND EXTREME VETTING LIKE "HOP OVER THE FENCE." COME ON! BRING THAT BROKEN BOTTLE WITH YOU! COME ON! ( APPLAUSE ) AND TRUMP HAD SOME SOBERING NEWS ABOUT A RECENT ATTACK ON ONE OF OUR ALLIES.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GERMANY, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING LAST NIGHT IN SWEDEN. SWEDEN! WHO WOULD BELIEVE THIS? SWEDEN!
STEPHEN: NO ONE. NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WELL, NOT NO ONE, BUT MAYBE SOMEONE WHO SKIPS THEIR INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT ON FRIDAY NIGHT "NO INCIDENT OCCURRED IN SWEDEN." WHICH IS ACTUALLY HEADLINE NEWS THERE. "NOTHING HAPPENS, AGAIN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S VERY QUIET, VERY SAFE. NO ONE WAS MORE BAFFLED BY TRUMP'S SUPPOSED SWEDISH INCIDENT THAN THE SWEDES. THEIR FORMER PRIME MINISTER, CARL BILDT, TWEETED, "SWEDEN? TERROR ATTACK? WHAT HAS HE BEEN SMOKING? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT HAS HE BEEN SMOKING? AH, VLADIMIR PUTIN'S (BLEEP)? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT LET'S BE REAL HERE. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE HAS ACCESS TO THE LATEST INTEL AT ALL TIMES. SIR, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM? "MY STATEMENT AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SWEDEN WAS IN REFERENCE TO A STORY THAT WAS BROADCAST ON FOX NEWS CONCERNING IMMIGRANTS AND SWEDEN." OH, I GUESS TRUMP ONLY ACCEPTS INTELLIGENCE REPORTS WITH THE LOGO: "AS SEEN ON TV." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, HERE'S THE TRUTH -- THE SEGMENT TRUMP SAW ON FOX LINKED AN INCREASE IN SWEDISH CRIME TO IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES, WHEN, IN FACT, ALTHOUGH THEY'VE TAKEN IN THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS, SWEDEN'S CRIME RATE HAS FALLEN SINCE 2005. IN FACT, EXPERTS SAY 90% OF SWEDISH CRIME ACTUALLY OCCURS IN "THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAVE YOU READ THAT?
Jon: YES, I'VE HEARD OF IT.
Stephen: I HEAR IT'S PRETTY GOOD. CLEARLY, TRUMP BELIEVES EVERYTHING HE SEES ON TV IS REAL. WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN THIS OTHER TWEET: "AMERICA IS A DISASTER! OUR GIRLS ARE BROKE! OUR DEAD ARE WALKING! THE POPE'S TOO YOUNG! IT'S A SCANDAL! #SHAMELESS" ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ALL TRUE. ALL TRUE. HE'S RIGHT. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THAT. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRAGICALLY, SWEDEN IS THE THIRD NOT-A-TERRORIST ATTACK THAT HAS NOT SHOCKED THE WORLD IN THE LAST MONTH. FIRST, THERE WASN'T THE BOWLING GREENE MASSACRE. THEN NO ONE WAS LOST IN ATLANTA. AND NOW, IT'S NOT SWEDEN'S TURN. WHEN WILL IT BEGIN? BUT JUST BECAUSE THIS ATTACK DIDN'T HAPPEN, DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T SUFFER. ( LAUGHTER ) WE PAY TRIBUTE TO THEM NOW. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! UMA THURMAN IS HERE! JASON JONES IS HERE! AND WHEN WE RETURN, I HAVE A WARNING FOR PARENTS OUT THERE THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY NOT SCARED ENOUGH! STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! GOOD TO SEE YA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON?
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK!
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO NEW YORK!
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS FELLOW WAS DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS THIS WEEKEND.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU WERE DOING, MY FRIEND.
I PLAYED THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT THE N.B.A. ALL-STAR GAME.
Stephen: FANTASTIC. BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL.
Jon: THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO INTEREST MYSELF AMERICA'S DAD -- THAT I KNOW OF. ( APPLAUSE ) AND AS A PARENT, I KNOW HAVING KIDS MEANS WORRY. ARE THEY GETTING GOOD GRADES? ARE THEY HANGING WITH THE WRONG CROWD? OR WORSE, THE RIGHT CROWD? NERDS. BUT MY BIGGEST WORRY IS "AM I WORRYING ENOUGH?" THANK GOD FOR LOCAL NEWS. THEY ALWAYS UNCOVER THE LATEST TEEN TRENDS TO SOIL YOUR DAD JEANS. AND SOME OF THEM MIGHT EVEN BE HAPPENING. TONIGHT'S PARENTAL SCARE STORY COMES FROM FOX Q-13, SEATTLE'S TEEN NEWS LEADER, WHO HAS FOUND THAT OUR KIDS MAY BE TEXTING EACH OTHER... IN CODE.
TO YOUNG PEOPLE, EMOJIS CAN MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS, AND SOME CYBER EXPERTS SAY KIDS ARE STARTING TO USE SOME AS A SECRET CODE THAT WE AS PARENTS CAN'T NECESSARILY FIGURE OUT.
STEPHEN: YES, CHILDREN ARE DECEIVING US PARENTS WITH CODES. THAT MAKES ME L-O-L. "LINGER OVER LIES." ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS IS SOME SINISTER STUFF.
A FOX, YOU THINK THAT'S A SIMPLE ENOUGH THING, A FOX RIGHT, BUT THAT CAN BE A MESSAGE TO SOMEONE THAT YOU WANT TO SNEAK OUT, SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE. A SKULL, ARROW AND A FLAME, THAT CAN BE SAYING TO SOMEONE "I HOPE YOU DIE IN A FIRE." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO TRUE. SO TRUE. THESE KIDS THESE DAYS, THEY'RE SO CLEVER. ( LAUGHTER ) IN THE OLD DAYS, WE HAD TO SAY THAT IN A GREETING CARD, LIKE THIS ONE: HAPPY SWEET 16. I HOPE YOU DIE IN A FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY HURTFUL MESSAGE KIDS ARE EMOJI-ING.
THIS IS A SCARY ONE YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT -- WELL I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK-- WE GOT TWO EYEBALLS HERE.
I'M WATCHING YOU. >>YES, THAT'S ONE OF THEM. AGAIN, THESE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEANINGS. SO THIS COULD MEAN I'M WATCHING YOU. BUT WE'RE ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT SEXTING. THIS CAN ALSO MEAN, SEND ME NAKED PICTURES OF YOU.
OH, MY GOSH.
Stephen: YES, YES, SO TRUE. IT COULD ALSO MEAN "EYE WANT TO SEE YOU", "EYE WANT YOU TO COME OVER MY HOUSE", OR "EYE THINK THIS ENTIRE NEWS STORY IS BULL( BLEEP )." ( LAUGHTER ) ANY ONE OF THOSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT ONLY GETS WORSE FROM THERE.
SOME OF THESE ARE SO SIMPLE.
YEAH! A FLOWER.
A FLOWER. YOU THINK THAT'S JUST A FLOWER RIGHT?
IT MEANS YOU WANT TO BRING YOUR MOTHER FLOWERS.
WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?
YEAH!
IT CAN ALSO MEAN DRUGS.
Stephen: THERE IT IS. THAT SIMPLE. FLOWER MEANS DRUGS. TAKE THAT, GEORGIA O'KEEFE! YEP, THAT'S DEFINITELY DRUGS. JUST SAY NO, KIDS! SEE THIS DRUG? DON'T TOUCH IT. THAT'S A DRUG. BUT I DON'T THINK THIS REPORT GOES FAR ENOUGH. I CAN IMAGINE SO MANY MORE EMOJI CODES THAT KIDS COULD BE USING. FOR INSTANCE, WE ALL KNOW THE EGGPLANT EMOJI MEANS PENIS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHAT ABOUT CORN... PENIS. BURRITO... PENIS. AND I WISH YOU A MERRY PENIS. ( LAUGHTER ) NEXT, THE HEART EYES EMOJI LOOKS INNOCENT ENOUGH. SOME PEOPLE THINK IT MEANS "I LOVE YOU," BUT REMEMBER THESE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEANINGS, SO IT MAY ALSO MEAN "LET'S HAVE PREMARITAL SEX IN A GRAVEYARD." ( LAUGHTER ) AND "DANCING WOMAN" IS USUALLY UNDERSTOOD AS SOMEONE HAVING FUN OR CELEBRATING, BUT, WHEN KIDS SEND THE DANCING WOMAN, THEY'RE ACTUALLY SAYING, "LET'S KILL MY GRANDMA, THEN DANCE ON HER GRAVE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND OF COURSE ANGRY CAT MEANS, DONALD TRUMP GRABBED ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND PARENTS, IF THAT'S NOT TERRIFYING ENOUGH, TEENS MAY BE COMBINING EMOJIS TO SEND MESSAGES. FOR EXAMPLE, WAVING HAND DRESS, EGGPLANT, MOVIE TICKET MOON, LAMP MEANS "I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH YOU OVER THE CLOTHES IN AN 8:00 P.M. SHOWING OF THE OSCAR-NOMINATED MOVIE 'MOONLIGHT.'" ( LAUGHTER ) AND HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? FAMILY, PEACH, SANTA, SNOWFLAKE, STACK OF DOLLARS SEEMS LIKE A NICE CHRISTMAS MESSAGE, BUT IT TRANSLATES INTO, "MY UNCLE PETE IS A MALL SANTA, AND HE WILL SELL US COCAINE FOR CHEAP." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT HAPPENED TO A FRIEND OF MINE. THAT HAPPENED TO A SON OF A FRIEND OF MINE I KNOW. HERE'S ANOTHER: PLATE, FORK, AND KNIFE, SMILEY FACE WITH MONEY COMING OUT OF MOUTH, SKULL TRANSLATES TO "I THOUGHT MONEY WAS FOOD SO I ATE IT AND NOW I'M DEAD." ( LAUGHTER ) AND IF YOUR TEEN SENDS THE EMOJIS CHURCH, SLEEPY FACE FIRE, IT MEANS "I'M BORED IN CHURCH SO I'M GOING TO COMMIT ARSON." ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S JUST EMOJIS. THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER GROUP OF SYMBOLS TEENS ARE USING TO SEND MESSAGES. THESE CAN BE COMBINED TO MEAN ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, PLEASE, STAY SCARED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH UMA THURMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GOLDEN GLOBE-WINNING ACTRESS YOU KNOW FROM PULP FICTION AND KILL BILL. SHE NOW STARS IN BRAVO'S IMPOSTERS.

Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME UMA THURMAN! UMA! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY DON'T LEAP TO THEIR FEET FOR EVERYBODY. I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
AW!
Stephen: WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: I'M A BIG FAN. I HAVE TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE GET STARTED. I'M A HUGE FAN OF LORD OF THE RINGS, WHICH IS NO SECRET. I FOUND OUT BEFORE THE SHOW YOU TURNED DOWN A PART IN LORD OF THE RINGS?
YES.
Stephen: I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD.
Stephen: WHY? IT WAS A VERY LONG TIME AGO AND I CONSIDER IT ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS EVER MADE, BUT I HAD JUST HAD MY FIRST CHILD, AND I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW, I WAS A LITTLE HOUSEBOUND.
Stephen: DIDN'T WANT TO DRAG YOUR CHILD TO NEW ZEALAND FOR THREE YEARS?
YEAH, THAT WAS A LITTLE UNKNOWN FOR ME. BUT IT IS DEFINITELY A REGRET.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE YOU DID "KILL BILL."
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: TOTALLY DIFFERENT SWORDPLAY, THOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR DAD, ROBERT THURMAN, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: WAS A FAMOUS BUDDHIST.
HE IS STILL.
Stephen: OKAY. STILL WITH US. STILL A BUDDHIST.
IT'S WORKING FOR HIM.
Stephen: WAS THE FIRST AMERICAN TIBETAN BUDDHIST PRIEST?
MONK, YES.
Stephen: WHAT DOES A TIBETAN BUDDHIST MONK DO? WHAT DO THEY DO?
WELL, THEY LEARN TIBETAN, AND THEY MAKE VOWS, WHICH HE BROKE.
Stephen: LIKE VOWS OF CELIBACY?
YEAH.
Stephen: AND UMA THURMAN IS HERE.
YES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GLAD HE BROKE THE VOWS. WHAT WAS IT LIKE GROWING UP WITH A TIBETAN BUDDHIST. CLEAN YOUR ROOM. I DON'T WANT TO. IT'S SUFFERING.
YES, AND TRANSCEND THAT.
Stephen: HE DIDN'T MAKE YOU LEARN YOUR ABCs OR -- ( SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE )
Stephen: I TRUST YOU. ONE TIBETAN DOCTOR USED TO STAY WITH US, A VICIOUS BACKGAMMON PLAYER, AND I LEARNED TO COUNT TO SIX VERY WELL, WHICH WITH I FORGOT, BECAUSE HE WAS CHEATING ALL THE SAME TIME.
Stephen: I NEVER HEARD VICIOUS AND BUDDHIST IN THE SAME SENTENCE.
A VICIOUS BUDDHIST BACKGAMMON PLAYER.
Stephen: YOU ARE ONE OF TARANTINOS GREAT MUSES, AND "KILL BILL" VOLUMES 1 AND 2 ARE AN INCREDIBLE SERIES OF MOVIES.
THANK YOU ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: RIGHT NOW -- HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?
I HAVE THREE. I HAVE AN 18-YEAR-OLD AND A 15-YEAR-OLD AND A FOUR AND A HALF AND THREE-QUARTERS, SHE CALLS HERSELF. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AT WHAT AGE DID YOU ALLOW YOUR KIDS TO WATCH KILL BILL?
I WAITED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT I THINK IT WAS, LIKE, MAYBE FOUR YEARS AGO.
Stephen: YEAH? YEAH.
Stephen: WERE THEY, LIKE, MOM, YOU'RE BAD ASS, OR, MOM, WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU?
SOMEONE ASKED ME ABOUT THAT. MY SON WAS, LIKE, IT HURT WHEN THEY SHOT MY MOM IN THE CHEST AND NAILED HER IN THE COFFIN. I WAS GLAD I WAITED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.
Stephen: I TRIED TO KEEP MY KIDS FROM WATCH WITHING MY OLD SHOW FOR AS LONG AS I COULD. I USED MY OWN NAME AND THERE I AM SAYING THINGS I DIDN'T MEAN WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO SEE ME AS PURELY IRONIC, SO I WOULD BE PUTTING THEM IN BED AND SAY I LOVE YOU, AND THEY GO, I GET IT, DAD. SO I UNDERSTAND WANTING TO KEEP YOUR KIDS AWAY FROM YOUR WORK.
WELL, IT'S JUST NICE TO BE THE PARENT AT HOME.
Stephen: I'M JEALOUS OF ACTORS. I DABBLED WITH ACTING WHEN I WAS YOUNG. BUT I'M JEALOUS OF REAL ACTORS AND MOVIE STARS WHERE YOU GET SO INTENSIVELY INVOLVED, SO IMMERSED IN THE PROJECT YOU'RE WORKING ON. DO YOU STILL HAVE SWORD SKILLS? IF 88 MANIACS TACKED US NOW, HOW MANY COULD YOU TAKE OUT TO PROTECT ME?
I PROBABLY COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN MOST PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. FIRSTOV ALL, I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE EXITS ARE.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF TRAINING DO YOU HAVE TO DO?
BACK THEN?
Stephen: YEAH. IT WAS MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS OF TRAINING.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH, IT WAS REALLY GOOD FOR ME. I WAS A BIT OF A KLUTZ. THEY TUNED ME UP A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YOU DO NOT SEEM LIKE A KLUTZ.
THEY TUNED ME UP. THE BEST THING IS TO LEARN NEW THINGS ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: IS THAT THE FAVORITE THING YOU LEARNED IN THE IMMERSIVE WORLD OF BEING A MOVIE STAR OR DID SOMETHING STICK WITH YOU THAT'S MORE ENJOYABLE THAN THAT?
MORE ENJOYABLE THAN TENDING TO KILL PEOPLE?
Stephen: YEAH. WELL -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HARD TO IMAGINE. IT'S EASIER THAN THE MAKEOUT SCENES, I'VE GOT TO TELL YA.
Stephen: A LOVE SCENE IS HARDER?
YEAH, THERE'S MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER PERSON. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A MUCH CLEANER BUSINESS. MUCH LESS PERSONAL.
Stephen: IMPOSTERS IS THE NEW SERIES ON BRAVO.
YES.
Stephen: WHO IS LENNY COHEN AND WHERE DID THE ROLE COME FROM?
LENNY COHEN, IS THE HEAVY, YOU SAW HER BREAK SOMEONE'S ARM.
Stephen: YEAH, DIDN'T CHOP THEIR HEAD OFF.
NO, NO. SHE'S TEN FORCER FOR THE MYSTERIOUS BAD GUY, IMPOSTERS. IT'S A BLACK COMEDY ABOUT SCAMMERS AND HUSTLERS AND CON ARTISTS.
Stephen: ACTORS ARE CON ARTISTS, AREN'T THEY, IN SOME WAY?
ON A GOOD DAY.
Stephen: WHAT'S A BAD DAY? BAD DAY'S A BAD CON ARTIST.
Stephen: YOU GET CAUGHT. YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU AN ENFORCER LIKE LENNY IS IN REAL LIFE? ARE YOU A HEAVY AROUND THE HOUSE?
NOT EXACTLY.
Stephen: DO THIS OR I'LL BREAK YOUR ELBOW?
NO. THERE IS TESTIMONY ABOUT HOW I AM NOT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE A SOFTY? YEAH, I'M A YES MOM.
Stephen: YOU'RE A YES MOM? YES.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. DID YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF UPBRINGING AS WELL? WERE YOU KIND OF LIKE A FREE-RANGE KICKEN? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I WAS. I WAS THE LAST OF ELEVEN. MY MOM IS, LIKE, TEN FINGERS AND TOES, YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. GO PLAY.
SO FREE RANGE.
Stephen: I WAS ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER I WANTED, GO OFF IN THE WOODS.
I THINK THERE WAS A MIX. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE. SO I HAD A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY.
Stephen: IN THE MIDDLE OF HOW MANY?
FIVE OR FOUR, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU STARTED TO COUNT. I HAVE A HALF SISTER WHO I LOVE, WHO I DIDN'T GET TO GROW UP WITH BUT I DON'T LIKE TO EXCLUDE HER.
Stephen: I HAVE FULL BROTHERS AND SISTERS I DIDN'T GET TO GROW UP WITH.
BECAUSE THEY WERE GONE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE THE MIDDLE.
YES.
Stephen: SO IS THAT WHY YOU THINK YOU WENT INTO THE ARTS BECAUSE MIDDLE CHILDREN, OFTEN ARTISTS ARE LIKE TROUBLED CREATURES AND MIDDLE CHILDREN ARE OFTEN CALLED THE TROUBLED CHILD.
YES, THEY ARE.
Stephen: ARE YOU A TROUBLED PERSON, UMA THURMAN.
I'M NOT NOW.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE ACTING HEMS, DOESN'T IT?
ACTING HELPS. CREATIVITY HELPS.
Stephen: THE ONLY TIMES I'VE GONE INSANE IN MY LIFE AND THAT'S LIKE MEDICATED ASLEEP ALL DAY INSANE OR WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THIS, WHEN I COULDN'T WORK, THAT'S WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY.
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. GOT TO GET IT OUT. YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST, KEEP GOING.
