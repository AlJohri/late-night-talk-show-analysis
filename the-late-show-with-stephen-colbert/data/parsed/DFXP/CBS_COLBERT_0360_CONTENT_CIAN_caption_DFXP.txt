ITS PATENTED TRIPLE-LAYER CORE WITH LEAK GUARD BLOCKADE LOCKS IN INFORMATION, STOPPING THE LEAK BEFORE IT STARTS. SIMPLY REMOVE THE TRUMP LEAKAGE PROTECTION UNDERWEAR FROM THE PACKAGE, THEN PLACED OVER YOUR HEAD. NOW NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU LEAK. TRUMP LEAK AN PROTECTION UNDERWEAR WITH SPECIAL LEAK GUARD BLOCKADE. I CAN'T BREATHE IN THIS THING.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES UZO ADUBA, T.J. MILLER AND OLIVER STONE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON, JON? ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN )
Stephen: HELLO, EVERYBODY! VERY NICE. VERY NICE. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERING )
Stephen: FOLKS, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MOMENTS IN DONALD TRUMP'S BRIEF PRESIDENCY THAT HAVE RAISED EYEBROWS AND LOWERED EXPECTATIONS. BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE, BUT I'M GOING TO GUESS THINGS ARE REALLY GOING POORLY INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE TODAY HE HAD HIS FIRST FULL CABINET MEETING. THEY USUALLY HAVE THEM EARLIER THAN THIS, BUT IT WAS HARD TO SCHEDULE AROUND ALL THEIR MEETINGS WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. BUT THEY GOT THAT IRONED OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY POPULAR GUY. AND FOR THIS MEETING, THEY LET IN THE CAMERAS SO EVERY SINGLE PERSON AROUND THE TABLE COULD SPEAK FREELY. JUST WHATEVER WAS ON THEIR MIND. GOOD OR BAD! JUST THE HONEST, UNVARNISHED TRUTH. AND, FUNNY THING -- THEY ALL SAID THIS --
MR. PRESIDENT, MY PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE. I'M DEEPLY HONORED, AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE AMERICAN WORKERS.
ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE SENIOR STAFF AROUND HERE, MR. PRESIDENT, WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE BLESSING YOU'VE GIVEN US TO SERVE YOUR AGENDA.
MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT AN INCREDIBLE HONOR IT IS TO LEAD THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT THIS TIME UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR TO SERVE THE COUNTRY. IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE YOU'VE GIVEN ME.
STEPHEN: "AND MR. PRESIDENT, WE ALL WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING SUCH A BIG, BEAUTIFUL BEHIND, SO... ( LAUGHTER ) -- SO ALL OF US IN THE CABINET CAN SMOOCH IT AT THE SAME TIME." ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHO APPRECIATES DONALD TRUMP ON A LEVEL NO ONE ELSE APPROACHES.
AND WHEN I RAN, IT WAS "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, BELIEVE ME. WE'RE DOING IT, AND WE'RE DOING IT AT A MUCH FASTER PACE THAN ANYONE THOUGHT. I WILL SAY THAT NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A PRESIDENT, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, IN THE CASE OF F.D.R., HE HAD A MAJOR DEPRESSION TO HANDLE.
STEPHEN: MR. PRESIDENT, DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. SINCE YOU GOT ELECTED, MANY PEOPLE HAVE A MAJOR DEPRESSION TO HANDLE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. BUT I CAN'T GET OVER THESE FAWNING CABINET MEMBERS. THESE ARE ADULTS, SOME OF THEM BILLIONAIRES AND THEY'RE JUST HAPPY TO HAVE THEIR LEASHES YANKED AS CAMERAS ROLL FOR THE DEAR LEADER. I DID NOT KNOW THAT TRUMP HAS A STRICT "PLEASE CHECK YOUR BALLS AT THE DOOR" POLICY. ( LAUGHTER ) YES. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS NEXT-LEVEL WEIRD. AN UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC STROKE-FEST FOR AN EMOTIONALLY FRAIL MAN. OKAY? THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CHILLING, RIGHT, MARK?
RIGHT, BOSS! WHATEVER YOU SAY. IT'S AN HONOR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: NO MORE CAMERA TIME FOR HIM. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: NOW, TRUMP MAY BE FEELING INSECURE, BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT JAMES COMEY'S SENATE TESTIMONY. BECAUSE TRUMP NEVER DID ANYTHING WRONG AS HE MADE CLEAR AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE:
HE DID SAY UNDER OATH THAT YOU TOLD HIM TO LET THE FLYNN-- YOU SAID YOU HOPED THE FLYNN INVESTIGATION--
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
SO HE LIED ABOUT THAT?
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I MEAN, I WILL TELL YOU, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
AND DID HE ASK YOU TO PLEDGE --
AND THERE WOULD BE NOTHING WRONG IF I DID SAY IT ACCORDING TO EVERYBODY THAT I READ TODAY, BUT I DID NOT SAY THAT.
STEPHEN: SPOKEN LIKE A MAN WITH NOTHING TO HIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "OFFICER, I DID NOT STEAL THAT CAR, AND THERE WOULD BE NOTHING WRONG IF I DID BECAUSE STEALING'S NOT ILLEGAL, RIGHT? IT IS? OKAY, THEN PUT ME DOWN FOR 'DIDN'T DO IT.'" JUST CHECK THAT BOX. FILL IN -- I'LL DO IT. DIDN'T -- DIDN'T DO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )    THEN TRUMP WENT ON THE ATTACK TWEETING, "I BELIEVE THE JAMES COMEY LEAKS WILL BE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN ANYONE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. TOTALLY ILLEGAL? VERY 'COWARDLY!'" YES, TRUMP SAYS COMEY'S A COWARD. "YOU WANT TO ATTACK SOMEBODY? DO IT LIKE A MAN...TWEET IT FROM THE TOILET." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THERE'S NO PROOF IT'S ON THE TOILET. BY THE WEEKEND, THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION WAS JOINING IN ON WHAT INSIDERS CALLED THE "'COMEY IS A PUSSY OFFENSIVE. ONE TRUMP INSIDER EXPLAINED, IT "MINIMIZES COMEY AND UNDERMINES THE SERIOUSNESS OF HIS TESTIMONY AND CLAIMS," THE OFFICIAL NOTED, CHUCKLING. YOU ALWAYS KNOW THE HERO OF A STORY BY WHO CHUCKLES AFTER EVERYTHING THEY SAY. "WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN." ( CHUCKLES ) ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, NAME-CALLING IS A LONG-TIME TRUMP TACTIC-- "LITTLE MARCO, LYIN' TED, CROOKED HILLARY, RUDY GIULIANI." ( LAUGHTER ) HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THAT ONE. CAN'T CALL A MAN THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, COMEY'S A COWARD AND LIAR, BECAUSE TRUMP NEVER SAID, "I HOPE YOU LET FLYNN GO." NOW, TO CORROBORATE THIS FACT, LET'S GO TO  OLDEST SON AND MAN WHO WANTS TO JUST KEEP LAST NIGHT BETWEEN US GUYS, DONALD TRUMP, JR.
WHEN I HEAR THE FLYNN COMMENT-- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW MY FATHER A LONG TIME. WHEN HE TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING, GUESS WHAT? THERE'S NO AMBIGUITY IN IT. THERE'S NO, HEY, I'M HOPING YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS. HEY, I HOPE THIS HAPPENS BUT YOU GOT TO DO YOUR JOB. THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD COMEY.
STEPHEN: HE JUST CONTRADICTED EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP JUST SAID! USUALLY DONALD TRUMP DOES THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, EVERY PRESIDENT NEEDS A WAY TO BLOW OFF STEAM. WHEN THE PRESSURE OF THE JOB GETS ON THEM. TRUMP'S GOT AN INTERESTING ONE: PRESIDENT TRUMP "CAN'T STOP" CRASHING PARTIES AT HIS GOLF CLUBS. THE LATEST INCIDENT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT TRUMP DROPPED IN ON A WEDDING RECEPTION TAKING PLACE AT HIS BEDMINSTER NEW JERSEY GOLF CLUB. EVERY WEDDING HAS A BEST MAN, BUT ONLY A SELECT FEW GET THE WORST MAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) PLUS, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT WEDDINGS: SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING ORANGE, SOMEONE GET HIM AWAY FROM THE BRIDESMAIDS! ( LAUGHTER ) THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE PEOPLE THERE POSTED PICTURES LIKE THIS ONE ON INSTAGRAM. "IT'S MY DAY. IT'S MY SPECIAL DAY." "AM I PRETTY? GET THE CABINET IN HERE TO TELL ME I'M PRETTY." ACCORDING TO ONE GUEST, WHEN TRUMP ARRIVED, "THE BRIDE CAME RUNNING OUT, AND HE GAVE HER A BIG HUG AND A KISS." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) QUICK QUESTION: WHICH WAY WAS SHE RUNNING? COME ON, COME ON -- ( LAUGHTER ) NO, NO, STOP. MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THERE WAS SOME STRANGE COMMUNICATIONS FROM DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY AND SUBSTITUTE TEACHER WHO'S NOT KIDDING AROUND, MISTER, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. SHE'S DONE A SOLID JOB FILLING IN FOR SEAN SPICER, AND SHE'S EVEN ADOPTED HIS APPROACH TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND, SHE TWEETED THIS STRING OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE EMOJIS SYMBOLS, AND LETTERS. WHICH IS SURPRISING. WHY NOT STICK TO THE WHITE HOUSE'S CLEAR MESSAGE OF COVFEFE? ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S RIGHT THERE. IT'S ALL IN THERE. A SELECT FEW OF US UNDERSTAND IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT HUCKABEE SANDERS GAVE AN EXPLANATION IN HER NEXT TWEET: THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR 3-YEAR-OLD STEALS YOUR PHONE. FIRST OF ALL, HE ONLY SEEMS LIKE A 3-YEAR-OLD. HE'S GOING TO BE 71 SOON. LAUG( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRUE. BUT I'M NOT BUYING HER EXPLANATION. BECAUSE I'VE CRACKED THE CODE OF WHAT SHE TWEETED. REMEMBER, SHE WORKS WITH SEAN SPICER, AND I THINK THIS IS SPICER'S ESCAPE PLAN. LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE BY BOAT, THEN DRIVE FOUR TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO A SECOND BOAT, THEN, ONCE YOU'VE MEMORIZED YOUR MAPS, LAY LOW AND WATCH A FEW EPISODES OF CASTLE, CATCH A PROP PLANE FROM EASTER ISLAND TO KYOTO, HIDE OUT IN A CRACK HOUSE, WHERE YOU'LL MEET A WOMAN NAMED LOLA KIKKLE-KUK, AND I'M PRETTY SURE FOUNTAIN, TRAIN, TRAFFIC LIGHT, TRAIN, BOAT, TRAIN IS FOR ALL THE THINGS HE'S WILLING TO THROW HIMSELF IN FRONT OF INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO WORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD LUCK, SEAN. I HOPE YOU FLAMENCO DANCER ALL YOUR CAT WITH HEART EYES. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. UZO ADUBA IS HERE. OLIVER STONE IS HERE, T. J. MILLER IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL TALK ABOUT PORN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) â™ª
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT OVER THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEST BAND ON TELEVISION RIGHT THERE. BEST BAND ON TELEVISION. ( APPLAUSE ) YEP, RIGHT THERE. ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, FOLKS, WELCOME BACK. IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SUBJECT -- SEX! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT WAS A TRICK. NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION: PORNOGRAPHY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE LEARNING A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT CLICKS PEOPLE'S HYPERLINK, THANKS TO ONE OF THE LARGEST PORN SITES, WHOSE NAME I'M NOT ALLOWED SAY. AND THIS IS TRUE. CBS DOES NOT WANT ME TO SAY IT, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. AFTER ALL, IT IS A BIG HUB FOR PORN. IT RHYMES "CORN SCRUB," WHICH IS ACTUALLY A POPULAR GENRE OF VIDEO ON THAT WEBSITE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN A MOVE PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE KINSEY REPORT OF OUR TIME, THE SITE HAS ANALYZED A DECADE'S WORTH OF USER DATA, GRANTING US AN UNUSUAL PEEK INTO THE INTERNET'S COLLECTIVE ID. THIS REPORT IS FULL OF FASCINATING DETAILS, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT USER RUSTY GOLDMAN OF DAYTON, OHIO IS INTO SOME PRETTY FREAKY STUFF. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY, RUSTY, JUST REPORTING THE NEWS. ACCORDING TO THE DATA, IF YOU WATCHED ALL OF THE VIDEOS ON THE SITE END TO END, IT WOULD TAKE YOU 173 YEARS. THOUGH, OF THOSE 173 YEARS, MOST PEOPLE ONLY WATCH THE FIRST TWO MINUTES. ( LAUGHTER ) THE REPORT SHOWS THAT THE ELECTION PLAYED A BIG PART IN PEOPLE'S PORN SEARCHES. FOR EXAMPLE, ON ELECTION NIGHT, OVERALL U.S. PORN TRAFFIC GREW 10% AFTER DONALD TRUMP OFFICIALLY WON THE PRESIDENCY. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, THAT ELECTION ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS SEARCHED FOR "NAIVE BLONDE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING." ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO, WHEN RUMORS OF A "PEE TAPE" INVOLVING DONALD TRUMP FIRST SURFACED, SEARCHES FOR "GOLDEN SHOWERS" SPIKED BY 289%. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT I'M PRETTY SURE MOST OF THOSE SEARCHES WERE MY RESEARCH DEPARTMENT. I REALLY WANT TO FIND THAT TAPE. THIS DATA ALSO GETS INTO SPECIFICS BY STATE, SUCH AS THE FAVORITE GAY SEARCH TERM. IN ARIZONA IT'S "CHOLO", IN OKLAHOMA IT'S "COWBOY," AND IN NORTH DAKOTA IT'S "GAY BEEF" WHICH GETS EVEN MORE CONFUSING WHEN YOU LEARN THAT, IN NORTH DAKOTA, "GAY BEEF" IS WHAT THEY CALL CHICKEN. ( LAUGHTER ) TRY THE BUFFALO GAY BEEF. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT SOME OF THE MOST FUN DATA THEY RELEASED WAS THIS MAP OF EACH STATE'S MOST MISSPELLED SEARCHES INCLUDING "LESIAN," "LESBIAM," "LEBSIAM," "ANATUR," "STEP MON" AND, THE MOST COMMON, "PORM." WHICH IS LIKE PORN BUT WITH A PARMESAN BREADING. TRY THE GAY BEEF PORM. SO DELICIOUS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK'S" "CRAZY EYES," UZO ADUBA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! THANKS. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY-AWARD WINNER YOU KNOW AS SUZANNE "CRAZY EYES" WARREN IN "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK." PLEASE WELCOME, UZO ADUBA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
HI!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: FIRST TIME WE HAD YOU ON WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
YES.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU HAVE NOW WON TWO EMMYS FOR PLAYING CRAZY EYES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CRAZY. CRAZY.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ABOUT THAT. ARE YOU GETTING TIRED OF THE EMMYS? THAT OLD THING?
THAT OLD THING, YEAH -- LOOK HOW MANY YOU HAVE. YEAH, IT'S EXCITING EVERY TIME. OUR SHOW IS SO EXCITING TO DO. WE ALL HAVE SUCH A GREAT TIME THAT WEEKEND WHEN WE GO OUT THERE.
Stephen: IT'S GREAT IF YOU WIN. IF YOU DON'T WIN, YOU GO, THIS IS STUPID.
NO, NO... ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT IF YOU WIN IT'S, LIKE, IT'S GOOD TO GET TOGETHER. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER. IT'S REALLY NICE. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, SPEAKING OF IMPORTANT WORK AND BEING RECOGNIZED, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU RAN TRACK FOR B.U.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU JUST WENT BACK AND GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH.
I DID.
Stephen: WHAT AN HONOR. HOW LONG SINCE YOU GRADUATED?
IT'S BEEN 2005. SO IT'S BEEN SOME TIME.
Stephen: YEAH, 12 YEARS. BUT I HAVE BEEN BACK A FEW TIMES BEFORE THAT, BUT TO GO AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT SPEECH WAS REALLY OUT OF THIS WORLD.
Stephen: IT'S A TREMENDOUS HONOR. THE SCHOOL RECOGNIZED YOU AS SOMEBODY THEY WANTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLICLY AND, HONESTLY, NOT EVERY ALUMNI GETS THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU HAVE A MESSAGE YOU WANTED TO KIDS TO GET. WHAT WAS THE OVERALL MESSAGE?
THE THING I THOUGHT WAS MOST IMPORTANT WAS ABOUT FEAR. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER SITTING IN THOSE SEATS IN THAT TIME, SUCH A CRUCIAL TIME AND YOU'RE SO NERVOUS ABOUT SO MANY THINGS COMING UP IN YOUR LIFE AND I JUST WANTED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT FEAR IS NOT A REAL THING. IT IS SOMETHING THAT --
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN FEAR IS NOT A REAL THING?
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE BUILD UP INSIDE OF OURSELVES AND WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN PARALYZE US ESSENTIALLY.
Stephen: IT DEFINITELY CAN, YEAH.
AND STOP YOU FROM DOING THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO, AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW THEY SHOULD NEVER STOP TRYING FOR THINGS, REACHING FOR THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID. TAFS A HUGE PART OF THE SPEECH. AS SCARED AS I WAS TO BE THERE.
Stephen: SURE, BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THIS PRESSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GEM OF WISDOM FOR A YOUNGER GENERATION. THE SPEECH IS KIND OF FOR THE PARENTS, YOU KNOW, WHO HAVE INVESTED.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: AND FOR THE KIDS, AND CALMING THEM DOWN IS NOT A BAD THING TO DO. THERE ARE SOME THINGS TO BE AFRAID OF, OBVIOUSLY.
FOR SURE.
Stephen: SHARKS. NAKES.
Stephen: SURE. F.D.R. DID NOT INCLUDE THAT IN HIS SPEECH.
AT ALL.
Stephen: FEAR OF SNAKES. AND SHARKS. I WANT THEM TO KNOW, THERE ARE THINGS TO BE AFRAID OF BUT DON'T LET THOSE THINGS STOP YOU. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO INTO THE INDUSTRY OF ACTING AND MUSIC AND ART --
Stephen: WERE YOU TERRIFIED TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW? THE OLD SAW IS 95% OF PEOPLE WHO ATTEMPT TO BE ACTORS ARE UNEMPLOYED.
YES.
Stephen: SO A ONE IN TWENTY CHANCE OF GETTING ANY WORK LET ALONE THE TWO EMMYS. HAVE I SCARED YOU IN RETROSPECT?
YOU HAVE, YOU'VE SCARED ME INTO WANTING TO GIVE THEM BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS SCARY WHEN I FIRST STARTED. IT'S LIKE STEPPING INTO THE UNKNOWN. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, BUT IT WAS THE WILLINGNESS TO TRY IS THE IMPORTANT THING, AND I WAS WILLING TO TRY, AND I JUST WANTED THESE KIDS TO UNDERSTAND, JUST GO FOR IT DO. IT FREELY. I HAD SHOWN UP THERE SCARED TO DEATH. WHEN I GOT THE EPAIL TO COME AND GIVE THE SPEECH, I WAS TERRIFIED, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT CAME IN -- WHEN I CAME IN, THEY WERE, LIKE, WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER.
Stephen: DID YOU GET AN HONORARY DOCTORATE?
NO.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO GO BACK.
I THINK YOU FORGOT SOMETHING! EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I MAY HAVE THIS WRONG, BUT YOUR NAME UZO ADUBA MEANS THE ROAD IS GOOD?
YES.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT MESSAGE FOR A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU, THE ROAD IS GOOD? AND DID YOU KNOW YOUR ENTIRE LIFE THAT'S WHAT YOUR NAME MEANT?
YES, IT'S ANY FULL NAME WHICH MEANS THE ROAD IS GOOD. I GOT IT FOR M FOR MY BIRTHDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND WHEN MY PARENTS NAMED ME, YOU KNOW, THEY HAD COME TO AMERICA AND SURVIVED SO MUCH WHICH IS UZO ADUBA, THE JOURNEY WAS WORTH IT. AND NOW TRYING IN THIS BUSINESS, AUDITIONING AND A TIME QUITTING IN MY LIFE, ALL WAS WORTH IT BECAUSE IT ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT.
Stephen: AUDITIONS AND WORKING YOUR WAY UP IN THIS BUSINESS, YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS DOING THE SHOWS THAT GOT YOU THE TWO EMMYS. WERE THERE EARLY MORE QUESTIONABLE ROLES YOU DID? BECAUSE I TOOK ANYTHING TO GET IN FRONT OF A CAMERA.
ABSOLUTELY. THE FIRST ACTING JOB I HAD WAS IN MY HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF A SECRET GARDEN, I PLAYED A GHOST. VERY PROUD OF IT.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE LINES?
NO, I DID NOT. BUT I FELT THEM INSIDE.
Stephen: IT'S A PLAY ABOUT A GHOST.
EXACTLY. IF I WERE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO SPEAK, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY.
Stephen: THE NEW SEASON WAS RELEASED THIS PAST FRIDAY.
YES.
Stephen: "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK."
YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY. SEASON 5.
SEASON 5.
Stephen: WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THE NEW SEASON?
OOH, OKAY. WE CAN EXPECT NO SPOILERS. WE CAN EXPECT THE SHOW TAKES PLACE OVER THREE DAYS, WHICH IS NOT HOW IT'S GONE IN THE PAST.
Stephen: THE WHOLE SEASON'S HERE.
THE WHOLE SEASON, 72 HOURS, THAT'S THE ENTIRE SHOW.
Stephen: LAST SEASON'S SPOILER ENDED WITH THE INMATES TAKING OVER THE PRISON.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SO NOW WE PICK UP RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT AND WE SEE THE PRISONERS, THEY TAKE CONTROL OF THE PRISON, AND THEY'RE IN POWER, AND WE GET TO SEE WHAT EACH OF THESE WOMEN DO WHEN THEY HAVE POWER OR BECOME EMPOWERED.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP IN HERE. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS ONE?
THIS CLIP IS ABOUT THE BLUE SKY. THE SKY THE BLUE.
Stephen: THE SKY IS BLUE, JIM.
AGAIN, I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT HOW A GOOD NIGHT'S REST MIGHT SOLVE A MYRIAD OF EMOTIONAL ISSUES! YOU THINK YOUR FEELINGS ARE REAL, BUT THEY'RE NOT. TRUST ME. IT'S, LIKE, THE SKY IS BRING, RIGHT? BUT WHEN THERE ARE CLOUDS, YOU THINK IT'S GREY, BUT REALLY IT'S STILL BLUE. IT HASN'T CHANGED, IT'S JUST COVERED WITH GREY CLOUDS PASSING BY. NOW, THE CLOUDS ARE YOUR FEELINGS. THE SKY IS HOW IT REALLY IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
STEPHEN: SEASON 5 OF "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK" IS STREAMING NOW ON NETFLIX. UZO ADUBA, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH T.J. MILLER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! TO THE BROADCAST. YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "SILICON VALLEY" AND "DEADPOOL." HIS NEW STANDUP SPECIAL IS "METICULOUSLY RIDICULOUS." PLEASE WELCOME T.J. MILLER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
IT'S A WORRY RING I WEAR AFTER THE ELECTION.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT? IT'S A WORRY RING I WEAR WHEN I HAVE ANXIETY.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. I HAVE ONE OF THOSE, TOO.
I HAVE IT ON BOTH SIDES.
Stephen: ARE YOU MARRIED? I AM. MY WIFE'S RIGHT BACK THERE.
Stephen: REALLY? YOUR WIFE'S BACK THERE? HELLO!
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? SOMEBODY FELL FOR IT!
Stephen: WHAT'S HER NAME? HEY, IT'S KATE MILLER, EVERYBODY!
I WAS IN A MOVIE CALLED SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE AND IT'S ALSO MY LIFE. IT'S SO RIDICULOUS BUT SHE'S AMAZING. WE'RE ALSO VERY BAD CHESS PLAYERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO PLAY BAD CHESS. I JUST MOVED TO NEW YORK AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE, YOU GUYS.
Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU TO THE BIG CITY OF DREAMS.
STANDUP COMEDY. SHE MOVED UP AFTER COLLEGE AND I WENT TO VISIT HER AND WENT TO A STANDUP COMEDIAN AND I FOLLOWED HIM BECAUSE I OVERHEARD HE WENT TO THE CELLULAR AFTER THIS SET AND HAD ANOTHER SET AFTER THAT SO I FOLLOWED HIM LIKE A REAL CREEPY GUY TO EACH OF TEASE COMIC SHOWS AND SAW HOW HE CHANGED HIS ACT AND IT BLEW MY MIND THAT YOU COULD DO FIVE, SIX SETS, TEN SETS -- I'VE DONE TEN SETS IN ONE NIGHT IN NEW YORK CITY, AND I'M A PUBLIC SERVANT AND COMEDY'S THE OPIATE I OFFER AS A DRUG DEALER TO YOU. ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: YOU'RE A VERY BUSY MAN. YOU'RE STARRING IN TH THE EMOJI MOVIE, THE NEW "DEADPOOL" MOVIE AND THE OLD "DEADPOOL" MOVIE.
I AM STARRING IN A MOVIE THAT IS CALLED "THE EMOJI MOVIE." ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW WE'RE LIVING IN A POST, POST REAL SOCIETY WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION, BUT IT'S ALSO I'M IN A MOVIE ABOUT EMOJIS CALLED "THE EMOJI" GO AHEAD.
Stephen: THEY MADE A GAME CALLED BATTLESHIP.
YES, WHICH WASN'T AS GOOD AS THE FIRST. HOLLYWOOD, WHAT WILL YOU DEAL US NEXT?
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW STANDUP ON HBO CALLED "METICULOUSLY RIDICULOUS."
YES, IT'S JUNE 17 ON HBO. I INVITE YOU ALL TO WATCH IT AND SORT OF BE POLARIZED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU HATE IT OR LOVE IT.
Stephen: WHY WOULD WOULD ANYONE HATE IT? THIS IS COMEDY, THE OPIATE OF THE MASSIVE.
IT'S A DIVISIVE SPECIAL. IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY ONES WHO IS WORKING AND AN ANIHILIST. A POS PIF ANIHILIST.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT CALLED AN OP OPTIMIST? ( APPLAUSE )
TRULY THE BEST IN THE GAME! UPONLY ONE REVIEW HAS COME IN FOR THE SPECIAL. FROM THE SIOUX CITY JOURNAL.
Stephen: OH. THAT'S A TOUGH CROWD.
AND IT IS THE BEST.
Stephen: SIOUX CITY, IOWA? I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE SIOUX CITY IS. I THINK IT'S IN IOWA, RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH. YEAH! WELL, THIS GUY NAMED BRUCE MILLER ABSOLUTELY PANNED THE SPECIAL, ATTACKED THE IDIOCY OF IT. IT'S WELL WRITTEN, WHICH I ALSO LOVE. HE WRITES, THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF STRUTTING IN THE SPECIAL. MILLER HAS A HABIT OF DEMONSTRATING HIS INTELLIGENCE, BUT IT DOESN'T LEAD ANYWHERE -- ANYWHERE FUNNY, THAT IS. PRETTY GOOD. AND RIGHT FROM THE THREE-POINT LINE, BRUCE, SWISH! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN IT SAYS --
Stephen: YOU KNOW, NO ONE WOULD HAVE READ THIS UNTIL YOU READ IT OUT LOUD, RIGHT? YOU'RE UPDRAFTING A MAN WHO HATES YOU RIGHT NOW.
I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. SO THEN HE WRITES, WHEN HE LAM POONS HIMSELF AS A STAR OF OWING WHERE BEAR 3-D, WHICH I NEVER MADE FUN OF MYSELF FOR DOING THAT, THAT'S THE GREATEST TALKING BEAR COMEDY IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA, WHEN HE LAM POONS HIMSELF, HE'S MUCH BETTER OFF. MILLER ADMITS HE SPENT $73,000 LAST YEAR ON CARNIVAL GAMES ALONE, A BIT OF INSIGHT INTO HIS TENDENCIES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. ( APPLAUSE )
NOW, LOOK, AS AN ABSURDIST, THAT IS AN ABSURDIST PIECE OF MATERIAL. IT'S NOT TRUE. BUT THIS MAN IN SIOUX CITY, IOWA, BELIEVES THAT I SPENT 73 7 73 -- CARNIVAL GAMES COST BETWEEN 1 AND $5 USUALLY -- I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A PROBLEM, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE IDEA YOU HAVE WOULD HAVE TO PLAY 30,000 GAMES TO SPEND $73,000, WHAT DOES HE THINK I'M -- ACTUALLY, IT'S WHY I LEFT SILICON VALLEY. ALL I DO IS PLAY CARNIVAL GAMES EVERY DAY. KATE AND I, WE TRAVEL WITH THE COUNTY FAIR AND WE GO, FLY, MEET THEM THERE AND I PLAY MORNINGS TO NIGHT. I'VE HIRED A GUY WHO STANDS NEXT TO ME WITH A BRASS BALL OVER THE BUCKET AND WHEN I START TO FALL ASLEEP, H HE DROPS THE BALL IN THE BUCKET AND I KIND OF WAKE UP AND KEEP THROWING THE DART AT THE BALLOONS! ( CARNIVAL UKE MUSIC PLAYING ) SO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT GET THE SPECIAL, AND ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE BETRAYED HIS OWN NAME -- BRUCE, IF YOU'RE OUT THERE LISTENING, YOU FOOL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU FOOL. IT WOULD BE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM SPEND $73,000 PLAYING CARNIVAL GAMES. THE IDEA THAT YOU BELIEVE IT -- IN FACT, KATE -- I KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) SO KATE SURMISED --
Stephen: JUST SO WE KNOW, WE TURNED OFF THE CAMERA ABOUT TWO MINUTE AGO.
FINE, FINE. ROUGH RIFF HEY, LISTEN, BUDDY, FOR ME, IF THIS IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE AT HOME, WHO CARES ABOUT THAT. IT'S ABOUT YOU GUYS RIGHT HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "METICULOUSLY RIDICULOUS" PREMIERES THIS SATURDAY ON HBO. T. J. MILLER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OLIVER STONE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS -- MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNING FILMMAKER KNOWN FOR "PLATOON," "WALL STREET," AND "J.F.K."-- FOR HIS NEW DOCUMENTARY, HE SPENT OVER 20 HOURS INTERVIEWING VLADIMIR PUTIN.
YOU DO REALIZE HOW POWERFUL YOUR ANSWER COULD BE IF YOU SAID SUDDENLY THAT YOU PREFERRED X CANDIDATE, HE WOULD GO LIKE THAT TOMORROW, AND IF YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T LIKE TRUMP OR SOMETHING, RIGHT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? HE WOULD WIN, RIGHT? YOU HAVE THAT AMOUNT OF POWER IN THE U.S.
THANK YOU, SIR. WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. TALK ABOUT SOME HEAVIER STUFF.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME OLIVER STONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! GLAD TO SEE YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. NOT TOO LONG AGO.
Stephen: WE'VE TALKED A FEW TIMES OVER THE YEARS.
WE HAVE.
Stephen: LAST TIME WE WERE HERE, ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE INTERVIEW, I ASKED YOU A QUESTION AND YOU SAID THAT'S COMPLEX, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GET PHILOSOPHICAL. I DO WANT TO TALK PHILOSOPHICAL. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S TRUTH AND WHAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND, SO LET'S TALK ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN. YOU SPENT 20 HOURS WITH THIS GUY AND PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE GETTING TOO COZY. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO SAY YOURS IS A FAWNING INTERVIEW OF A BRUTAL DICTATOR?
YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE BECAUSE IT WAS A TWO-YEAR DEAL AND I WAS WITH HIM NUMEROUS TIMES, CATCHING UP WITH HIM.  HE HAS A BUSY SCHEDULE. HE WORKS 12 HOUR DAYS FOR ALMOST 16 YEARS NOW. IT'S POLITENESS, CURIOSITY AND IT'S THE WAY YOU ASK THE QUESTIONS. HE RESPECTED ME AND MY WORK AND KNEW I WOULD GIVE HIM A FAIR HEARING AND WOULDN'T BE COPPED INTO PIECES.
Stephen: THE 40 SECONDS OR MINUTE YOU SAW WHERE YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT INTERFERING IN ELECTIONS AND HE SAID THIS IS SOMETHING WE DON'T DO, IS YOUR RESPONSE, WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT MOMENT, IS THIS CONTIGUOUS TIME.
I TOOK THAT AT FACE VALUE. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR HIM AND HE KEEPS INSISTING ON IT.
Stephen: NO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION. IT SEEMS LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO MERELY PROPAGANDIZE.
IN THE FOURTH HOUR, WE WENT ON. I PRESSED HUM ON THE ELECTION COMING UP FOR HIM IN 2018, AND I ALSO PRESSED HIM ON THE THIS ISSUE OF MR. TRUMP, THE WHOLE HACKING THING AND CYBERWARFARE. THE CYBER WARFARE IS VERY COMPLEX. I DON'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY.
Stephen: AFTER SPENDING 20 HOURS WITH THE GUY, DO YOU TRUST HIM?
I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE THE FILM FOR YOURSELF.
Stephen: I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION, DO YOU TRUST HIM AFTER SPENDING 20 HOURS WITH HIM?
HE'S THE HEAD OF STATE AND HAS HIS OWN INTERESTS OF RUSSIA AT MIND. I RESPECT HIM FOR THAT. I UNDERSTAND WHY HE DOES IT. HE'S A STRONG NATIONALIST. HE WENT THROUGH A HISTORY OF 16 YEARS SINCE 2000 TILL NOW OUTLINING WHAT ARE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. HAS BEEN. I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM BAD MOUTH THE U.S. I HEARD HIM TRY TO REACH OUT AND HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. HE CALLED THEM OUR PARTNERS REPEATEDLY. I ALMOST MADE FUN OF IT AT SOME POINT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM THE PARTNERSHIP IS WORKING BOTH WAYS. HE WANTS STILL A PARTNERSHIP. THERE IS A STRONG FEELING THAT HE CAN STILL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. THAT I DID NOT -- I FELT VERY GENUINE ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: WHEN I WATCH THIS DOCUMENTARY WHICH I WILL DO, WHAT WILL SURPRISE ME MOST IN THE FOUR HOURS AT THE I SEE? ABOUT HIM.
THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND A LOT OF IT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVEN'T HEARD. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW YOU THINK. I THINK HE'S DEVOTED TO HIS COUNTRY, AND I'M AMAZED AT HIS CALMNESS, HIS COURTESY. HE NEVER REALLY SAID ANYTHING -- BAD MOUTH ANYBODY. HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT. HE'S BEEN INSULTED AND ABUSED. I DIDN'T SENSE ANY KIND OF -- ABUSED IN THE PRESS, IN THE MEDIA. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I DIDN'T SENSE ANY KIND OF ANGER ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: ANYTHING ABOUT HIM NEGATIVE YOU -- YOU FOUND? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ANYTHING? ANYTHING? OR DOES HE HAVE YOUR DOG IN A CAGE SOMEPLACE? ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT IS WRONG WITH RUSSIA? WHY WOULD YOU BE AGAINST IT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS MENTALITY OF -- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU HATE TRUMP.
Stephen: HATE'S A STRONG WORD.
IT IS A STRONG WORD.
Stephen: I DON'T TRUST HIM. YOU DON'T TRUST HIM. SO, THEREFORE, RUSSIA IS CONVENIENT --
Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OUR PRESIDENT WILL NEVER SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN GIVEN THAT PUTIN IS AN OPPRESS YOU'VE LEADER OF HIS COUNTRY WHO SUPPRESSES THE FREE PRESS AND ARRESTS HIS ENEMIES. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I AS AN AMERICAN OR MEMBER OF THE PRESS CAN RESPECT. AND I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU DO RESPECT THAT.
WELL YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOR FREE SPEECH.
Stephen: YES, HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE H HE WOULD BE A HERO OF THAT.
LISTEN, NO QUESTION, HE'S A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE. IN THAT WAY, HE BELIEVES THAT -- ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING, BUT --
Stephen: BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A MILD DESCRIPTION, THAT'S WHY THEY'RE LAUGHING. I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT WATT YOU WANT TO SAY HERE, BUT --
WELL, WHAT I SAID IS IN THIS FOUR-HOUR DOCUMENTARY. IF YOU WATCH IT PATIENTLY, I THINK IT'S DEVELOPED, IT'S A FILM THAT HAS A FLOW FROM 2000 TO 2016, '17, IT HAS A LOT OF WORK IN IT. WE WENT BACK AFTER THE ELECTION TO TALK TO HIM SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE ELECTION. IT'S ALL DONE IN THAT VEIN AND EVERYTHING IS ABOVE BOARD. THESE THINGS WHERE -- HAS HE MURDERED A MAN? I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO ASK HIM THAT QUESTION. I LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE, TOO, AND IF I BELIEVED IT, I WOULD GO AFTER IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, MR. STONE. THE PUTIN INTERVIEWS A FOUR-PART SERIES AIRS THIS WEEKEND ON SHOWTIME ALONG WITH A COMPANION BOOK. OLIVER STONE, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
STEPHEN: THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE OLIVIA WILDE, EDDIE IZZARD, AND MUSICAL GUEST, "NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS." NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, SALMA HAYEK PINAULT, AND SOFIA COPPOLA. GOODNIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
