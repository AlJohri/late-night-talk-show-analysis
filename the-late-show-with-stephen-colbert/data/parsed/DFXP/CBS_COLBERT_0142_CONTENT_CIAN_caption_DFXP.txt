ARE YOU READY FOR MAIRK UP?
Stephen: YEAH. I WANT TO TRY A DIFFERENT LOOK TONIGHT, THOUGH.
OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT'S A LITTLE TOO SALVADOR DAWLEY. SOMETHING ELSE. OOH, I LIKE McGREET, BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE MY GUESTS. SOMETHING ELSE. WOW! PICASSO IS BOLD, BUT MY GLASSES WON'T FIT. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING SIMPLE AND MASCULINE. OH, YEAH, SEXY GINGER.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MATT BOMER ZACH WOODS AND A PERFORMANCE BY COMEDIAN NICK GRIFFIN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY! BOOM! BA! WELCOME. HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY, YOU DOWN THERE. SORRY, I DROPPED MY PHONE. I DROPPED MY PHONE. I ALWAYS JUST CARRY A PHONE WITH ME. JUST IN CASE. I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA TALK TO-- SORRY, I GOTTA GO. HEY, EVERYBODY. LET ME HAVE A SHOT OF THAT. ACTUALLY, LET ME HAVE A SHOT OF THAT. AND... WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. HI, JON.
Jon: HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAPPY TO BE HERE. IT IS MY BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, 15 AND A HALF, 33, IN CASE YOU WANT TO GET ME SOMETHING. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY, AND WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY, EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY'S CLOSED DOOR MEETING BETWEEN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN AND SPEAKER OF THE MOUTH DONALD TRUMP. EVERYBODY. ALL THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IT WENT GREAT. BUT BRING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TOGETHER IS GOING TO BE A SLOW PROCESS BECAUSE PAUL RYAN STRESSED THAT "IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE DON'T FAKE UNIIFYING." OKAY, YEAH. PAUL RYAN DOESN'T WANT TO FAKE IT AND TRUMP IS HAVING TROUBLE FINDING THE G.O.P. SPOT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I HEAR IT'S A MYTH. I HEAR--
Jon: HEY, HEY!
Stephen: I HEAR THE G.O.P. SPOT IS A MYTH. ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDES, PEOPLE CAN SMELL FAKE UNITY A MILE AWAY, WHETHER IT'S THE REUNITED GUNS N' ROSES OR POST-CIVIL-WAR AMERICA. IT DOESN'T-- WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING IN THE NEWS? WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING. OH, RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP. ACCORDING TO THE "WASHINGTON POST," BACK IN THE EARLY 90s HE WOULD CALL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS PRETENDING TO BE HIS OWN PUBLICIST TO BRAG ABOUT HIMSELF, HE HID BEHIND A FAKE NAME. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS ASHAMED TO SAY HOW TREMENDOUS HE IS. THE "WASHINGTON POST" SAYS THEY HAVE RECORDINGS OF MULTIPLE CALLS FROM "PUBLIC RELATIONS MEN WHO SOUND PRECISELY LIKE TRUMP HIMSELF GOING BY THE NAME OF JOHN MILLER AND SOMETIMES JOHN BARON. WHO SAID THINGS ABOUT TRUMP LIKE "HE'S DOING "HE'S DOING TREMENDOUSLY WELL FINANCIALLY." "MADONNA WANTS TO GO OUT WITH HIM. CARLA BRUNI IS LEAVING MICK JAGGER TO DATE HIM. ON TOP OF THOSE TWO, HE'S GOT THREE OTHER GIRLFRIENDS. AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT THE SECRET GIRLFRIENDS HE'S GOT IN CANADA." AND IN THE 90s, TRUMP ADMITTED UNDER OATH HE WAS JOHN MILLER, AND THE WHOLE THING WAS A "JOKE GONE AWRY." SO A LOT LIKE HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HE ALWAYS TELLING HIS STORY, MAN.
Stephen: BUT THIS MORNING ON "THE TODAY SHOW," TRUMP SAID SAID THIS.
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE TAPE? IS IT YOU?
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME AT ALL.
Stephen: WOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT GUY ON THE PHONE WAS, BUT HE DOES ONE HELL OF A JOHN MILLER IMPRESSION. CLEARLY DONALD TRUMP ACTED AS HIS OWN PUBLICIST UNDER A PRETEND NAME, WHICH IS ODD, BUT NO ODDER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE'S EVER DONE. AND I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON FOR HIM TO DENY-- (PHONE RINGS) SORRY, I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE SHUT THIS OFF. HOLD ON, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS. HELLO.
HELLO, STEPHEN? THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S NEW P.R. SPOKESMAN, JOHN ALD, UH... MELANIA-WITZ. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M SORRY, MELANIA-WITZ?
I MEAN, BARRON McJOHNINGTON. ANYWAY, LISTEN HERE, DUMMY. I WAS WATCHING YOUR SHOW, AND I DON'T LIKE THE LIES YOU'RE TELLING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS MY INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL BOSS AND DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT GUY THAN ME. LAUGH
Stephen: WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING THAT BACK IN THE 1990s DONALD TRUMP DID NOT PRETEND TO BE HIS OWN PUBLICIST?
OF COURSE NOT. HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME BACK THEN. HE WAS TOO BUSY BANGING MADONNA, AND JESSICA RABBIT.
Stephen: LOOK, MR. McJOHNINGTON, JESSICA RABBIT WAS ANIMATED.
SHE SURE WAS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WE HAD LOONY TUNE SEX. I MEAN, DONALD TRUMP DID.
Stephen: COME ON, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY DONALD TRUMP.
I WISH I WAS. THE MAN IS A GOD, AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF CHARISMA AND SEXUAL ENERGY. SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD HAVE SEX WITH HIM MYSELF.
Stephen: LOOK, MR. MCJOHNINGTON--
WHO'S THAT?
Stephen: IT'S YOU.
NOT ANYMORE. HE GOT FIRED. I'M HIS NEW PUBLICIST, MILL-JOHN IVANKA-TOWER.
Stephen: LOOK, MR. TRUMP--
MR. TRUMP IS NOT AVAILABLE. HE'S MAKING LOVE TO TAYLOR SWIFT ON A BOAT MADE OF STEAKS. THE BEST. GOT TO GO!
Stephen: HELLO? I GOTTA GO, TOO, HEY. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY.

Stephen: HEY, DO YOU GUYS LIKE EMOJIS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE THEM. THEY ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS. THEY EXPRESS HOW I FEEL WHETHER I'M FEEL HAPPY OR SAD OR FLAG OF NORWAY. ALL OF MY FEELINGS. EVERYBODY LIKES EMOJIS BUT NOT EVERYONE IS PROPERLY REPRESENTED IN EMOJIS. FOR INSTANCE, WOMEN ARE NOT WELL REPRESENTED IN THE EMOJI WORLD. BUT I JUST READ THAT GOOGLE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S GOING TO START PRODUCING NEW EMOJIS THAT WILL REPRESENT PROFESSIONAL WOMEN SUCH AS SCIENTISTS, DOCTOR, EDUCATORS, AND FARMERS. THE FARMER EMOJI, OF COURSE, FERTILIZER HER FIELD WITH THE POOP EMOJI. I'M GLAD EMOJIS ARE BECOMING MORE INCLUSIVE. IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY ADDED SKIN COLOR OPTIONS TO REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO DON'T V HAVE JAUNDICE. APPARENTLY, EVEN THOUGH WOMEN USE EMOJIS MORE THAN MEN, THEY'RE A LITTLE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THE EMOJI-VERSE. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW UNEVEN IT IS. IF YOU'RE A MAN IN THE WORLD OF EMOJI, YOU CAN BE A POLICE OFFICER, A BRITISH PALACE GUARD, A SANTA WITH A WEIRD FLESH-BEARD, A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, A... I WANT TO SAY BIKE HELMET SALESPERSON? A SWAMI, A CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHO ALSO SELLS POT, AND THE SAXOPHONE PLAYER FOR STAY HUMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PUT IT UP! JIMMY-- ( LAUGHTER ) FANTASTIC! I CAN'T TELL-- WAIT, WHICH ONE OF YOU IS REAL? WHICH ONE OF YOU DO I SHOOT? I DON'T-- EDDIE, DO YOU GET ANY CASH? DO YOU GET YOUR BEAK WET ON THAT ONE? NO, NO MONEY? I WOULD SUE. I WOULD DEFINITELY SUE. NOW, ON THE FEMALE SIDE, YOU CAN BE A PRINCESS, A BRIDE, A FLAMENCO DANCER, OR THE TWO SLICES OF BREAD IN A HUGH HEFNER SANDWICH. NOT EXACTLY A TON OF OPTIONS FOR WOMEN. AND WHEN EMOJI MEN AREN'T WORKING AT THEIR MARIJUANA FACTORY JOBS, THEY CAN DO ALL SORTS OF LEISURE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS RUNNING, WALKING WHILE SLOUCHING UPON GOLFING, SURFING ROWING A BOAT, SWIMMING, BIKING OBIKING PAST A MOUNTAIN, TOURING THE WORLD UNDER THE STAGE NAME JOHN APPLESEED,  WEIGHTLIFTING RIDING A HORSE, OR BEING A LEVITATING BLUES BROTHER. SUPER USEFUL. BUT FOR WOMEN, EMOJIS DON'T HAVE AS MANY OPTIONS. IF YOU WANT TO REPRESENT WHAT YOU DO TO RELAX THERE'S... WELL... DID I MENTION YOU CAN FLAMENCO DANCE? AND MAYBE SURF-- HARD TO TELL THE SEX BETWEEN THE LONG HAIR AND SURF SLACKS. AND, HEY, MAYBE THE PERSON RIDING THE GONDOLA IS A WOMAN? OR MAYBE IT'S A WOMAN FLYING THIS ROCKET. AND MAYBE THIS GHOST WAS A WOMAN. AND SHE HAD A GREAT CAREER AS A CHEMICAL ENGINEER, BUT KILLED HERSELF WHEN SHE REALIZED HER ONLY LEISURE ACTIVITY WAS FLAMENCO DANCING. SO I DO HOPE THE EMOJI WORLD GETS A FEW MORE WOMEN, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S A BIT OF AN EGGPLANT-FEST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MATT BOMER.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. I THINK I JUST DROOLED ON MY NOSE JUST NOW. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A GOLDEN GLOBEWINNER WHO YOU KNOW FROM "WHITE COLLAR" AND "MAGIC MIKE." HIS NEW MOVIE IS "THE NICE GUYS."

IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
Stephen: I'M WORKING ON MY BIRTHDAY. IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR AT ALL. I HEARD SOMETHING, DID YOU REALLY COME HERE ON THE SUBWAY?
YEAH, DI. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR IN THE CAR IN NEW YORK RAINY TRAFFIC RUSH HOUR, WE SWITCHED OVER TO THE SUBWAY, HOPPED ON THE "E" TRAIN, AND WE'RE HERE.
Stephen: DID YOU GET ANY ATTENTION? WERE PEOPLE LIKE, "HEY, IT'S KEN FROM "MAGIC MIKE." SHAKE IT UP.

I HEARD. IT GOT A LITTLE HAIRY BUT YOU WERE A GREAT MEDIATOR.
RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE WERE FIGHTING OVER WHO NEEDED ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER. THAT RUSSELL CROWE IS AN INTIMIDATING GUY. YOU FIGHT HIM IN THIS MOVIE?
I DO FIGHT HIM QUITE EXTENSIVELY. I FIGHT BOTH OF THEM WHICH WAS FUN. OT TO PLAY GROWN-UP COP COPS AND ROBBERS. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I FILMED WHERE RUSSELL WAS CHOKING ME QUITE SEVERELY AND, YOU KNOW--

Stephen: HE SAYS HE DOESN'T DO HIS OWN STUNTS.
OH, YES HE DOES.
Stephen: HE SAYS HE DOESN'T. HE SAID HE LEAVES IT TO THE OTHER GUYS. HE DOES HIS OWN STUNT.
YEAH, BUT WE MADE IT SURE WE HAD IT DOWN PAT AND HAD THREE TAKES INSTEAD OF 20. I WAS TERRIFIED. I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WILL CHOKE ME OUT. HE WON'T KILL ME, BUT HE MIGHT CHOKE ME. IT WILL BE GREAT, IT WILL BE LEGITIMATE. WE'LL GET IT ON CAMERA. I'LL WAKE UP AT SOME POINT TO MELLING SALT SALTS AND EVERYBODY WILL SAY GO HOME, GREAT JOB. BUT HE WAS GREAT ABOUT IT AND RELAXING ME, AND AS HE PUT HIS LARGE THUMBS ON MY JUGULAR, HE SAID, "THIS IS IS FOR "MAGIC MIKE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AT WHICH POINT --
YOU HAVE MADE IT. A LOT OF GUYS ARE ON BOARD WITH THAT SENTIMENT, I GOTTA SAY. YOU GUYS-- ALL YOU FIT PEOPLE MADE IT TOUGHER FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON'T FLASH IT AS MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO PERHAPS HAVE HAD MORE BIRTHDAYS THAN YOU HAVE HAD. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU FEEL ANY GUILT ABOUT THAT?
THERE'S HOW FIT YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE DOING "MAGIC MIKE" AND THERE'S THE FIT YOU ARE WHEN WH YOU'RE NOT DOING "MAGIC MIKE" AND IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

I GOT YOU MAGNOLIA DONUTS AND CUPCAKE S.

Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
MMM!
Stephen: I'M ON A BUTTER HIGH RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. YOU PLAY AN ASSASSIN IN THIS MOVIE.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU PREP FOR THAT? HOW DO YOU METHOD FOR PLAYING AN ASSASSIN? DO YOU DO A RIDE-ALONG OR SOMETHING?
WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE BRILLIANT, DIRECTOR, WRITER, SHANE BLACK, WHO HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF MY FORMATIVE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCES, HE DID "KISS KISS BANG BANG," WROAGHT "LETHAL WOMAN" I GOT TO DO REALLY FUN EXEPSIVE ARMS TRAINING BUT IT'S KIND OF A TESTAMENT TO HIS TWISTED SENSE OF HUMOR THAT THIS CHARACTER WHO IS THIS MERCLESS COLD-BLOODED ASSASSIN COMES IN THE VISAGE OF JOHN BOY FROM "THE WALTONS." EVERYONE 25 AND UNDER IS LIKE, WHO? HE BASICALLY IN THE 70s ALL YOU ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD WHOLEHEARTEDLINESS, AND HERE HE IS A COLD-BLOODED ASSASSIN. SO JUST THAT DICHOTOMY ALONE WAS FUN TO PLAY WITH.
Stephen: DID YOU MEET AN ASSASSIN?
NO, NO, I DIDN'T. THEY WERE HARD TO FIND. I PUT AN AD OUT THERE. NO ONE RESPOND --
HOLD ON A SECOND. HOLD ON A SECOND. I'M GOING TO SELL THIS ON E-BAY NOW. ( LAUGHTER )
AND MY MOM WILL BUY IT FOR 50 CENTS.

VERY SWEET.
Stephen: ARE YOUR PARENTS DOWN WITH YOU BEING AN ACTOR? SOMETIMES PARENTS WORRY ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY SOME PLACES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH-- WHERE IN TEXAS ARE YOU FROM?
I'M FROM OUTSIDE HOUSTON FROM A TOWN CALLED SPRING.
Stephen: NOT A LOT OF SHOW BUSINESS IN SPRING, TEXAS, I'M GUESSING.
NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen: WERE YOU PARENTS WORRIED ABOUT YOU GOING INTO SHOW BUSINESS OR WERE THEY VERY SUPPORTIVE?
THEY DID. THEY WERE A LITTLE RIT CENT. WHATEVER THE 1996 EQUIVALENT OF A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION IS I GAVE THEM IN TERMS OF HOW I WAS GOING TO AUDITION FOR CONSERVATORIES AND WHEN I WAS DONE WITH CONSERVATORIES HOW I WOULD GET AN AGENT AND LAID OUT THE GAME PLAN AS BEST I COULD FOR THEM TO ASSUAGE THEIR FEARS.
Stephen: YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A CHILD AT THIS POINT.
I WAS 17.
Stephen: THAT'S GETTING THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: WERE YOU A THEATER NERD AS A KID?
YEAH.
Stephen: THEATER CAMP AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
ABSOLUTELY. I DIDN'T DO THE CAMP SO MUCH BECAUSE I ALSO PLAYED SPORTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU PLAY? WHAT WAS YOUR SPORT?
FOOTBALL AND TRACK, NO BIG DEAL. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ME, TOO, I PLAYED--
BY THE WAY, NEITHER OF WHICH I WAS VERY GOOD AT.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT AS NERDY AS IT COULD BE. I PLAYED HACKY SACK.
I ENVY THOSE GUYS, MAN BECAUSE I CAN'T SACK FOR CRAP. IS THAT THE PROPER TERM, SACK?
Stephen: I LIKE IMAGINING IT.
YEAH, YEAH. I CAN'T SACK FOR CRAP.
Stephen: SACK FOR CRAP.
I CAN'T, I CAN HIT IT MAYBE TWO, THREE TIMES AND I'M DONE.

WHAT YOU DID TOOK INCREDIBLE GUT AND THE FACT THAT IT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE MAKES IT ALL THE MORE MEANINGFUL. I SAW THIS NATURE DOCUMENTARY WHERE A BISON FOUGHT A LION TO PROTECT THE REST OF THE HERD. AND IT WAS SO MOVING.

I AM SO SELF-CONSCIOUS THAT IF I WATCH IT, I JUST-- I'M A WRITHING MESS. SO I DON'T WATCH IT. FOR ALL I KNOW IT'S A TERRIBLE SHOW.

YEAH, THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WATCH YOURSELF ON TV YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE FULL WEIRDNESS OF YOUR OWN FACE. EVEN NOW, I JUST LOOKED AT ONE OF THESE MONITORS AND FELT LIKE AN ICE CUBE MELTING IN MY CHEST.
Stephen: ACTUALLY, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY TRANSCENDENTLY NORMAL-LOOKING PERSON.

YEAH, THE NORMAL SIDE, THE LESS-- HE'S SORT OF A MATERNAL PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE AND I SORT OF BASED HIM ON MY MOM.
Stephen: THAT'S SWEET. DOES SHE KNOW THIS?
SHE DOES KNOW IT.
Stephen: IS SHE HAPPY ABOUT IT?
SHE HAS MIXED FEELINGS. I THINK SHE'S PSYCHED ABOUT IT. MY MOM IS SELF-AGGREGATING AND WILL GIVE UP ANY COMFORT FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND I TOOK THAT BEHAVIOR TO HER AND EXAGGERATED IT TO PROBLEMATIC EXTREMES.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER AT ANY POINT THINK YOU MIGHT BE IN TECH OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. OR BEING COMEDIAN OR AN ACTOR AND A COMED ARNG ALL YOU EVER WANTED TO BE?
NO, I'M TERRIFIED OF TECH. BUT I DID BRIEFLY WANT TO BE A MUSICIAN WHEN I GREW UP.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR INSTRUMENT?
I PLAYED TRUMPET. AND I LOVED IT. AND-- YEAH! ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THEN I GOT BRACES AND I COULDN'T PLAY ANYMORE. IT MESSED EVERYTHING UP.
Stephen: HOW LONG DID YOU HAVE THE BRACES ON?
I HAD THE BRACES FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH THAT LIKE, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: IT MESSES IT UP.
I USED TO GET-- THIS IS A VERY GRUESOME DETAIL TO DIVULGE, BUT I USED TO TAKE PLYERS AND TAKE OUT THE BRACES BECAUSE I WAS SO FRUSTRATED BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THEM BACK ON. THEY'RE NOT JUST LIKE, OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD. YEAH.
Stephen: HOW DID YOUR PARENTS FIND OUT? WERE YOU GOING, "I'M FINE. GREAT." WOW, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AGONIZING?
YEAH, IT WASN'T GREAT.
Stephen: HOW, SO OKAY, I'M NOT GOING TO BE A TRUMPETER ANYMORE. THEN WHAT? WHAT WAS NEXT?
THEN I HAD ALL THIS FREE TIME WHEN I USED TO PRACTICE TRUMPET AND I HEARD ABOUT THE BRIGADE THEATER.
Stephen: HERE IN NEW YORK, THOSE GUYS ARE GREAT.
I SAID I GUESS I'LL TAKE CLASSES THERE. I WOULD TAKE THE TRAIN FROM PENNSYLVANIA WHERE I GREW UP TO NEW YORK AND STARTED DOING IMPROV. YOU WEREN'T LIVING LIVING LIVING IN NEW YORK--
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Stephen: WHERE IN PENNSYLVANIA?
OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA.
Stephen: THAT'S A LONG WAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THIS ON WEEKENDS?
NO, IT WAS DURING THE WEEK.
Stephen: ON A SCHOOL NIGHT? YOU WOULD COME UP TO NEW YORK TO GO TO U.C.B.?
YEAH, I WOULD BE UP HERE AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING.
Stephen: YOUR PARENTS UPON COOL WITH THAT. THEY WEREN'T LIKE, "LET'S HAVE THEM PULL THE BRAISS OFF WITH PLIERS INSTEAD?"
THEY WERE FINE. IN RETROSPECT, I WONDER IF THEY WERE ANGRY WITH ME IN SOME UNEXPRESSED WAY BECAUSE I WAS IN NEW YORK AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTHER IS VERY SELF-SACRIFICING.
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, I'D COME BACK AND THEN GO TO SCHOOL. AND IT WAS FUN, BUT, ALSO, I PROBABLY AGED LIKE A NUMBER OF YEARS IN THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME.
Stephen: YOU REALLY LOVED IMPROVISATION. HAVE YOU EVER TAUGHT IT?
YEAH, I USED TO TEACH WHEN I-- I USED TO LIVE IN NEW YORK AND I TAUGHT.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU LIVE NOW?
I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
Stephen: OH, DO YOU LIKE IT OUT THERE, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO MAIN PLACES TO LIVE FOR SHOW BUSINESS. THERE'S HERE AND LOS ANGELES, AND--
I LIKE IT OKAY. I'VE COME TO LIKE IT A LOT. I'M PRETTY SCARED OF EARTHQUAKES. AND RIGHT AFTER I MOVED THERE, I WAS IN A HOTEL, AND THERE WAS A-- WHEN I FOUND OUT AFTER THE FACT, THERE WAS A SMALL EARTHQUAKE. BUT IN MY HOTEL ROOM I WAS, LIKE, THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE END. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I WENT OUT INTO THE HALLWAY. THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY IN THE HALLWAY, AND HE WAS LIKE, WHAT SHOULD WE DO IN? AND I'M LIKE, "I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE." I SAID,"I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE." AND HE SAID, "I'M GOING TO STAY." AND IN MY HEAD I THOUGHT, "YOU'RE A DEAD MAN BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO CONVINCE YOU." I RAN DOWN THE STEPS AND I CALLED MY MOM AND I WAS LIKE, MOM, I KNOW I BITCH A LOT BUT I'VE HAD A BEAUTIFUL LIFE. IT'S BEEN SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME ON THIS EARTH."

YOU CAN KIND OF SEE IT COMING, COULDN'T YOU, REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND YOU LOOKED AT YOUR PARENT AND THEY ALWAYS SEEMED ANXIOUS AND PISSED OFF. YOU'D BE LIKE, "GEEZ, WHAT'S THEIR PROBLEM?" THEN YOU GET OLDER AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, OKAY." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S HARD TO BE AN ADULT, MAN. YOU JUST-- JUST BABY SITTING YOURSELF ALL DAY. ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING? ( LAUGHTER ) TRYING NOT TO DO THE THINGS YOU REALLY WANT TO DO. AH-- I CAN'T. TRY NOT TO EAT TOO MUCH OR DRINK TOO MUCH OR SMOKE TOO MUCH OR SPEND TOO MUCH OR WATCH TOO MUCH. YEAH. THAT'S WHY ADULTS GO TO BED EARLY. THERE'S REALLY NOTHING LEFT TO DO. ( LAUGHTER ) "BUT IT'S 7:30." "IT'S OVER!" ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR SOCIAL LIFE SHRINKS AS YOU GET OLDER. I USED TO DO A LOT OF STUFF, BUT I HAVE NO PATIENCE. I USED TO GO TO A LOT OF CONCERTS. I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, THOSE BIG SOLD-OUT, 20,000-SEATS. YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO GET INTO THE CONCERT, GOTTA WAIT FOR A DRINK, GOTTA WAIT FOR THE BATHROOM, GOTTA WAIT FOR THE BAND. AND BEFORE THE BAND STARTS THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, "ARE YOU READY TO ROCK?" YES! ( APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, WE'RE READY TO ROCK. WE BOUGHT A TICKET. WE PAID FOR PARKING. LET'S-- ( LAUGHTER ) HOW DO I PROVE TO YOU I'M READY TO ROCK? ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHY I THINK CONCERTS ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND SOMEBODY SAYS, "ARE YOU READY TO ROCK?" YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD! I AM READY TO ROCK! HOW DID THAT GUY KNOW?" ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT YOU'RE BUSY YOU'RE LIKE, "JUST GO!" "PLAY THE FOUR SONGS I LIKE AND WRAP IT UP!" ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) I'M SINGLE.
Audience: WHOO!
WELL, THANK YOU, I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS BUT, YEAH, I AM SINGLE. THAT'S A COOL THING TO SAY. IN YOUR 20. RIGHT. IT MEANS I'VE ARRIVED. I'VE GOT PLANS. SAYING IT NOW MEANS MY PLAN SUCKED. ( LAUGHTER ) I WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP. I REALLY DO. I THINK I'M AT A POINT YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES. I'VE BEEN SINGLED, I'M DIVORCED, BEEN IN RELATIONSHIPS, MARRIED. I THINK RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD. RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHERE YOU GROW AND CHANGE, YOU KNOW. YEAH. I MEAN, SURE. YOU CAN CHANGE AS A SINGLE PERSON. IT'S JUST EASIER WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE RIGHT THERE GOING... "CHANGE!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "FASTER." I LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S THE BEST, ISN'T IT? OH, YEAH. SO MUCH HOPE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE A GYM MEMBERSHIP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME. I'M GOING TO DO ALL THE EXERCISES. YOU KNOW WHY THE BEGINNING OF THE RELATIONSHIP IS SO GOOD? BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THE OTHER PERSON. YOU ONLY KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM. THEY'RE ONLY SHOWING YOU THE GOOD STUFF AT THE BEGINNING. IT'S THE MOVIE TRAILER TO THE RELATIONSHIP YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE TRYING TO TRICK YOU LIKE MOVIE TRAILERS DO. THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL YOU ON SOME SEXY ACTION COMEDY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT SEXY ACTION COMEDIES. NO. THEY'RE SHORT PORNO FILM FOLLOWED BY A PBS DOCUMENTARY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) SORT OF. BUT I'M HANGING IN THERE. YOU KNOW, I'M STILL TRYING, GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT. MY SISTERS ARE ALWAYS LIKE, "GOTTA HANG IN THERE. GOTTA KEEP TRYING." THEY'RE ALL IN LONG-TERM MARRIAGES. "YOU CAN DO IT. IT COULD HAPPEN GOOD NIGHT. YOU COULD MEET THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE AT 70." OH, I HOPE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AT 70? THAT'S LIKE GETTING AN iPHONE 4 NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
