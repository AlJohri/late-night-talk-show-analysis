AND NOW "THE LATE SHOW" EXCLUSIVE. STEPHEN COLBERT'S INTERVIEW OF MIKE HUCKABEE'S INTERVIEW OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Stephen: PLUMP, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SITTING DOWN TO TALK WITH ME TODAY. IS IT OKAY I EDIT THIS INTERVIEW JUST TO GET THE ANSWERS I WANT?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: GREAT. LAST WEEK YOU CAME BACK FROM PUERTO RICO WHERE THERE'S BEEN TOTAL DEVASTATION AND UNTOLD SUFFERING. WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU MOST FROM THAT TRIP?
THEY HAD THESE BEAUTIFUL SOFT TOWELS, VERY GOOD TOWELS.
Stephen: OKAY, GO ON. WE WERE HAVING FUN, THEY WERE HAVING FUN, THEY SAID, THROW THEM TO ME! THROW THEM TO ME!
Stephen: ANY CHANCE THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE TOSSING FOOD LIKE A BIG PAPERY BURRITO OR SOMETHING? OKAY. WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU TOLD THEM IT WAS TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE?
THE CHEERING, IT WAS DEAFENING.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT DACA. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE CHILDREN BEING DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE KNOWN NO OTHER HOME? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS. CAN WE JUST PLAY  A LITTLE WORD ASSOCIATION? I'LL SAY A WORD OR A PHRASE, YOU SAY THE FIRST THING THAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND. OKAY? HURRICANE RESPONSE.
A PLUS.
Stephen: YOUR GOLF GAME. BAD PLAYER.
Stephen: YOUR IDEAL DATING AGE.
28 YEARS.
Stephen: AMERICA'S FUTURE UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP?
DEATH SENTENCE.
Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON. WHAT'S YOUR ADMINISTRATION DOING NEXT.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A PLAN EVERYBODY SAYS WILL NEVER WORK.
Stephen: ATLANTA ALL OF YOUR PLANS?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: JUST A QUICK QUESTION, A LITTLE BIT OFF SUBJECT -- WHAT IS MAKING LOVE WITH YOU LIKE?
IN AND OUT. IN AND OUT.
Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW. FINAL QUESTION, SIR. ON JANUARY 20th, YOU WERE SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. GIVEN THE LAST TEN MONTHS, WHAT WERE YOU THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT DAY?
THAT WAS ONE OF THE TRULY BIG MISTAKES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME CIRCUMSTANCES SIR. DO YOU HAVE ANY LAST STATEMENT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, BOB CORKER, JACKIE CHAN, BOB SCHIEFFER AND TROMBONE SHORTY SITTING IN WITH JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! PLEASE, SIT DOWN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT -- FULL DOCKET TONIGHT -- 'CAUSE THIS WEEKEND BROUGHT US ANOTHER BUMPER CROP OF TRUMP, A TRUMPER CROP. ( LAUGHTER ) WAS IT SUNDAY? ON SUNDAY, TRUMP WENT AFTER FELLOW REPUBLICAN, TENNESSEE SENATOR AND MAN READING THE DOLLAR MENU, BOB CORKER. YOU SEE, LAST WEDNESDAY, CORKER UNCORKED THIS ABOUT HOW BADLY TRUMP NEEDS HIS ADVISERS.
I THINK SECRETARY TILLERSON SECRETARY MATTIS AND CHIEF OF STAFF KELLY ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT HELP SEPARATE OUR COUNTRY FROM CHAOS.
STEPHEN: I'M PRETTY SURE "CHAOS" IS TRUMP'S NICKNAME FOR HIS IPHONE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN RESPONSE, TRUMP TWEETED: "SENATOR BOB CORKER BEGGED ME TO ENDORSE HIM FOR RE-ELECTION IN TENNESSEE. I SAID NO, AND HE DROPPED OUT-- SAID HE COULD NOT WIN WITHOUT, DOT DOT DOT DOT DOT, MY ENDORSEMENT. HE ALSO WANTED TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, I SAID 'NO THANKS.' HE IS ALSO LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRENDOUS IRAN DEAL!" "ALSO, AND THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE, LAST YEAR HE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET ME ELECTED. THANKS, BOB." ( LAUGHTER ) "REALLY, SO GOOD. HE WORKED SO HARD. SO AMAZING. I LOVE YOU, BOB. GO TO HELL ." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AT LEAST HE WAS ABLE TO GET THIS OFF HIS CHEST AND MOVE ON TO MORE IMPORTANT-- "DOT DOT DOT HENCE, I WOULD FULLY EXPECT CORKER TO BE A NEGATIVE VOICE AND STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR GREAT AGENDA. DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO RUN!" YEAH, CORKER DOESN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO RUN. AND HE'S QUALIFIED. IMAGINE HOW BRAVE TRUMP MUST BE. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE THING -- EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING TRUMP JUST SAID IS A LIE. CORKER'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IRAN DEAL, "HE LED THE CONGRESSIONAL OPPOSITION... AND VOTED AGAINST IT." PLUS, CORKER'S CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS, "THE PRESIDENT CALLED SENATOR CORKER ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AND ASKED HIM TO RECONSIDER HIS DECISION NOT TO SEEK REELECTION AND REAFFIRMED THAT HE WOULD HAVE ENDORSED HIM." YES, CORKER TURNED DOWN THE COVETED TRUMP ENDORSEMENT, SOMETHING -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TURNED IT DOWN. IT'S A PRECIOUS ENDORSEMENT, AN ENDORSEMENT THAT'S USUALLY RESERVED FOR MAIL-ORDER STEAKS AND GOOD NAZIS. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES.
Jon: HEY, HEY.
Stephen: JUST QUOTING THE MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT CORKER IS ONLY A YEAR AWAY FROM RETIREMENT AND HE'S GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS (BLEEP). SO HE TWEETED, "IT'S A SHAME THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BECOME AN ADULT DAY CARE CENTER. SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY MISSED THEIR SHIFT THIS MORNING." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH! WHOA!
Stephen: YES. YES, THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY MISSED HIS STORY TIME AND DIDN'T GET TO HEAR HIS FAVORITE BOOK: "GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE WIVES." ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) BASED ON A TRUE STORY, THAT BOOK. ( LAUGHTER ) CORKER LATER TOLD THE "NEW YORK TIMES, "I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, IT'S A SITUATION OF TRYING TO CONTAIN HIM." AND GOOD LUCK CONTAINING TRUMP. I MEAN, HIS TENNIS WHITES CAN'T EVEN DO THAT. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP ALSO -- SORRY. THERE SHOULD BE ONE OF THOSE DISCLAIMERS RIGHT BEFORE THIS -- I WANT TO LET SOME OF OUR VIEWERS KNOW SOME DISTURBING IMAGES ARE COMING UP. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP ALSO WENT AFTER THE MEDIA COVERAGE OF HIS HANDLING OF PUERTO RICO: "NOBODY COULD HAVE DONE WHAT I'VE DONE FOR #PUERTORICO WITH SO LITTLE APPRECIATION. SO MUCH WORK!" "AND THE DEVASTATION TO MY EGO COULD TAKE 30 YEARS TO FIX. IN THE END, IT TURNED OUT, I WAS THE DISASTER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SIR, LET THE HEALING BEGIN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, TRUMP'S GOTTEN A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR PASSING OUT AID TO PUERTO RICANS VIA JUMP SHOT. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S INSENSITIVE. YOU'VE GOT TO GO GIVE FOOD TO THE HUNGRY, LIKE MOTHER THERESA DID WITH HER PATENTED SKY HOOK. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SATURDAY, HE DEFENDED HIMSELF ON MIKE HUCKABEE'S NEW HUCKA-SHOW.
SO, WE DID A GREAT JOB AND WE WEREN'T TREATED FAIRLY BY THE MEDIA BECAUSE WE REALLY DID A GOOD JOB. I MEAN, ONE EXAMPLE -- THEY HAD THESE BEAUTIFUL SOFT TOWELS, VERY GOOD TOWELS. AND I CAME IN AND THERE WAS A CROWD OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEY WERE SCREAMING AND THEY WERE LOVING EVERYTHING AND I WAS HAVING FUN. THEY WERE HAVING FUN.
Stephen: AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL, SOFT TOWELS BECAUSE THEY WERE PAPER TOWEL-BRAND PAPER TOWELS. ( LAUGHTER ) RIFT RIFT HUGE FANS, ARE THEY A SPONSOR? PAPER TOWEL BRAND PAPER TOWELS. YOU KNOW THEIR SLOGAN, "THESE ARE PAPER TOWELS." BUT CATCHY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ULTIMATELY, TRUMP REFLECTED ON THE SUFFERING OF THE HURRICANE VICTIMS AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT FROM HIS POSITION OF PRIVILEGE, HE COULDN'T EVEN COMPREHEND WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. (SILENCE) JUST KIDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) HE KEPT THE FOCUS ON THE REAL VICTIM, HIMSELF.
I SOMETIMES ASK MYSELF HOW DID I EVER GET HERE WITH THE HORRIBLE, UNFAIR PUBLICITY? AND I DON'T MIND. LOOK, IF IT'S FAIR-- IF I DO SOMETHING WRONG, TREAT ME BADLY.
STEPHEN: WE'RE DOING OUR BEST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. I'M SORRY. I INTERRUPTED YOU. PLEASE, GO ON.
BUT WHEN WE'RE DOING GOOD, IT SHOULD BE FAIR. THE MEDIA IS, REALLY THE WORD, I THINK ONE OF THE GREATEST OF ALL TERMS I'VE COME UP WITH IS "FAKE." I GUESS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE USED IT PERHAPS, OVER THE YEARS, BUT I'VE NEVER NOTICED IT.
STEPHEN: YOU THINK YOU CAME UP WITH THE WORD "FAKE?" ( LAUGHTER ) SIR, JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER NOTICED SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T THERE ALL ALONG. LOOK AT ERIC. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) NOT IN THE EYES. YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOOK HIM.
Jon: WATCH YOURSELF, NOW...
Stephen: SPEAKING OF SOMETHING YOU NEVER NOTICED BUT WAS THERE ALL ALONG. FAMED HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER AND HUMAN SHREK, HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS A BAD PERSON. NOW, IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR "THE ENGLISH PATIENT," "GOOD WILL HUNTING," "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," AND OTHER MOVIES YOUR MOM LIKED IN THE '90S. LAST WEEK, THE "NEW YORK TIMES" PUBLISHED AN EXPLOSIVE ARTICLE DETAILING DECADES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS AGAINST WEINSTEIN. AND TODAY, HARVEY WEINSTEIN WAS FIRED FROM THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY. ( APPLAUSE ) YES. HARVEY WEINSTEIN NO LONGER IN THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY, FORCING THEM TO CHANGE THEIR NAME FROM "THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY" TO SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE: "ASBESTOS CHILD SLAPPERS, INC." ( LAUGHTER ) I WANT TO WARN ALL OUR VIEWERS AT HOME, SOME OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT WEINSTEIN DID ARE PRETTY TERRIBLE. FOR EXAMPLE, HE APPARENTLY REQUIRED SOME FEMALE EMPLOYEES TO BE PRESENT WHILE HE BATHED. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YES, I KNOW. WHICH EXPLAINS THE JOB LISTING: "MUST TYPE 90 WORDS PER MINUTE, AND ENJOY VOMITING." BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THIS. A LOCAL REPORTER IN NEW YORK SAID WEINSTEIN FORCED HER TO WATCH HIM MASTURBATE INTO A POTTED PLANT. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) PRO TIP: IF YOU EVER HAVE DINNER AT HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S HOUSE, AVOID THE FRESH BASIL. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Jon: OOOOOOHHH!
Stephen: AND AFTER THE SALAD'S BEEN SERVED, WHEN HE COMES AROUND THE TABLE, THAT'S NOT A PEPPER GRINDER HE'S HOLDING. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS MONSTROUS BEHAVIOR THAT IN A JUST WORLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR DECADES. OF COURSE, WEINSTEIN IMMEDIATELY MOUNTED A DEFENSE, RELEASING A STATEMENT SAYING, "I CAME OF AGE IN THE '60S AND '70S, WHEN ALL THE RULES ABOUT BEHAVIOR AND WORKPLACES WERE DIFFERENT." AND "AN OLD DINOSAUR LEARNING NEW WAYS." ( LAUGHTER ) A: THAT'S NO EXCUSE. B: DINOSAURS DIDN'T TOUCH THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF THE EMPLOYEES. T-REX'S ARMS WERE TOO SHORT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) COINCIDENTALLY, THIS WEEKEND WAS THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRUMP-BILLY BUSH "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" GRAB 'EM BY THE, Y'KNOW, TAPE. AND TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT WEINSTEIN AND SAID THIS:
I HAVE KNOWN HARVEY WEINSTEIN FOR A LONG TIME. I'M NOT AT ALL SURPRISED TO SEE IT.
WERE HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S ACTIONS INAPPROPRIATE?
WELL, HE SAYS THEY WERE INAPPROPRIATE.
A YEAR AGO, A VIDEO THAT CAME OUT THAT HAD YOU --
THAT'S LOCKER ROOM -- THAT'S LOCKER ROOM.
STEPHEN: MR. PRESIDENT, SAYING "LOCKER ROOM" DOESN'T EXCUSE IT. THAT'S LIKE HARVEY WEINSTEIN SAYING, "MASTURBATING IN POTTED PLANTS? THAT'S JUST GREENHOUSE TALK." ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JACKIE CHAN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, WE OFFER THE PRESIDENT EQUAL TIME WITH A SPECIAL GUEST. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! THAT'S THE BAND RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! PLEASE! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL SITTING. YOU'RE STILL AT HOME. I'M STILL STANDING HERE BECAUSE THERE'S MORE MONOLOGUE WE'VE GOT TO DO. BEFORE THE COMMERCIALS, I WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP ATTACKED BOB CORKER, AND THE FAKE NEWS, BUT I'M KIND OF PROUD THE PRESIDENT SAVED JUST A LITTLE COMPLAINING FOR US TALK SHOW HOSTS. MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL. SEE, OVER THE WEEKEND, TRUMP TWEETED "LATE NIGHT HOSTS ARE DEALING WITH THE DEMOCRATS FOR THEIR VERY 'UNFUNNY' AND REPETITIVE MATERIAL, ALWAYS ANTI-TRUMP!" FIRST OF ALL, "UNFUNNY" IN QUOTES? ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH MEANS YOU THINK WE'RE FUNNY? ( LAUGHTER ) IN WHICH CASE I WANT TO SAY, "THANK YOU," FOR "UNDERSTANDING HOW QUOTES WORK." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HE ENDED THAT TWEET BY SAYING, SHOULD WE GET EQUAL TIME? I KNOW THAT ONE -- NO. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS. YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT. WE MAKE FUN OF YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT ANYWAY JUST TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. I WILL NOW BE JOINED BY ANOTHER HOST, LICENSED IN "UNFUNNY." AND THAT HOST WILL OFFER BALANCE TO WHAT I SAY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. COME ON OUT, HOST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE IS HOW IT WILL WORK, OKAY. SO YOU'LL BE THE BALANCE. I'LL DO MY USUAL UNFAIR SLAMMING OF THE PRESIDENT, AND YOU'LL PROVIDE THE COUNTERWEIGHT. HERE WE GO. OKAY. DONALD TRUMP THINKS WE SHOULD GIVE EQUAL TIME ON A COMEDY SHOW, EVEN THOUGH THE ELECTION IS OVER. KIND OF LIKE IF "THE BIG BANG THEORY" WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY "THE CREATIONIST BAZINGA FUN TIME HOUR" STARRING JESUS AND HIS ROOMMATE, A T-REX. LOOK OUT FOR THE SPIN-OFF, "YOUNG JESUS." AND BE POSITIVE. ( LAUGHTER )
CAN I HAVE MORE TIME?
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING. JUST SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE. ( LAUGHTER )
DONALD TRUMP -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- IS NOT.... A CANNIBAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: THAT'S YOUR EQUAL TIME?
THAT'S IT.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT.
STEPHEN: LAST WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP'S OWN SECRETARY OF STATE CALLED HIM A ( BLEEP ) MORON. NOT ONLY IS THAT AN INSULT, HE GAVE AWAY TRUMP'S SECRET SERVICE CODE NAME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT. I GOT THIS ONE. ALL RIGHT. GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN HAVING HOT LAVA POURED INTO MY PEE HOLE AND DONALD TRUMP BEING THE PRESIDENT -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- I CHOOSE LAAA --
Stephen: PASSTIVE! THE LATTER.
Stephen: GOOD. ON FRIDAY -- ( LAUGHTER ) I'M FINDING THIS HARD, TOO. ON FRIDAY, TRUMP MADE IT EASIER FOR EMPLOYERS TO DENY WOMEN BIRTH CONTROL. PRETTY SOON, THE ONLY CONTRACEPTIVE WOMEN WILL HAVE LEFT IS HIS FACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M IN THE GROOVE NOW. I'M STARTING TO FEEL THIS. DONALD TRUMP IS GREAT TO WOMEN.
GREAT?
GOOD.
STEPHEN: GOOD?
BETTER THAN HARVEY WEINSTEIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MAYBE. I'LL FACT CHECK THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
STEPHEN: LAST WEEK, THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID AT A WHITE HOUSE PHOTO OP SURROUNDED BY MILITARY LEADERS AND THEIR SPOUSES:
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT THIS REPRESENTS? MAYBE THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
WHAT'S THE STORM ?
IT'S THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
WHAT STORM, MR. PRESIDENT?
YOU'LL FIND OUT. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
STEPHEN: AH--
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY? "YOU'LL FIND OUT?" OOH, A CLIFF HANGER! WILL TRUMP GIVE HUMANITY THE ROSE? WILL CIVILIZATION MAKE IT TO THE FANTASY SUITE?! AND "CALM BEFORE THE STORM?" IS THAT WHAT HE WAS SAYING?
STEPHEN: POSITIVE.
HOW? "CALM BEFORE THE STORM." HOW IS ALL THIS NOT THE STORM? ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS ALL THE STORM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WHAT KIND OF SOCIOPATH WOULD USE THAT TERMINOLOGY WHEN PEOPLE ARE STILL CLEANING UP FROM LITERAL STORMS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SORRY, I KNOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE POSITIVE, BUT I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T DO IT. I COULDN'T DO IT. ( CHEERING )
Stephen: DO I HAVE TO BE POSITIVE NOW? COULD I HAVE MORE TIME?
NO.
Stephen: DONALD TRUMP -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- IS NOT -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- A CANNIBAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON STEWART, EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JACKIE CHAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! GIVE IT UP ONE MORE TIME FOR JON BATISTE AND THE BAND OVER THERE! JON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, YOU GUYS SOUND PARTICULARLY GOOD TONIGHT. CAN YOU LET THE PEOPLE AT HOME KNOW WHO YOU'VE GOT SITTING IN WITH THE BAND TONIGHT?
Jon: MY GOOD FRIEND, THE GREAT TROMBONE SHORTY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I HEAR YOU HAVE TWO SHOWS AT TERMINAL 5 THIS WEEKEND?
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, TWO SHOWS. HAPPY TO HAVE YOU BACK. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE POWER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY FIRST GUEST HAS MADE OVER 200 MOVIES INCLUDING "RUSH HOUR" AND "SHANGHAI NOON." HIS LATEST IS "THE FOREIGNER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME JACKIE CHAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) HEY! COME ON UP!
THANK YOU! WOW! WHAT A LOVELY AUDIENCE.
Stephen: WELL, THEY LOVE YOU. I IMAGINE YOU MUST GET A STANDING OVATION ALL AROUND THE WORLD. YOU'RE NOT JUST A MOVIE STAR. YOU'RE AN INDUSTRY. $2 BILLION MADE WITH YOUR MOVIES. YOU'VE GOT SUCCESSFUL MOVIES AND BUSINESSES ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM WINES TO GYMS TO SEGUE DEALERSHIPS. CAN YOU GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT SOMEBODY SAYING, HEY, DO A BACKFLIP THROUGH A LADDER!
I REMEMBER A LONG TIME WE WERE FILMING IN AFRICA, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE, I COME BACK WITH ABOUT 100 CHILDREN WITH ME. EVERYBODY DO THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) I SAID, HOW DO THEY KNOW ME IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE? THREE YEARS AGO, I WAS ON AN ISLAND WHERE THEY HAVE ONLY 20,000 PEOPLE THERE. WHEN THEY'RE DRIVING BY THE STREET, THE WHOLE ISLAND IS CHANTING "JACKIE, JACKIE." ( LAUGHTER ) I ASKED THE DRIVER, WHY THEY KNOW ME? THEY HAVE A TWO VIDEO CLIP. IN THE VILLAGE, THEY ONLY KNOW TWO VILLAGE PAST THE VILLAGE, ONE, JACKIE CHAN AND STALLONE.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING A MOVIE WITH STALLONE?
SOON, I HOPE SO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, YOU STUDIED AT DRAMA ACADEMY WE IS A PAY KING OPERA SCHOOL.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS PEKING OPERA?
A LONG TIME AGO, IN CHINA, THERE WAS EVOLUTION, SO MANY PEOPLE ESCAPED FROM CHINA. IN THE MORNING, WE'RE LEARNING SINGING, THEN AFTERNOON PUNCH AND KICKING,.
Stephen: FROM OPERA? YES, AND ALL KIND OF TEACHER, THEY COME TO OUR SCHOOL.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU AT THIS POINT IS THIS.
SEVEN.
Stephen: SEVEN? WHAT KIND OF TRAINING? WAS IT TOUGH TRAINING?
OH YOU JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT. IN THE MORNING, WITH A CUP FULL OF TEA, WATER, WE RUN LIKE THIS. YOU CANNOT SPE SPILL IS IT WATER YOU SPILL THE WATER, THEY HIT YOU. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) WE'RE JUST WALKING LIKE THIS AND 1,000 PUNCH AND 500 KICK.
Stephen: AND SINGING. AND SINGING. ( LAUGHTER ) SINGING, SUMMERSAULT.
Stephen: YOU'RE LITERALLY A TRIPLE THREAT, ACTOR, SINGER AND PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.
AND DOING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME.
Stephen: WOW. WAS THIS MEANT TO TRAIN YOU TO GO INTO MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES OR JUST A --
I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS, AT THAT TIME, WAS IN THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN AUSTRALIA. AND I WAS IN HONG KONG IN A BOARDING SCHOOL, STAYED THERE TEN YEARS.
Stephen: SO TEN YEARS MEANS 7 TO 17.
YES. ONE DAY A DIRECTOR CAME TO OUR SCHOOL, SHOW US A CHILD ACTOR. COME, COME. THEN I BECOME A YOUNG CHILD ACTOR. FROM THAT TIME, I KEEP FILMING 57 YEARS AND HERE NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT WORKS. YEAH.
Stephen: I JUST FOUND THIS OUT, YOU REVEALED "RUSH HOUR 4" IS IN THE WORKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FINALLY.
Stephen: YEAH. FINALLY, IN THE SEVEN YEARS AFTER I HAVE SO MANY SCRIPTS SENT TO ME, POLICE FROM HONG KONG, POLICE FROM CHINA, C.I.A. FROM HONG KONG, C.I.A. FROM CHINA -- I SAID, CAN I HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE MAMMA MIA? ( LAUGHTER ) OR LIKE "LA-LA LAND."
Stephen: STOP CASTING ME AS THESE GUYS.
YES. IF I CHANGE TO ACTOR, NOBODY ACCEPT IT, SO FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, I KEEP CHANGING, LET THE AUDIENCE KNOW I'M THE ACTOR WHO CAN FIGHT, NOT THE FIGHTER WHO CAN ACT.
Stephen: WHO ARE YOU PLAYING IN "THE FOREIGNER"?
I'M THE ORDINARY PEOPLE HIDING IN LONDON. OPENING A CHINESE RESTAURANT. SUDDENLY, MY DAUGHTER GETS KILLED. I LET THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HELP ME, BUT THEY SAY, YEAH, YEAH, NOTHING HAPPENED. IT TAKES A LONG TIME. I FIND HIM MYSELF. LATER ON, THEY FIND OUT, WHO IS THIS GENTLEMAN? THEN THEY FIND OUT I HAVE A SPECIAL BACKGROUND, I TRAIN FOR THE SPECIAL FORCES, NAVY SEAL AND I JUST FIND OUT WHO KILLED MY DAUGHTER. IT IS A VERY SERIOUS ROLE. MOSTLY WHEN YOU SEE RUSH HOUR, EVERYBODY IS HA, HA, HA, HA -- ( LAUGHTER ) NOW I GO TO THE THEATER AND WATCH WITH THE AUDIENCE, THE WHOLE THEATER --
Stephen: CRYING? YEAH, CRYING. THE MOVIE FINISHES AND EVERYBODY IS JUST STANDING UP.
Stephen: BUT IN GOOD WAY? YEAH.
Stephen: NOT STUNNED BUT IMPRESSED.
"THE FOREIGNER," WITH THIS KIND OF MOVIE, THE AUDIENCE SITS LIKE THIS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT THIS ONE -- RIGHT, YOU CAN IMAGINE "RUSH HOUR 4" LIKE THIS, EVERYBODY -- ( LAUGHTER ) SO A DIFFERENT KIND OF MOVIE. RUSH HOUR, YOU NEED PEOPLE MOVING.
Stephen: YES. "THE FOREIGNER," THE AUDIENCE HAVE TO BE QUIET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING )
Stephen: WELL, JACKIE, IT WAS SO WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FLUKE GETTING PEOPLE TO JUST STARE SILENTLY AT THE SCREEN IN "THE FOREIGNER." "THE FOREIGNER" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. JACKIE CHAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BOB SCHIEFFER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! IT'S A GOOD BAND! THAT'S A GOOD BAND RIGHT THERE! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A CBS LEGEND WHO HAS BEEN COVERING POLITICS FOR 60 YEARS AND HAS INTERVIEWED EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE RICHARD NIXON. PLEASE WELCOME BOB SCHIEFFER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, BOB! COME ON UP! THERE YOU GO! ALL RIGHT! 46 YEARS AT CBS NEWS, 14 ELECTION CYCLES, YOU'RE THE MAN TO ASK THIS QUESTION -- PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS IS THE CRAZIEST PRESIDENCY WE'VE EVER HAD, BUT YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. DOES IT SEEM LIKE THE CRAZIEST, MOST BIZARRE PRESIDENTIAL CERTAINLY NEWS CYCLES THAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN?
IT'S DIFFERENT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW DIFFERENT? I CAN'T EVER RECALL A PRESIDENCY QUITE LIKE THIS ONE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK "FINDING THE TRUTH IN TODAY'S DELUGE OF NEWS, IT'S CALLED" OVERLOAD ." IN WHAT WAY DO YOU THINK WE'RE OVERLOADED?
STEPHEN, WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THIS COMMUNICATION REVOLUTION THAT'S TOTALLY CHANGED OUR CULTURE I THINK IN AS PROFOUND A WAY AS THE INVENTION OF THE PRINTING PRESS, CHANGED THE CULTURE OF THAT DAY, AND NOTHING HAS BEEN MORE AFFECTED BY ALL OF THIS THAN OUR POLITICS AND THE WAY WE GET OUR NEWS. WE'VE LOST 126 NEWSPAPERS OVER THE LAST 1 YEARS. ONE REPORTER IN FIVE NOW LIVES IN EITHER WASHINGTON, NEW YORK OR LOS ANGELES. THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY. IT'S NOT ABOUT BIASED NEWS, IT'S THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANY NEWS. THEIR NEWSPAPER HAS GONE AWAY. THEY'RE GETTING MOST OF YOUR NEWS NOW ON Facebook, WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR NEIGHBORS, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE THINGS THAT POP UP ON Facebook HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THE SAME VETTING PROCESS THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU LISTEN TO MAINSTREAM MEDIA OR SOME OF THE MORE RELIABLE NEWS SOURCES. THERE ARE SOME GOOD SOURCES OUT THERE, BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME REALLY BAD ONES.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE Facebook OR SOMETHING CERTAINLY LIKE TWITTER IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO AROUND THE NEWS FILTER, TO GO AROUND THE EAST COAST ELITES LIKE YOU WHO ARE LETTING THE AUDIENCE KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT KNOW OR WHAT IS OR ISN'T TRUE ABOUT A STORY. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR RESPONSE TO SAYING THAT JUST A FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION IS BETTER THAN THE VETTING SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
WELL, IF YOU DON'T CARE WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT'S FALSE, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. ( APPLAUSE ) WE KIND OF CHECK THINGS OUT, STEPHEN. I MEAN, WE DON'T PRINT THEM AND WE DON'T BROADCAST THEM UNLESS WE DETERMINE IT'S TRUE AND TRADITIONALLY THAT WAS THE ROLE OF THE NEWS MEDIA. LOOK, WE DON'T WANT A COUNTRY WHERE THE ONLY SOURCE OF NEWS IS THE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S A TOTALITARIAN SOCIETY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND OUR JOB IS TO GIVE ST. SENS ANOTHER -- IS TO GIVE CITIZENS ANOTHER CAREFULLY COLLECTED ACCURATE SET OF FACTS THEY CAN COMPARE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S VERSION OF THE EVENTS, THEN THEY DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. THAT'S OUR JOB, THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDERS MEANT FOR US TO DO AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, THE PRESIDENT CALLS MANY THINGS FAKE NEWS, ANYTHING HE DOESN'T AGREE WITH. HE'S CALLED CBS NEWS FAKE NEWS. YOU STARTED AT CBS IN 1969. HOW DID YOU BECOME A MEMBER OF THE CBS NEWS TEAM?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.
Stephen: BECAUSE IT'S FAKE NEWS? ( LAUGHTER )
AND THIS IS NOT FAKE NEWS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. YOU KNOW, I WAS A NEWSPAPER REPORTER BACK IN TEXAS, AND, ANYWAY, I GOT A JOB IN WASHINGTON WORKING FOR A NEWS COMPANY THERE, AND WE CAME TO WASHINGTON, AND I'D BEEN THERE ABOUT THREE WEEKS, AND I WENT HOME AND TOLD MY WIFE, I SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD A JOB AS I HAD BACK IN TEXAS. I THINK WE OUGHT TO GO BACK. SHE SAID, HAVE YOU NOTICED I'M PREGNANT? I SAID, WELL, YEAH. SHE SAID, CAN WE AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL THE BABY COMES? SHE HAD MOVED US UP, I HAD LEFT HER TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THAT STUFF. ANYWAY, WHILE I'M WAITING FOR THE BABY TO COME, I WENT TO THE CBS NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU ONE DAY. I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK AT CBS. I HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET EVEN AN APPOINTMENT THERE. SO I NEVER ASKED FOR AN APPOINTMENT. THERE WAS NO SECURITY IN THOSE DAYS. I WENT UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR. I SAID, I'M BOB SCHIEFFER, I'VE COME TO SEE THE BUREAU CHIEF. SHE SAID, OH, YES, BOB, COME RIGHT IN. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS TRUE, I WAS USHERED INTO THE BUREAU CHIEF'S OFFICE AND SUBSEQUENTLY HIRED. ( LAUGHTER ) TURNED OUT, I HAD WALKED IN ON SOMEONE ELSE'S APPOINTMENT. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SOMEONE NAMED BOB? YES, IT WAS BOB HAGER, WHO HAD HAD A LONG CAREER AT NCB NEWS, AND SOME YEARS AFTER THAT I CALLED HIM AND SAID, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING, DID YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH BILL SMALL BACK IN 1969? HE SAID, YEAH, THAT'S WHEN IT WAS, BUT, YOU KNOW, NOTHING EVER CAME OF IT AND NBC OFFERED ME A JOB SO I WENT TO WORK THERE.
Stephen: WORKED OUT GOOD FOR EVERYBODY.
WORKED OUT GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BOB, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HIS BOOK "OVERLOAD: FINDING THE TRUTH IN TODAY'S DELUGE OF NEWS" IS AVAILABLE NOW. BOB SCHIEFFER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT THERE. GOT IT RIGHT THERE. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? JON AND TROMBONE SHORTY ARE BOTH PROUD SONS OF NEW ORLEANS. OR AS THEY SAY DOWN THERE -- N'AWLINS. ( LAUGHTER )
JON: THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT HOW WE SAY IT DOWN THERE.
Stephen: I'M PRETTY SURE IT IS.
Jon: YOU'VE GOT TO WORK ON THAT. THAT'S ONE OF MANY MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT OUR HOMETOWN.
Stephen: YEAH.
Jon: BUT I HAVE A NEW VIDEO THAT CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT NEW ORLEANS IN SIX EASY STEPS. JIM? HELLO THERE, STUDENTS. I'M JON BATISTE. DO YOU EVER WONDER WHERE BABIES COME FROM? WELL THIS IS "PIANO ONE-OH-FUN: NEW ORLEANS!" FIRST, LANDMARKS. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE FRENCH QUARTER IS THE OLDEST NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEW ORLEANS. AND JUST LIKE AN OLD PERSON, IT'S FULL OF HISTORY AND COVERED IN PEE. BUT THERE'S LANDMARKS ALL OVER TOWN, INCLUDING: JACKSON SQUARE! THE SUPERDOME. WALGREENS! BOAT! NEW ORLEANS CENTER FOR CREATIVE ARTS, THE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT PELICANS! THE OTHER WALGREENS! TIMES SQUARE! AND, MY FAVORITE PARK IN THE CITY...CITY PARK. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS PARK IS THAT--
JON BATISTE!? WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' BACK HOME?!
JON: OH MAN! STEVIE! IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU! I'M JUST TEACHING THESE PEOPLE ABOUT NEW ORLEANS.
WELL YOU WANT TO BLOW THAT OFF AND COME TO MY HOUSE?
Jon: OF COURSE. ♪
JON: NEW ORLEANS IS KNOWN FOR ITS MUSIC: ZYDECO, BOUNCE, THE FOO FIGHTERS WHEN THEY COME THROUGH ON TOUR. BUT NONE MORE SO THAN JAZZ, WHICH WAS INVENTED HERE WHEN A COMPOSER'S SHEET MUSIC WAS EATEN BY A GATOR SO HE JUST MADE UP A BUNCH OF STUFF. AND THERE HAVE EVEN BEEN THOUSANDS OF SONGS WRITTEN ABOUT NEW ORLEANS. LET'S PLAY THE MOST FAMOUS ONE NOW! ♪ ♪
NEW ORLEANS!
Jon: LESSON THREE, BOOM! THERE'S AN OLD SAYING THAT THERE'S TWO KINDS OF MUSIC IN NEW ORLEANS-- JAZZ AND SHRIMP. BUT SHRIMP IS ONLY ONE OF THE MANY FOODS YOU CAN ONLY FIND IN NEW ORLEANS AND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. ONE OF MY FAVORITE IS THE PO-BOY SANDWICH. YOU CAN FIND THE BEST PO-BOYS IN OUT OF THE WAY, UNEXPECTED PLACES LIKE GROCERIES AND GAS STATIONS. I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO GET TO THE BEST PO-BOY SHOP IN NEW ORLEANS. TAKE CHARTRES STREET TO NATCHEZ AND TAKE NATCHEZ DOWN TO TCHOUPITOULAS. FOLLOW TCHOUPITOULAS FOR A WAYS AND THEN HANG A RIGHT ON SMITH STREET. ONCE YOU'RE THERE WAKE UP DENNIS AND ANSWER HIS RIDDLE.
JON: THE ANSWER IS...RAIN.
THAT IS...CORRECT! CURSE YOU, JON BATISTE! ( LAUGHTER )
