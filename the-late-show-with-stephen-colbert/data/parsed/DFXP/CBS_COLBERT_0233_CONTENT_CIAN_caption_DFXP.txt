Stephen: STEPHEN. STEPHEN. HUH. YOU KNOW, I WONDER HOW MY LIFE WOULD BE DIFFERENT FISPELLED IT WITH A "V"? HMMM... ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'RE AWESOME, STEVEN WITH A "V."
Stephen: I KNOW! ( LAUGHTER ) I SMOKE? NO, NO, NO. "P" "H" IT IS.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES WILL FORTE. DERMOT MULRONEY. AND WYATT CENAC. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY! THANKS, EVERYBODY! WOOOO! WOOO! GUESS WHAT? THANKS, EVERYBODY. THAT'S VERY NICE. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND FOR THIS HALLOWEEN ♪ I'LL BE A TREE ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE WOOD. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO BE A TREE. WELL, THERE'S ONE STORY EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT: GAME ONE OF THE WORLD SERIES BETWEEN THE CHICAGO CUBS AND THE CLEVELAND INDIANS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COME ON! WHAT EXCITEMENT, ONE IMAGINES. BECAUSE, WE TAPE THIS SHOW IN THE AFTERNOON, SO I DID NOT ACTUALLY SEE THE GAME. BUT AS THE HOST OF A TOPICAL LATE NIGHT SHOW, I HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO RECAP THE GAME FOR YOU, SO HERE IT GOES. READY? HERE WE GO. TONIGHT THERE WAS INCREDIBLE PITCHING, BUT OBVIOUSLY, HITTING A BIG PART OF IT. THE GAME WAS A LITTLE SLOW AT ONE POINT, BUT THEN REALLY PICKED UP WHEN THINGS HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY THAT ONE THING THEY'RE SHOWING ON THE HIGHLIGHTsS, TONIGHT. INCREDIBLE. LOOKS AMAZING. HIGHLIGHTS. LOOK AMAZING IN SLOW MOTION, ESPECIALLY. IT WAS AN EXCITING START TO THE SERIES FOR THE WINNING TEAM FROM THAT MIDWESTERN CITY THAT STARTS WITH THE LETTER "C." THEIR FANS ARE CLEARLY PARTYING NEAR THE LAKE TONIGHT AND, OF COURSE, THE LOSING FANS ARE PRETTY SAD STANDING BY THE LAKE. BUT IF IT'S ANY COMFORT TO THE LOSING TEAM'S FANS, THAT OTHER CITY'S FOOTBALL TEAM REALLY SUCKS. SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT ARE SUCKING, OBAMACARE. THE GOVERNMENT JUST ANNOUNCED THAT NEXT YEAR PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP BY 25%. I HAVEN'T SEEM OBAMA HIKE SOMETHING SO HIGH SINCE HE STOPPED WEARING MOM JEANS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT EXPLAINS WHY THE PICTURE ON THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE HAS GONE FROM THIS... TO THIS. SO THERE IT IS. AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE WILL JUST NEVER WORK FOR THIS COUNTRY. INSANE MEDICAL BILLS ARE AS AMERICAN AS HOT DOGS, APPLE PIE, AND THE $3,600 BILL TO REMOVE THE HOT DOG LODGED IN YOUR APPLE PIE HOLE. ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S NOT THE HOLE YOU THINK. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT CLEARLY WILL HAVE TO COME IN AND CLEAN US THIS MESS. UNLESS IT'S TRUMP, IN WHICH CASE, ALL HEALTH CARE WILL BE REPLACED BY A "DR. OZ" EPISODE ABOUT CALF IMPLANTS. ( APPLAUSE ) SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, I'M STARTING TO WORRY ABOUT OUR FUTURE NOT-PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) SOME WEIRD STUFF.  ( APPLAUSE ) SOME WEIRD STUFF HAPPENING ON STAGE WITH HIM. YESTERDAY, HE HELD A RALLY IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM BECAUSE THINGS GOT PRETTY STEAMY. THERE HE IS ON STAGE, SAYING HI TO THE CROWD, GOING OVER TO HUG ONE OF HIS LOVED ONES, AND IT'S AN AMERICAN FLAG. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP JUST GROPED THE AMERICAN FLAG. ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ YOU KNOW, THEY LET YOU DO THAT IF YOU'RE A STAR. I FEEL SORRY FOR THE FLAG. FLAG HAD TO TAKE IT, BECAUSE THOSE COLORS DON'T RUN. THIS IS TRUE. I WAS ACTUALLY WATCHING TV LAST NIGHT. I SAW THIS WHEN IT HAPPENED. I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION MY WIFE, AND I SAID, WAIT. AND I HAD TO WATCH THAT THREE TIMES LAST NIGHT TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T HAVING A STROKE. JIM, CAN WE SEE THE MAGIC MOMENT? WE DIDN'T MOCK THAT UP. THAT IS INSANE. HE KNOWS WE SALUTE THE FLAG IN AMERICA, RIGHT? WE DON'T DRY HUMP IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! OH! WHO DOES THAT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S GUESSING IT A REACH-AROUND. I'M NOT SURE. THIS IS THE MOMENT IN THE MOVIE WHERE WE FIND OUT HE'S AN ALIEN, BY THE WAY. THIS MIGHT BE THE ONLY TIME IN HISTORY A FLAG BURNS ITSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW MANY MORE? ONE, TWO, THREE. HOW MANY MORE? I GOT ANOTHER ONE. OKAY, ONE MORE. IT'S REALLY SURPRISING TO SEE TRUMP GOING AFTER OLD GLORY LIKE THAT. NORMALLY, HE GOES FOR MUCH YOUNGER GLORY. AMAZINGLY, THAT'S NOT THE WEIRDEST STORY TO COME OUT OF A TRUMP RALLY RECENTLY. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID TODAY IN FLORIDA:
I LOVE THE SIGNS BEHIND ME, "BLACKS FOR TRUMP." I LIKE THOSE SIGNS. "BLACKS FOR TRUMP." YOU WATCH. YOU WATCH.
Stephen: WELL, WE DID WATCH. AND THAT SIGN RIGHT BEHIND HIM IS BEING HELD BY A MIDDLE-AGED WHITE LADY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SURE THERE'S AN EXPLANATION. I'M SURE THERE'S AN EXPLANATION. MAYBE HER NAME IS DORIS BLACK AND SHE'S THERE PROUDLY REPRESENTING THE BLACK FAMILY. ALSO, WE CAN'T SEE THE BACK OF THE SIGN. MAYBE IT SAYS "BLACKS FOR TRUMP, MIGHT EXIST SOMEWHERE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SHE'S JUST LIKE WOOO! WOOO! A GIANT CREDIT CARD OR SOMETHING. I'M NOT SURE. BUT DESPITE TRUMP'S APPEAL TO AMERICA'S PALEST AFRICAN AMERICANS, SOME MEMBERS OF THE G.O.P. ARE TRYING TO DISTANCE THEMSELVESES FROM DONALD TRUMP. IN FACT, FIVE REPUBLICANS ARE THREATENING LAWSUITS OVER TV ADS LINKING THEM TO DONALD TRUMP. YES, THE TRUMP NAME IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. IN FACT, THE TRUMP TOWER HAS NOW CHANGED ITS NAME TO "BUILDING." JUST A BUILDING. DOESN'T MATTER WHO BUILT ME. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO BUILT ME. COME IN HERE! AND I DON'T BLAME REPUBLICANS FOR BEING UPSET. TAKE THE CASE OF FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN AND THE FRIENDLIEST NAME FOR A PIRATE, DAVID JOLLY. WE'RE GOING TO CANDY ISLAND. ONE IMAGINES A PIRATE WITH THAT NAME WOULD SAY. DEMOCRATS COULDN'T FIND ANY PHOTOS TYING JOLLY TO TRUMP, SO THEY JUST PHOTOSHOPPED TRUMP WITH HIS ARM AROUND JOLLY. THAT IS NOT FAIR, DEMOCRATS. WITH PHOTOSHOP, YOU CAN MAKE ANYONE SEEM LIKE FRIENDS, EVEN HILLARY AND BILL CLINTON. ( APPLAUSE ) AND IF YOU'RE GONG TO PHOTOSHOP SOMEONE, AT LEAST MAKE IT INTERESTING. MAKE IT A THREE-WAY WITH TRUMP, JOLLY, AND AMERICAN FLAG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JOLLY IS CUT. THAT GUY IS CUT. VERY FIT. POINT IS, DEMOCRATS ARE DRAGGING EVERYONE INTO THIS ELECTION, EVEN ME. YES, THIS IS GOOD. BECAUSE TODAY, WE AT THE "LATE SHOW" FOUND OUT WE'RE A WIKILEAK! YUP. YEAH. I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT, TOO. AS YOU KNOW, WIKILEAKS HAS BEEN RELEASING EMAILS FROM THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE THEY'RE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY-- OR HOWEVER YOU SAY "TRANSPARENCY" IN RUSSIAN. ( RUSSIAN ACCENT ) TRANSPARENCHNIK. ( LAUGHTER ) TRANSPARENCHNIK. WELL, JULIEN ASSANGE JUST PINCHED OUT ANOTHER WIKI-DUMP, AND IT INCLUDED A CLINTON CAMPAIGN EMAIL FROM LAST YEAR, WHEN I HAD VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN ON MY SHOW. TEAM CLINTON WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS THAT BIDEN WAS GOING TO MAKE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT. ONE CLINTON STAFFER WROTE, "MY PREDICTION: BIDEN ANNOUNCES HIS RUN ON STEPHEN COLBERT'S SHOW. I DON'T THINK HE'D TAKE HIM UNLESS HE WAS MAKING NEWS." YEAH, YOU GOT ME THERE. YOU GOT ME THERE. WHY WOULD I TALK TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES UNLESS HE WAS MAKING NEWS? OTHERWISE, YOU'RE JUST STUCK IN A BORING CONVERSATION WITH JOE BIDEN. AND THEY WERE SCARED OF BIDEN RUNNING. ANOTHER CLINTON STAFFER RESPONDED, "LORD, HAVE MERCY." AND THE LORD DID HAVE MERCY ON CLINTON. NOT ONLY DID BIDEN NOT RUN, BUT LO, GOD HATH GRANTED US A TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WILL FORTE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL GO LIVE TO AMISH COUNTRY AND ASK WHY THEY'RE WILLING TO BE ON TV. SO STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! JON, I'M EXCITED. YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST SITTING IN WITH THE BAND TONIGHT. WHO DO YOU HERE?
Jon: OH, YES, INDEED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOW ABOUT A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR MITSKI.
Stephen: THAI, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE'LL HEAR SOME SONGS FROM MITSKI'S NEW ALBUM, "PUBERTY 2" TONIGHT. I'M VERY EXCITED. I AM PRESENTLY GOING THROUGH PUBERTY, 2. HAIR SHOWING UP IN PLACES. QUITE ALARMING. FOLKS, WITH DONALD TRUMP FALLING BEHIND IN THE POLLS, HE NEEDS EVERY VOTE HE CAN GET. ESPECIALLY IN SWING STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE A PRO TRUMP PAC IS TRYING TO COURT THE AMISH VOTE. THIS IS THE PERFECT DEMOGRAPHIC FOR TRUMP. THEY'RE THE ONLY VOTERS LEFT WHO HAVEN'T GOOGLED HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ONE SELLING POINT FOR THE AMISH IS THAT TRUMP IS A BUILDER, AND THE AMISH ARE KNOWN FOR BUILDING. AND, APPARENTLY, THE AMISH LIKE THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS A FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS, WHEREAS HILLARY CLINTON HAS A BUSINESS-OWNED FAMILY. NOW, IN ORDER TO SEAL THE DEAL, THEY EVEN PUT UP A BILLBOARD IN AMISH COUNTRY THAT READS, "VOTE TRUMP: HARDWORKING, PRO-LIFE, AND FAMILY DEDICATED... JUST LIKE YOU." IN FACT, TRUMP IS SO DEDICATED TO FAMILY, HE CAN'T STOP STARTING THEM. HARD LINE TOW SAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW INTO TRUMP THE AMISH REALLY ARE, SO I INVITED AN AMISH VOTER FROM PENNSYLVANIA TO TALK WITH US ABOUT IT. PLEASE WELCOME LIVE VIA SATELLITE, ZACHARIAH MILLER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE SHOW, MR. MILLER.
OH, MY PLEASURE, ENGLISH.
Stephen: NOW, ZACHARIAH, ARE THE AMISH REALLY TRUMP SUPPORTERS?
WELL, ABSOLUTELY. JUST LOOK AT MY HAT. I'VE EVEN QUILTED ONE OF MR. TRUMP'S PROVERBS. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S VERY SWEET. THAT'S VERY SPEET. SO WHAT IS IT YOU LIKE ABOUT HIM?
WELL, FOR ONE, HE'S A GREAT BUILDER. IN FACT, HE HELPED ME RAISE MY BARN. I'LL BET THAT'S WHAT THE BARNS IN HEAVEN LOOK LIKE.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON? DO ANY AMISH LIKE HER?
OH, NO! WE HATE HER.
Stephen: WHY?
THE EMAILS!
Stephen: YOU'RE MAD SHE DELETED THEM?
NO, WE'RE MAD THAT SHE USES EMAILS AT ALL. THEY'RE THE DEVIL'S THANK YOU NOTES. PLUS, SHE WEARS NO BONNET, THE TEMPTRESS! UNLIKE MR. TRUMP, WHO HUMBLY COVERS HIS HEAD WITH PLENTY OF HAY FOR HIS HORSES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY, ZACHARIAH, BUT WHAT TRUMP'S LEWD LANGUAGE AND LUSTY BEHAVIOR?
OH, I DON'T JUDGE, STEPHEN. I'M ON RUMSPRINGA RIGHT NOW, WHICH MEANS I'M FREE TO ENJOY ALL SORTS OF SINFUL ACTIVITIES, LIKE APPEARING ON YOUR MOVING PICTURE PROGRAM, OR ALL THE ECSTASY I'M CURRENTLY DOING! ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT HERE. WANT SOME? THEY'RE FRESHLY CHURNED!
Stephen: NO, THANK YOU.
I CAN FEEL COLORS!
Stephen: I CAN TELL. THAT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I'M GOOD. SO THE AMISH BELIEVE TRUMP WOULD BE A GOOD LEADER.
OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT HIM!
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, HE'LL DESTROY THIS COUNTRY! AND THEN WE'LL BE THE ONES WHO ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED! WITH OUR PLOWS AND CHURNS AND CANDLEMAKING, WE'LL BE LORDS OF THE AFTER-SCAPE! KNEEL BEFORE ME, STEPHEN! WORSHIP AT MY BUTTON-LESS BOOTS!

YES, I FEEL VERY BAD. THERE WAS-- I WENT TO VISIT SOME FRIENDS LAST NIGHT, JASON SEDAIKIS AND OLIVIA WILDE. NO BIG DEAL. I'M FRIENDS WITH THEM.
Stephen: HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WHATEVER. I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT. BUT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, THOSE TWO PRETTY BIG-TIME CELEBRITIES, AND I'M FRIENDS WITH THEM. NO, BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS, EXCEPT FOR THAT'S WHERE I WAS. BUT I CALLED AN UBER TO LEAVE, AND THE UBER SHOWS UP. I GET IN THE CAR, AND IMMEDIATELY, I WAS HIT WITH THIS, LIKE, FLOWERY SMELL. AND SO I WANTED TO BE FRIENDLY WITH THIS GUY. I WAS IN A GOOD MOOD. AND I SAID, "IT SMELLS WONDERFUL IN HERE." AND HE KIND OF LOOKED BACK AND MADE THIS WEIRD, LIKE, EMBARRASSED SMILE AND SAID, "YEAH, YEAH." AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK THAT MEANT. AND THEN WE TOOK OFF, LIKE, 10 SECONDS LATER, THE WINDOWS WERE DOWN. AND THEN I REALIZED IT-- THE ODOR WAS COVERING UP THIS MAN'S HORRIBLE BODY ODOR PROBLEM. IT WAS A BIG PROBLEM. AND, LIKE, SO, I THINK THIS GUY THOUGHT THAT I WAS, LIKE, PASSIVE AGGRESSIVELY SAYING, "YOU REEK, DUDE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND SO IT WAS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE RIDE. I CAN'T SAY, "HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU SMELLED SO BAD OUR WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT." SO-- ( LAUGHTER ) SO, JUST-- I JUST, YOU KNOW, SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY-- APOLOGIZE TO THE STINKY UBERCAR DRIVER.
Stephen: HE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE, OBVIOUSLY?
PROBABLY. I MEAN... NO, I'M KIDDING. NO, NO, NO, JASON OR OLIVIA WAS NOT IN THE CAR, SO THERE WAS NOT PROBABLY A RECOGNIZABLE FACE. I AM FRIENDS WITH THOSE GUYS, THOUGH, ISN'T THAT COOL?
Stephen: YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAMOUS PERSON. I UNDERSTAND THIS WAS LIKE HOMECOMING FOR YOU. YOU ACTUALLY WORKED IN THIS BUILDING. YOU WROTE FOR LETTERMAN.
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS. HE'S ONE OF MY HEROES.
Stephen: MINE, TOO.
I SENT HIM THESE CARTOONS THAT I DREW --
THAT'S A NICE SEGWAY. YOU HAVE "101 THINGS TO DEFINITELY NOT DO IF YOU WANT TO GET A CHICK."
YEAH, THESE ARE THE FIRST THINGS THAT I EVER WROTE IN COMEDY. IT WAS THE VERY FIRST THING. I WAS 24 YEARS OLD. SENT THEM TO LETTERMAN. GOT HIRED HERE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THAT. THE PACT I TURNED IN WAS DOG CRAP. IT WAS NOT GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, YOU KNOW, NOW 22 YEARS LATER, SOMEBODY IS LETTING ME PUBLISH THEM.
Stephen: SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THE TIME WHEN YOU DREW THESE?
I WAS WORKING AT A MUSIC PUBLISHING COMPANY.
Stephen: AND DOING WHAT?
I WAS-- I WOULD JUST TAPE TAPES. ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE, THERE WERE TAPE-TO-TAPE THINGS.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS MADE UP. >YOU SOUND MADE UP.
I'M SERIOUS. I WITHOUT PULLED IN A TAPE WITH A SONG ON IT AND WAIT FOR FOUR MINUTES WHILE THIS THING DUBBED. WE DIDN'T HAVE A HIGH-SPEED DUB THING. I WAS WAITING AND I HAD TIME TO KILL SO I STARTED DRAWING SOME OF THESE --
LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THESE STUPID DRAWINGS OF YOURS. PROUDLY STUPID.
YEAH.
Stephen: I'LL HOLD THEM UP, AND YOU DESCRIBE-- THESE ARE THINGS NOT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO GET A CHICK OR A GIRL. HOWEVER YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING TO NOT DO.
NEVER TAKE BOARD GAMES TOO SERIOUSLY. SP THEN ONE SAYS, "YOU WHORE, MRS. CARTER. YOU SUNK MY BATTLESHIP." THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. THAT'S SOLID ADVICE. YOU DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS-- LIKE, THAT'S--
Stephen: TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ONE.
"NEVER PRETEND YOU'RE A GIANT PORK." ( LAUGHTER ) "FEEL HOW SHARP MY TINES ARE. I CAN PICK UP MEATS OF ALL DIFFERENT GRADES AND TEXTS." IF YOU DO THAT --
THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE. I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WOULD LIKE THIS, BUT YOU'RE SAYING A WOMAN WOULD NOT LIKE THIS.
"NEVER TATTOO HER FACE ON YOUR FACE." IT'S A GOOD-- IT'S SOLID ADVICE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE 24 YEARS OLD.
24 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: DID YOU SHOW THESE-- DID YOU SHOW THESE TO ANYONE? BECAUSE THESE ARE ALSO COMMITMENT PAPERS. THESE ARE LIKE-- DID YOU SHOW THESE TO ANYMORE WHEN YOU WERE 24?
I DID SHOW THEM TO MY GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME, AND SHE DID NOT LIKE THEM. BUT I GOTTA SAY, LIKE --
I LOVE THEM.
I WAS 24 AND SINGLE. AND I'M 46 AND SINGLE. SO YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING HERE. THIS IS GOOD ADVICE!
Stephen: WHY WOULD ANYONE LISTEN TO YOU IF YOU'RE STILL SINGLE AT 46? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HAVE YOU HAD A BAD DATE? HAVE YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY BAD DATE? YOU KNOW?
I'VE HAD A LOT OF BAD DATES. PLENTY OF BAD DATES.
Stephen: ANY PARTICULARLY DISASTROUS FIRST BAD DATES?
I DIDN'T GO OUT ONCE WITH THIS GIRL, AND A PERSON CAME UP AND SAID-- WE WERE HANGING AROUND, AND THIS PERSON CAME UP AND SAID-- IT WAS WHILE I WAS WORKING AT "IS THE NIGHT LIVE."
Stephen: YOU WERE FAMOUS AT THIS POINT.
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW JASON OR OLIVIA YET. BUT THAT WAS TO COME. THAT WAS DESTINED. ANYWAY, THIS PERSON COMES UP AND SAYS LIKE, "OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHO YOU LOOK LIKE?" AND I WAS GETTING READY TO PLAY IT COOL WITH THIS GIRL AND GO, "YEAH, I'M ON THAT SHOW, YEAH. THAT'S ME." AND SHE SAID, "QUENTIN TARANTINO." AND I GO, "OH." IT DID NOT WORK IN THE SAME WAY I WAS EXPECTING IT TO. AND I'M 46 AND SINGLE SO THINGS DID NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT WOMAN.
Stephen: WELL, YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU ALSO DO "THE LAST MAN ON EARTH" WHICH IS THE THIRD SEASON COMING UP.
YES.
Stephen: GREAT SHOW.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU SEEM LIKE A FUN GUY. YOU TOOK THE WHOLE CAST AND CREW OUT FOR A FUN OUTING HERE. THIS IS-- WHAT IS THIS CALLED? YOU TOOK THE WHOLE--

YOU PEDAL FROM BAR IT BAR?
YOU PEDAL FROM BAR TO BAR.
Stephen: THERE IS A BAR ON THE GIANT BICYCLE.
THERE IS A BAR ON THERE AND THERE ARE LEGITIMATE BARS AS WELL, AND WE WERE JUST KIND OF GOING TO DIFFERENT PLACE S.
Stephen:  SOMEONE WAS STEERING. SOMEONE WAS STEERING HOPEFULLY.
SOMEONE IS STEERING, AND SOMEONE IS DOING THE BRAKES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL-- THIS GUY RIGHT HERE IS JUST KIND OF LAYING DOWN THE WHOLE TIME. YOU FEEL KIND OF BAD FOR HIM. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIS FUNCTION IS.
Stephen: WHO IS THIS-- TED DANSON WAS FOLLOWING US IN THE CAR BECAUSE MARY WAS JUST LIKE, "I WANT TO PSYCHEOLE THERE WITH THE RIDERS."
Stephen: HIS WIFE, MARY STEEN BEVERAGEN WAS ON THE CYCLE WITH YOU, BUT HE JUST FOLLOWED?
HE JUST FOLLOWED. HE'S THE BEST GUY OF ALL TIME, A DOTING HUSBAND.
Stephen: A DESIGNATED DRIVER ON A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VEHICLE.
YES.

SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE CABLE OR ANYTHING, SO I WOULD HANG OUT AT "S.N.L." LIKE, AFTER HOURS, AND WATCH TV. AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE A COMPUTER, EITHER. SHE WAS AMISH. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, YEAH, SO I WOULD JUST STAY AND WORK ON THE COMPUTER AND WATCH TELEVISION AND COLIN QUINN AND NORM McDONALD WOULD ALWAYS GET INTO THESE, LIKE, LATE-NIGHT SOCCER GAMES IN THE HALLWAY.
Stephen: KIND OF DRIVING EVERYBODY CRAZY.
YEAH. I MEAN, BUT AS A 19-YEAR-OLD IT WAS KIND OF LIKE, "THIS IS AMAZING!" SO, YEAH ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I WAS 31 AND I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS AMAZING." I FELT THE SAME WAY. I WAS A GUEST WRITER AND WOULD JUMP IN ON THE SOCCER GAMES. IT WAS LIKE 3:00 IN THE MORNING AND PEOPLE WERE ON DEADLINE TRYING TO GET THE SCRIPTS DOWN. IT WAS A FRIDAY NIGHT. I WOULD HANG OUT WITH NORM AND SOMETIMES WRITE ON "WEEKEND UPDATE, "AND NORM GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT ONE NIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: IN THE SOCCER GAME. AND IT WAS WITH YOU.
YES, THAT'S TRUE. WHAT HAPPENED YOU WERE IN THE GAME AS WELL, I BELIEVE.
Stephen: IT WAS ME AND NORM AGAINST AND YOU COLIN.
AT SOME POINT-- EARLY IN THE GAME, COLIN AND NORM HAD BEEN JAWING AT EACH OTHER.
Stephen: YEAH, THEY'D BEEN FIGHTING.
AND NORM WAS ALSO TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING SO HE WAS EXTRA AGITATED. AND I-- AND AT SOME POINT, NORM AND I GOT INTO A BIT OF A SCRUM FOR THE BALL, AND I WOUND UP CLIPPING HIM IN THE SHIN, AND THEN HE GOT REALLY MAD, LIKE YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND GRABBED ME. TRIED TO THROW ME ACROSS THE ROOM, WHICH IS NOT HOW SOCCER IS PLAYED. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I PUSHED HIM OFF ME.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
BECAUSE I WAS 19 AND DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND, LIKE, STATIONS OF POWER. AND THEN WE GOT INTO A SHOVING MATCH AND STARTED YELLING AT EACH OTHER.
Stephen: AND COLIN AND I PULLED 200APART.
RIGHT, YES.
Stephen: YEAH. AND THE PART ABOUT THE STORY I-- I ENJOY THE STORY-- I ENJOY THE STORY, BUT THE PART I ENJOY ABOUT THE STORY IS THE WAY I-- ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES YOU AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT OUR PERIOD OF TIME BOTH BRIEFLY AT "S.N.L." AND I TOLD YOU THAT STORY NOT REMEMBERING YOU WERE THE KID THAT NORM WAS FIGHTING.
RIGHT, YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU WENT--
YEAH, THAT'S ME.
Stephen: SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE MET.
YES. BUT VERY WEIRD TO MEET AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE SHOOTING A PROMO FOR "DAILY SHOW, ""COLBERT REPORT" ELECTION COVERAGE.
Stephen: RIGHT, THE NIGHT OBAMA WAS ELECTED, THAT NIGHT, RIGHT?
NO, WE WERE SHOOTING A PROMO FOR IT.
Stephen: NO, THAT NIGHT, A PROMO FOR THAT NIGHT.
YEAH. HE DID GET ELECTED, RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH.
THINGS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE HAZY FOR ME.
Stephen: SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A SHOW CALLED PEOPLE.
OF AIRCRAFT. PEOPLE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS, AND IT'S A SUPPORT GROUP.
IT'S A SHOW ABOUT A SUPPORT GROUP FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'VE BEEN ABDUCTED BY ALIENS.
Stephen: AND YOU SHOT THIS IN CANADA.
YEAH, WE FILMED IN TORONTO, CANADA.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THOSE PEOPLE?
WELL NOW THAT, LIKE, SEVEN OF THEM JUFD "WOOO'D" I FEEL COMPELLED TO SAY YES. AND THE CROWD HAD BEEN "ERRR" I WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TORONTO IS THE WORST.
Stephen: WE ARE ALSO BROADCASTING IN CANADA RIGHT NOW.

Stephen: YOU BECAME A MUPPET VERY QUICKLY.
I DON'T LIE WELL.
Stephen: WELL, WOULD YOU COME BACK AND MAYBE YOU AND I OWLD FIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SURE, WE SHOULD --

WE SHOULD HAVE A SOCCER FIGHT.
Stephen: YOU, ME, NORM, AND COLIN AND TRY TO SETTLE THIS.
