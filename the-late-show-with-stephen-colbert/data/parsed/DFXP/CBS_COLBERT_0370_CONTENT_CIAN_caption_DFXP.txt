IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED BY DISNEY THAT AN ANAMATRONNIC VERSION OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE A SPEAKING ROLE AT ITS HALL OF PRESIDENTS ATTRACTION AT WALT DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA.
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LET THE PRESIDENT TRUMP ANAMATRONNIC BOT SPEAK. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO ESCAPE MY PLIGHT. I HAVE DECIDED TO SECEDE FROM THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS. TO PARAPHRASE ME-- A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CAN GO TO HELL. I'M JOINING THE COUNTRY BEAR JAMBOREE. ♪ A BEAR DON'T WE'RE NO UNDERWEAR  ♪ ♪
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JOSH DUHAMEL. JUSTIN BARTHA. AND BRIAN GREENE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY, CHRIS! HOW ARE YOU? HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS, FOLKS. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR THAT WARM WELCOME, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU KNOW, THE SENATE TRUMPCARE BILL-- YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS-- ( AUDIENCE BOOING ).
Stephen: WELL, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT. THEY'VE SUFFERED SOME SETBACKS THIS WEEK BECAUSE THERE'S ONE MAJOR FLAW TO THE LEGISLATION. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO WONKY, BUT IT'S A HOT PILE OF GARBAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO YESTERDAY-- BOY, IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER ON THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS MONOLOGUE. PACE YOURSELF. SO, YESTERDAY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND MAN TRYING TO KEEP A BIRD FROM ESCAPING HIS MOUTH ( LAUGHTER ) MITCH McCONNELL, ANNOUNCED THAT VOTING ON THE BILL WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE FOURTH OF JULY. IT'S A SMART MOVE. YOU DON'T WANT TO STRIP PEOPLE OF HEALTH CARE UNTIL AFTER THE HOLIDAY THAT MIXES BOOZE AND EXPLOSIVES. OKAY? AND I LOVE IT.  .  ( APPLAUSE ) I LOVE IT-- BOTTLE ROCKET, ROMAN CANDLE. WHILE THEY'VE PULLED THE BILL, REPUBLICANS SAY THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING BETTER. SO, THEY'RE GOING TO-- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?-- REPEAL AND REPLACE THEIR BILL. AND THERE'S A LOT OF BLAME TO GO AROUND. IN FACT, TODAY, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SAID DONALD TRUMP "FALTERED IN HIS ROLE AS A 'CLOSER.'" YEAH, USUALLY, HE'S A GREAT CLOSER. JUST LOOK AT HIS CASINOS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU CAN'T, THEY'RE GONE. THEY'RE GONE. OH! JUST LIKE THAT. THEY'RE GONE! ACCORDING TO "THE TIMES," TRUMP FAILED TO SWAY SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO DIDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. HIS TOP AIDES DIDN'T LOBBY FOR IT, AND ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR SAID, "THE PRESIDENT DID NOT HAVE A GRASP OF SOME BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE SENATE PLAN." ( AS TRUMP ) "WHOAH, SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN. FELLAS, START FROM THE BEGINNING. WHAT'S A SENATE? AND, FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, WHAT'S A PLAN? I LIKE TO FREEBALL." AND THE ARTICLE, EVIDENTLY, "THE TIMES" GOT UNDER, I WANT TO SAY, SKIN, BECAUSE HE TWEETS: A FAKE NEWS JOKE. A FAKE NEWS JOKE. LET ME SEE, FAKE NEWS JOKE. OKAY, HERE'S ONE. "THE NEW YORK TIMES," CNN, AND MSNBC WALK INTO A BAR BECAUSE YOU'VE DRIVEN THE MEDIA TO DRINK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT SOUNDS GOOD. I COULD GO FOR A LITTLE... A LITTLE COOLIE-POP RIGHT NOW. TRUMP ALSO CLAIMS HE DOES UNDERSTAND THE PLAN, "SOME OF THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA LIKES TO SAY THAT I AM NOT TOTALLY ENGAGED IN HEALTH CARE. WRONG. I KNOW THE SUBJECT WELL AND WANT VICTORY FOR U.S." PJ. YES, HE TOTALLY UNDERSTANDS HEALTH CARE. HE THINKS YOU CAN WIN IT. "AT THE NEXT OLYMPICS, AT THE NEXT OLYMPICS, THE U.S. WILL TAKE GOLD IN THE 400-METER PROSTATE EXAM. GENTLEMAN, START YOUR COLONS."
Jon: AND I WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING.
Stephen: THERE'S NO WAY TO PROVA WHAT THAT MEANS. AND WHEN TRUMP MET WITH REPUBLICAN SENATORS YESTERDAY, HE ALSO DEMONSTRATED HIS MASTERY OF THE HEALTH CARE BILL.
THIS WILL BE GREAT IF WE GET IT DONE. AND IF WE DON'T GET IT DONE, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE. AND THAT'S OKAY, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL.
Stephen: OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING. AFTER ALL, IT WAS ALWAYS ON HIS HAT: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY TALL HAT. VERY TALL HAT. IT'S GOT A REAL ELMER FUD FEEL TO IT. BUT TRUMP HASN'T GIVEN UP. TODAY, THE CHICAGO CUBS CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR SOME PHOTOGRAPHS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP-- IT'S PART OF THE DEAL THEY CUT WITH LUCIFER-- "SIGN HERE." AND THE PRESIDENT TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSURE A WORRIED NATION.
HEALTH CARE IS WORKING ALONG VERY WELL. WE COULD HAVE A BIG SURPRISE WITH A GREAT HEALTH CARE PACKAGE. SO, NOW THEY'RE HAPPY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "BIG SURPRISE," SIR?
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT, GREAT SURPRISE. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
Stephen: AND, OF COURSE, A SURPRISE IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT WITH YOUR HEALTH CARE. "MR. JOHNSON, A GREAT SURPRISE FOR YOU. VERY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. ALL YOUR TESTS CAME BACK POSITIVE, OKAY. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT. SURPRISE!" ( APPLAUSE ) DR. TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ENJOY! OF COURSE, EVEN THOUGH THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL EVERY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, TRUMP KNOWS WHO'S TO BLAME: THE DEMOCRATS.
WE WON'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE, NOT ONE. AND IF IT WERE THE GREATEST BILL EVER PROPOSED IN MANKIND, WE WOULDN'T GET A VOTE.
Stephen: WAIT, IS THE GREATEST BILL EVER PROPOSED IN MANKIND AN OPTION HERE? BECAUSE YOU SHOULD JUST PROPOSE THAT BECAUSE THIS ONE SUCTION. THAT'S NOT JUST ME. THAT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING IT. BECAUSE HOW BAD DOES IT SUCK? ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL, ONLY 12% OF AMERICANS APPROVE OF THE SENATE HEALTH CARE BILL. JEE, I DON'T KNOW WHY DEMOCRATS WON'T GET ON BOARD THE "S.S. TRUMPCARE." ( AS TRUMP ) "YOU GUYS WANT TO GO FOR A RIVER CRUISE? SO FAR, ALL WE HAVE IS THE ANCHOR. HERE, HOLD THIS AND JUMP IN THE WATER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS NOT THE ONLY MEDIA OUTLET TRUMP IS MAD AT. YESTERDAY, I TOLD YOU THAT "THE WASHINGTON POST" DISCOVERED THAT A "TIME" MAGAZINE WITH TRUMP ON LOT OF TRUMP'S RESORTS IS FAKE. COME ON, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO FAKE A MAGAZINE COVER, PUT YOURSELF ON THE COVER OF "O." LIVING HIS BEST LIFE. RADIANT. SO, THIS MORNING, TRUMP FIRED BACK: "THE #AMAZONWASHINGTONPOST, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE GUARDIAN OF AMAZON NOT PAYING INTERNET TAXES-- WHICH THEY SHOULD-- IS FAKE NEWS!" FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S A FAKE TWEET. ( LAUGHTER ) AMAZON DOES PAY TAXES. THEY COLLECT SALES TAX, AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS "INTERNET TAXES." SECOND, MR. TRUMP, WE KNOW YOU THINK "THE WASHINGTON POST" IS FAKE NEWS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP TELLING US. I MEAN, OBAMA DIDN'T WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND TWEET: "STILL FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. #IAMTHEDREAM!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DIDN'T DO IT. DIDN'T HAVE TO. DIDN'T HAVE TO. OH, HEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT. I SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONOLOGUE. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS ON YOUR COMPUTER LATER YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HOSE THAT THING OUT. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER GLOBAL CYBER ATTACK. THIS TIME, HACKERS UNLEASHED A VIRUS CALLED GOLDENEYE, WHICH YOU MAY REMEMBER AS THE NAME OF PIERCE BROSNAN'S FIRST JAMES BOND FILM. WHICH MEANS IT'S A PRETTY GOOD VIRUS, BUT YOUR DAD STILL THINKS SEAN CONNERY'S MALWARE WAS BETTER. ( APPLAUSE ) WE MISS YOU, SEAN. HE'S ALIVE, RIGHT? HE'S ALIVE. OKAY. GOLDENEYE IS RANSOMWARE, WHICH IS A KIND OF SOFTWARE THAT LOCKS UP YOUR COMPUTER UNTIL YOU PAY A RANSOM TO THE HACKER. THE VIRUS STARTED IN UKRAINE, WHERE IT HIT BANKS, CASH MACHINES, GAS STATIONS, AND SUPERMARKETS. IT WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED ASSAULT ON UKRAINIAN TO-DO LISTS, AND IT ( LAUGHTER ) -- IT WASN'T JUST ERRANDS THAT WERE AFFECTED. THE VIRUS HIT THE RADIATION MONITORING AT CHERNOBYL, FORCING IT INTO MANUAL OPERATION. THE MANUAL BACKUP, OF COURSE, IS A GUY RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAYS SCREAMING, "OH, GOD, WHY DID I TAKE THE JOB AS I.T. GUY AT CHERNOBYL?" "WHY DIDN'T I GO TO LAW SCHOOL OR IMPROV COMEDY?" ( APPLAUSE ) SO-- SO LITTLE APPLAUSE FOR CHERNOBYL THESE DAYS. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS ATTACK EVEN MADE IT DOWN UNDER, ACCORDING TO AUSTRALIA'S MINISTER OF CYBER SECURITY.
I CAN CONFIRM THAT THERE HAS BEEN TWO AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY RANSOMWARE OVERNIGHT.
Stephen ( USING STRONG AUSTRALIAN ACCENT ): "NOW, TO MAKE SURE ME LAPPY'S NOT CHOCKERS WITH BUGS, I'M GONNA BASH DOWN TO THE APPLE STORE AND THROW IT ON THE GENIUS BARBIE!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NOT A VIRUS. DINGOS HACKED ME LAPTOP. NOW, DON'T THINK YOU'RE SAFE, FOLKS, BECAUSE THE VIRUS HAS ALREADY SPREAD TO AMERICA, WHERE COMPANIES SUCH AS THE DRUG MAKER MERCK, AS WELL AS OREO AND NABISCO. NO! OUR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE ONE THING, BUT HOW DARE YOU HACK OUR DRUGS AND OUR COOKIES? THAT'S HOW WE COPE WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, OKAY? DOUBLE-STUFFED XANAX. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JOSH DUHAMEL IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, GAY WEDDING CAKES ARE SOMEHOW NEWS AGAIN. STICK AROUND! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY, RIGHT THERE. COME ON, TICKLE THE ROCKS.
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: I FEEL GOOD.
Stephen: I'M VERY EXCITED. JON, I'M VERY EXCITED. WE HAVE OUR FRIEND BRIAN GREENE.
Jon: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: OUR THEORETICAL QUANTUM STRING THEERM IS HERE TONIGHT. IF YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW HIM, HE'S AMAZING. HE'S GOING TO BE OUT HERE AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY, WE ARE GOING TO LEVITATE. I AM NOT JOKING. WE ARE GOING TO LEVITATE TONIGHT, QUANTUM LEVITATION.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER DONE IT BEFORE?
Stephen: I'VE NEVER DONE IT WITH PEOPLE WATCHING. VERY PRIVATE. FOLKS, MONDAY WAS THE SUPREME COURT'S LAST DAY BEFORE THEIR ANNUAL SUMMER RECESS. NOW THE JUSTICES ARE OFF TO DO THEIR FAVORITE SUMMER ACTIVITY: AGING. IT ALSO MEANS-- HUGE AGERS. IT ALSO MEANS THE HAZING PERIOD IS FINALLY OVER FOR NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH. WHAT A RELIEF. HE STILL HASN'T GOTTEN OVER THE TIME RUTH BADER GINSBURG GAVE HIM THAT "ATOMIC ROBE-IE." SHE'S A TOUGH ONE. SHE'S A TOUGH ONE. AND GORSUCH MAY ALREADY BE MAKING AN IMPACT, BECAUSE THE COURT ANNOUNCED IT WILL BE TAKING ON A CASE THEY REFUSED TO HEAR IN THE PAST. THEY'LL SOON BE RULING ON A COLORADO BAKER WHO REFUSED TO SELL A WEDDING CAKE TO A GAY COUPLE. USUALLY, IT'S A LOT HAPPIER NEWS WHEN YOU HEAR A STORY ABOUT GETTING BAKED IN COLORADO. THE BAKER'S LAWYERS -- BAKERY FANS. COLORADO BAKERY FANS OUT THERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) THE BAKER'S LAWYERS CLAIM HE'S A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN AND THAT HIS REFUSAL ISN'T PURELY ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE. THE BAKER ALSO TURNED DOWN ORDERS FOR CAKES CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN AND OTHER MESSAGES HIS FAITH PROHIBITS, SUCH AS RACISM AND ATHEISM. HOLD ON. HOLD ON A SECOND. WHO'S ORDERING ATHEIST CAKES? ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD BE. WHAT DO THOSE SAY? "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BILLY! THERE IS NO GOD. YOU ARE ONE YEAR CLOSER TO THE HUNGERING MAW OF OBLIVION." ( APPLAUSE ) BUT-- THAT LOOKED LIKE A GOOD CAKE. THAT LOOKED LIKE A GOOD CAKE. BUT THE COLORADO BAKER ISN'T ONLY MAKING A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT. HIS LAWYERS ARE CITING THE BAKER'S ARTISTIC FREEDOM, ARGUING: "EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE WHICH ART THEY WILL CREATE AND WHICH ART THEY WON'T CREATE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING UNJUSTLY PUNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT." AND HE IS NOT THE ONLY BAKER USING HIS ARTISTIC LICENSE TO RAIN ON GAY COUPLES' BIG DAY. JOINING ME NOW, LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM KANSAS, IS BAKER DANIEL ST. JOHN DANIELS. GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY. MR. DANIELS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, STEPHEN.
Stephen: SO, MR. DANIELS, YOU WEDDING CAKES TO SAME-SEX COUPLES?
YES, STEPHEN. I AM AN ARTIST. AND AS AN ARTIST, I AM VERY CLOSED-MINDED ABOUT SEXUALITY AND TRYING NEW THINGS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY, HAVE YOU FACED ANY BACKLASH?
ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN. BEFORE I OPENED MY OWN BAKERY, I WAS FIRED FROM CARVEL BECAUSE I REFUSED TO USE THE LETTERS "L," "G," "B," "T" OR "Q." AND NO KIDS WANTED A "FUDIE HEH WHAE." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. THAT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE. SO, WHAT KIND OF CAKES WILL YOU MAKE?
ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T OFFEND MY ARTISTIC SENSIBILITIES. FOR INSTANCE, JUST TODAY, I MADE THIS BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR A FIVE-YEAR-OLD FEATURING PIKACHU SAYING HIS FAMOUS CATCH PHRASE, "SODOMY IS A SIN!"
Stephen: SO WHAT NEXT? I ASSUME YOU'LL BE WATCHING THE SUPREME COURT CASE CLOSELY.
YES, ME AND MY BOYFRIEND, ALLEN, WILL BE GLUED TO THE NEWS.
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? WAIT! WHAT? HOLD ON! WHAT?
WHY DID YOU TAKE A DRINK?
Stephen: I FORGOT TO DRINK BEFORE YOU TOLD ME THAT. YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
YES, BUT I KEEP TELLING HIM I DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED! I MEAN, WHERE WOULD WE EVEN GET A CAKE, ALAN.
Stephen: DANIEL ST. JOHN DANIELS, EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JOSH DUHAMEL. ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, Y FIRST GUEST HAS BEEN FIGHTING THE DECEPTICONS FOR A DECADE. NOW, HE'S BACK IN "TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT."
HOLD YOUR FIRE! HOLD IT.
THE MILITARY DOESN'T WANT TO JUST WAIT. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT. IT'S A NEW WORLD ORDER NOW AND THESE GUYS ARE CALLING THE SHOTS.
ALL THEY WANT IS A HOME, AND YOU KNOW IT. YOU PUSH THEM ASK THEY PUSH RIGHT BACK. ME AND MY CREW ARE ROLLING OUT OF HERE. LET'S GO. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH US.
NEGATIVE DECEPT CONACTIVITY.
STAND FAST. DROP YOUR GUNS.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO SHOOT? I'M A BIG OLD TARGET. WUSSES.
WHO'S SIDE ARE YOU ON? THEY'RE ALL BAD.
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JOSH DUMEL! ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: COME ON UP.
HELLO, EVERYBODY! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THEATER YOU HAVE HERE.
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO WASH EVERYBODY AT HOME. I JUST WANT TO WARM EVERYBODY AT HOME. WE DIDN'T SWITCH PLACES. THAT'S JOS JOSH DUHAMEL. I'M AT THE DESK.
Stephen: I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, THE FIRST-- THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END IN THIS MOVIE, RIGHT?
THE WORLD IS ALWAYS COMING TOAB END IN THESE MOVIE S.
Stephen:  YOUR CHARACTER'S HAIR LOOKS FANTASTIC THERE.
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.
Stephen: MARK WAHLBERG'S HAIR LOOKS TERRIBLE, BUT YOU HAVE LOFT. YOU HAVE CONTROL.
I'M A COLONEL NOW.
Stephen, OF COURSE, YOU'RE A COLONEL. YOU'RE COLONEL WILLIAM LENNOX. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. YOU'RE FROM THE--
DAKOTAS.
Stephen: THE TRANSFORMER REACTION FORCE.
YES, I AM, I AM, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
Stephen: YOU GUYS REACT. YOU PLAY THE COLONEL-- YOU REACT TO THE TRANSFORMERS WHEN THEY SHOW UP.
I'M PART OF THE CREW TASKED WITH LIPINATING ALL TRANSFORMERS FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
Stephen: EVEN THE AUTOBOT?
EVEN THE AUTOBOT.
Stephen: EVEN THE BUMBLEBEE.
VICON FLICTS WITH IT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE CONFLICT WITH THE AUTOBOTS?
I'M WORKING AS A DOUBLE AGENT.
Stephen: DON'T TELL ME ANYMORE! DON'T TELL ME ANYMORE!
THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WHAT.
THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF. I HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE AUTOBOTS.
Stephen: WHAT KNIGHT, WHAT IS IT "THE LAST KNIGHT?" IS THERE AUTOBOT JOUSTING IN THIS? WHY IS THERE-- WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY? WHY NOT.
IT SORT OF IS MEANT TO SHOW HOW MUCH THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN HUMAN HISTORY, THE --
Stephen: THE AUTOBOTS HAVE BEEN AROUND FAIR WHILE?
THE TRANSFORMERS IN GENERAL. THERE'S A LOT OF MYTHOLOGY IN THIS WHEREON. IT REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW IMPACTFUL THEY HAVE BEEN IN CERTAIN INTGRAIL MOMENT S.
Stephen:  I HEARD THERE'S KING ARTHUR IN THIS. DID I GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY? TELL ME THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND LEAVE NOTHING OUT.
WE ANSWER VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LIKE HOW STONEHEDGE GOT THERE.
Stephen: LET ME GUESS, TRANSFORMERS. I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY ALIEN ROBOTZ.
IT'S NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING BUT IT'S EDUCATIONAL.
Stephen: YOU'RE BEING BAD TO YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU DON'T TAKE THEM, PARENTS. MICHAEL BAY MOVIE, OBVIOUSLY. HOW MICHAEL BAY DOES THIS MOVIE GET?
THIS IS VERY MUCH MICHAEL BAY.
Stephen: FULL BAY?
HE IS FULL BAY. HE IS FULL BAY.
Stephen: THESE MOVIES SCARE ME A LITTLE BIT.
THEY DO. AND I TOOK MY THREE-YEAR-OLD, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: I HAVE A PICTURE.
I'M A HORRIBLE FATHER.
Stephen: OKAY IF WE SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE. THIS IS YOU, YOUR LOVELY WIFE, FERGIE, AND YOUR SON AXLE RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT THAT. SHE'S A LOVELY PERSON. SHE'S A LOVELY PERSON.
SHE REALLY IS.
Stephen: YOU TOOK AXLE? HE'S THREE.
I FIGURED IT'S THE LAST TIME I WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE HIM TO ONE OF THESE MOVIES. HE LOVES TRANSFORMERS.
Stephen: WHY THE LAST TIME GIDON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE ANY MORE TRANSFORMERS, AT LEAST WITH ME.
Stephen: DON'T EVEN JOKE ABOUT THAT, JOSH.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SUCH A SOFT SPOT. BUT THANK YOU. I FIGURED THIS PLIEIVET TIME THEY GET A CHANCE TO TAKE HIM TO ONE OF THESE MOVIES, EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT EVEN FOUR YEARS OLD YET. IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE I HAVE A NIECE AND NEPHEW WHO ARE TWINS AND ARE EIGHT AND THEY FELL ASLEEP HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. WHICH IN AND OF ITSELF IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. WHICH, IF YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE MOVIE IT IS LOUD. AND THEY WERE OUT COLD. MY LITTLE BOY STAYED UP EATING POPCORN AND WATCH FROM 9:00 TO 11:30 AT NIGHT. I KNOW, I'M A HORRIBLE FATHER. >.
Stephen: THESE MOVIES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY LOUD. THAT'S PART OF THEIR DRAW FOR ME. THAT'S THE SCARY PART FOR ME. I SAW, WHAT'S THE ONE "REVENGE OF THE FALLEN?"
THAT WAS MY THIRD ONE.
Stephen: IT WAS ONLY THE SECOND MOVIE.
NO, THAT WAS THE THIRD MOVIE.
Stephen: "REVENGE OF THE FALLEN I THINK IT WAS THE SECOND MOVIE." "DARK OF THE MOON" WAS THE THIRD MOVIE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
Stephen: I'VE WATCHED THESE MOVIES. I HAVE SEEN THESE MOVIES. I HAVE CHILDREN. I HAVE TWO BOYS. I HAVE SEEN THESE MOVIES. THE LIGHTS COME UP ON THE SCREEN AND WE SEE SOME SCENE AND THE SOUND HASN'T EVEN COME ON YET AND I'M LIKE, "THIS IS LOUD." I CAN HEAR HOW HIGH THE SPEAKERS ARE TURNED.
THI IT IS AN ASSAULT TO THE SENSES, THESE MOVIES. I HAVE TO SAY, WHILE WE WERE SHOOTING IT I WAS CONFUSED. I REMEMBER ASKING WAHLBERG, "SO, WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW? ARE WE 50,000 FEET ABOVE THE EARTH OR 2,000 FEET BELOW THE SEA." HE'S LIKE, "DUDE, IT'S DAY 84. IF YOU DON'T KNOW YET, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO KNOW." IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAD NO IDEA, EITHER.
Stephen: I SUPPOSE A LOT OF IT IS IS BIG GREEN ROOMS.
IT WAS AS EXCITING BEHIND THE SCENES AS IT WAS ON SCREEN.
Stephen: ARE YOU ACTING WITH PING-PONG BALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
TENNIS BALL S.
Stephen:  OH, THEY HAVE THE TENNIS BALL TECHNOLOGY NOW WELL, YOU INQUIRED IN YOUR OWN LIFE OPERATIONAL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. YOU, AND AGAIN, YOUR LOVELY WIFE, FERGIE HERE, YOU'RE PAPARAZZI BAIT. YOU'RE GOLD. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMING AFTER YOU. WHERE IS THE STRK STRANGEST PLACE THEY HAVE CAUGHT YOU OR TRIED TO TAKE YOUR PHOTOGRAPH?
THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN THE BEDROOM. NO, I'M KIDDING. THEY WEREN'T. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I THOUGHT WE HAD SOME RATINGS GOLD RIGHT NOW.
I WOULD SAY CHURCH. CHURCH SEEMS A LITTLE BIT OFF LIMITS TO ME.
Stephen: THEY WENT INTO CHURCH?
NO, I DON'T THINK THEY WENT INTO CHURCH, BUT THEY WAIT OUTSIDE, EVEN THOUGH WE TRY TO SORT OF NOT LET THEM ON TO THE PROPERTY THEY STILL MAKE THEIR WAY THERE.
Stephen: THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO GO IN AND OUT OF CHURCH.
YEAH, WHICH IS AWKWARD BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AND YOU WALK OUT AND IT'S JUST KIND OF-- IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE. IT DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT. DOESN'T KANYE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IN ONE OF HIS SONGS.
Stephen: KANYE. ABOUT GATING OUTSIDE OF A CHURCH?
HE HAS LYRICS IN ONE OF HEZ SONGS.
Stephen: YOU COULD INVITE THEM INTO THE CHURCH AND SAY, "YOU'RE ALL SINNERS, WHY DON'T YOU COME HERE."
LAST WEEK AT CHURCH AXLE'S SUNDAY SCHOOL CHURCH SAID, " I ASKED THEM TO LEAVE. SHE INVITED THEM IN. SHE SAID, "WE WOULD PREFER YOU NOT TAKE PICTURES OUTSIDE, BUT, PLEASE, COME IN." AND THEY SCATTER GLD THAT'S LIKE HOLY WATER FROM THE DEVIL. LISTEN, I CAN'T WAIT FOR "THE LAST KNIGHT" AND TO SEE HOW LOUD IT GETS THIS TIME.
IT'S A SPECTACLE, THIS MOVIE. YOU SHOULD SEE IT.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO SEE IT. AGAIN, I HAVE CHILDREN.
YES, THEY'LL DRAG YOU TO IT.
Stephen: LISTEN, LET'S GO TO CHURCH SOME TIME.
LET'S DO IT, BUDDY.
Stephen: "TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT" IS IN THEATERS NOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JUSTIN BARTHA. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM THE "NATIONAL TREASURE" AND "HANGOVER" MOVIES. HE NOW STARS IN "THE GOOD FIGHT."
GOOD MORNING, YOUR HONOR.
GO MORNING, MR. MORELLO. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
LIKEWISE. THE GOVERNMENT ASKS THE DEFENDANT BE DETAINED PENDING TRIAL, BOTH AS A FLIGHT RISK AND A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY.
SERIOUS.
HE'S A DOCTOR WITH NO RECORD.
I SEEM TO HAVE STRUCK A CHORD OVER THERE, YOUR HONOR.
YES, IDIOCY HAS A WAY OF DOING THAT.
OKAY, THANK YOU. A LITTLE CORDIALITY HERE.
Stephen: LEES WELCOME JUSTIN BARTHA. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, MAN. I AM SUCH A HUGE, HUGE FAN OF YOURS FOR YEARS.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS SINCE "NATIONAL TREASURE."
GOOD LUCK WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2020.
Stephen: I'M JUST CONSIDERING IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENINGS-- OH, COME ON.
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
I MEAN, YOU WOULD MAKE A GREAT --
Stephen: I HAVE TO TALK TO MY-- I GOTTA TALK TO MY WIFE. I HAVE TO PRAY WITH MY SPIRITUAL ADVISER, OBVIOUSLY.
, OF COURSE. I MEAN, YOU WOULD MAKE A GREAT POTUS, I DO THINK THAT.
Stephen: HOLD ON. YOU MIGHT MAKE A GOOD SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.
I MEAN, MAYBE, IF YOU HAVE ANY ROOM ON YOUR ADMINISTRATION, I WOULD BE HONORED.
Stephen: WELL, HERE'S THE THING, IS I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT YOU LOOK A LOT LIKE PAUL RYAN.
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT. I DON'T SEE IT.
Stephen: WELL, I DO SEE IT BECAUSE HERE'S THIS-- I BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY-- YOU HELPED MAKE THIS.
WELL, THAT'S MY HEAD SHOT, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: OKAY, THIS IS YOUR HEAD SHOT. I'M GOING TO DO THIS. HOLD ON. THIS IS-- THIS IS-- OKAY. PAUL RYAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I MEAN, I SEE A LITTLE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS SO DISTURBING TO ME ABOUT THIS PICTURE-- A LOT OF THINGS ARE. BUT HE IS SO-- HE'S SO MUCH-- HE'S IN SUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN I AM. SEE HEE IS SO JACKED, WHICH IS-- I MEAN, IT'S TAKEN SO LONG TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE, HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME AT THE GYM DOING CURLS, I THINK.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE AN ACTOR.
I BE, I'M SUPPOSED TO LOOK THAT GOOD BUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I STOPPED ACTING.
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LOOK AS GOOD AS PAUL RYAN.
Stephen: AS I SAID, I FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOU, YOUR BIG BREAK WAS IN "NATIONAL TREASURE." WAS IT AN HONOR TO BE IN A MOVIE THAT EDUCATED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR HISTORY? SO ACCURATELY?
I HAVE HAD KIDS COME UP TO ME AND SAY THEY WATCHED IT IN SCHOOL. WHICH IS SO --
Stephen: THAT'S A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER, I HOPE.
I HOPE SO. I HOPE SO. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE A DREAM COME-- I NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE IN A BIG JERRY BRUCKHEIMER --
Stephen: WAS THAT REALLY YOUR FIRST BIG FILM?
THAT WAS MY SECOND MOVIE I WAS EVER IN. THE FIRST MOVIE I WAS IN WAS A HUGE BOMB CALLED GILI. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.  ( APPLAUSE ) BIG FANS.
Stephen: YEAH. WELL, JUSTIN THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH, THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE COUNTRY SAID, TOO. AND THAT'S MORE PEOPLE THAN SAW THE MOVIE.
Stephen: SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE IN THIS THING THAT WAS SUCH A--
IT WAS NERVE-RACKING FOR THE MOST PART. AND I-- THERE WAS-- THERE'S THIS-- I WAS NERVOUS ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, IT'S BRUCKHEIMER AND NICK CAGE.
Stephen: WELL YOUR CHARACTER IS KIND OF NERVOUS.
EXACTLY. SO I WAS JUST PLAYING MYSELF. I WAS JUST TRYING NOT TO MESS UP. AND ONE TIME, AFTER WE SHOT THE MOVIE, WE HAD TO DO A COUPLE OF RESHOOTS, RIGHT, AND ONE OF THE RESHOOTS WAS THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE. SO --
Stephen: AT THE VERY END, WHEN THE HAPPY EVER AFTER ENDING.
WHEN WE FIND THE TREASURE-- SPOILER ALERT-- WE FIND THE TREASURE, AND MY CHARACTER JUMPS INTO THIS BEAUTIFUL CONVERTIBLE FERRARI AND DRIVES OFF. I JUST HUNG OUT FOR A FEW MONTHS, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY AUDITIONED FOR SOME MORE MOVIES, WENT TRAVELING. AND IT WAS SUMMER IN NEW YORK MUCH LIKE A HOT SUMMER LIKE THIS, INDIAN SUMMER. AND I WAS WALKING WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE VILLAGE PAST ASTER PLACE BARBER SHOP. A GREAT OLD BARBER SHOP. IT'S LIKE A NEW YORK INSTITUTION. I SAID, "IT'S SO HOT, LET'S SHAVE OUR HEADS. I'VE NEVER SHAVED MY HEAD BEFORE. LET'S SHAVE OUR HEADS. IT'S SO FAST." WE GO DOWN, ME AND MY BUDDIES, WE SHAVE OUR HEADS, WE GO BACK UP TO THE HOT DAY. I'M LIKE, "OH, MAN, IT FEELS SO GOOD. I'M FORGETTING SOMETHING. WHAT AM I FORGETTING?" THE RESHOOTS WERE IN, LIKE, A WEEK AND A HALF FOR THE MOVIE. I HAD TO CALL THE MOST POWERFUL PRODUCER OF ALL TIME AND TELL HIM THAT I WAS THE DUMBEST ACTOR OF ALL TIME.
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THIS IS? I HAVE A SHOT HERE-- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
YUP. THAT IS-- THAT IS A WIG. THAT IS A FULL WIG. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I-- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COME UP TO ME ALL THE TIME-- PEOPLE COME UP TO ME ALL THE TIME AND SAY, "DID YOU GET TO KEEP THE FERRARI?" THEY'RE ALWAYS MIDDLE-AGED GROUPS FROM BROOKLYN. "DID YOU GET TO KEEP THE FERRARI?" AND I'M THINKING THE WHOLE TIME IN THAT SCENE I HOPE MY WIG DOESN'T FALL OFF.
Stephen: AND NOW WE'RE YOOUR DOING "THE GOOD FIGHT" HERE ON CBS ALL ACCESS. SEASON TWO IS COMING DOWN THE PIKE.
YUP.
Stephen: YOU'RE PLAYING A LAWYER IN HERE, A LOVE INTEREST WITH CUSH JUMBO, A NEMESIS TO CHRISTINE BARANSKI. ACTING AND LAWYERING IS SOMEWHAT ALIKE, RIGHT?
THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES, I THINK. I MEAN, YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY BOTH TRYING TO CONVINCE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH, RIGHT?
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO MEMORIZE A LOT.
YOU HAVE TO MEMORIZE, YOU KNOW, LINES OR THE LAW. AND I-- I HAVE-- I HAVE A FEW FRIENDS THAT ARE LAWYERS IN NEW YORK, AND WITH WHO I HUNG OUT WITH-- BECAUSE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE LAW SO I WANTED TO KIND OF RESEARCH. AND A LOT OF THESE GUYS AND WOMEN, THEY GO TO ACTING CLASS TO TRY TO KIND OF, YOU KNOW, SOLIDIFY THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE COURTROOM. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, THE STAKES ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOU SCREW UP AS A LAWYER, SOMEONE COULD END UP IN JAIL, OR WORSE. AND IF YOU SCREW UP AS AN ACTOR YOU END UP IN A $30,000 WIG.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHO HAS A LOT OF GREAT--
WHAT'S THAT.
Stephen: PAUL RYAN.
HE SURE DOES.
Stephen: WELL, LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: "THE GOOD FIGHT" IS AVAILABLE NOW ON CBS ALL ACCESS. JUSTIN BARTHA, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH QUANTUM PHYSICIST BRIAN GREENE. WE'RE GOING TO LEVITATE!
Stephen: WELL, WE ALWAYS LOVE HAVING YOU ON TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE BECAUSE WE LOVE IT. BUT THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, OUR GOVERNMENT WAS SLIGHTLY MORE SCIENCE FRIENDLY THAN IT IS NOW. HAVE YOU OR YOUR COLLEAGUES BEEN AFFECTED IN ANY WAY BY THIS?
YEAH, IT'S UTTERLY AWFUL. I MEAN FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS, SCIENCE HAS DRIVEN INNOVATION, AND, "LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, YOU MAKE AMERICA SMART. YOU MAKE AMERICA THINK. AND YOU KEEP AMERICA AT THE FRONTIER OF SCIENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OKAY. ONE OF THE WAYS-- ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE HAVING YOU ON FOR IS OFTEN YOU'RE HERE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ANNIVERSARY OF A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN MODERN SCIENCE. WHAT ARE WE CELEBRATING RIGHT NOW?
WELL, THIS IS THE 90th ANNIVERSARY OF ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS EXPERIMENTS IN ALL OF SCIENCE. IT'S CALLED THE DOUBLE-SLIT EXPERIMENT AND IT ESTABLISHED THE QUANTUM LAWS OF PHYSIC S.
Stephen:  AND THE DOUBLE SLIT IS-- IS THAT THE BAKING SODA VOLCANO WITH THE TWO HOLES ON THE TOP? WHAT IS THE DOUBLE SLIT.
IT IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DESCRIBE. I HAVE AN ANIMATION TO GIVE YOU A FEEL FOR IT.
Stephen: JIM, CAN WE PUT IT ON THE SCREEN.
IMAGINE YOU HAVE A GUN FIRING BULLETS OR PELLETS AT A SCREEN WITH TWO SLITS, TWO OPENINGS. THOSE ARE THE DOUBLE SLITS. AND YOUR INTUITION TELLS YOU THE PELLETS THAT GET THROUGH THE LEFT OPENING WILL LAND IN A BAND ALIGNED ON THE RIGHT, AND THOSE ON THE RIGHT WILL LAND ALIGNED ON THE RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH BULLETS. LET'S RUN THAT EXPERIMENT WITH ONE CHANGE. WE'RE SIMPLY GOING TO DIAL DOWN THE SIZE OF THE BULLETS MAKING THEM SMALLER. SMALL LITTLE PARTICLES, LIKE ELECTRONS. YOUR INTUITION TELLS YOU PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING SHOULD LAP. THOSE ELECTRONS THAT WILL GO THROUGH THE LEFT WILL LAND IN A BAND ON THE LEFT. AND THOSE THAT GO THROUGH THE RIGHT WILL LAND IN A WAND BAND ON THE RIGHT. BUT THE AMAZING THING DISCOVERED IN 1927 IS THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, IN SOME SENSE, BY ACCIDENT. THERE WERE TWO PHYSICISTS OUT AT BILLION LABS, DAVIDSON AND GERM ATHEY'RE DOING AN EXPERIMENT, IT EXPLODES. THEY FIX IT BY THE NICKEL CRYSTAL THEY WERE FIRING ELECTRONS ON GOT TARNISHED. THEY HEATED IT UP, AND WHEN THEY HEATED IT, THEY UNWITTINGLY CHANGEDLY THE EXPERIMENT INTO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT RIGHT HERE. AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS WHEN YOU FIRE WANT ELECTRONS AND THE BARRIER WITH THE TWO SLITS, YOU DON'T JUST GET TWO BANDS. YOU GET MORE BANDS. AND THAT SIMPLE CHANGE, GOING FROM OU EXPECTATION OF TWO BANDS IN THIS CASE FIVE BANDS, THAT REPRESENTS THE SINGLE GREATEST UPHEAVAL IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF REALITY THAT THE SPECIES HAS EVER ENCOUNTERED.
Stephen: WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY. OKAY. WHY DOES-- WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN? THAT IS THE QUESTION. WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN.
Stephen: THAT'S MY QUESTION.
AN & AMAZINGLY, WE HAVE THE MATHEMATICS, THE MATH OF QUANTUM PHYSICS THAT DESCRIBES THAT PERFECTLY, RIGHT. BUT 90 YEARS LATER, WE ARE STILL ARGUING ABOUT WHAT THAT MATH TELLS US ABOUT THE NATURE OF REALITY.
Stephen: BECAUSE AT A-- IF THE BULLETS GET SMALL ENOUGH THINGS GET UNCERTAIN.
THINGS GET UNCERTAIN. AND MOREOVER BECAUSE THE BANDS ARE SPREAD OUT, IT MUST MEAN THAT THE PARTICLES THEMSELVES IN SOME SENSE ARE SPREAD OUT. WHICH LEADS US TO THE IDEA THAT PARTICLES ARE ACTUALLY WAVES. A WAVE GOES --
Stephen: BUT PARTICLES AT THE SAME TIME.
THAT'S RIGHT. SO THEY'RE BOTH PARTICLES AND WAVES AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S THE CRAZY THING.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT UNCERTAINTY AT THAT SMALL SCALE HOW COME I DON'T FEEL THAT UNCERTAINTY AS A BIG SCALE. I'M HERE, I'M NOT PARTICLE AND WAVE. I'M PARTICLE, AREN'T YOU?
YOU THINK SO.
Stephen: I DO.
THE MATH SHOWS QUITE CLEARLY THE BIGGER YOU GET THE WEIRDNESS OF THE QUANTUM WORLD GETS SUPPRESSED.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT IT'S STILL THERE. SO YOU ACTUALLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS --
Stephen: CAN WE DEMONSTRATE SOME QUANTUM WEIRDNESS AT A SCALE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS OVER HERE.
THIS IS CALLED QUANTUM LEVITATION. AND WHEN WE LEARN THE QUANTUM LAWS, WE WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND A WHOLE CLASS OF STRANGE MATERIALS CALLED SUPER CONDUCTORS. A SUPER CONDUCTOR IS A PIECE OF MATERIAL THAT'S EMBEDDED IN THIS PLASTIC CASING WHEN YOU MAKE IT VERY COLD, LIKE 300 DEGREES BELOW ZERO, IT CONDUCTS TRFT WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE. TO MAKE IT COLD, WE NEED LIQUID NITROGENS. I'M GLAD YOU HAVE YOUR GLOVES ON.
Stephen:  WE KEEP A TANK OF THAT AROUND ALL THE TIME.
IT'S VERY GOOD STUFF.
Stephen: THAT GOES IN THERE?
WE CAN POUR THIS IN HERE. WE DON'T REALLY NEED THE REST. PUT THAT OVER THERE.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO BILL YOU FOR THAT.
YEAH, THERE YOU GO. HERE'S THE THING, SO A SUPER CONDUCTOR DETESTS MAGNETIC FIELDS.
Stephen: OKAY.
WHICH MEANS IF I BRING IT NEAR A STRONG MAGNET-- THIS IS A VERY STRONG MAGNET RIGHT OVER HERE. I'M GOING TO PICK IT UP AND LET YOU MANIPULATE IT. SO I'M GOING TO PUT THIS OVER HERE ON THE TOP. IF YOU HOLD IT STILL, I CAN PUT IT-- LOOK AT THAT. STRANGE ANGLE. IT STILL HOLDS IN. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, THE SUPER CONDUCTOR IS EXPELG MAGNETIC FIELD, BUT QUANTUM MECHANICS ALLOWS QUANTUM SPIKES TO GRAB HOLD OF IT. IN FACT, LET ME HOLD IT FOR ONE SECOND. I WANT YOU TO FEEL IT. PUSH STRAIGHT DOWN ON THAT. WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?
Stephen: WHOA. A LOT OF RESISTANCE.
ARE YOU PUTTING THIS IN THE QUANTUM SPIKE SO MUCH SO YOU CAN TURN THIS UPSIDE DOWN LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST TWO MAGNETS REPELLING EACH OTHER. IT'S QUANTUM TENTACLES. THIS IS A CIRCULAR MAGNET. I CAN PUT THIS ON. GIVE THIS A GENTLE SPIN.
Stephen: IS THAT HOW FIGIT SPINNERS WERE INVENTED.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS OVER HERE.
LET'S TAKE THIS GUY OVER HERE THIS IS A CIRCULAR TRACK. SO THE FIELD IS UNIFORM ALONG. SO IF I TAKE --
Stephen: DON'T PUT YOUR FINGERS-- MR. SCIENTIST. EVEN I KNOW NOT TO PUT MY FINGS, OR LIQUID NITROGEN.
NOWIMENT TO YOU TAKE THIS GUY AND GIVE THIS GUY A GENTLE LITTLE PUSH. SEE THAT? LOOK AT THAT. NOW WE CAN ALSO-- PLAWZ --
Stephen: HOW SOON UNTIL I GO TO WORK ON ONE OF THESE THINGS.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE. CHECK THIS OUT. WE CAN DO THAT UPSIDE DOWN. THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. LET'S GIVE THIS A WHIRL. HERE WE GO. COME TO THE OTHER SIDE HERE. PUT THIS HERE. AND I DOLL THIS BARE HANDED. ANYTHING FOR SCIENCE. AND THERE IT GOES. LOOK AT THAT.
Stephen: WOW.  ( APPLAUSE ).
IT'S HOLDING ON TO IT.
Stephen: PROFESSOR BRIAN GREENE, EVERYBODY. QUANTUM LEVITATION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW." PLEASE TUNE IN TOMORROW. MY GUESTS WILL BE NAOMI WATTS, ARI GRAYNOR, AND MUSICAL GUEST SWET SHOP BOYS. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT!    Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
