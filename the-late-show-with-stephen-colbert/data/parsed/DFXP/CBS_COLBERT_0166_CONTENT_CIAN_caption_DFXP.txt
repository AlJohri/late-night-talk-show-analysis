I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, YOUR HOST FOR "THE LATE SHOW" TONIGHT. HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN WATCHING THIS SIT-IN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PRETTY DRAMATIC. IT IS SO RARE THAT CONGRESS DOES ANYTHING INTERESTING. (LAUGHTER) DOESN'T IT FEEL THAT WAY? WAIT, WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON! I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING IN MY ADULT LIFE HAPPENING THAT I SAID, "OH, THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D EXPECT OF CONGRESS. (LAUGHTER) IS THAT A SHRED OF COURAGE I SEE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I SEE SOMETHING IN THERE. SO I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD: "THANK YOU CONGRESS FOR SITTING ON YOUR ASS." (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: AFTER THE PROTEST BEGAN, PAUL RYAN DECLARED A RECESS AND CUT OFF C-SPAN'S LIVE FEED. (AUDIENCE BOOING) NOW, PERSONALLY, I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE PAUL RYAN DECIDES WHAT'S ON TV. (APPLAUSE) I'M GUESSING IT WOULD JUST BE P-90X INFOMERCIALS AND TOP GUN. 24 HOURS A DAY. (APPLAUSE) ♪ DANGER ZONE!♪!♪  I CAN SEE HIM AS A TOM CRUISE, YEAH. BUT THE WHOLE THING BACKFIRED ON REPUBLICANS WHEN THE DEMOCRATS USED PERISCOPE, WHICH GAVE THE SIT-IN A LO-FI, GUERILLA-STYLE THAT FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING. IT'S PRETTY GRAINY, BUT TO BE FAIR, MOST CONGRESSMEN ARE SO OLD THAT THEY SHOT THAT FOOTAGE ON ROTARY PHONES. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT AGAIN, IT FELT EXCITING. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. I DI DID YOU NOT, WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THIS, MY TEENAGE SON SAID, "LET'S GO WATCH C-SPAN!" I HOPE HE'S NOT ON DRUGS. (LAUGHTER) AND HE WASN'T ALONE, CSPAN SAW AN 800% INCREASE IN RATINGS LAST NIGHT. 800%! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S MEANS LIKE 800 PEOPLE WERE WATCHING. (LAUGHTER) THINGS REALLY GOT CRAZY. PAUL RYAN CAME BACK TO THE HOUSE TO ATTEMPT TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE CHAMBER.
HOUSE WILL BE IN ORDER. THE CHAIR WISHES TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THE DECORUM IN THE HOUSE CHAMBER.
STEPHEN: AND ONCE AGAIN, JOHN BOEHNER GOES TO BED, SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. (APPLAUSE) BYE-BYE! BYE-BYE, GOOD LUCK! GOOD LUCK, SUCKERS! ♪ (LAUGHTER) AND SOME REPUBLICANS GOT REALLY MAD. IN FACT, ON TWITTER, NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN MARK WALKER ATTACKED JOHN LEWIS, TWEETING "CALLING THIS A SIT-IN IS A DISGRACE TO WOOLWORTH'S." KEEP IN MIND, JOHN LEWIS LED WOOLWORTH LUNCH COUNTER SIT-INS DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IN THE 1960s. AND THIS GUY'S LECTURING HIM ON WHAT IS OR IS NOT A SIT-IN. I'M NOT SURPRISED MARK WALKER DIDN'T JOIN THE SIT-IN. WITH BALLS THAT BIG, SITTING MUST BE PAINFUL. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) KEEP THOSE SEPARATED FOR A WHILE. OH, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS, DONALD TRUMP HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S NORMAL FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO GO OVERSEAS TO MEET WORLD LEADERS AND BRUSH UP ON FOREIGN POLICY. WHICH IS WHY TODAY TRUMP WENT TO SCOTLAND TO PROMOTE A GOLF COURSE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. THEY HAVE TO MODEL THE CLOWN'S MOUTH OFF SOMEONE. (APPLAUSE) NOW, SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS TRIP IS AN UNNECESSARY DISTRACTION FROM THE ELECTION. AS ONE POLITICAL STRATEGIST SAID, "EVERYONE KNOWS THIS IS THE WRONG THING FOR THE NOMINEE TO BE DOING NOW, AND IT IS AMAZING THIS CAN'T BE STOPPED." THEN AGAIN, "IT IS AMAZING THIS CAN'T BE STOPPED" "IS" TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE'S GOT A LOT OF CAMPAIGN SLOGANS. WHO HERE LOVES TICKETMASTER? (CHEERING) THAT SURPRISES ME. YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS WITH YOUR LOVE. YOU'RE VERY NICE PEOPLE. WELL, TICKETMASTER IS SETTLING A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR OVERCHARGING CUSTOMERS. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, THEY'RE GIVING OUT $5 MILLION IN FREE CONCERT TICKETS. OBVIOUSLY, MINUS A $3.5 MILLION PROCESSING FEE. HERE'S THE THING -- ANYONE IS ELIGIBLE IF THEY USED TICKETMASTER BETWEEN 1999 AND 2013, SO YOU'RE INCLUDED, WHETHER YOU SAW SMASHMOUTH IN THEIR PRIME AT THE STAPLES CENTER OR JUST A FEW YEARS LATER IN THE PARKING LOT OF A STAPLES. ♪ SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME -- ♪ I LOVE SMASHMOUTH!

WEIRD AL YANKOVIC COVER ARTIST, ABSURD PHILIP MOSCOWITZ. USHER, NOT THE ARTIST "USHER," JUST AN USHER. POLYPALOOZA, A THREE DAY FESTIVAL FEATURING THE MOST EXCITING COLON POLYPS.

CORRECT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU FINISHED WRITING THE SPEECH?
NO. I CAN USE SOME HELP, STEPHEN.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THE POINTS OF THE SPEECH. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE IN THE SPEECH THAT YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE SOME HELP PHRASING?
YES. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE IS THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE WILL CONTINUE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH THE STRONGEST PLATFORM THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS EVER SEEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE WITH GOING TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT TO CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US AND NOT JUST THE FEW ON TOP.

GOT A FEW MORE.
Stephen: THESE, I HATE TO SAY, THEY ALL SOUND GOOD. I HAVE HEARD THESE BEFORE.
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THEM AGAIN, AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION-FREE! YOU GOT IT? F-R-E-E!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU MIGHT BE SAYING TONIGHT ABOUT THE STATUS OF YOUR CAMPAIGN THAT I WOULD WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOW AND FELT CHEATED IF I DIDN'T GET TO ASK YOU ABOUT BECAUSE YOU SAID IT AFTER THE SHOW WAS OVER? IN OTHER WORDS, ARE YOU CONTINUING YOUR CAMPAIGN AFTER TONIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ARE YOU STILL A CANDIDATE?
YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE?
NO.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT? NO. I TELL YOU WHY. I'M VERY GOOD AT ARITHMETIC. WASN'T MUCH OF A STUDENT BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD IN ARITHMETIC. I UNDERSTAND THAT SECRETARY CLINTON HAS A LOT MORE -- OR WE HAVE 1900 DELEGATES GOING TO PHILADELPHIA FOR THE CONVENTION, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. SHE HAS MORE, WHICH IS NOT SO GOOD FOR ME. IT'S GOOD FOR HER. BUT 1900 DELEGATES IS ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS MARSHALING OUR RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT, A, WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP AND WE DEFEAT HIM BADLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU KNOW HE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. HE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. HE'S IN SCOTLAND.
CHECKING ON HIS GOLF COURSES? IS THAT WHAT IT IS? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YEAH, MM-HMM. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, CAMPAIGNS ARE ABOUT WINNING AND LOSING NOMINATIONS, BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS THE NEED TO TRANSFORM AMERICA. I'VE SAID SINCE DAY ONE, WE NEED A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. ALL OF YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE WATCHING HAVE GOT TO BE INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, HAVE GOT TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THE KIND OF AMERICA WE KNOW WE CAN BECOME. AND I'M NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP ON THAT FIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO ENDORSE SECRETARY CLINTON THIS EVENING?
NO.
Stephen: OKAY. ARE YOU HOLDING OUT FOR SOMETHING? WHAT IS IT YOU WANT? JOHN EDWARDS WOULDN'T ENDORSE ANYBODY IN 2008 UNTIL SOMEBODY GAVE HIM A JET SKI. (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS IT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?
GOOD. THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND THAT'S WHAT POLITICS IS ABOUT. LOOK, WE GOT 12 MILLION VOTES DURING OUR CAMPAIGN. WE RECEIVED, I BELIEVE, EVERY SINGLE PRIMARY AND CAUCUS THE LION'S SHARE OF YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE UNDER 45 YEARS OF AGE WHO ARE PREPARED TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR REAL CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BRINGING IN TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. WHAT DO WE WANT IN RETURN? WE WANT OUR 12 MILLION SUPPORTERS TO BE HEARD! (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR PROOF OF THAT? WHAT'S THE PROOF OF THAT FOR YOU?
WELL, THE PROOF IS, RIGHT NOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, OUR CAMPAIGN IS TALKING TO SECRETARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN, AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE CERTAIN THAT SHE IS GOING TO COME OUT VERY STRONGLY IN MOVING TOWARD MAKING PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TUITION-FREE. I WANT TO SEE HER MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION.
Stephen: IS THIS A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION?
YEAH, IT IS. LOOK -- WELL, IT'S FRIENDLY -- (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, SECRETARY CLINTON I'VE KNOWN FOR 25 YEARS AND I AGREE THAT TRUMP HAS TO BE DEFEATED.
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE FELT LIKE THE FIX WAS IN FOR SECRETARY CLINT UP. DONALD TRUMP SAYS, ROTTEN SYSTEM, FIX WAS IN, BERNIE GOT CHEATED, BERNIE SUPPORTERS COME VOTE FOR TRUMP. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOUR SUPPORTERS ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP?
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT. MY SUPPORTERS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE DO NOT WANT A BIGOT TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Stephen: OKAY. DID YOU EXPECT, AS YOU SAID, YOU WERE NEGOTIATING WITH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW TO GET SOMETHING FROM THEM OF YOUR AGENDA BEFORE YOU ENDORSE THE SECRETARY. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? DO YOU NARNIA OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? (LAUGHTER) GET SOMETHING GOOD, BERNIE!
WELL, I HAVE RIGHT NOW AS GOOD AS IT GETS. I'M THE SENATOR FROM THE BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT STATE OF VERMONT. CAN'T DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU WENT TO THE FLOOR YESTERDAY TO JOIN THE SIT-IN. WHAT WAS IT LIKE DOWN THERE? SEEMS LIKE, AT TIMES, IT SEEMS LIKE A DRUM CIRCLE. AT TIMES, IT SEEMS LIKE CHAOS. IT'S REALLY MOVING TO SEE THEM TAKE THIS ACTION.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE ON THE FLOOR AND IS THERE HOSTILITY TO WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE FLOOR?
IT'S ALMOST EMBARRASSING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT BECAUSE IT'S SO CRAZY. WE HAVE REPUBLICANS WHO APPARENTLY THINK IT'S OKAY TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF AIRPLANES FOR GOOD REASONS BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSIBLE TERRORISTS. WE ALL WANT TO SEE THAT CONTINUE. YET THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET ON A PLANE APPARENTLY CAN WALK INTO A GUN STORE AND BUY AN AK-47 WHICH CAN BE USED TO MOW DOWN PEOPLE. IT IS SO CRAZY WE HAVE TO ARGUE ABOUT HAVING SANE GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION, KEEPING GUNS AWAY FROM TERRORISTS, THAT IT'S ALMOST EMBARRASSING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DID YOU EXPECT TO GET THIS CLOSE TO THE NOMINATION WHEN YOU STARTED OUT? BECAUSE I THINK, FOR SOME PEOPLE, PART OF THE JOY OF WATCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN WAS THE SORT OF HAPPY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE WERE JUMPING ON BOARD WITH WHAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS IDEALISM.
IT'S NOT IDEALISM. YOU KNOW, WE WENT FURTHER AND FASTER THAN I WOULD HAVE PREDICTED, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ASK ORDINARY PEOPLE WHETHER THEY THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THEY HAVE TO WORK TWO OR THREE JOBS AND ALMOST NEW WEALTH AND INCOME GOES TO THE TOP 1%. YOU KNOW WHAT, MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THEY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY OF ANY COUNTRY WHEN WE'RE SEEING A PROLIFERATION OF MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY NOT TO PROVIDE PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL RELIEF FOR ALL PEOPLE AS A RIGHT. THESE ARE NOT RADICAL IDEAS. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN CHINA, ALL RIGHT, 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE. (APPLAUSE) THE TRUTH IS THESE ARE NOT RADICAL IDEAS BUT THEY'RE NOT SEEN ON THE TV TERRIBLY OFTEN. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING SOME OF YOUR SPONSORS, BUT --
Stephen: HEY, HEY, HEY... HEY, HEY... I'LL HAVE PAUL RYAN PULL THE PLUG HERE IN A SECOND, IF YOU DON'T -- (APPLAUSE) LET'S LIVE IN A CRAZY WORLD WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO END YOUR CAMPAIGN AT SOME POINT. IS THERE A MOST CHERISHED MEMORY OF THE ENTIRE THING, A MOMENT THAT YOU WILL TAKE BACK TO VERMONT WITH YOU?
THERE ARE MANY.
Stephen: IS THERE ONE THAT STANDS OUT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WALKING OUT IN PORTLAND, OREGON, AND SEEING 28,000 PEOPLE OUT IN AN ARENA. ON A MORE POIGNANT NOTE, WAS TALKING TO PARENTS IN FLINT, MICHIGAN, WHOSE KIDS WERE POISONED BY THE WATER THAT THEY DRANK AND, AS A RESULT, DEVELOPED BRAIN DAMAGE. I MEAN, YOU LEARN SO MUCH AND YOU SEE SO MUCH. I MEAN, I ALMOST WISH I HAD A CAMERA WITH ME ALL THE TIME TO SEE WHAT GOES ON IN AMERICA THAT TOO RARELY IS SEEN ON TV. THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND WANT TO TRANSFORM THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT WAS THE MOST GRATIFYING ASPECT OF THIS WHOLE THING. LOOKING OUT -- JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I WAS OUT IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FARMLAND OUT THERE, CENTRAL CALIFORNIA, AND YOU SEE YOUNG LATINOS AND YOUNG BLACKS AND WHITE KIDS REALLY LOVING THIS COUNTRY, WANTING TO SEE IT DOING A LOT BETTER THAN WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND THAT JUST GIVES ME INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF HOPE AND ENERGY.

Stephen: SO YOU'RE VERY VULNERABLE IN THIS ROLE AND A LOT OF YOUR ROLES. ALMOST ALARMINGLY VULNERABLE.
OKAY.
Stephen: NO, BUT IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

YEAH.
Stephen: WERE YOU ALWAYS LIKE THIS AND SAY, WELL, I WEAR MY HEART ON MY SLEEVE, I MIGHT AS WELL BE AN ACTOR, OR DID YOU HAVE TO TRAIN UP INTO THIS ABILITY?
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY THINK I'M A FAIRLY QUIET PERSON. I WOULD PROBABLY CALL MYSELF MORE OF AN INTROVERT, SO IT'S A FUNNY THING TO BE A PERFORMER, AND I NEVER HAD A LIGHTNING BOLT MOMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHY. EVEN IF YOU ASKED ME WHY YOU'RE AN ACTOR, I DON'T KNOW WHY, EXCEPT THAT, LIKE, I'M DRAWN TO IT FOR SOME REASON, AND PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT, AND I DO LOVE IT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SKILLS?
NO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: LIKE, IF THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU, LIKE, WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING? IF YOU HAD TO MAKE A LIVING DOING SOMETHING ELSE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE THE ROMANTIC NOTION OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE A FARMER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SOUNDS REALLY HARD, ACTUALLY.
I WOULD FAIL MISERABLY.

Stephen: WHAT IS IS THIS AND WHY?
OKAY, SO I WAS JUST WORKING IN KOREA. I'M A BIG, BIG BASKETBALL FAN AND I HAD TO BE AWAY DURING THE PLAYOFFS BUT LUCKILY I GOT TO WATCH THEM EVERY MORNING WHEN I ATE BREAKFAST. I STREAMED THE GAMES THAT WERE ON HERE WHEN I ATE BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING BUT GAME SEVEN OF THE N.B.A. FINALS, I HAD TO BE ON A PLANE HOME FROM SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO DELAY MY FLIGHT BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET HOME. I DEBATED THAT BUT ZOE WOULD KILL ME IF I DELAYED A FLIGHT TO WATCH A BASKETBALL GAME. SO I SAID, OKAY. ZOE TAPED THE GAME. I WENT ON SHUTDOWN MODE WHERE I KEPT MUSIC ON IN MY -- EARS AND MY HEAD TOWARD THE GROUND. I DIDN'T SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING. WHEN I GOT IN THE CAR, I SAID TO THE CABBY, DON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BASKETBALL GAME. I SAID, I'M SOAR RIRGS THAT SOUNDS SO RUDE, BUT JUST DON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BASKETBALL GAME. NOW HERE'S WHERE I'M GOING. AND I MADE IT HOME. FRIENDS BET ME I WOULDN'T MAKE IT HOME WITHOUT FINDING OUT THE FINAL SCORE.

I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THE DIRECTORS -- THEY'RE CALLED THE DANIELS -- SAID TO ME. THEY SAID WE WANT TO MAKE A FILM WHERE THE FIRST FART MAKES YOU LAUGH AND THE LAST FART A MAKES YOU CRY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT SHOULD BE ON THE POSTER!
AND THAT WAS IT. YOU KNOW. NO, REALLY, THOUGH. THINK ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, I WAS IN. I WAS IN. I WAS IN! I MEAN, COULD WE DO IT? (LAUGHTER) LIKE, WHAT A CHALLENGE. AT THE SUN DABS MOVIE FESTIVAL, THE MOVIE PLAYED. WE DID A Q&A ON STAGE AND WHEN THE Q&A ENDED, WE HAD A MIDDLE-AND I WOMAN RUN UP ON THE STAGE CRYING, AND SHE REALLY GOT THE FILM. SHE SAID TO ME, I HAVE A FRIEND WHO WE CAN FART IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER, AND SHE SAID, I HAVE A FRIEND WHO CAN'T FART IN FRONT OF ME, AND I KNOW IF HE COULD, EWOULD BE SO MUCH HAPPIER.
