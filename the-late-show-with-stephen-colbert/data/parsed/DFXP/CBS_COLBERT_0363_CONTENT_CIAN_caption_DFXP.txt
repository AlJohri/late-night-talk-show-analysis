Captioning sponsored by CBS ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS HAS DIRECTED FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TO REEVALUATE MARIJUANA LEGISLATION.
MY BEST VIEW IS WE DON'T NEED TO BE LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS. ♪ ♪ ♪
NOT ABLE TO BE RUSHED THIS FAST. IT MAKES ME NERVOUS. ♪ THE -- COLLEAGUES, THAT IS FALSE. I CAN'T SAY "COLLEAGUES" NOW. I'M NO LONGER A PART OF THIS BODY. ♪ I DON'T RECALL -- I DON'T RECALL -- I DON'T HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION -- I DON'T REMEMBER. I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY REAL RECALL OF THE MEETING. I COULD SAY I POSSIBLY HAVE A MEETING BUT I STILL DO NOT RECALL IT. I DON'T RECALL.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MILO VENTIMIGLIA, JUDY GREER AND COMEDIAN KEITH ALBERSTADT, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WHOO! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! HOW ARE YA? HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WE -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW ON A REGULAR BASIS, YOU KNOW THAT WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE LATEST THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE DAY ON THAT SHOW, THAT NIGHT. LAST NIGHT, WE COULD NOT. BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER THE SHOW WAS FINISHED, AS SOON AS IT ENDED, IT WAS REVEALED SPECIAL AGENT ROBERT MUELLER IS INVESTIGATING DONALD TRUMP FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IS THAT THUNDER? LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO NEED TO CHANGE THE HAT: "MAKE JUSTICE OBSTRUCTED AGAIN." THIS IS A BIG MOMENT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. WHEN THE MOVIE COMES OUT, THIS WILL BE DEFINITELY IN IT. AND I WILL DEFINITELY BE PLAYED BY HUGH JACKMAN. AND I'LL STILL HAVE THE CLAWS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CAN'T GROW A BEARD, THOUGH. OF COURSE, MUELLER'S INVESTIGATING WHETHER TRUMP PRESSURED COMEY AND THE HEADS OF THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO BACK OFF THE RUSSIA PROBE. BUT WHO KNOWS WHY HE FIRED COMEY?
WHEN I DECIDED TO JUST DO IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, "YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIA THING, WITH TRUMP AND RUSSIA, IS A MADE UP STORY."
STEPHEN: THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, "MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SAY THAT ON TV." OH, THAT'S A CAMERA? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A CAMERA? THESE ARE ALL CAMERAS, AND I'M ON TV AND I JUST SAID IT. OKAY. AND MUELLER IS NOT KIDDING AROUND. TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED, HE'S PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN ALL-STAR LEGAL TEAM. YES, MUELLER'S LIKE BATMAN GETTING FLASH, GREEN LANTERN, AND WONDER WOMAN TO JOIN "THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE LEAGUE!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I'D WATCH THAT MOVIE.
Jon: THAT WILL BE A GOOD MOVIE.
Stephen: I WOULD WATCH THAT MOVIE. CRITICS COMPLAIN THAT MUELLER HAS HIRED THREE PEOPLE FOR HIS LEGAL TEAM WHO HAVE GIVEN POLITICAL DONATIONS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO DEMOCRATS. AND THAT HE SHOULD ONLY BE HIRING PEOPLE WITH NO POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. AS ONE TRUMP SUPPORTER PUT IT, "HE HAS TO HAVE A STAFF OF VIRGINS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES. YES. STAFF OF VIRGINS. (SINGING) WHICH, I BELIEVE, IS HOW TRUMP ENDED UP WITH REINCE PRIEBUS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WHY NOT? FRESH-FACED BOY. EARLIER THIS WEEK, A PERSONAL FRIEND SAYS TRUMP CONSIDERED FIRING MUELLER. AND TRUMP COULD DO IT. HE'D JUST HAVE TO ORDER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE MR. MUELLER. IF MR. ROSENSTEIN REFUSED, MR. TRUMP COULD FIRE HIM, TOO. OF COURSE, THAT WOULD BE ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT NIXON DID IN WATERGATE'S "SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE." SO, IN A WAY, VERY PRESIDENTIAL. SO WHY DID TRUMP FLOAT THIS FIRING IDEA THROUGH HIS FRIEND? WELL, WORD IS, TRUMP THOUGHT THAT "THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING FIRED WOULD FOCUS MUELLER ON DELIVERING WHAT THE PRESIDENT DESIRES MOST: A BLANKET PUBLIC EXONERATION." AND NOW, HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR OBSTRUCTION. I GUESS THAT THREAT OF FIRING... BACKFIRED. ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO TRUMP JUST HURT HIMSELF WITH WHAT ONE WHITE HOUSE INSIDER CALLED, "THIS COCKAMAMIE SCHEME TO GET MUELLER TO PLAY BALL." NOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHO AT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THIS, BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT "COCKAMAMIE" IS MIKE PENCE'S DIRTIEST SWEAR WORD. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND WHEN ASKED HOW THE WHITE HOUSE WAS GOING TO HANDLE THIS, ONE SENIOR OFFICIAL REPLIED, "KEEP HIM AWAY FROM TWITTER. DEAR GOD, KEEP HIM AWAY FROM TWITTER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. > OH, COME ON. HE'S A GROWN MAN AND I'M SURE... "THEY MADE UP A PHONY COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS STORY, FOUND ZERO PROOF, SO NOW THEY GO FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ON THE PHONY STORY. NICE." NO! YOU CAN'T RUIN THE WORD "NICE" FOR US, TOO! YOU'VE ALREADY RUINED "SAD," AND "WALL," AND "COVFEFE." NO! NO! ( APPLAUSE ) NO ONE WILL EVER NAME THEIR CHILD COVFEFE NOW. TRUMP ALSO TWEETED, "YOU ARE WITNESSING THE SINGLE GREATEST WITCH HUNT IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY, LED BY SOME VERY BAD AND CONFLICTED PEOPLE! HASHTAG MAGA." YES, IT'S JUST LIKE THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS, WHEN THOSE YOUNG WOMEN WERE ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT AND THEN SAID, "WE DID WITCHCRAFT," IN AN INTERVIEW WITH LESTER HOLT. ( APPLAUSE ) LESTER HOLT FANS. I LOVE LESTER HOLT. AND LAST NIGHT, SOMEONE LEAKED THE R.N.C.'S TALKING POINTS ON THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. THE G.O.P. PARTY LINE IS TO CLAIM MUELLER STRUCK OUT ON TRYING TO PROVE COLLUSION, AND IS TRYING TO SAVE FACE. NO! GETTING INVESTIGATED FOR A SECOND CRIME DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MEAN YOU DIDN'T COMMIT THE FIRST CRIME. "YOUR HONOR, YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M GOING TO JAIL FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY? PRETTY SURE THE BATTERY CANCELS OUT THE ASSAULT. UNHAND ME, SIR." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) SPEAKING OF RUSSIA, YESTERDAY, THE SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED TO IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA OVER ELECTION MEDDLING. 97 - 2. WHO VOTED AGAINST IT? AS USUAL, IT WAS WYOMING SENATORS BORIS AND NATASHA. ( LAUGHTER ) THOSE TWO, VERY STAUNCH. VERY STAUNCH SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT. ( APPLAUSE ) THEY BLAME HACKING THE D.N.C. ON MOOSE AND SQUIRREL. NOW, TRUMP HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT RUSSIA. HE'S EVEN MENTIONED EASING SANCTIONS. BUT THIS BILL ALLOWS CONGRESS TO BLOCK ANY EFFORTS BY THE PRESIDENT TO SCALE BACK SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEP. NOW, THIS LOOKS LIKE CONGRESS THINKS SOMETHING FISHY IS GOING ON BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA... ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING? OH, THIS IS KIND OF BIG NEWS. FOX NEWS IS DROPPING ITS "FAIR AND BALANCED" SLOGAN. I ASSUME BECAUSE THEY FINALLY WATCHED THEMSELVES. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? THIS ISN'T RIGHT AT ALL! ( PIANO RIFF ) ACCORDING TO A FOX INSIDER, THE SLOGAN WAS DROPPED BECAUSE THE PHRASE HAD "BEEN MOCKED." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FOR NOW, FOX NEWS WILL BE USING ITS OTHER SLOGAN: "MOST WATCHED. MOST TRUSTED." BUT HERE ARE SOME OTHER PHRASES THAT THEY BRIEFLY CONSIDERED. "CNN FOR YOUR ANGRY UNCLE." "THANKS FOR WATCHING, MR. PRESIDENT!" AND PERHAPS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL REJECTED SLOGAN, "YOU'D BE PRETTY IF YOU SMILED MORE." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS OUT THERE, BECAUSE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN RUINING OUR CHILDHOODS BY TELLING US THAT DINOSAURS MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN COVERED IN FEATHERS. LOOK AT HOW STUPID THAT IS. HE LOOKS LIKE A PARROT STEPPING ON A LEGO. ( LAUGHTER ) PALEONTOLOGISTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE T-REX HAD SCALY SKIN AND NOT FEATHERS! OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. SCALY SKIN, NO FEATHERS.
Jon: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: NOW TO SEE SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE COVERED IN FEATHERS, YOU WILL HAVE TO GO TO COACHELLA. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYONE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW, ALMOST EVERYONE. WELL, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS BECAUSE NEW YORK CITY HAS EASED THE SEVERITY OF LAWS AGAINST PUBLIC URINATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS! IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND A BATHROOM IN THIS TOWN! IF YOU'RE WAITING IN LINE FOR THE STARBUCKS BATHROOM, THE LINE JUST BECAME THE BATHROOM. ( LAUGHTER ) UNDER THESE NEW RULES, IF YOU RELIEVE YOURSELF ON THE BIG APPLE, YOU WILL ONLY GET "A TICKET, LIKE FOR BREAKING THE SPEED LIMIT." THAT'LL SAVE THE POLICE SOME PAPER WORK. THEY CAN JUST DO A TWO-FER WHEN THEY CATCH YOU DOING 90 AND PEEING OUT THE WINDOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL SAYS DOWNGRADING THE OFFENSE WILL "DIVERT 100,000 CASES A YEAR FROM A BACKLOGGED CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM." 100,000 CASES PER YEAR! ( LAUGHTER ) NO WONDER SEA LEVELS ARE RISING! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MILO VENTIMIGLIA IS HERE, BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL REVEAL MY DEEPEST MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS.
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY'S ALL BLACK TONIGHT. VERY FORMAL. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WOW.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW, I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC WHICH MEANS THE GUILTY LAVEER IS BAKED RIGHT IN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I DON'T GET TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I LIKE, AND I REALLY MISS MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITION: CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
AUDIENCE: OF COURSE NOT!
STEPHEN: GREAT. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!" ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, WAIT RIGHT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( SOFT ORGAN MUSIC ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE: AS A CATHOLIC, I BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS ALWAYS BY MY SIDE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS ENTITLES ME TO USE THE CARPOOL LANE. ( LAUGHTER ) MY DOCTOR TELLS ME TO LIMIT MY ALCOHOL INTAKE TO ONE GLASS OF WINE A DAY. BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED, BOTTLES ARE MADE OF GLASS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LAST WEEK, I WON $500 AT A "STEPHEN COLBERT" LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST. ( LAUGHTER ) I FINISHED THIRD. ( LAUGHTER ) I DROPPED MY IPHONE IN THE TOILET, BUT TOLD THE GUY AT THE APPLE STORE THAT IT FELL OFF MY SPEEDBOAT. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, WHEN I'M LONELY, I RUN RED LIGHTS JUST SO I'LL GET PULLED OVER AND I'LL HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO. ( LAUGHTER ) "A TICKET? FOR ME? BUT I DIDN'T GET YOU ANYTHING." ( LAUGHTER ) WHENEVER MY DENTIST ASKS ME IF I'VE BEEN FLOSSING, I ALWAYS SAY THE SAME THING: NO HABLA INGLEÉS ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN MY DOG LICKS SOMEONE ELSE'S FACE, I FEEL CHEATED ON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YOU SLUT! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NOT MY DOG. I NEVER RUN AWAY FROM MY PROBLEMS, BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH FASTER TO DRIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE MY KIDS, BUT THE REAL REASON I HAD THEM WAS SO PEOPLE WOULD STOP ASKING IF I WAS A VIRGIN. ( LAUGHTER ) "SEE, THOSE KIDS OVER THERE? YOU TELL ME!" ( LAUGHTER ) MY NEIGHBOR ASKED ME TO WATER HIS PLANTS WHEN HE WAS ON VACATION, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THEY ALL DIED IN THAT FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I TELL PEOPLE I ENJOY CLASSICAL MUSIC, BUT WHAT I REALLY ENJOY IS TELLING PEOPLE I ENJOY CLASSICAL MUSIC. ( LAUGHTER ) AH, CELLOS. I DON'T HAVE A CAT, BUT I DO HAVE A LITTER BOX. AND IT'S A MESS. ( LAUGHTER ) I SAY "I LOVE YOU" TO MY DOG MORE THAN I SAY IT TO MY WIFE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I LOVE YOU. YOU SLUT. ( APPLAUSE ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE?
AUDIENCE: WE FORGIVE YOU!
STEPHEN: THANKS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MILO VENTIMIGLIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT FROM HIS ROLES ON "HEROES," "GILMORE GIRLS" AND NOW "THIS IS US."
COME LIE DOWN AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A PUSHUP. RANDALL, CLIMB ON YOUR FATHER'S BACK. ♪ ( CLEARING THROAT ) JACK, YOUR BACK WAS BUILT TO CARRY YOUR SON THROUGH LIFE. ARE YOU WILLING TO HOLD HIM UP NO MATTER WHAT COMES HIS WAY?
YES.
Stephen: SHOW HIM. GOOD. NOW KEEP GOING. ARE YOU WILLING TO RAISE THIS YOUNG BOY INTO A STRONG MAN?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: ARE YOU WILLING TO PUSH HIM TO BE THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD HE CAN BE?
YES.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MILO VENTIMIGLIA! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU WERE A LITTLE MISTY.
Stephen: I WAS A LITTLE MISTY! TRYING TO BREAK MY HEART IN EVERY SCENE OF THIS SHOW?
NOT TRYING, BUT I JUST THINK IT KIND OF HAPPENS.
Stephen: FATHER'S DAY IS COMING UP.
YES, VERY BIG DAY.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN?
NO, I DO NOT. I'M MAKING IT UP.
Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WOULD BE A GOOD ONE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. I HAVE CHILDREN. I'M NOT SURE I COULD BE THAT PUSHUP THING.
I BET YOU COULD.
Stephen: MY KIDS ARE, LIKE, SIX-TWO NOW.
MY CO-STAR, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HAVE HIM GET ON MY BACK. I HAVE A VIDEO OF HIM ON MY BACK, JUSTIN ON HIS BACK AND STERLING ON JUSTIN ICE BACK TO SHOW WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER. THEY BEAT ME IN THAT.
Stephen: EVEN THAT WILL MAKE ME CRY. HOW MANY WILL YOU DO FOR THAT SCENE?
I THINK 320 PUSHUPS WITH LONNIE ON MY BACK. THAT'S WHAT THE EDITORS TOLD ME THAT DAY.
Stephen: WOW. ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, UM, THE SHOW IS HUGE. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ARE YOU A CRYER YOURSELF? BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS SHOW IS YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THERE WITHOUT CRYING. YOUR RATINGS ARE FANTASTIC BUT YOU SHOULD BE MEASURED IN HOW MANY CCs OF SALINE YOU HAVE AT THE END.
YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU A CRYING EMOTIONALLY?
AS I'VE GOTTEN OLDER, I'M CLOSING IN ON 40.
Stephen: YOU'RE CLOSING IN ON 40?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU GO TO HELL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU LOOK GOOD, MAN!
YEAH, PETER AND CAROL GAVE ME SOME PRETTY GOOD GENES.
Stephen: OH, MOM AND DAD? YEAH. NO, I CRY MORE, I'M MORE CONNECTED WITH MY MOTIONS. I'VE HEARD IT MEASURED IN KLEENEX BOXES BUT I NEVER HEARD SALINE BAG. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WAY DIFFERENT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NAME VENVENTIMIGLIA, HAS ANYONE TRIED TALK YOU OUT OF THAT?
YES, THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT MILO VENTI. I WOULD BE A LARGE CUP OF COFFEE AT THIS POINT. THERE WERE OTHER VARIATIONS AS A CHILD, MILO VENT-VEGETARIAN. I WAS RUNNING ON A FOOTBALL FIELD -- AARON BROWN, JEFF SMITH, MILO VENT -- WHATEVER.
Stephen: THEY ACTUALLY SAID WHATEVER?
I WAS RUNNING ON THE TEAM AND I SAID, WHAT THE --
Stephen: WAS THAT YOUR TEAM OR THE OPPOSING TEAM'S ANNOUNCER?
GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: THANK YOU, THAT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
SEE, PEOPLE GIVE ME LINES AND I READ THEM.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS, YOU HAD A DISTINCTION OF VERY FEW PEOPLE IN TELEVISION HAVE HAD. ONLY THREE MALE BARE BUTTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN ON BROADCAST TELEVISION. JIMMY SCHMIDT'S DENNIS FRAN'S.
YOU HAVE TO CLAP FOR THAT ONE, TOO.
Stephen: THAT'S COURAGE. AND YOUR BUTT. WE ACTUALLY SEE YOUR BUTT BEFORE YOUR FACE.
YES, YOU DO. I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A BAD JOKE AND SAY, HOW DO YOU FOLLOW THAT, BUT I GUESS I DID.
Stephen: TECHNICALLY, IT FOLLOWS YOU.
YEAH, YOU TAKE THAT, BUTT.
Stephen: WAS THAT IN THE TABLE READ, WE SEE HIS BUTT?
YEAH.
Stephen: OR DID THEY SAY IN THE TAKE, LET'S LOSE THE PANTS? SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
YEAH, RIGHT? THE FUNNY THING WAS, I SHOW UP TO WORK THAT DAY AND THERE WERE THESE NUDE OR FLESH COLORED PATCHES OF CLOTH AND TAPE, AND I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS LIKE, DAN, WHO WROTE THIS IN THE SCRIPT, HE WASN'T JOKING AROUND, IT IS GOING TO BE ME COVERING MY MANHOOD AND THEN --
Stephen: IT'S NOT LIKE A TUBE SOCK, IT'S A FLESH-COLORED --
THEY GAVE OPTIONS.
Stephen: HERE'S AN OLD TURTLE SHELL -- ( LAUGHTER )
I KNOW, RIGHT? HERE'S A BACKPACK.
Stephen: A BACKPACK, WOW, I'M IMPRESSED. HERE'S A 50-GALLON DUFFLE BAG.
YEAH, ME AND JOHN.
Stephen: WHAT DO THEY DO THERE?
BASICALLY, PICK YOUR OPTION.
Stephen: ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THE NUDITY?
I'M OKAY WITH IT. IT'S A HARD-WORKING BUTT. MY TRAINER JASON WALSH MAKES SURE THINGS ARE WORKED OUT.
Stephen: DO SQUATS. DO SQUATS.
Stephen: NEVER SKIP LEG DAY.
NO, NEVER.
Stephen: I DID A NUDE SCENE ONCE --
FULL FRONTAL NUDE?
Stephen: I WAS 19. GET OUT!
Stephen: WHEN THEY ASKED ME, I SAID, I SHOULD DO THIS NOW. I KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO LAST MUCH LONGER.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ON SET, WHEN YOU'RE NUDE, WHEN YOU'RE THERE AND IT'S ALL HANG OUT, DO THEY CLEAR THE SET?
YEAH, THEY WILL BE POLITE, CLEAR THE SET, CLOSE THE SET IS WHAT THEY CALL IT, AND THEN USUALLY, YOU KNOW, I HAD A TOWEL ON THE DAY WE WERE FILMING, THE TERRIBLE TOWEL.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. AND THEN I JUST KIND OF KEPT MY BACK THE A WALL IN BETWEEN TAKES BUT I WAS STILL TRYING TO COMMUNICATE, LIKE, HEY, WHAT'S UP, CHRIS? YOU KNOW? YEAH, YEAH. GOOD TO SEA YOU, DON. YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: GOING OVER TO THE FOOD TABLE?
NO, I DIDN'T. I WAITED. I WAITED. I WAS, LIKE, YOU CAN'T MIX AS AND, YOU KNOW, FOOD.
Stephen: RED VINES. NO. YEAH, YOU COULD. YOU COULD. YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH AT A PRETTY YOUNG AGE TO GET SOME WORK ON TELEVISION. WE FOUND A CLIP WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE EVER ON TELEVISION. WHAT IS THIS FROM?
FRESH PRINCE OF BELLAIRE.
Stephen: OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT WAS MY VERY FIRST PAYING GIG AS AN ACTOR.
Stephen: YEP? WHO WAS YOUR CHARACTER?
I WAS PARTY GUEST NUMBER ONE. I'LL SET THE SCENE. IT WAS 1995, SO I HAD AWESOME OVERALLS, SHIRT OPENED, UNBUTTONED, HAIR JUST SO.
Stephen: HERE WE GO. FIRST APPEARANCE. ♪
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS DOING IN THE BATHROOM?
RELAX, WE'RE JUST TAKING A LITTLE TOUR. ( LAUGHTER )
TOUR. TAKING A TOUR.
Stephen: EXPLORING. EXPLORING. BEING YOUNG.
Stephen: YOU GUYS WERE TOTALLY HAVING SEX UPSTAIRS.
ABSOLUTELY HAVING SEX UPSTAIRS.
Stephen: JUST FOR BACKSTORY, WERE YOU TOTALLY NUDE WHEN YOU GOT UP THERE?
AND HAD A TERRIBLE TOWEL.
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU. MILO VENTIMIGLIA. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "THIS IS US" RETURNS THIS FALL O NBC.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, I'VE WANTED TO SIT DOWN WITH MY NEXT GUEST A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW HER FROM "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT" AND "ARCHER." SHE NOW STARS IN "CASUAL" ON HULU. PLEASE WELCOME JUDY GREER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IT'S BEEN FOREVER. 2002 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.
Stephen: WE DID A SHOW TOGETHER FOR ANOTHER NETWORK.
NO, DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: THE SYMBOL IS A BIRD WITH TAIL FEATHERS -- CALLED THE FINKELMAN PROJECT.
THE UNTITLED FINKELMAN PROJECT.
Stephen: IT REMAINED UNTITLED BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GO ON TELEVISION. IT WAS A PILOT FOR NBC AND WE SHOT IT IN TORONTO.
WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE FAMOUS.
Stephen: WE WERE GOING TO BE WORKING ALL THE TIME.
I WAS GOING TO GET A NEW ESCORT.
Stephen: YOU MEAN A CAR, RIGHT? ( APPLAUSE )
YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE GUTTER, MISTER!
Stephen: I REALLY BELIEVED IN THE PROJECT. IT WAS REALLY FUNNY. A LOT OF IT WAS IMPROVISED.
YES, YOU WERE PLAYING KEN FINKELMAN.
Stephen: IT WAS BASED ON A SHOW IN CANADA CALLED THE NEWS ROOM AND I WAS A NEWS DIRECTOR AND YOU WERE MY SISTER.
ALL I REMEMBER WAS BEING YOUR SISTER AND I REMEMBER KEN FINKELMAN BEING ON THE SET. YOU AND KEN WERE KIND OF DIFFERENT SO I WAS WONDERING HOW THAT WAS GOING TO WORK OUT IN THE END.
IT DIDN'T.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER SEE THE FINAL PROJECT?
NO, DID YOU IN.
Stephen: YES. YOU DID?
Stephen: YES. AS A MATTER OF FACT. AND THIS IS TRUE --
NO --
Stephen: WE HAVE THE PILOT RIGHT HERE. MADE BY IMAGINE WHICH IS ONE OF RON HOWARD'S PRODUCERS.
I'VE HEARD OF HIM.
Stephen: ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES HERE AT CBS REACHED OUT TO RON HOWARD WHO HAD SOMEBODY GO INTO THE FAULTS OR WENT HIMSELF AND FOUND THE PILOT SO WE HAVE A SCENE HERE BETWEEN YOU AND ME. YOU'RE IN THE BATHROOM. I'VE GONE OVER TO YOU THE ASK IF YOU CAN GET ME TICKETS TO A GOLF TOURNAMENT WITH CELEBRITY PLAYERS I'M INTERESTED IN. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE DAMN SHOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THIS IS.
Stephen: THIS IS A VHS TAPE IS WHAT THIS IS. THIS IS ME AND JUDY GREER IN 2002 IN THE UNTITLED KEN FINKELMAN PROJECT.
THIS IS A ONCE AND A LIFETIME CHANCE FOR ME TO PLAY GOLF WITH THE PROS. YOU'RE MY SISTER.
I CAN'T DO IT. THE TOURNAMENT IS ON SATURDAY. YOU'RE NOT A CELEBRITY.
WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO BE? RICHARD SIMMONS, FOR GOD'S SAKE? I PRODUCE THE NEWS.
THERE IS ONE POSSIBILITY. SEE, FAMILY IS EVERYTHING. EXPLAIN THE BOCCA TRIP AND YOU'RE IN.
THAT'S A BRIBE. I CAN'T SELL AIR TIME.
WHY NOT? THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED JOURNALISTIC ETHICS. ( APPLAUSE )
THE CHEMISTRY!
Stephen: AND JUST LIKE THAT, IT WAS GONE. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN --
IT COULD HAVE BEEN.
Stephen: RON, WE'RE STILL HERE. YOU CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
I THINK THE WORLD NEEDS TO SEE THIS.
Stephen: I THINK THAT'S ALL THE WORLD NEEDS THE SEE OF THAT. I'VE SEEN THE REST OF IT. WE PLAY SIBLINGS IN THIS SHOW. I THINK THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE --
WE DO.
Stephen: A LITTLE TAN IN COMMON. WE'RE BOTH RAISED CATHOLICS.
THAT MAKES US HAVE DNA IN COMMON, YEAH.
Stephen: YES. YES.
Stephen: WE HAVE THE SAME ESCORT. ( APPLAUSE )
WE DO HAVE THAT IN COMMON BUT I'M GOING TO ONE-UP YOU HERE.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU ARE. I'LL BICK YOU UP WITH VISUAL AIDS. BOTH RAISED CATHOLIC.
BUT MY MOM WAS A NUN. THAT IS SISTER SOMETHING-SOMETHING ELIZABETH. SHE WAS A NUN. SHE GOT KICKED OUT OF THE CONVENT AFTER EIGHT YEARS SERVING THE LORD.
Stephen: EIGHT YEARS. YES.
Stephen: HAD SHE TAKEN HER FINAL VOWS?
THAT'S UP FOR GRABS. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES SHE SAID SHE DID AND SOMETIMES SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T BUT I DO LIKE TO REMIND HER THAT MY FATHER IS HER ACTUAL SECOND HUSBAND BECAUSE HER FIRST HUSBAND WAS JESUS.
Stephen: RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY EVEN WEAR A RING AND EVERYTHING.
YEAH ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW. BUT SHE GOT KICKED OUT BECAUSE SHE WAS A LITTLE TOO CRAZY. THEY THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE BETTER SERVING THE LORD IN A MORE SECULAR ENVIRONMENT.
Stephen: WHAT'S A CRAZY NONE? WHAT'S TOO CRAZY TO BE A NUN?
SHE HAD A RED BATHING SUIT.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, SHE HAD A BATHING SUIT. THAT'S THE FIRST ONE.
SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS ONE PARISHIONER WHO USED TO LET THE NUNS GO SWIMMING IN THEIR POOL IN THE SUMMERTIME. WHICH, I MEAN, IMAGINE TODAY IFN THERE WAS VIDEO CAMERAS FILMING A BUNCH OF NUNS SWIMMING, I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD REALITY SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT A MINUTE, DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT BEING A NUN YOURSELF?
GOSH, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T? MOM NEVER BROUGHT IT UP LIKE THERE IS GOOD STUFF ABOUT IT?
NO. I, IN FACT, LEFT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WHEN I WAS TEN.
Stephen: THAT'S EARLY TO CUT THE CORD.
I TOLD MY PARENTS I WOULD FEEL CLOSER TO GOD AT A PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE MY FRIEND CAROL SMITH WENT TO THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND ALL THE BOYS THERE WERE REALLY CUTE. THE BOYS AT THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH WERE SO MUCH CUTER THAN THE CATHOLIC BOYS. I HAD A GOOD ARGUMENT. MY PARENTS WERE DOWN, THEY LET ME GO TO THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND THEN I COULD CHASE THE PRESBYTERIAN BOYS INSTEAD OF THE CATHOLIC BOYS.
Stephen: MY WIFE IS PRESBYTERIAN, SO THERE YOU GO.
AND I MARRIED A LUTHERAN.
Stephen: BOY, YOU REALLY JUST THREW THE LUTHERANS UNDER THE BUS THERE, DIDN'T YA? ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, "CASUAL" IS ON HULU THIS SEASON.
YES.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU!
Stephen: IT AIRS TUESDAYS ON HULU AND STARS JUDY GREER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH COMEDIAN KEITH ALBERSTAT.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A REGULAR AT THE COMEDY CELLAR HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. PLEASE WELCOME KEITH ALBERSTAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! GOOD TO BE HERE. I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN NEW YORK FOR A WHILE NOW BUT I'M ORIGINALLY FROM NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. YEAH, A GREAT TOWN. SO I TALK A LOT SLOWER THAN MOST PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN NEW YORK. SOMETIMES THEY'LL TRY TO SPEED UP CONVERSATIONS. THEY CAN BE CREFER ABOUT IT. THEY'LL USE WORDS OUT OF THEIR NORMAL CONTEXT, WORDS LIKE "TRUST." I HEARD THAT RECENTLY, I TRUST YOU HAD A GOOD WEEKEND? WITH YOU ASKING ME OR TELLING ME? I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT. THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO SPEED IT ALONG THAN TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT ARE STATEMENTS. I TRUST YOU HAD A GOOD WEEKEND. I ASSUME YOUR FAMILY IS DOING OKAY. I SUSPECT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE NO FRIENDS. ( LAUGHTER ) A LOT OF GREAT RESTAURANTS HERE IN NEW YORK. I LOOKED ONE UP ON YELP TO SEE WHAT THE REVIEWS WERE. THE VERY FIRST REVIEW SAID THIS -- EVERYTHING I ORDERED, EVEN THE APPETIZER, HAD A HAIR IN IT. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHAT CAUGHT MY EYE. EVEN. EVEN THE APPETIZER. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WAS TYPING AWAY GOING, ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? IN THE MAIN COURSE, I GET IT. DRINKS, DESSERT, SURE. BUT SPINACH DIP? CROSSED THE LINE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THINGS ARE GOOD. I GOT MARRIED A FEW MONTHS AGO. I'M RECENTLY MARRIED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WENT ON A HONEYMOON. THE VERY FIRST DAY ON OUR HONEYMOON M I WIFE LOOKED AT ME AND ASKED ME THIS -- WHAT TUNING A GOOD BABY NAME WOULD BE? I'M SORRY, WHAT? SHE SAID, I'M NOT PREGNANT, BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE, ONE DAY. THAT'S A VERY UNNECESSARY SHOP. ( LAUGHTER ) I MIGHT DO THAT TO HER SOME TIME. HEY, DO YOU KNOW ANY GOOD BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE NOT BROKE, BUT -- MAYBE ONE DAY. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING CONCEIVED AND RAISED -- WHAT'S HIS FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) I DID SUGGEST A NAME. I SUGGESTED ONE THAT WILL WORK FOR EITHER A BOY OR A GIRL. I SUGGESTED USERNAME. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS VERY PRACTICAL. OUR KID'S ALREADY GOING TO BE LOGGED IN, THREE SECONDS AHEAD OF THE CLASS. I KNOW IT LOOKS WEIRD BUT WE'LL PRONOUNCE IT OOSER-N A-ME. RIGHT? DON'T WANT THE KID TO GET PICKED ON. MIDDLE NAME PASSWORD. PRONOUNCED PASSWORD. SPELLED WITH EIGHT BLACK DOTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MOST KIDS DON'T LIKE THEIR MIDDLE NAME. HOW COOL WOULD IT BE TO HAVE MADELE NAME YOU HAVE TO CHANGE EVERY SIX MONTHS FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. MY FATHER IN LAW BOB HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW HILARIOUS HE IS. ONE DAY BEFORE LESLIE AND I WERE MARRIED, WE WERE HANGING OUT AT HER PARENTS' PLACE IN NEW JERSEY. BOB WALKED OUT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. COMES BACK. WALKS INTO THE LIVING ROOM, FIRST THING HE SAYS TO EVERYBODY, I GOT CHLAMYDIA. ( LAUGHTER ) HE IS 78 YEARS OLD. IT'S REAL BAD, TOO. IT'S CALLED HYPERCHLAMYDIA. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ) COUPLE QUESTIONS LATER, COME TO FIND OUT BOB ACTUALLY HAS HIGH POTASSIUM. ( APPLAUSE ) THE MEDICAL TERM FOR THAT IS HYPERCALEMIA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BOB, WHO ELSE DID YOU TELL THIS TO? TOLD THE NEIGHBORS. THE NEIGHBORS? NOW THERE IS AN ENTIRE CUL-DE-SAC IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY WHO THINKS MY FATHER IN LAW HAS OFF THE CHARTS, ROCK STAR CHLAMYDIA. ( LAUGHTER ) THANKS A LOT, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: HIS ALBUM "WALK IT OFF" IS AVAILABLE ON I TUNES.
STEPHEN: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE SCARLETT JOHANSSON, BILL BURR, AND MUSICAL GUEST FLEET FOXES. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, JAMIE FOXX AND ANSEL ELGORT. GOOD NIGHT!
