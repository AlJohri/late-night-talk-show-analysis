♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ JACK BE NIMBLE JACK BE QUICK IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES GORDON RAMSAY. DAVID SEDARIS. AND MUSICAL GUEST, PIXIES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: WOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S FRIDAY. IT'S FRIDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NOT JUST ANY FRIDAY CROWD. THAT IS THE FRIDAY CROWD BEFORE THE FRIDAY BEFORE SUMMER BEGINS. IT IS SUMMER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU MADE IT. THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT. I'M GOING TO GET A TAN, MAN. I'M GOING TO GET A TAN THIS SUMMER. I'M DOING THE COCOA BUTTER. IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC. YES, I AM. I'M GOING TO DO THE COCOA BUTTER. I'M GOING TO SMELL-- I'M GOING TO SMELL LIKE A BUFFET AT A JIMMY BUFFET RESTAURANT. IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF RAMADAN. HAPPY RAMADAN, OR WHATEVER EMOTION GOES WITH RAMADAN. I DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW WHETHER IT'S A HAPPY DAY. IT'S A TIME OF FASTING, SO HUNGRY RAMADAN. JUST HAVE A GOOD ONE, THAT'S ALL I ASK. DONALD TRUMP IS STILL OUT OF THE COUNTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE STILL HAVE TIME TO CHANGE THE LOCKS. HE'S IN SICILY FOR THE G-7 MEETING. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE DOWN AT THE G-7 THIS YEAR, OR AS TRUMP CALLS IT "WEATHER CHANNEL FAKE NEWS. GETS COLD EVERY WINTER, DON'T UNDERSTAND." ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP WAS IN BRUSSELS FOR THE NATO MEETING? YEAH, THE NEWTO MEETING IN BRUSSELS. AND THE MOMENT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IS HIS HANDSHAKE WITH NEWLY ELECTED FRENCH PRESIDENT AND GUY WHO WANTS TO TRY IT WITH THE LIGHTS ON TONIGHT, EMMANUEL MACRON. ( LAUGHTER ) THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS POOL DESCRIBED THE HANDSHAKE THIS WAY: "EACH PRESIDENT GRIPPED THE OTHER'S HAND WITH CONSIDERABLE INTENSITY, THEIR KNUCKLES TURNING WHITE AND THEIR JAWS CLENCHING AND FACES TIGHTENING." PRETTY EXCITING STUFF.
Jon: PRETTY EXCITING.
Stephen: THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING STUFF. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS POOL IS ALSO NOW WRITING EROTIC FAN FICTION. GET READY FOR "50 SHADES OF ORANGE" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRUMP WAS IN BRUSSELS FOR THE NATO SUMMIT, AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE. AND WHEN THEY WERE LINING UP FOR A PHOTO, LOOK AT HIM GET KIND OF HANDSY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF MONTENEGRO. "ALL RIGHT, OUTTA MY WAY, YOU MONTENEGRO! ALPHA MALE COMING THROUGH. SIT DOWN, PINK HAIR." WHAT A JERK. ( LAUGHTER ) "GET OUT OF THE WAY! I GOT IT. ADJUST THE JACKET, NO ONE WILL NOTICE." I DON'T THINK THAT KIND OF SHOVING IS APPROPRIATE FOR AN INTERNATIONAL SUMMIT. THAT'S THE KIND OF SHOVING THAT BELONGS AT THE BUFFET LINE AT MAR-A-LAGO. AND TRUMP WASN'T DONE OFFENDING OUR ALLIES.
23 OF THE 28-MEMBER NATIONS ARE STILL NOT PAYING WHAT THEY SHOULD BE PAYING AND WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING FOR THEIR DEFENSE.
Stephen: WHILE TRUMP WAS DRESSING THEM DOWN, LOOK AT THE NATO LEADERS' FACES. CHECK THIS OUT. OH, COME ON. CHEER UP. HE'S NOT YOUR PRESIDENT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU DON'T HAVE TO-- LIVE WITH HIM HERE. NO WONDER THAT TRUMP WAS LEFT LARGELY ON HIS OWN AFTER THE SPEECH AS LEADERS MINGLED AND LAUGHED WITH EACH OTHER. OH, THEY WOULDN'T LET POOR DONALD ♪ JOIN IN ANY NATO GAMES ♪ NO, NOPE, NO. "GUYS, GUYS, WAIT UP. DID I EVER TELL YOU THE STORY OF WHEN I WON THE ELECTION? I WON MICHIGAN. I WON WISCONSIN. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA YET. WANNA GUESS WHETHER I WON IT?" ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, JAMES COMEY IS BACK IN THE NEWS AGAIN. COMEY STORIES NOW ARE THE NEW "IS JENNIFER ANNISTON PREGNANT?" THIS NEW STORY GOES BACK TO LAST JULY, BACK COMEY WAS STILL THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR, AND WE WERE ALL 80 YEARS YOUNGER. BACK THEN, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ELECTION, HE TOOK THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE TO ANNOUNCE THE F.B.I. HAD FOUND NO CRIMINAL CONDUCT IN THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION, BUT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A VERY, VERY BAD SECRETARY OF STATE. BAD CLINTON. NOBODY KNEW WHY COMEY DID IT, UNTIL NOW, BECAUSE "THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED THAT COMEY BASED HIS DECISION ON A "RUSSIAN DOCUMENT NOW VIEWED WITHIN THE F.B.I. AS UNRELIABLE AND POSSIBLY A FAKE." COMEY, COMEY FELL FOR FAKE NEWS! HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN THE DOCUMENT'S RETURN ADDRESS WAS "12 ACTUAL AVENUE, TRUTHBURG, REALTUCKY, USA." ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, APPARENTLY-- ALL THE STAMPS. APPARENTLY-- AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HAPPENS. THERE'S A LOT ABOUT THE STORY I DON'T GET. APPARENTLY, THE RUSSIANS SENT THE F.B.I. A FAKE INTELLIGENCE REPORT ABOUT ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH ASSURING THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THAT THE EMAIL INVESTIGATION WOULD NOT PUSH TOO DEEPLY. COMEY WAS THEN WORRIED THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS IMPROPERLY PRESSURING SOMEONE TO DROP AN INVESTIGATION-- WHICH, IN HINDSIGHT, MAKES HER SEEM VERY PRESIDENTIAL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT? AND WHEN COMEY READ THE FAKE REPORT, HE BELIEVED HE HAD TO COME FORWARD "BECAUSE HE FEARED THAT IF LYNCH ANNOUNCED NO CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON, AND THEN THE SECRET DOCUMENT LEAKED, THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ENTIRE CASE WOULD BE QUESTIONED." SO HE DID IT, CLINTON LOST, AND NOW ONLY THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ENTIRE ELECTION IS IN QUESTION. SO THAT'S IT. COMEY FELL FOR A FAKE EMAIL. BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? HE LANDED ON HIS FEET. I HEAR HE'S EARNING $2,000 A WEEK WORKING FROM HOME ON HIS LAPTOP. YEAH. I JUST-- THERE ARE SO MANY COMEY STORIES. THEY'RE AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT JAMES COMEY. FIRST, HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S A GOOD GUY, THEN HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S A BAD GUY, THEN IT SEEMS LIKE HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF TO SAVE OTHER PEOPLE OH, MY GOD. IS JAMES COMEY SEVERUS SNAPE? ARE WE GOING TO FIND OUT HE LOVED US ALL ALONG? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NO? NO. I'M BEING TOLD NO. I'M BEING THOALD, THAT, NO, HE IS NOT SEVERUS SNAPE. ONE POSITIVE THING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT WHILE TRUMP IS OVERSEAS DEALING WITH THE OTHER LEADERS OVER THERE, HE IS LESS LIKELY-- HE IS TOO BUSY TO SAY DUMB STUFF TO GET HIM INTO TROUBLE. LUCKILY, HIS STAFF HAS STEPPED UP TO DO IT ON HIS BEHALF, STARTING WITH HUD SECRETARY AND MAN COUNTING HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE THERE ARE IN THE CABINET, BEN CARSON. DR. CARSON DID A RADIO INTERVIEW RECENTLY FOR SIRIUS RADIO, AND HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE STATE OF POVERTY IN AMERICA:
I THINK POVERTY, TO A LARGE EXTENT, IS ALSO A STATE OF MIND.
Stephen: YES, POVERTY IS A STATE OF MIND. NO, NO. THIS IS TRUE. DO YOU KNOW IN MANY STATES, IT'S LEGAL TO PAY YOUR RENT WITH OPTIMISM. IT'S NOT IN REALITY, BUT IT IS UP HERE. UNFORTUNATELY, HE WENT ON.
YOU TAKE SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE RIGHT MINDSET, YOU CAN TAKE EVERYTHING FROM THEM AND PUT THEM ON THE STREET. I GUARANTEE YOU, IN A LITTLE WHILE, THEY'LL BE RIGHT BACK UP THERE. AND YOU TAKE SOMEBODY WITH THE WRONG MINDSET, YOU CAN GIVE THEM EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD, THEY'LL WORK THEIR WAY BACK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM.
Stephen: YEAH, IT'S ALL ABOUT MINDSET. I MEAN, REMEMBER THE GREAT DEPRESSION WHEN AMERICA HAD A CASE OF THE BLAHS? LOOK AT THIS DEBBIE DOWNER. COME ON! TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN, LITTLE LADY. WHY NOT LOOK AT THE BOWL AS HALF FULL OF DUST? ( LAUGHTER ) AND SPOOKING OF THE ADMINISTRATION, WE JUST LEARNED AN IMPORTANT DETAIL ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. HE HAS DICHED HIS ANDROID PHONE IN FAVOR OF AN iPHONE WITH ONE APP-- TWITTER. JUST THE ONE. JUST THE ONE. I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. WHAT APPS DID I EXPECT HIM TO HAVE, "WORDS WITH FRIENDS"? HE MIGHT HAVE FRIENDS, BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE WORDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND TRUMP IS SUCH CONSTANT AND ALL-ENCOMPASSING NEWS NOT EVEN DISNEY WORLD CAN ESCAPE HIS GRAVITATIONAL PULL. YOU KNOW DISNEY'S HALL OF ANIMATRONIC PRESIDENTS? YOU KNOW, WHERE THE PRESIDENTS GET UP AND THEY TALK? WELL, SOURCES SAY DISNEY WORLD WILL OVERHAUL THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS TO KEEP DONALD TRUMP FROM SPEAKING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪  WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR, MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHO YOU ARE ORIGINALLY, THE ONLY PRESIDENTS WHO SPOKE WERE WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN, BUT THAT CHANGED 25 YEARS AGO. NOW, WHOEVER IS CURRENTLY PRESIDENT ALSO HAS A FEW LINES. THAT STARTED IN 1993 WITH BILL CLINTON. I BELIEVE HIS FIRST WORDS WERE, "HEY, SLEEPING BEAUTY, YOU UP?" ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH! OH! OH!
Stephen: BUT TRUMP HAS SAID SO MANY OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THAT PETITIONS ARE CIRCULATING INSISTING THAT DISNEY'S ROBO-TRUMP SHOULD NOT SPEAK. ONE PETITION HAS OVER 14,000. ANOTHER SAYS, "EVEN CLOSING DOWN THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS IS BETTER THAN ADDING DONALD TRUMP." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT THEN-- BUT THEN WHAT? BUT THEN WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH THE TRUMP ROBOT? WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THE RUMORS OUT OF THAT RUSSIAN HOTEL ARE TRUE, HE'D FEEL RIGHT AT HOME ON SPLASH MOUNTAIN. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. KEEP IT LIGHT. ONE THING'S FOR SURE, IF DISNEY DOESN'T ADD DONALD TRUMP TO THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST ADD HIS HANDS TO "IT'S A SMALL WORLD." WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. GORDON RAMSAY IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL BE READING SOME FIRST DRAFTS OF GRADUATION CARDS. STICK AROUND ARE GRADUATE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, RIGHT THERE.
Jon: YEAH! OH! OH!
Stephen: JON, JON, JON ARE YOU EXCITED?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THAT--
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE TOO KIND. YOU'RE TOO KIND. JON, ARE YOU EXCITED-- ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT SUMMER TAKING OFF HERE BSTARTING UP THE SUMMER?
Jon: OH, YEAH, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT, MAN. I LOVE SUMMER, IT'S MY FAVORITE.
AND THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR.
Jon: IT I IT IS.
Stephen: AND LAST WEEK I UNDERSTAND YOU GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT SALVE REGINA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THE KIDS? WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE OF HOPE AND LEADERSHIP?
Jon: I SAID YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE, WHO YOU WANT TO BE, AND WHO YOU CAN HELP ALONG THE WAY. THAT WAS MY THEME.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. WE LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE. WE LEAK TO HELP PEOPLE ON THIS SHOW.
Jon: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WE TRY TO, WE TRY TO. WE DO, WE DO.
Stephen: AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP SOME OF THE GRADUATE RIGHT NOW. IN AROUND OF ALL THE GRADUATES WE WOULD LIKE TO DO A GRADUATION SEGMENT OF "FIRST DRAFTS."
NO, STUPID!
Stephen: WHENEVERY DO FIRST DRAFTS I NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP ME READ THE FIRST DRAFTS UP HERE. GOT ANYBODY WHO IS STILL IN COLLEGE RIGHT NOW? ANYBODY OUT HERE WHO IS STILL IN COLLEGE? ARE YOU? YOUNG LADY, ARE YOU STILL IN COLLEGE?

Stephen: TO CELEBRATE YOUR GRADUATE, HERE'S A LUKEWARM KEG BEER, AND A COPY OF "ALL THE PLACES YOU'LL GO." THAT'S FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU CAN HOLD ON TO THAT. WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME.

I AM.
Stephen: EVERYTHING'S GREAT THEN. GOT ME WORRIED THERE FOR A SECOND, ASHLEE. CAN YOU PUT THAT OVER THERE? I WANT YOU TO HOLD THIS STACK OF CARDS. THESE ARE GRADUATION CARDS, OKAY?
OKAY.
Stephen: THAT WE HAVE TWO DRAFTS. WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL DRAFT, AND WE HAVE THE-- AND THE PHENYL DRAFT, OKAY. AND WE SHOW HOW THE PREMISE OF THIS BIT THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO IS I WILL READ THE FINAL DRAFT AND THEN READ THE FIRST DRAFT, TO SEE THE MISTAKE THEY MADE THE FIRST TIME THIGH TRIED TO READ THE-- WRITE THE CARD. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YES.
Stephen: WITH ME?
YES.
Stephen: I'LL TAKE THAT FIRST ONE. HERE'S A LOVELY GRADUATION CARD. IT SAYS, "CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF 2017." IT'S A BIG WORLD OUT THERE-- GO FOR IT! WHICH IS AWFULLY NICE. THE KIND OF MESSAGE YOU WOULDN'T MIND GETTING FOR YOUR FOLKS. BUT THE FIRST DRAFT READ, "MOM CHANGED YOUR ROOM INTO A SHOE CLOSET." ( APPLAUSE ).
SOMETHING THIGH MOM WOULD DO.
Stephen: IS YOUR MOM HERE?
NO, SHE'S IN KANSAS.
Stephen: SHE'S BACK IN KANSAS? THIS ONE'S PRETTY PROFOUND. I BELIEVE THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THOMAS PAINE. "CONGRATS, GRADS. THE MIND ONCE ENLIGHTENED CANNOT BECOME DARK." DEEP STUFF, RIGHT, DEEP STUFF. BUT THE FIRST DRAFT READ, "YOUR DRUNK FACEBOOK PHOTOS ARE NEVER GOING AWAY." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
OH, NO!
Stephen: IT'S TRUE.
I BETTER GET TO DELETING THEN.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO WITH YOUR DEGREE NOW THAT YOU'RE-- NOW THAT YOU HAVE GRADUATED? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH YOUR DEGREE?
I DON'T KNOW. ARE YOU GUYS HIRING?
Stephen: I'M BEING TOLD WE'RE NOT. I'M BEING TOLD WE'RE NOT. THIS ONE'S A BIT OF A PEP TALK. IT SAYS, "CONGRATS, GRADUATES. NOW THAT ALL STANDS BETWEEN AND YOU YOUR DREAMS IS BELIEF IN YOURSELF. THAT'S TRUE. THE FIRST DRAFT READ, "REMEMBER, IF YOU HAVE TO, YOU CAN SELL YOUR BLOOD."
OH, NO! NEVER DONE THAT, I CAN SAY.
Stephen: I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE. IT RESIDENT, "GREAT WORK, GRAD. YOUR FUTURE IS UP TO YOU." IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE, ASHLEE. THE FIRST DRAFT READ,ING, ," WE' NOT PAYING FOR GRAD SCHOOL." AREV YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GRAD SCHOOL?
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT GR I DIDN'T GO.
I'M GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.
Stephen: I WAS GOING TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL
AND HERE YOU ARE.
Stephen: YEAH, WORKS OUT. I AM PROOF THAT EDUCATION IS OVER-RATED ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S A CARD THAT SAYS, "NEXT STOP: MED SCHOOL!" THAT COULD BE FOR YOU. THAT COULD BE FOR YOU, ASHLEE.
YOU NEVER KNOW. BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID, "PLEASE BECOME A DOCTOR BEFORE TRUMP TAKES AWAY OUR INSURANCE." THIS CARD SAYS-- THERE'S A LOVELY GRADUATE RIGHT THERE. AND IT SAYS, "HOORAY, YOU DID IT."
WHAT DID IT REALLY SAY?
Stephen: BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID, " "YOU CAN FINALLY TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE DATING YOUR PROFESSOR!"
Stephen: ANY OF THAT GOING AROUND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS?
I HOPE NOT THAT. NOT THEY HEARD OF.
Stephen: MY COLLEGE LOVED THAT. BUT I WENT TO ACTING SCHOOL, SO THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S PART OF THE MAJOR. HERE'S ONE THAT SAYS-- THERE'S AN OWL, KIND OF CHARMING. AND IT SAYS, "WE KNEW YOU COULD DO IT!" BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID, "WE JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE YOU SEVEN YEARS!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DID YOU DO IT IN FOUR YEARS?
FOUR YEARS.
Stephen: FOUR YEARS?
YEAH. I MADE IT.
Stephen: FIVE, I DID FIVE. IT TOOK MY FIVE YEARS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I GRADUATED, THERE WAS NO DIPLOMA INSIDE OF MY LITTLE LEATHER THING. THERE LITERALLY WAS JUST A TORN PIECE OF LEGAL PAD THAT SAID-- FROM THE DEAN. IT SAID, "SEE ME." TRUE STORY. I GOT AN INCOMPLETE, GOT AN INCOMPLETE. THIS IS A NICE SENTIMENT. IT SAYS, "WAY TO GO, GRADUATE! CARPE DIEM!" BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID "THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER USE YOUR LATIN MAJOR." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ASHLEE, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: YOU CAN TAKE THE BEER WITH YOU.
OH, THANK YOU!
Stephen: AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT RIGHT OVER THERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GORDON RAMSEY. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. COME HERE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A WORLD-RENOWNED CHEF ARE A RESTAURATEUR, AND A TELEVISION PERSONALITY. HIS NEW SHOW IS "THE F WORD."

MY NAME IS MARIA. I SPENT LAST SEVEN YEARS AS AN EXECUTIVE CHEF FOR THE GORDON RAMSEY GROUP.

HE WOULD BE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME CHEF GORDON RAMSEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU! HELLO! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: NOW, YOU ALREADY-- YOU ALREADY SEEM MORE CHEERFUL THAN I'M USED TO SEEING YOUR FACE. THIS IS MORE SMILING THAN WE NORMALLY GET ON ONE OF YOUR TV SHOWS.
WE DO HAVE GOOD DAYS, THOUGH, DAYS OF UTTER PERFECTION. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY MAY LOOK SOMEWHAT BORING SO I LIKE TO SPICE IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: EVERY UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN THEIR OWN WAY AS SAYING GOES. YOU HAVE 31 RESTAURANTS, MULTIPLE MICHELIN STARS?
YES.
Stephen: MULTIPLE MICHELIN STARS. YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF BRITISH EMPIRE, O.B.E. IS THAT GOOD, IS THAT FUN?
FOR CURSING.
Stephen: IT JUST ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA-- EXTRA CLASS WHEN YOU DROP THE "F" BOMB.
ORDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE, AND THE QUEEN GAVE IT TO ME AS WELL, SO IT WAS REALLY NICE.
Stephen: IS IT LIKE A SWORD SITUATION?
NO, THAT IS LIKE WHEN YOU GET KNIGHTED. O.B. IS UNDER THAT. SO A LITTLE HANDSHAKE AND A POLITE (BLEEP) OFF. SHE MUTTERS IT UNDER HER BREATH.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, WHEN YOU GO INTO A RESTAURANT, DO PEOPLE FREAK OUT BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
YES.
Stephen: AND THEY WANT TO IMPRESS YOU. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WALK INTO ANY OLD PLACE?
I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, EVERYONE LOOKS BEHIND ME TO SEE IF THERE'S A CAMERA CREW. THEY THINK O(BLEEP). "HE'S FILMING KITCHEN NIGHTMARES HERE. WE'RE TOO LATE. THIS PLACE IS A CONFIRMED (BLEEP).
Stephen: SO YOU CAN SAY THAT KIND OF STUFF ON TV IN ENGLAND, CAN YOU?
OH, WHAT (BLEEP) (BLEEP)?
Stephen: JS YS JORKS ONE MINUTE PAST 9:00.
Stephen: AT ONE MINUTE PAST 9:00 YOU CAN SAY (BLEEP).
OR (BLEEP). WHATEVER YOU WANT.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THAT RESTAURANT. NO.
THEY FIEND OUT WHAT I'M EATING AND IF THEY'RE NOT WATCHING WHAT I'M EATING HERE COMES THE CHEF AND HE WANTS TO SERVE THIS DISH AND THAT DISH AND I'M GETTING SPOILED. I WANT TO BE TREATED NORMAL, WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE IS IMPORTANT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT COOKING IN AMERICA? BECAUSE WE'VE GOT, LIKE, REGIONAL DISHES THAT ARE VERY SPECIAL OVER HERE? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU SEE OVER HERE AND SAY, "I COULDN'T POSSIBLY EAT THAT?" ANYTHING THAT TURNS YOU OFF.
I'M NOT A FAN OF GRITS. I FIND THEL HARD ON 2 --
Stephen: REALLY, IT'S A POLENTA, CORNMEAL, AND BUTTER AND SALT AND PEPPER.
THEY'RE RICH, HEAVY, AND SOMETIMES A BIT GREASY. AND SANDWICHES --
Stephen: ENGLISH FOOD IS FILTRATION ORGANS, ISN'T IT? HOW DARE YOU JUDGE US. YOU STUFF THINGS AN ANIMAL AND BURY IT.
THE SANDWICHES, YOU GO TO A DELI AND THE SANDWICH IS (BLEEP) LIKE 12 FOOT TALL.
Stephen: THAT'S A SANDWICH. THAT'S A SANDWICH.
NO! NO! NO!
Stephen: THAT'S THE SANDWICH OF A SUPERPOWER, MY FRIEND. BACK WHEN YOU HAD AN EMPIRE, SANDWICHES WERE MUCH LARGER, YOU REALIZE.
YOU CAN'T EAT IT.
Stephen: WHAT.
YOU CAN'T EAT IT.
Stephen: TAKE YOUR TIME. YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. WERE YOU ALWAYS DEMANDING, EVEN AS A KID? DID YOU DEMANTD LUNCH LADIES, LIKE, IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE-- "PUT SOME PARSLEY ON THERE. OF THE.
I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT THE SORT OF SKIN THAT SAT ON A STEW LIKE A LIVER AND BACON --
Stephen: AGAIN, KIDNEY, LIVER, ALL FILTRATION ORGANS.
... TO REMOVE THAT PIECE OF SKIN. COME ON, I'M JOKING. WE HAVE AN AMAZING DESSERT. HAVE YOU EVER HAD SPOTTY DICK. IT'S A VERY DELICIOUS, STEAMED SORT OF SPONGE WITH SORT OF MARINADE IN THERE. YOU DON'T WANT A CRISPY SKIN ON THAT?
Stephen: YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T. YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE THAT CHECKED OUT. YES. DO YOU ENCOURAGE-- HOW ABOUT YOUR OWN CHILDREN? HOENCOURAGE YOUR OWN-- HOW MANY CIZ HAVE YOU GOT?
FOUR, THREE GIRLS AND A BOY. SO THEY GREW UP AS LITTLE FOODIES. AND BACK IN THE U.K., I-- I SORT OF BECAME A BIT OF A MENTOR FOR THEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T BUY THEM iPADS AND X-BOX GAMES. I BOUGHT THEM TURKEY AND SHEEP AND LAMBS TO REAR.
Stephen: TO REAR? TO RAISE?
TO EXPRAIZ THEN TO EAT.
Stephen: BUT THEN THEY HAVE TO LIKE...
I COME HOME LATE ONE NIGHT, AND TILLY WAS UPSTAIRS --
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR YOUNGEST.
THAT'S THE YOUNGEST. I COULD HEAR HER MESSING AROUND-- "WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE." IT'S HER TURKEY. "WHAT YOU ARING DO?" SHE SAID, "I DON'T WANT IT TO GO TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE TOMORROW?" AND I SAID, "DON'T WORRY, IT WILL BE PLUCKED AND READY FOR THE OVEN." SHE STARTED CRYING, AND SO I BROKE HIS NECK-- NO, I DIDN'T! COME ON! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS.
Stephen: SHE HAS TO GROW UP SOMETIME.
EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE HERE DEEP FRIES THEIR (BLEEP) TURKEY, RIGHT?
Stephen: HAVE YOU DONE THAT? DO YOU ENJOY DEEP FRYING THE TURKEY.
I WENT AROUND TO A FRIEND OF MINE FOR THANKSGIVING, AND HE STARTED GOING TO THE GARAGE FOR PREPARATION OF THE LUNCH. I SAID, "WHERE ARE WE GOING?" AND THERE'S THIS BIG VAT AND HE WHEELED THIS BIG BIRD DOWN AND DEEP FAT FRIED THIS THING AND IT WAS (BLEEP) DISGUSTING.
Stephen:  OH, IT'S SO GOOD.
DRY TURKEY? THERE'S A REASON WHY WE ONLY EAT THAT BIRD ONCE A YEAR.
Stephen: OH!
ROAST IT. OR BUTTER, BEAUTIFULLY DONE, BACON ON TOP. BUT NOT DEEP FRIED. FROM A CHEF POINT OF VIEW, COME ON! SERIOUSLY.
Stephen: I WON'T. I'M FROM THE SOUTH. EVERYTHING IS DEEP FRIED. WE DIP IT IN CONCRETE AND DEEP FAT FRY IT.
NO!
Stephen: THE NEW SERIES IS CALLED "THE F WORD."
YES.
Stephen: "THE F WORD." WHICH I WAS ALOUD TO SAY ON CBS BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. NORMALLY I CAN'T SAY "F" WORD. I CAN'T EVEN SAY THE EUPHEMISM?
REALLY.
Stephen: WE'RE VERY CLEAN HERE.
AT 11:35 AT NIGHT.
Stephen: YES, YES. SO COULDN'T EVERY ONE OF YOUR SHOWS BE CALLED "THE F WORD"? WHY IS THIS ONE CALLED "THE F WORD"?
THIS IS FUN, FOOD, AND FAMILY. AND WE'RE LIVE --
Stephen: THAT WAS A PRETAPE.
WE SORT OF GOT A LITTLE BIT OF NAUGHTINESS GOING ON SO THIS WILL BE A COUPLE OF B.T.s FLOATING AROUND. FAMILIES ARE COMPETING COOKING FOR THE ENTIRE DINING ROOM. I HAVE KEVIN SPACEY NEXT WEEK, JAMES CORDON. THEY'RE SERIOUS FOODIES. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME ON.
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TO. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE MORE THAN THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH AND HAVE YOU YELL AT ME WHILE I DO IT.
SERIOUSLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: READY?
OKAY, RIGHT. SPREAD IS NICE AND EVENLY. AND WHY ARE YOU USING WHITE, ANEMIC BREAD? WOULDN'T YOU TOAST THAT FIRST?
Stephen: THERE'S NO TIME.
YOU'RE RIPPING THE BREAD ALREADY.
Stephen: IT'S TEARING.
YOU'RE TEARING THE BREAD.
Stephen: IT'S A THICKER PEANUT BUTTER THAN I'M USED TO.
IT'S ALL IN THE BLOODY MIDDLE, SPREAD IT OUT A LITTLE BET. THAT'S ENOUGH. NOW THE CORNERS. WHAT ABOUT THE CORNERS. OTHERWISE THE ENDS ARE DRY.
Stephen: WATCH THIS.
NO, NO! CORNERS! SEE, NOW THAT-- THAT LOOKS A MESS.
Stephen: I CUT THE CORNERS OFF. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THAT.
STEPHEN-- RIGHT. RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) RIGHT. OKAY. MAY I?
Stephen: SURE.
PLEASE, THAT LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF (BLEEP). ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S $2 MILLION.
IT'S A HELICOPTER.
Stephen: IN THE WORDS OF A GREAT MAN, THAT'S A (BLEEP) DISASTER. "THE F WORD" PREMIERS NEXT WEDNESDAY ON FOX. GORDON RAMSEY. EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DAVID SEDARIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS AN EXTREMELY FUNNY WRITER WHO HAS SOLD OVER 10 MILLION BOOKS WORLDWIDE. BUT BEFORE ALL THAT, I KNEW HIM AS MY FRIEND AMY'S OLDER BROTHER. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID SEDARIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
FANTASTIC. NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN YOU IN A LONG, LONG TIME.
I THINK THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS AT LaGUARDIA AIRPORT AND YOU HAD JUST STARTED DOING "THE DAILY SHOW." I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO BE IN FRANCE. AND YOU WERE AT THE --
Stephen: I REMEMBER SEEING THRU. THAT WAS IN 1997, DAVID. THAT MEANS IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE YOU AND I HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER?
I THINK SO.
Stephen: THAT'S CRAZY.
BUT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR PROGRESS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S BEEN --
Stephen: I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR PROGRESS, TOO.
AND I GOTTA SAY, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
Stephen: I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU, TOO. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT YOU, I'VE KNOWN VERY FEW PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THAT I KNEW YOU A LONG TIME AGO WHEN YOU WERE AMY'S OLDER, QUIET BROTHER. AND SINCE THEN, YOU'VE BECOME THIS-- WELL, YOU ALWAYS WERE, BUT I HAVE GOTTEN KNOW YOU, LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, AS THIS BRILLIANT WRITER. AND I'M A LITTLE BIT IN AWE OF YOU?
REALLY.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. I LOVE YOUR WORK SO MUCH THAT TALKING TO YOU NOW IS NOT LIKE TALKING TO AMY'S BROTHER. IT'S A FAMOUS AUTHOR WHO LOOKS LIKE AMY'S BROTHER. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
BECAUSE WE KNEW EACH ENERGY CHICAGO. YOU WERE AT SECOND CITY.
Stephen: CHICAGO IS A GREAT LEVELER.
IT WAS INTERESTING BACK THEN, WITH YOU AT SECOND CITY AND I WAS AT THE ART INSTITUTE, AND YOU WOULD KIND OF LOOK AROUND AND THINK, "SOMEBODY'S GOING TO MAKE IT, BUT WHO?"
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT.
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW. THERE WERE PEOPLEY WOULD THINK, "OH, THAT PERSON IS GOING TO BE HUGE," AND I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT. BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. LUCK, I GUESS.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE WORKED REALLY HARD, HAVEN'T YOU?
YEAH, BUT SO ARE YOU.
Stephen: AND WE BOTH MADE IT, SO I GUESS THAT'S IT. I GUESS THAT'S IT. CONGRATULATIONS TO US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I USED TO LIKE--
IT COULDN'T HAPPEN TO BETTER PEOPLE.
Stephen: NO. WE ARE LOVELY FOLKS. I USED TO LOVE TO HEAR THE STORIES THAT AMY WOULD TELL ABOUT YOUR FAMILY GOING TO YOUR BEACH HOUSE IN NORTH CAROLINA. YOU'D HAVE, LIKE, YOUR TANNING CONTESTS. AND YOU HAVE YOUR EMOLLIENTS--
WE ALWAYS HAD A MISS EMOLLIENT PAGEANT. WE WOULD GO TO THE BEACH FAIR WEEK, AND YOU HAVE A TAN-- A COMPETITION TO SEE WHO HAS THE DARKEST TAN. AND MY SISTER GRETCHEN WINS. IT WAS-- WE WOULD RENT PLACES. BUT THEN WE GOT-- WE BOUGHT A PLACE.
Stephen: OH, YOU ARE HAVE ONE THERE NOW?
YES, BUT THE HOUSES THERE, YOU KNOW, THEY ALL HAVE BEACHY NAMES LIKE "CLAM-A-LOT." AND "DUNE-OUR-THING" AND THE "SCHLITZ." THE ONE WE GOT HAD A DUMB NAME, SO WE NAMED IT TO THE "SEE SECTION." I'M GOING TO GET A BOAT AND CALL IT "ROW V.WAVE." I'M GOING TO PAINT ON THE SIDE, "SEMEN GOT YOU INTO THIS."
Stephen: YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THEFT AND FINDING:  DIARIES, 1977-2002." FIRST QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY-- DO I APPEAR IN YOUR DIARY?
YOU'RE NOT IN THE BOOK, BUT YOU'RE IN MY DIARY.
Stephen: SO I'M NOT IN THIS.
NO.
Stephen: OH, OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ARE YOU AFRAID I WOULD COME AFTER YOU WITH A LAWYER OR SOMETHING, DAVID?
I SPENT, I DON'T KNOW,IC LIKE THE LAST TWO YEARS GOING THROUGH MY DIARIES. I HAD 164 BOOKS THAT ARE ALL BIGGER THAN THAT.
Stephen: LIKE YOUR ACTUAL DIARIES IS 164 OF THESE.
YEAH. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S LEAK A CRAZY PERSON. IT'S LIKE TINY HANDWRITING ON THE FRONT AND THE BACK OF THE PAGE. SO THAT'S ALL-- THAT'S, LIKE, JUST A TINY FRACTION OF. >--
Stephen: HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO WHITTLE THIS DOWN TO THIS RIGHT HERE IF YOU HAVE 164 OF THESE. WHAT WAS THE LAST YEAR OF YOUR LIFE?
WHAT WAS THE LAST YEAR OF MY LIFE.
Stephen: WAS IT JUST READING THIS?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TIME TO WRITE IN YOUR NEW DIARY OR WAS IT READING THE OLD DIARIES EVERY DAY.
THAT'S THING. AND YOU'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION, BUT YOU COULD READ THAT BOOK AND THEN YOU GET TO BE YOURSELF. YOU PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND YOU GET TO BE YOURSELF. BUT I HAD TO READ THE BOOK AND THEN STILL BE THE PERSON IN THE BOOK. SO IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH OF THAT PERSON.
Stephen: WELL WHAT, DID YOU THINK-- WHAT DID YOU THINK-- AFTER READING ABOUT YOURSELF, YOUR OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR LIFE FROM '77 TO 2002 WHAT, DID YOU THINK OF YOU?
I WAS SURPRISED HOW LITTLE I HAD CHANGED, I SUPPOSE. BUT DO YOU THINK YOU'VE CHANGED A LOT? I MEAN, MAYBE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED, BUT FUNDAMENTALLY, DO YOU THINK YOU'VE CHANGED IN 30 YEARS?
Stephen: I'VE GAINED WEIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO PEA WHAT'S HAPPENING, BEFORE I SHOW THIS PHOTO, AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO.
SURE. WHERE WE LIVE NOW, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S ALL ENGLISH PEOPLE BUT A LOT OF ENGLISH PEOPLE, THEY'LL READ A NEWSPAPER, FINISH THE McDONALD'S, AND THEY THROW IT OUT THE CAR WINDOW. SO THE ROADSIDES -- WHERE WE LIVE IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND THE ROADSIDES ARE CARPETED WITH LITTER. SO I STARTED PICKING IT UP. AND I SPEND, I DON'T KNOW, BETWEEN FOUR AND NINE HOURS A DAY PICKING UP TRASH ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND I'VE PICKED UP TONS AND TONS AND TONS. AND SO MY LOCAL COUNCIL NAMED A GARBAGE TRUCK AFTER ME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S A FORM OF IMMORTALITY. WELL, IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I CERTAINLY HOPE IT'S NOT ANOTHER 20 YEARS BEFORE I SEE YOU AGAIN. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, BY THE WAY. I THINK I'VE SEEN YOU INDEPENDENT LAST 20 YEARS.
NOPE.
Stephen: A PLAY THAT AIMY AND PAUL HAVE DONE. LIKE AT LA MAMA, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. GOD I HAVE TO HAVE SEEN YOU.
BUT THAT WAS MORE THAN 20 YEARS?
WAS THAT MORE THAN 20 YEARS.
MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: WELL, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
WE HAVE MAKEUP ON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
