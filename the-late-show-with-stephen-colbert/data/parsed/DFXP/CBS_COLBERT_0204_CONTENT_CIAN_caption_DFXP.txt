Stephen: WE BELIEVE THE IPHONE 7 IS THE MOST EXCITING iPHONE YET. YOU'VE HEARD THE RUMORS AND, YES, THEY ARE TRUE. WE HAVE REMOVED THE HEADPHONE JACK.  ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. WE ALSO GOT RID OF THE HOME BUTTON.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, SOME COMPANIES MIGHT STOP THERE. BUT WE THOUGHT IF LESS IS MORE, HOW MUCH MORE COULD WE LESS? WE THINK YOU'LL BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ALL THE THINGS WE DIDN'T INCLUDE. FOR INSTANCE, THAT FRAGILE GLASS FRONT? GONE.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND WITH NO FRONT, DO YOU REALLY NEED A BACK? ALSO, THE iPHONE 7 NEVER NEEDS TO BE CHARGED BECAUSE THERE IS NO BATTERY.  ( APPLAUSE ) INTRODUCING THE iPHONE 7. QUITE SIMPLY, A SOLID CHUNK OF METAL. ( APPLAUSE ) SO HOW DO YOU GET ALL THE GREAT iPHONE FEATURES YOU'VE COME TO RELY ON? TONIGHT, WE'RE PROUD TO INTRODUCE iFRIEND UPON HELLO, GABE.
HELLO.
Stephen: INSTANT VERBAL RESPONSE. ( APPLAUSE ) SAY, GABE, WHAT TIME IS IT?
10:15.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GABE, I MIGHT GO FOR A WALK LATER. HOW'S THE WEATHER?
IT'S PRETTY NICE OUT. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ASKING-- HOW WILL I PLAY MY MUSIC? WELL, IT'S THIS SIMPLE. I STILL HAVE MY OLD HEADPHONES RIGHT HERE. GABE, I CAN BORROW YOUR iPHONE 6? ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( YELLING ) THE iPHONE 7, THE NEXT THING WE'RE ASKING YOU TO BUY.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW"" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES WHOOPI GOLDBERG. REGINA HAL. AND CAPTAIN "SULLY" SULLENBERGER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? WOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS, EVERYBODY! WHAT'S GOING ON? HOW YOU DOING? HEY!
WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW." HEY CHRIS. WHAT'S GOING ON, JON? WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR YOUNG, SPRIGHTLY HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. TODAY, OF COURSE, IS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY BECAUSE APPLE HAS ANNOUNCED A NEW iPHONE, THE iPHONE 7. iPHONES ARE NOW TIED WITH "THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS" FRANCHISE BALL'S IN YOUR COURT, VIN DIESEL. LET'S SEE WHAT'S NEW. WHAT'S NEW WITH THE PHONE? IT'S WATER RESISTANT, WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN YOU DROP IT IN A TOILET, YOU CAN JUST PICK IT UP AND PUT IT RIGHT BACK UP TO YOUR MOUTH. NO RB. BUT APPLE MADE ONE BIG CHANGE THAT I DON'T THINK THE WORLD'S READY FOR. THEY GOT RID OF THE HEADPHONE JACK, AND THEY DID IT FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.
NOW, SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED WHY WE WOULD REMOVE THE ANALOG HEADPHONE JACK. THE REASON, TO MOVE ON, THERE ARE THREE OF THEM, BUT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO ONE WORD--
Stephen: IS IT (BLEEP) YOU? I'M SORRY. NO, THAT'S TWO WORDS. I'M SORRY. PLEASE, GO ON.
BUT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO ONE WORD: COURAGE.
Stephen: YES, WHERE DO THEY FIND THE COURAGE TO CHARGE PEOPLE $160 FOR NEW HEADPHONES? ( LAUGHTER ) WITHOUT THE HEADPHONE JACK, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO USE NOW, BLUETOOTH? BLUETOOTH IS FOR CAR STEREOS AND PEOPLE WHO TALK LOUDLY IN PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR BOAT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'M JUST GOING TO HAMMER MY OLD HEADPHONE PLUG INTO THE LIGHTNING PORT AND HOPE FOR THE BEST-- SAME WAY I GOT MY DVD PLAYER TO ACCEPT MY VHS TAPES. WE ARE WATCHING "THE LION KING"! NOW, APPLE SAYS YOU CAN STILL HOLD AND STILL USE YOUR OLD HEADPHONES. YOU'LL JUST NEED AN ADAPTER. THIS JUST IN: YOU'VE ALREADY LOST THE ADAPTER. SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT ARE CONFUSING AND UPSETTING, THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS JUST 60 DAYS AWAY, AND THE RACE IS TIGHTENING. OVER THE SUMMER, DONALD TRUMP WAS WAY BEHIND, BUT A NEW CNN POLL HAS HIM UP BY TWO POINTS NATIONALLY. NOW, I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT HAPPENED. I'M GOING TO SAY ANGRY WHITE MEN HAVE STARTED TO REPRODUCE ASEXUALLY. AND LAST WEEK, TRUMP MAY HAVE GOTTEN A SIGN HE WILL WIN IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE TRUMP'S ATTORNEY, MICHAEL COHEN, TWEETED OUT THIS PICTURE OF A CLOUD THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP, ALONG WITH THE CAPTION "IN CASE ANYONE IS UNSURE AS TO WHO WILL BE OUR NEXT #POTUS, THE LORD HAS CHOSEN THE PEOPLE'S MESSENGER." YES, GOD MADE A TRUMP-SHAPED CLOUD, THOUGH THE CLOUD ACTUALLY HOLDS A POSITION LONGER THAN THE REAL DONALD TRUMP. BUT, YOU KNOW, GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS BECAUSE LATER THAT DAY HE ALSO ENDORSED A SEAHORSE, A DUCKIE, AND YOUR MOTHER MAKING LOVE TO THE MAILMAN. I THINK? NO ONE ELSE SEES THAT? NO ONE ELSE? NO ONE ELSE SEES THAT? OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND GOD'S NOT THE ONLY ONE SAYING DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE PRESIDENT. SO IS DONALD TRUMP. COURAGE. HE HAS A NEW WAY OF QUESTIONING HILLARY CLINTON'S FITNESS FOR OFFICE.
YOU'VE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S STAMINA.
RIGHT.
YOU'VE EVEN SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T LOOK PRESIDENTIAL.
I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IF-
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WELL, I JUST DON'T THINK SHE HAS A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK, AND YOU NEED A PRESIDENTIAL LOOK.
Stephen: HMMM, WHAT DOES TRUMP MEAN BY "PRESIDENTIAL LOOK"? I MEAN, IS IT SOMETHING,  YOU KNOW, THIS AREA? HOW CAN I PUT THIS? I'M UNCOMFORTABLE DOING THIS. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS FOR YOU TO WATCH ME DO THIS. HOW CAN I PUT THIS? I THINK TRUMP IS POINTING OUT THAT YOU CAN'T SPELL "PRESIDENTIAL" WITHOUT "PENIS." OR IF YOU WANT TO USE ALL THE LETTERS "IDLE RAT PENIS," WHICH MIGHT BE ANOTHER SIGN.  ( APPLAUSE ) IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER SIGN FROM GOD THAT HE THINKS TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT. BUT TRUMP'S REMARKS GOT ME THINKING. MAYBE HILLARY WOULD SEEM MORE PRESIDENTIAL IF SHE JUST BORROOWED HER LOOK FROM SOME OF OUR PAST PRESIDENTS. WHAT IF SHE HAD GEORGE WASHINGTON'S HAIR? ABE LINCOLN'S BEARD. F.D.R.'S GLASSES AND CIGARETTE HOLDER. AND WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT'S MORBID OBESITY. WORTH A SHOT. OF COURSE, THE STORY THAT I'VE S BEEN AVOIDING TALKING ABOUT-- AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS IN CASE DON'T KNOW-- TAYLOR SWIFT AND TOM HIDDLESTON HAVE BROKEN UP. THAT'S RIGHT, HIDDLESWIFT CALLED IT HIDDLE-SPLITS. AND TAYLOR HAS SENT HIDDLESTON PACKING BACK TO ASGARD OR HOGWARTS OR WHEREVER HE'S FROM. AND I'M ESPECIALLY SAD ABOUT THIS NEWS BECAUSE THEIR LOVE WAS IN THE PRESS SO MUCH, I THOUGHT I WAS A PART OF IT, TOO. IN A WAY, IT FEELS LIKE THEY BROKE UP WITH ME. IN FACT, I'M SO UPSET, THAT I DID WHAT TAYLOR DOES WHEN SHE GOES THROUGH A BREAKUP: I WROTE A SONG ABOUT IT. COULD I HAVE-- COULD I HAVE MY STRINGLESS GUITAR, PLEASE? THANKS SO MUCH.

Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. HEY, THERE'S BIG NEWS IN FRANCE. A COURT ON THE ISLAND OF CORISCA WHEN FRANCE CONTROLS-- JUST UPHELD A LOCAL BAN ON BURKINIS, WHICH COMBINE A BURKA WITH A BIKINI, THOUGH I GOTTA SAY, I DON'T SEE MUCH KINI. IT'S MOSTLY BURK. BUT THEN AGAIN, WELL, LOOK AT THOSE ANKLES. HELLO! THOSE CAN'T BE NATURAL. WOW. I'M IMPLYING SHE HAS ANKLE IMPLANTS. OVER THIS SUMMER, MULTIPLE FRENCH TOWNS HAVE BANNED THE GARMENT, AND POLICE HAVE EVEN FORCED WOMEN TO DISROBE IN PUBLIC. IT TURNS OUT, FRANCE HAS ACTUAL FEDERAL BIKINI INSPECTORS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, DEFENDERS OF THE BAN SAY BURKINIS PROMOTE THE SUBJUGATION OF WOMEN. SO BASICALLY, HERE'S THEIR LOGIC: "EXCUSE ME, MA'AM? YOUR GARMENT IS PART OF A CULTURE THAT OPPRESSES WOMEN, SO LET'S LOSE THAT TOP." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, PERSONALLY, I SUPPORT BURKINIS AT THE BEACH, AS SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND WHO MAY OR MAY NOT ENJOY THE SECURITY OF A BIG DROOPY T-SHIRT WHILE SWIMMING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, FALL. I'VE GOT TO SAY, FRANCE HAS NOT HANDLED THIS SITUATION WELL. IN A RECENT STATEMENT, FRANCE'S PRIME MINISTER AND GUY WHO DOESN'T CARE YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, MANUEL VALLS, INVOKED MARIANNE, THE SYMBOL OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC, SAYING, THEN HE SAID "HAW HAW HAW!" AND HAD A THREE-WAY WITH A MIME AND WHEEL OF CHEESE. ( LAUGHTER ) FRANCE, I'VE GOT TO CALL BULL-CREPE ON THIS BECAUSE BARE BREASTS AREN'T A SYMBOL OF YOUR REPUBLIC. THEY ARE A SYMBOL OF OUR REPUBLIC. WHERE ARE YOUR BREAST-THEMED RESTAURANTS? WE HAVE HOOTERS, TILTED KILT, TWIN PEAKS, APPLEBEE'S. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, YEAH. BESIDES, THE SONG GOES "THERE'S A PLACE IN FRANCE WHERE THE LADIES WEAR NO PANTS." IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING UP TOP. IN AMERICA, WE LOVE BREASTS SO MUCH, WE USE THEM TO FEED OUR BABIES, UNLIKE YOU GUYS, WHO I'M PRETTY SURE SLAP A NIPPLE ON A BOTTLE OF BURGUNDY. AND IF YOU'RE SO INTO BREASTS, FRANCE, HOW COME THE STATUE YOU GAVE US IS SUCH A PRUDE? SHE'S NOT EVEN SHOWING HER ANKLES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH WHOOPIE GOLDBERG. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR, AUTHOR, TALK SHOW HOST, AND HAS HER OWN LINE OF PREMIUM POT. PLEASE WELCOME WHOOPI GOLDBERG. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, THEN, YOUNG LADY, THANK YOU FOR BEING BACK HERE.
I LOVE COMING HERE.
Stephen: I LOVE HAVING YOU HERE. YOU SEE-- NOW, DIGET THAT RIGHT? DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN LINE OF PREMIUM--
NO, I DO NOT.
Stephen: WHAT IS-- HOLD ON, LET ME GET THIS RIGHT. WHOOPI AND MIA MEDICAL CANNABIS.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. YOU CAN'T SMOKE IT. IT'S NOT SMOKEABLE. YOU RUB IT. IT'S FOR PEOPLE --
YOU RUB IT?
YOU RUB IT. SO SOMEBODY SAID TO ME --
WHAT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO DOES NOT HAVE A MENSTRUAL CYCLE-- ( KNOCKS ON DESK ) BEEN A WHILE, IT'S BEEN A WHILE. CAN I RUB IT ON ME?
YOU CAN RUB IT ON YOU.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS?
YOUR MUSCLES WILL PROBABLY FEEL BETTER.
Stephen: OH, WOW.
WE'RE NOT HERE TO GET YOU-- WE DON'T WANT TO GET YOU HIGH. ALL YOU NEED IS A WEED MAP FOR THAT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET YOU DOING SOMETHING THAT IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN TAKING MAYBE SOME OF THE PILLS THAT ARE AROUND FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE STRONG MENSTRUAL CYCLES. AND BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK MENSTRUAL PAIN IS FAKE, THERE WAS KIND OF-- YEAH.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK IT'S FAKE.
MANY PEOPLE DO.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHO?
A LOT OF WOMEN WHO HAVE NEVER HAD IT.
Stephen: WHAT?
MEN WHO DON'T HAVE IT. THIS IS HOW I GOT INTO IT. A FRIEND OF MINE SAID TO ME, "SNOOP DOGG IS DOING THIS, WILLY IS DOING THIS. AND I SAID, "IS ANYBODY DOING ANYTHING FOR MEN SPHRAL CRAMPS? AND HE STARTED LAWCHG. HE SAID, "NO, NO, IT'S A NICHE MARKET." I SAID, "THAT'S A NICHE MARKET THAT THAT'S HALF THE POPULATION ON EARTH."
Stephen: IT'S A BIG NICHE.
IT'S A BIG NICHE.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING HERE. WHILE IT'S NOT MEANT TO GET YOU HIGH, WILL IT GET YOU HIGH?
NO, IT WILL NOT --
NO MATTER WHERE YOU RUB IT.
NO MATTER WHERE YOU RUB IT. AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN'S PRODUCTIVITY, WHICH GOES DOWN TWO, THREE DAYS A MONTH WHEN WOMEN GET THESE BAD CRAMPED-- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE COULD SAY TO YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THESE CRAMPS THE FIRST TIME, THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE IT TO USE THAT HELPS. SO WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO GET YOU HIGH. WE JUST WANTED IT TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER IN TERMS OF THE CRAMPS, AND IT DOES.
Stephen: WOW, OKAY.
SO I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE PRESCRIBING FOR MEDICINAL MARIJUANA, CRAMPS ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE EVER THINK OF. SO IT'S NEVER SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE PRESCRIBE FOR. SO IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA.
Stephen: YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING AT THIS POINT TO GET A PRESCRIPTION, RIGHT?
NO, NOT HERE.
Stephen: I HAVE ANXIETY.
NOT IN NEW YORK, NOT IN NEW JERSEY, NOT IN MOST PLACE S.
Stephen:  I HAVE FRAIL CUTEICLES. I CAN GET SOME POT.
NOT HERE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION?
DO I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION? YES.
Stephen: DID YOU BRING ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE?
I CAN'T SMOKE.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
YES, I CAN ONLY VAPE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE SMOKING DOPE IN THE FUTURE. IT ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE FROM THE FUTURE WHEN YOU HAVE A VAPE PEN?
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN ME WITH ONE BUT I HAVE ONE.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE THE LOCH NESS MONSTER, NO ONE'S EVER--
YES, IT IS. NO ONE EVER'S EVER SEEN IT, BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THERE.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU HAD AN ANTI-RELATIONSHIP BOOK. ARE YOU STILL FIGHTING LOVE OR HAS CUPID STRUCK?
I'M MOTT FIGHTING LOVE. I JUST KNOW BETTER.
Stephen: WHAT!
LISTEN, YOU ARE HAPPILY MARRY GLD ABSOLUTELY.
LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE ARE HAPPILY MARRIED. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE TO HELP YOU RUB THE CANNABIS LOTION ON YOU. YOU'RE RUBBING IT ON THE WRONG SPOT.
SEE THESE HANDS? THESE HANDS KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS.
Stephen: OH, OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SEE THESE HANDS? SAME DEAL.
I KNOW! SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING. BUT I-- YOU KNOW, I JUST-- YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD WITH A RELATIONSHIP.
Stephen: YOU DO, YEAH.
YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO IT, AND I'M NOT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M NOT. I DON'T WANT TO. I DON'T WANT TO. I LIKE-- YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A HIT AND RUN EVERY NOW AND THEN WITH A GOOD FRIEND.
Stephen: REALLY?
OH, YEAH!
Stephen: AT LEAST GET A LICENSE PLATE. GET A LICENSE PLATE OR SOMETHING.
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T NEED A LICENSE PLATE. IF THEY HIT IN THE RIGHT SPOT! YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) WRITE THAT DOWN. YOU KNOW! WRITE IT DOWN! ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK HERE IN JUST A SECOND AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO AWAY. I TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. YOU'RE A NEW YORKER. YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE. YOU'RE FAMOUS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW BOTH TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MET BOTH THESE PEOPLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING BEHIND THE SCENES? SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?
HE'S-- HE'S-- AH-- ( LAUGHTER ) HE HAS-- HE HAS A GREAT DAUGHTER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND HILLARY CLINTON?
HILLARY ALSO HAS A GREAT DAUGHTER.
Stephen: WOW. MAYBE THE DAUGHTERS SHOULD BE RUNNING.
WELL, I THINK SO. I WOULD MUCH-- LISTEN, YOU KNOW, THIS IS-- THIS IS THE-- THE GLORY AND THE HORROR OF OUR POLITICS. ANYBODY CAN RUN, AND ANYBODY CAN BECOME PRESIDENT. SO WE, AS A COLLECTIVE GROUP, HAVE TO BE REALLY FREAKING CAREFUL ABOUT WHO WE PUT IN THERE. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT-- THIS IS NOT A SHOW. THIS IS OUR POLITICS. THIS IS OUR LIVES. THIS IS NOT-- YOU CAN'T FIRE THIS GUY. IF YOU PUT HIM IN, YOU CANNOT FIRE HIM. SO JUST BE MINDFUL. WHATEVER YOUR DECISION IS. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. JUST SAYIN'. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. STICK AROUND. STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT K WITH MOR MORE WHOOPI GOLDBERG,
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK WITH WHOOPIE GOLDBERG. ALWAYS NICE TO TALK TO YOU?
YES. CAN I JUST DO SOMETHING? YOU ALL ARE KICKING BUTT OVER THERE. CAN I JUST SAY IT? YOU ALL JUST KICK BUTT. I LOVE YOU ALL.
Jon: THANK YOU, YEAH!
THE HOUSE WAS ROCKIN', PEOPLE WERE MOVIN'. WHITE PEOPLE WERE JUST LIKE YAA! IT WAS AMAZING.
Stephen:  YOU'VE GOT A NEW SHOW ON OXYGEN CALLED "STRUT." TELL US WHAT "STRUT" IS.
WELL, "STRUT" IS ABOUT THE FIRST TRANSGENDER MODELING AGENCY. YOU KNOW, IT'S AN AMAZING THING. PEOPLE SORT OF FEEL TRANSGENDER, FOLKS HAVE JUST GOT HERE, THAT THIS IS VERY NEW. BUT, YOU KNOW, TRANSGENDER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR YEARS. AND ONE OF THE REASONS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE FOLKS DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE CAITLIN JENNER OR YOU SEE LAVERNE COX, AND YOU THINK, OKAY, THAT'S WHAT IT IS. BUT THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE TALKING TO AND BRINGING TO THE SHOW ARE REGULAR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO JUST HAVE THEIR LIVES. IT'S KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY.
Stephen: REGULAR PEOPLE WHO ARE, ALSO, LIKE MODEL GLAMOROUS, THOUGH.
YEAH, YEAH. BUT, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: YOU KNOW, MODELS ARE NOT REGULAR PEOPLE. MODELS ARE--
EXCEPT THAT THESE ARE.
Stephen: REALLY?
THESE FOLKS ARE. YEAH. BECAUSE THEY-- YOU KNOW, THESE ARE FOLKS WHO KNOW WHO THEY ARE INSIDE, BUT IF THEY CAME TO WORK, YOU KNOW, HERE OR, YOU KNOW, H.R. WOULD SAY TO THEM, "HEY, LISTEN, YOU CAN'T BE DRESSED LIKE THAT. YOU CAN'T BE THIS PERSON." AND THEY WOULD SAY, "LISTEN, THIS IS WHO I AM."
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY LOOK TOO GOOD? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SOMETIMES THEY LOOK TOO GOOD BECAUSE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SEEM TO MAKE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME REASON. AND I FIND-- AND TALKING TO A LOT OF THE FOLKS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH-- YOU KNOW, THEY SAY, LISTEN, WE'VE HAD TO DO OTHER KINDS OF WORK BECAUSE PEOPLE WON'T HIRE US BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS OR UNCOMFORTABLE. AND SO THIS IDEA OF BECOMING A MODEL OR BEING MODELS AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS, IT'S STARTING TO BE SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF, I THINK IT IS-- IS AN AMAZING DREAM FOR FOLKS AND A GOOD WAY NOT TO HAVE TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BECAUSE YOU'RE A TRANSGENDER PERSON. YOU KNOW, IT'S-- THEIR BRAVERY, TO STAND UP AND SAY, "THIS IS WHO I AM," IN A WORLD FULL OF PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S FUNNY OR THINK IT'S SILLY OR DON'T UNDERSTAND OR WHO GET VERY, VERY, YOU KNOW, RELIGIOUS ABOUT IT, IT'S LIKE, LISTEN, SOMEBODY SAID, "WELL, GOD DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES." IT'S LIKE, "NO, GOD DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES, BUT MOTHER NATURE WILL MESS WITH YOU UNTIL THE COWS COME HOME." BECAUSE YOU-- YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I KNOW WHO I AM. BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARRIVE AND IT'S-- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LITTLE MIX-UP. THEY'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE. SO TO BE ABLE IT TO SAY IT OUT LOUD AND KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM PEOPLE, I JUST-- I HAVE TO TIP MY HAT TO THESE FOLKS BECAUSE THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY.
Stephen: THIS AGENCY ONLY HANDLES TRANSGENDERED MODELS.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THERE A LOT OF CALL FOR THAT?
YEAH, ACTUALLY, THERE ARE. AND WHEN YOU SEE OUR MODELS, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: NOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER-- THERE'S A PROCESS OF EDUCATION TO WHAT IS SORT OF ACCEPTABLE TO ASK SOMEONE IN THE THE TRANS COMMUNITY.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND THERE'S A CLIP RIGHT HERE SHOWING IT'S A-- IT'S A TRANSGENDERED MAN WHO HAS GONE OUT ON A DATE AND HE GETS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT HE WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO.
I CAN ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION?
YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING.
DO YOU HAVE A...
THAT'S ONE THING YOU DON'T ASK.
IS THAT OFFENSIVE? I'M SORRY. I AM SO SORRY. I DIDN'T-- I DON'T KNOW. I SAID IT WAS PERSONAL. I'M SORRY.
NO, IT'S GOOD. I MEAN, IT LETS ME KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW, SO THAT MEANS SOMETHING.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. YOU DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION UNLESS LATER YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT ABOUT THAT.
WELL, YOU DON'T ASK THAT TO ANYBODY.
Stephen: ( BLEEP ). DON'T EVER SAY THERE'S A QUESTION I WON'T ASK.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WOULD BE LIKE YOU MEETING SOME-- NOT YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED. BUT YOU MEETING SOMEONE AND SAYING, "HEY, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. HOW TIGHT IS YOUR VAGINA?" IT'S NOT A-- IT'S NOT A-- ( LAUGHTER ) YUP. DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW? THESE ARE QUESTIONS YOU WOULDN'T ASK OTHER PEOPLE. YOU JUST WOULDN'T ASK SOMEBODY THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW FOR FOLKS, AS SHE SAID, YOU KNOW,"I'M SORRY, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY."
Stephen: HE DID SAY HE COULD ASK ANYTHING.
YES, HE DID. AND I DID SAY TO HIM, "I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO SAY THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO SAY 'YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING' AND THEY SAY 'THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW'." HE'S EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT HIM AND THINK ABOUT ALL THESE STATE WITH THESE BATHROOM LAWS. NOW, DO YOU WANT HIM WALKING INTO A WOMAN'S BATHROOM? I DON'T THINK SO. NO.
Stephen: ARE YOU SHOOTING ANY OF THIS STUFF IN NORTH CAROLINA?
NOT YET. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: SEASON TWO?
WELL, YOU KNOW, COULD BE. BUT WE WANTED TO DO THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE FOLKS REQUIRE AS MUCH RESPECT AS ANYBODY ELSE YOU MEET ON THE STREET. SO THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO DO IT.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ).
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH THE SHOW.
THANK YOU.

THAT IS TRUE.
Stephen: THE AUDIENCE GIVES YOU THIS LITTLE SIGNAL. THEY LAUGH.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I DO SAY, EVERYONE IS LIKE, "WHEN YOU DO DRAMAS, IS IT HARDER?" BUT I WILL SAY THIS, COMEDY IS PRECISE. SO I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE REALLY PREPARED. PEOPLE THINK-- MEANING I HAVE TO BE IN CHARACTER AND IN THE MOMENT, EVEN IF I'M IMPROVING.

YOU KNOW, IN OUR FLIGHT SIMULATORS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO PRACTICE WATER LANDINGS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T PROSPECTED FOR IT. THE ONLY TRAINING WE HAD EVER GOTTEN WAS THEORETICAL CLASSROOM DISCUSSION.
Stephen: SO CHALKBOARD.
YES. SO WE HAD TO DIG DEEP, TAKE WHAT WE DID KNOW, ADAPT IT AND APPLY IT IN A NEW WAY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WE'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER THINK IN A MILLION YEARS THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING A WATER LANDING?
NO, OR BEING ON THIS SHOW, OR HAVING --
ONE THING AT A TIME. TOM HANKS.
OR HAVING TOM HANKS OR CLINT EASTWOOD INVOLVED IN TELLING THE STORY.
Stephen: SOMEBODY IN THE PLANE WHO HEARS THE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS OVER AND OVER, THEY SAY, "IN CASE OF A WATER LANDING," I ALWAYS THINK, "YEAH, RIGHT. YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE METAL, RIGHT?"
EVERY YEAR IN RECURRENT TRAINING, PILOTS AND FLIGHT ATTENDANT GOES THROUGH THAT, FOR YEARS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT'S REALLY UNLIKELY, AND GEEZ, IF IT WOULD HAPPEN, I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL IT WORK AT LEAST IN SITUATION LIKE THIS-- PART OF OUR JOB IS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE WHATEVER HAPPENS NO MATTER HOW UNEXPECTED OR HOW UNANTICIPATED IT IS.
Stephen: LET'S GOING GET BACK TO THE THINGS YOU COULD NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED WHICH IS TOM HANKS PLAYING YOU AND CLINT EASTWOOD DIRECTING TOM HAICHGS. WHAT WAS YOUR MEETING LIKE WITH THEM? YOU'RE NOT A HOLLYWOOD GUY. HOW DID YOU GET TO KNOW THEM? THE DOORBELL RANG, I OPENED IT, AND CLINT EASTWOOD WAS THERE.
Stephen: DID YOU KNOW HE WAS COMING? BECAUSE THAT WOULD FRIGHTEN ME IF THE DOOR OPENED AND HE WAS JUST THERE.
YEAH HE'S NOT THAT FRIGHTENING A GUY.
Stephen: HE'S NOT.
HE'S A NICE GUY. HE'S NOT "DIRTY HARRY" IN REALITY. SO I GOT THE HEADS UP. I GOT ABOUT 10 DAYS' NOTICE. WE HAD LUNCH. WE TALKED ABOUT THREE HOURS ABOUT MAKING MOVIES. AND I THINK HE WAS JUST TRYING TO GET THE MEASURE OF US, LAURIE AND ME, IN OUR HOME, IN OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, BEFORE HE MADE ANY CASTING DECISIONS. BUT I THINK, FROM WHAT I GATHER, TOM WAS AT THE TOP OF ALMOST EVERYONE'S LIST.
Stephen: MOST LISTS. MOST LISTS. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO SEE TOM HANKS PORTRAY YOU ON SCREEN? DO YOU RECOGNIZE YOURSELF UP THERE?
MY WIFE DOES. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IT'S HARD FOR EACH OF US TO SEE OURSELVES THAT WAY. WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE IN THE BACK.
Stephen: IT'S HARD TO RECOGNIZE YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MUSTACHE.
I CUT IT OFF AFTER TWO YEARS OF LOBBYING AND BEGGING AND PLEADING MY WIFE FINALLY CONVINCED ME IT WAS TIME FOR A CLEAN LOOK, TIME FOR A CHANGE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE WAS RIGHT.
Stephen: ARE THERE ANY-- YOU'VE BEEN HONORED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. HERE YOU ARE WITH THERE'S THE PRESIDENT.
YES.
Stephen: RIGHT THERE AND THE FIRST LADY. THAT WAS STILT HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR DAUGHTERS.
Stephen: THROWING OUT THE FIRST PITCH THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: HERE YOU ARE TAKING UP MORE PAGE SPACE THAN BEYONCE, WHICH IS NOT EASY TO DO.
WOW, WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE YOU PARTICULARLY ENJOYED?
OH, GOSH, BEING THE GRAND MARSHAL OF THE TOURNAMENT OF ROSES.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE.
IN THE 2009, JANUARY 1, 2010, WAS JUST INCREDIBLE. WE GOT TO SHARE IT WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER YOU DID THIS, MYSELF AND STEVE CARELL, HONORED YOU BY DOING A SONG ABOUT YOU AT THE AUTISM BENEFIT AND I JUST UPON TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF OUR SALUTE TO SULLY. JIM.
