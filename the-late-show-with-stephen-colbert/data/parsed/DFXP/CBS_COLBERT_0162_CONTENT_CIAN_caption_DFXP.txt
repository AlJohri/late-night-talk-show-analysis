YEAH, OKAY, MAYBE PEEING IN THE SHOWER IS NOT THE BIGGEST STORY, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT IS THE NUMBER ONE STORY. HERE'S THE DEAL: RESEARCHERS HAVE CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS AND DETERMINED THAT BY NOT FLUSHING TOILETS AND BY PEEING IN THE SHOWER INSTEAD, THE AMERICAN POPULATION WOULD SAVE 185 BILLION GALLONS OF WATER EVERY YEAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? ALL RIGHT? SO THAT'S SETTLED: PEEING IN THE SHOWER IS GOOD FOR THE PLANET. THAT'S SCIENCE. NOW, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO ADDRESS THE STAFF AT EQUINOX GYM.

I'M SORRY YOU CAUGHT ME "SAVING THE PLANET FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN." ANYWAY, I'M GLAD I GOT THAT OFF MY CHEST. SAME GOES FOR THE FOLKS AT GOLD'S GYM, CURVES, AND HOME DEPOT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WASN'T MY FAULT THOSE THINGS WEREN'T HOOKED UP. OKAY. HEY, ANYBODY HERE SEEN "HAMILTON"? YOU GUYS SEEN "HAMILTON"? IT'S GREAT.

Audience: OOH!
Stephen: I KNOW. SAME REACTION I HAD. IT WAS AN AMAZING RUN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S LEAVING TO DO-- I ASSUME BE ON THE TEN DOLLAR BILL. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA'S DAD SAYS HE WANTS TO SEE THE SHOW A FEW MORE TIMES, BUT "IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TICKETS." THAT'S RIGHT, EVEN THE FOUNDING FATHER'S FATHER CAN'T GET IN. THAT IS GOING TO BE AN AWKWARD CONVERSATION AT THE NEXT BIG FAMILY DINNER. "SO, SON, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY GOOD MOVIES LATELY? I'VE SEEN A BUNCH, SINCE I CAN'T GET TICKETS TO 'HAMILTON.' WHO'S PLAYING THE PART NOW? DOES HE LOVE HIS DAD?" ARE YOU AT ALL INTERESTED IN WHO'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? HAS THAT CROSSED YOUR MIND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE TALK ABOUT IT SOMETIMES OVER HERE. THERE MIGHT BE A NEW DEVELOPMENT. YESTERDAY, OPRAH WINFREY OFFICIALLY ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON. ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH THAT IS OFFICIALLY CALLED A SMATTERING, BY THE WAY. THAT IS A SMATTERING. OPRAH THINKS SECRETARY CLINTON WILL MAKE A GREAT SECOND-MOST- POWERFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

ALSO THIS WEEK, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ADULT ENTERTAINMENT SITES ON THE INTERNET-- IT'S GOT A LOT OF PORN. IT'S GOT EYE CAN'T SAY THE NAME. I CAN'T SAY THE NAME, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SAY THE NAME. LET'S JUST SAY IT HAS SO MUCH PORN OF DIFFERENT KINDS, IT'S LIKE A CENTRAL HUB WHERE YOU CAN GO FIND-- FIND PORN. WELL, THIS SITE, THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE REACHING OUT TO A NEW DEMOGRAPHIC LAUNCHING EXPLICIT AUDIO FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED IN WHICH PROFESSIONAL VOICE ACTORS EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SCENE.

HOW'S YOUR EYESIGHT, JON.
Jon: OH, MAN, I'M GOOD, 20/20.
Stephen: I, ON THE OTHER HAND, WEAR GLASSES. IT'S ALL-- THIS NEW SERVICE IS ALL THANKS TO THIS PORN SITE'S PHILANTHROPIC ARM. AND IT'S NICE TO KNOW A PORN SITE CAN HAVE A PHILANTHROPIC ARM. BECAUSE THE OTHER ARM IS A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW. AND I'M TOLD THAT I CAN ACTUALLY SHOW SOME OF THESE AUDIO- ENHANCED CLIPS SO YOU CAN GET A FEEL FOR IT. AND AGAIN, THESE ARE REAL CLIPS.

Stephen: GREAT DESCRIPTION. GREAT DESCRIPTION. FINALLY, AT LAST, THE BLIND CAN ENJOY PORNOGRAPHY'S LOW PRODUCTION VALUE. NOW, THIS NARRATION IS A GOOD START, BUT IT COULD BE CLASSIER. SO TONIGHT WE'RE DOING OUR PART. I'VE HIRED DISTINGUISHED BBC NARRATOR, NIGEL WINTHROP, TO TAKE PORN AUDIO DESCRIPTION TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
DING-DONG GOES THE DOORBELL AS THE PIZZA MAN AWAITS WITH BAITED BREATH. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ANSWERS IN A FLIMSY NEGLIGEE. SHE MUST BE TAKEN WITH FEVER OR ELSE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE ON THER MIND. THAT WILL BE $17.50 SAYS THE PIZZA MAP, A FAIR SUM IN THE OPINION OF YOUR HUMBLE NARRATOR. DOES IT COME WITH EXTRA SAUSAGE. HOW SHOULD I KNOW? YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ORDERED IT, THINKS THE PIZZA MAN. THE WOMAN'S HANDS ARE UPON HIS BELT BUCKLE. GOOD LORD! THIS ISN'T WHAT HE EXPECTED AT ALL. TANGLED LIKE FIGHTING COBRAS THE TWO PROCEED TO THE CHAUFFEUR WHERE THEY PERFORM DUTIES OF MARITAL QNG GREAT VIGOR. I THINK I'LL PAUSE FOR THIS MOMENT. THIS PART SEEMS WRATH INTIMATE.

AND FATHERS LIKE ME LIKE TO THINK THAT THEIR WORDS ARE ABSOLUTE, LIKE A LOT OF OTHER AUTHORITARIANS THROUGHOUT HISTORY, SUCH AS GENGHIS KHAN, BENITO MUSSOLINI, AND HARRY STYLES. CROSS THIS GUY, YOO & YOU'LL BE GOING IN ONE DIRECTION-- STRAIGHT TO HELL. THESE RUTHLESS LEADERS HAVE BUT TWO THINGS IN COMMON-- ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY AND A BIG FURRY HAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BEHOLD THE BIG FURRY HAT:  FATHER'S DAY EDITION. NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MINE HEAD, I AM ENDOWED WITH UNQUESTIONABLE POWER. THIS IS DUE TO MY HAT'S MAIN ATTRIBUTES:  ITS BIGNESS AND ITS FURRINESS. ANY PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE ABOUT FATHERHOOD WHILST WEARING THE HAT ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEREFORTH, WHATEVER WORDS DAD SINGS ALONG WITH THE SONG ON THE RADIO ARE NOW THE WORDS TO THAT SONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANY CHILD THAT TAKES THE BATTERIES OUT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS NOW THE REMOTE CONTROL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL CHILDREN SHALL EITHER STOP GROWING UP SO FAST OR ALLOW THEIR DAD TO HUG THEM IN PUBLIC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO NOT LOOK INSIDE THE CARDBOARD BOX OF MAGAZINES IN THE GARAGE. THERE IS NOTHING TO SEE THERE. HENCEFORTH, NO ONE SHALL MOCK THEIR FATHER IF HE CRIES DURING THE SONG "CATS IN THE CRADLE." ( LAUGHTER ) I'M FINE. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING IN MY EYE. IF A CHILD BRINGS A FRIEND OVER FOR DINNER, THE DAD MAY ADDRESS THAT FRIEND AS "KATIE," BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT OTHER KID THE CHILD BROUGHT OVER ONE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF YOU ARE WATCHING A MOVIE WITH YOUR FATHER AND A SEX SCENE COMES ON, NO ONE MAY SPEAK OF IT OR MAKE EYE CONTACT FOR THREE DAYS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH AARON PAUL! HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!

Stephen: AND YOU KNOW THAT I'M A FAN BECAUSE "BREAKING BAD" WAS THE FIRST SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS THE FIRST SHOW THAT I BINGED, AND YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR FIRST. DO PEOPLE STILL--
I APPRECIATE THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, IT'S AN INTIMATE FEELING.
YEAH.
Stephen: WE SPENT A LOT OF HOURS TOGETHER. AND-- YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT. AND PEOPLE STILL YELL, SCIENCE BITCH YES AT YOU EVERY DAY.
EVERY DAY. HONESTLY, I GET CALLED A BITCH EVERY DAY. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YEAH, IT'S TRUE. IT'S GREAT. IT'S GREAT, YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, THE NEW SHOW IS CALLED "THE PATH." WHICH IS ABOUT RELIGION, BITCH. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
Stephen: YOU GREW UP WITH A TRUINGS ARITY. YOU'RE THE SON OF A BAPTIST MINISTER.
I AM. I GREW UP INIDE HOW, AND MY FATHER IS A SOUTHERN BAPTIST MINISTER.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO FROM THE SON OF A BAPTIST MINISTER IN IDAHO TO AN ACTOR? THAT DISTRIBUTE SEEM LIKE THE MOST DIRECT PATH.
I WAS JUST OBSESSED WITH MOVIES EVER SINCE I WAS A KID. I STARTED WATCHING FILMS LIKE "STAND BY ME" AND "GOONIES" JUST OVER AND OVER-- ( APPLAUSE ).
"GOONIES" FANS. AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO SAVE UP MONEY TO MOVE OUT TO L.A. AT AGE, LIKE, 12. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND--
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IS THIS A TRUE STORY. I HEARD THAT RIGHT BEFORE YOU GOT "BREAKING BAD" OF, LIKE, A REAL LOW POINT IN YOUR CAREER? YOU WERE COMPLETELY BUSTED.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, AS AN ACTOR YOU HAVE A LOT OF HIGHS AND A LOT OF LOWS. MAINLY LOWS AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AT LEAST FOR ME.
Stephen: MOST ACTORS, LIKE 95% OF ACTORS ARE UNEMPLOYED.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IT'S A SCARY THING TO TELL YOUR PARENTS YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
AND MY MAIN THING WAS NEVER TO ASK MY FAMILY FOR ANYTHING FINANCIALLY. THIS WAS MY DREAM. SO RIGHT BEFORE "BREAKING BAD" WAS JUST-- I WAS STRUGGLING TO PAY MY RENT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN MY NEXT PAYCHECK WAS COMING. AND I HAD TO ASK MY FAMILY TO HELP PAY MY BILLS, WHICH IS JUST SO-- SO EMBARRASSING. YOU KNOW, I WAS MID-20s. HAD NO MONEY. AND THEN I READ THE PILOT FOR "BREAKING BAD," AND I JUST EYE KNEW I HAD TO FIGHT FOR IT. AND THEY GAVE IT ON TO ME.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER PAID THEM BACK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I HAVE.
Stephen: YOU PAID THEM BACK?
I PAID THEM BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD FEELING. THAT MUST BE A GOOD FEELING.
IT FELT GOOD, IT FELT GOOD, YEAH.
Stephen: THIS IS ABOUT A CULT, SORT OF, RIGHT?
IT'S A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT YEAH,.
Stephen: I DIDN'T WANT TO-- I DIDN'T WANT TO--
IT'S TRUE, YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE IN THESE MOVEMENTS, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE IN A CULT.
Stephen: EVERY RELIGION STARTED OFF AS A CULT. BECAUSE IT'S JUST A FEW PEOPLE WHEN IT STARTS OFF.
IT'S TRUE. IT ALL STARTS WITH AN IDEA.
Stephen: A CULT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S RELIGION. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH.
THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY TRUE.
Stephen: YEAH, IT IS.
THAT'S A GREAT PHRASE.
Stephen: I'M A VERY WISE MAN. NO, BUT, IS THIS A REAL-- IS THIS BASED ON A REAL CULT? THEY'RE CALL THE MEYERSIST. IS THAT A REAL THING?
NO, JESSICA GOLDBERG AND THE TEAM OF WRITERS JUST CREATED THIS INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. I MEAN TFEELS REAL BEING INSIDE OF IT, TO BE HONEST. BUT THEY JUST PULLED FROM MANY DIFFERENT CULTS, MOVEMENTS, RELIGION S.
Stephen:  IS THAT TEMPTING TO YOU? DOES THE IDEA OF A CULT TEMPT YOU AT ALL? I KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA.
OF COURSE. WHO HASN'T WANTED TO DRINK THE KOOL-AID A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: WELL, SOMEBODY WHO COULD JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO, HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE. TELL ME WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, AND I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
SOMEONE PROVIDING ANSWERS IS VERY TEMPT EXPWHING.
Stephen: JUST DON'T LEAVE THE COMPOUND AND BE WILLING TO BE CHILD'S FATHER BRIDE. I HEARD YOU GOT YOUR HOUSE ON AIRBNB. IS THAT TRUE?
IT IS.
Stephen: AIR BNB IS A LITTLE CULTIR.
IT IS. I USED TO HAVE MY HOUSE ON AIRBNB.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED?
I HAVE A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH AIRBNB. I USE IT ALL THE TIME. SECRETLY, I WAS RENTING OUT MY HOUSE IN IDAHO, BUT THEN AIRBNB, BLASTED IT OUT TO THE WORLD THAT IT WAS MY HOUSE. AND THEN--
Stephen: DID THEY TELL JEW NO! SHAME ON YOU, AIRBNB!
Stephen: WAIT, SO THEY JUST SAID, "HEY, BY THE WAY, YOU COULD SLEEP WITH AARON PAUL'S STUFF TONIGHT."
THEY JUST, YOU KNOW, THREW OUT THE LISTING. AND I STARTED GETTING ALL THESE MESSAGES FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO STAY AT MY HOUSE. I'M LIKE, THIS IS GREAT. BUT THEN THE MESSAGES WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD. I LOVE YOU BITCH. I CAN'T WAIT TO SLEEP IN YOUR BED, BITCH." I'M LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN I JUST GOOGLE, YOU KNOW, "AARON PAUL AIRBNB" AND IT'S JUST EVERYWHERE. SOME OF THESE MESSAGES --
DO YOU STILL HAVE ANY OF THEM?
I-- I-- I CAN DEFINITELY PULL OFF-- BECAUSE I STILL USE AIRBNB. I HAVE THE APP RIGHT HERE. LET ME JUST --
OKAY, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IT.
I MEAN, LISTEN TO THIS.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY RECEIVED THIS.
YES. "DUDE, WOULD LOVE TO RENT YOUR PLACE FOR A FEW DAYS TO A WEEK. HUGE "BREAKING BAD" FAN. MY DATES ARE FLEXIBLE. WOULD BE DRIVING FROM NORTHERN CALY. JUST ME AND AN OLDER FEMALE FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD A STROKE AND DEFINITELY DOES NOT PARTY." ( LAUGHTER ) SAD. "I WILL THROW IN SOME EXTRA CHEDDAH TO HAVE YOU KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND WHEN OPENED CALL US BITCHES." SMILEY FACE. "PEACE, IAIN." I MEAN, THAT IS ONE OF MANY.
