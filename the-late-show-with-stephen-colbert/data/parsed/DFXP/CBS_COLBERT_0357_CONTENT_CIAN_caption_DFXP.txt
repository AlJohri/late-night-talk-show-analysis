FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAN, THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO DO TWO MONOLOGUES. OKAY, ALL RIGHT? CAN WE DO THAT? LET'S DO THE FIRST ONE. YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. I-- I AM EXCITED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S THE MOST MAGICAL NIGHT OF THE YEAR BECAUSE IT'S COMEY TESTIMONY EVE. I'M READY. I HAVE THE DECORATIONS UP. I HUNG MY SOCKS UP OVER CNN. GOT TO PUT A FEW MORE OF THEM UP. I CAN STILL SEE WOLF BLITZER. I MEAN, YOU CAN FEEL THE ANTICIPATION? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I CAN FEEL IT. I CAN FEEL IT. ♪ I CAN FEEL IT COMEY IN THE AIR TONIGHT OH, LORD ♪ THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE READY TO PARTY. BECAUSE TOMORROW, BARS IN THE CAPITAL ARE OPENING EARLY AND OFFERING DRINK SPECIALS LIKE THE COVFEFE COCKTAIL. (LAUGHTER) ABSOLUTELY TRUE. NOT MADE UP. COVFEFE IS MADE UP, BUT THE COCKTAIL IS REAL. THAT'S A CUTE NAME. ,000 IF YOU COME UP WITH A NAME, ORANGE RUSSIAN IS RIGHT THERE. JUST TAKE A WHITE RUSSIAN, TOSS IN SOME COINTREAU AND A PINCH OF CAT HAIR. YOU'RE ALL GOOD. PEOPLE ARE CALLING COMEY'S TESTIMONY WASHINGTON'S SUPER BOWL. YEAH. AND I HEAR ANIMAL PLANET IS EVEN AIRING THE PUPPY COMEY TESTIMONY. COMEY'S TESTIMONY COULD BE CLOVIS. AND TODAY, WE GOT THE PRE-SPLOSION. BECAUSE AT COMEY'S INSISTENCE, THE SENATE PUBLISHED HIS PRE-WRITTEN OPENING REMARKS. THIS AFTERNOON AND... I HAVE THEM RIGHT HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THIS? HE PUBLISHED THIS. THIS IS TRUE. THEY JUST PUBLISHED IT, LIKE, A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, AND THIS THING IS FULL OF JUICY DETAILS BECAUSE, AS PROMISED, COMEY TOOK NOTES AFTER EVERY INTERACTION WITH DONALD TRUMP, STARTING WITH THEIR FIRST MEETING BACK IN JANUARY, WHEN COMEY WRITES, "I FELT COMPELLED TO DOCUMENT MY FIRST CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IN A MEMO. TO ENSURE ACCURACY, I BEGAN TO TYPE IT ON A LAPTOP IN AN F.B.I. VEHICLE OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER THE MOMENT I WALKED OUT OF THE MEETING." ( APPLAUSE ) "DEAR DIARY, I NEEDED TO WRITE DOWN MY THOUGHTS IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THAT GUY IS SO DARN NORMAL. ( LAUGHTER ) NOTE TO SELF: CAN YOU PURELL YOUR BRAIN? LOVE, ME." NOW, ALL IN ALL-- ALL IN ALL, COMEY SAYS HE SPOKE WITH TRUMP NINE TIMES IN FOUR MONTHS. IN CONTRAST, HE SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ONLY TWICE DURING HIS ENTIRE TENURE, "ONCE IN 2015 TO DISCUSS LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICY ISSUES, AND A SECOND TIME, BRIEFLY, FOR HIM TO SAY GOOD-BYE IN LATE 2016." "OH, AND A THIRD TIME A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHEN HE ASKED IF I WANTED TO JUST SAY, 'SCREW IT' AND GO HANG OUT WITH HIM AND OPRAH ON RICHARD BRANSON'S YACHT." ( APPLAUSE ) LET'S GO. LET'S GO. WE'RE GOING TO KITE SAIL. FANTASTIC. COMEY FIRST MET WITH TRUMP ON JANUARY 6th TO LET HIM KNOW ABOUT SOME SO-CALLED "SALACIOUS" INTELLIGENCE-- PEE-PEE TAPE, SAYING HE AGREED TO DO THE MEETING "ALONE TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL EMBARRASSMENT TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT." REMEMBER, THIS WAS BACK WHEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO FEEL EMBARRASSMENT. LAUGH AND AT ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS, EVIDENTLY, COMEY WRITES THAT TRUMP SAID, "HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA, HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED WITH HOOKERS IN RUSSIA." ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) COMEY REPLIED: "I UNDERSTAND, MR. PRESIDENT, BUT I JUST ASKED WHAT YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST." ( LAUGHTER ) "NEVER PAID FOR BREAKFAST IN MY LIFE." COMEY ALSO DESCRIBED A DINNER HE HAD WITH TRUMP JUST AFTER THE INAUGURATION. WHEN HE WAS INVITED, COMEY ASSUMED OTHER PEOPLE WOULD BE ATTENDING, OF COURSE, BUT WHEN HE SHOWED UP, IT TURNED OUT TO BE JUST THE TWO OF THEM, SEATED AT A SMALL OVAL TABLE. OH, COME ON. THAT'S THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK! YOU INVITE YOUR F.B.I. DIRECTOR OVER FOR A MOVIE SAYING IT'S GOING TO BE A "GROUP THING, JUST THE TWO OF YOU. CAN'T MAKE NETFLIX WORK, SO YOU KNOW... ( APPLAUSE ) SO YOU OBSTRUCT JUSTICE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND JUST AS COMEY SUSPECTED, TRUMP DROPPED A BOMBSHELL. AT THE MEETING. "THE PRESIDENT SAID, 'I NEED LOYALTY. I EXPECT LOYALTY.' COMEY SAYS, "I DIDN'T MOVE, SPEAK, OR CHANGE MY FACIAL EXPRESSION IN ANY WAY DURING THE AWKWARD SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE DIDN'T MOVE. DEPARTMENT MOVE A MUSCLE. BASICALLY, COMEY TREATED TRUMP LIKE THE T. REX IN "JURASSIC PARK." IT MAKES SENSE. THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME-SIZED HANDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I CAN'T TEAR IT. WITH HANDS THAT SMALL, YOU CAN'T TEAR ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF IN THIS DOCUMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, TRUMP FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO THE SCANDAL AS "THE CLOUD," TELLING COMEY THAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WAS A "CLOUD" AND ASKING WHAT HE COULD DO TO "LIFT THE CLOUD." MR. PRESIDENT, THAT'S NOT A CLOUD. METEOROLOGISTS CALL THAT A (BLEEP) STORM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND-- IN THEIR FINAL CONVERSATION, IN THEIR FINAL CONVERSATION, COMEY WRITES TRUMP SAID, 'I HAVE BEEN VERY LOYAL TO YOU, VERY LOYAL. WE HAD THAT THING, YOU KNOW.' I DID NOT REPLY OR ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT BY 'THAT THING.'" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, ACCORDING TO COMEY'S TESTIMONY, "THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. OH, SO IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING. ( LAUGHTER ) TOMORROW, COMEY'S GOING TO SAY ALL OF THIS OUT LOUD AND SENATORS WILL GET TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS ABOUT IT FOR HOURS. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS. I'M PRETTY EXCITED. YOU KNOW WHO'S NOT EXCITED? THANK YOU, CITIZEN. I'LL TELL YOU WHO IS NOT EXCITED. THE PRESIDENT. EVIDENTLY, THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS REALLY TAKING A TOLL ON TRUMP. ACCORDING TO ONE INSIDER, "HE NOW LIVES WITHIN HIMSELF, WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PLACE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BE. HE'S EMOTIONALLY WITHDRAWING. HE'S GAINED WEIGHT. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYBODY WHOM HE TRUSTS." OKAY, I KNOW WHAT THIS IS! I KNOW WHAT THIS IS. HE IS ENTERING HIS FAT GOTH PHASE. HE'LL GET OVER IT. HE'LL WORK THROUGH IT. WE ALL WORK THROUGH IT. ACCORDING TO AIDES, TRUMP IS "GLUED EVEN MORE THAN USUAL TO THE CABLE NEWS." EVEN MORE? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? IS HE HIDING BEHIND THE COUCH AT "FOX & FRIENDS"? ( LAUGHTER ) "WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? DON'T SAY THAT." BUT TRUMP ISN'T GOING TO TAKE COMEY'S TESTIMONY LYING DOWN. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY "HE'S KEEN TO BE A PARTICIPANT RATHER THAN JUST ANOTHER VIEWER, WHICH COULD INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING TO TWITTER TO OFFER ACERBIC COMMENTARY DURING THE HEARING." OH, TWEETING DURING THE HEARING! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE TWEETS! "DESPITE THIS SLANDEROUS TESTIVFEFE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT. MAKES AS MUCH SENSE. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. A SMALL GROUP OF US KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE TWEETING. ACCORDING TO TRUMP CONFIDANT AND GRUMPY MAYOR OF APPLETOWN, NEWT GINGRICH, "TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO LET SOME GUY LIKE THAT SMEAR HIM WITHOUT PUNCHING HIM AS HARD AS HE CAN." NOT THAT HARD, AGAIN, GIVEN THE SIZE OF HIS HANDS. BUT THE PUNCHING HAS ALREADY STARTED. A PRO-TRUMP ORGANIZATION-- AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE-- HAS MADE ATTACK AD AGAINST JAMES COMEY.
AS HEAD OF THE F.B.I., JAMES COMEY PUT POLITICS OVER PROTECTING AMERICA.
WHEN TERROR ATTACKS WERE ON THE RISE LAST YEAR, COMEY WAS CONSUMED WITH ELECTION MEDDLING.
JAMES COMEY: JUST ANOTHER D.C. INSIDER ONLY IN IT FOR HIMSELF. PAID FOR BY GREAT AMERICA ALLIANCE.
Stephen: AS MAHATMA GANDHI ONCE SAID, "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!" ( LAUGHTER ) IN CASE YOU'RE KEEPING TRACK OF NORMS THAT HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, THIS IS A BIG ONE-- THOUGH IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT, BECAUSE WE SEE ATTACK ADS ALL THE TIME. BUT NORMALLY THEY'RE AGAINST PEOPLE RUNNING FOR SOMETHING. COMEY IS NOW A PRIVATE CITIZEN, CALLED TO TESTIFY. YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAKE AN ATTACK AD ABOUT ONE OF MY AUDIENCE MEMBERS OUT HERE. LIKE THIS GUY: AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER, THIS GUY PUT HIS VIEWING EXPERIENCE OVER PROTECTING AMERICA. EVER SINCE TAKING HIS SEAT, HE'S JUST BEEN LAUGHING WHILE DOING NOTHING TO COMBAT TERROR. ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.
SOME SAY THIS GUY IS A GOOD AUDIENCE MEMBER. BUT WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT HIM? I KNOW I DON'T TRUST HIM AROUND MY BABY.
Stephen: NEITHER DO I. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THIS GUY: WRONG FOR SEAT 12. WRONG FOR AMERICA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. TILDA SWINTON IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, WE'RE GOING TO DO ANOTHER MONOLOGUE. MORE CHAOS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK! JON TABEAST AND STAY HUMAN, RIGHT THERE. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! LOOKING NICE. YOU'RE LOOKING NICE. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE VERY KIND. I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT. THE LIKE THE POPLIN FOR THE SUMMERTIME, JON. IT'S VERY ATTICUS FINCH. I WAS TALKING ABOUT COMEY'S TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE TOMORROW BEFORE I WAS SO RUDELY INTERRUPTED BY THE SPONSORS WHO PAY OUR SALARIES HERE. BUT WE'RE LEARNING SOME TELLING DETAILS ABOUT THE FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR'S INTERACTIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT. FOR INSTANCE, TRUMP'S PRESSURE TO DROP THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION MADE COMEY SO UNCOMFORTABLE, HE TOLD ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS, "DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH TRUMP." ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. WHICH IS A PHRASE YOU NORMALLY HEAR BACKSTAGE AT THE "MISS USA PAGEANT." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND COMEY ISN'T THE ONLY ONE IN DONALD TRUMP'S SIGHTS. JEFF SESSIONS HAS BEEN ON HIS NAUGHTY LIST SINCE ATTORNEY GENERAL RECUSED HIMSELF FROM THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. IN FACT, IT CAME OUT TODAY THAT SESSIONS RECENTLY OFFERED TO RESIGN, TELLING PRESIDENT TRUMP HE NEEDED THE FREEDOM TO DO HIS JOB. HIS JOB, YES, WHICH LOOKING AT HIM, IS BAKING COOKIES IN AN OLD OAK TREE. "I OFFER MY RESIGNATION. I CAN'T HAVE YOU LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER WHEN I AM FROSTING THOSE WAIVERS. ME AND MY ELVES ARE LEAVING!" ( LAUGHTER ) SESSIONS OFFERED TO RESIGN. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. BACK LAST FEBRUARY, HE WAS THE FIRST SENATOR TO ENDORSE TRUMP. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS LEAKED COPY OF HIS RESIGNATION AND IT CAN'T BE EASY FOR A LETTER. "MY DEAREST DONALD, IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART AND HOLLOWED BIRD-LINE BONES THAT I SUBMIT THIS, MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION. TOGETHER ON THE PORCH IN BIRMINGHAM, SING SWEET TEA WITH OUR SECRET FRIEND SERGEY KISLYAK. SHHH! I'VE SAID TOO MUCH. BUT THAT DREAM IS NOW BURIED. I BID YOU FAREWELL AND REQUEST MY SEVERANCE PAY IN GRITS AND RECENTLY-REMOVED STATUES OF CONFEDERATE GENERALS. ETERNALLY YOURS, JEFFERSON BEAUREGARD "ORIGINAL RECIPE" SESSIONS III. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TILDA SWINTON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ICON OF FILM AND FASHION WHO CURRENTLY STARS IN THE NEW FILM "OKJA." PLEASE WELCOME TILDA SWINTON! THANK YOU SO MUCH. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE. THANK YOU.
WOW.
Stephen: I MISS-- I MISREAD THE KISS OVER THERE. MY APOLOGIES.
TWO. EUROPEAN. YOU SEE, I'M SCOTTISH.
Stephen: ON BOTH SIDES. I NEVER KNOW. AND HERE'S THE THING ABOUT YOU IS THAT I DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE EUROPEAN.
YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT ACTRESS. YOUR VOCAL COMMAND IS AMAZING.
REALLY.
Stephen: MICHAEL CLAYTON, BURN AFTER READING, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, TRAIN WRECK, DR. STRANGE. NEW YORK LAWYER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A COUPLE OF ETERNAL BEINGS IN THERE. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE, LIKE-- HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE STRUCK THE ACCENT JUST RIGHT?
OH, I NEVER DO. I MEAN, YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP PLOWING ON AND YOU HOPE YOUR FRIENDS WILL TELL YOU AND YOU DON'T SEE THE MOVIE. THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT THING.
Stephen: DO YOU NOT SEE YOUR OWN STUFF?
YEAH, I DO, AND THEN I DON'T, AND THEN I FORGET, AND THEN I MOVE ON.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU DO THE FORGETTING PART?
OH, THAT'S SO EASY AT MY AGE, STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M REALLY ANCIENT, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, I SAW "DOCTOR STRANGE." YOU'RE AN ANCIENT ONE. I JUST WANT TO GET OUT, FAN-LIKE RIGHT NOW, I THINK ONE OF THE GREATEST PERFORMANCES I HAVE SEEN FROM YOU OR ANYONE IS YOUR CHARACTER FROM "MICHAEL CLAYTON."
OH, THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOUR NO MORAL COMP PASS LAWYER TRAPPED IN THAT MOMENT.
WELL, THAT WAS A PART WRITTEN BY TONY GILLROY, JUST BEYOND ANY PART. HE NOTICED, WHICH I LOVE, THOSE BAD GUYS, THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD. THEY THINK THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY GOOD. SHE THINKS SHE'S SUCH A GOOD PERSON. AND SHE'S SERVING THE BIG DADDY, AND SHE'S WRONG.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN ACTING? SOME PEOPLE ARE GREATLY INSPIRED BY A SINGLE PERSON. THEY SAY, "I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON." COMEDIANS, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I SAID,"I WANT TO GET THAT PERSON'S VOICE. I WANT TO DO THAT." WAS THERE SOMEONE LIKE THAT FOR YOU?
I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR. I STILL REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE AN ACTOR. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: I HAVE SOME TERRIBLE NEWS.
I'M JUST DISTRACTED. I HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED FOR 30 YEARS. THE BEST PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE AN INSPIRATION FOR ME IS A DONKEY IN A GREAT FILM BY ROBERT BLESSON. AND I'M NOT JOKING, ACTUALLY. IT'S THE BEST --
Stephen: A LIVE DONKEY.
PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE OF THEM BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO SWAP THEM OUT, LIKE TWINS FOR BABIES.
Stephen: RIGHT, LIKE THE OLSEN TWINS.
NO, THE --
Stephen: THEY'RE TWINS.
I KNOW, BUT THEY WEREN'T SWAPPED OUT.
Stephen: THEY WERE. THERE WAS ONLY ONE OF THEM AND THEY SWAPPED THEM OUT. I'M NOT JOKING. YOU DID NOT WATCH "FULL HOUSE." I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BREAK IT TO YOU.
I'M WRITING IT DOWN.
Stephen: SO A DONKEY INSPIRED YOU?
A DONKEY INSPIRED ME BECAUSE YOU JUST CAN'T STOP LOOK AT THE DONKEY AND THERE ARE ALL THE HUMANS AROUND AND YOU GO, "GET OUT OF THE WAY. I WANT TO LOOK AT THE DONKEY."
Stephen: I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY'RE SO NATURAL. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU IN A MOVIE, YOU'RE THINKING, "HOW WOULD A DONKEY DO THIS PART?" ( LAUGHTER ) HOW DO YOUR DIRECTORS FEEL ABOUT THAT? BECAUSE YOU-- YOU DON'T HAVE CLASSICAL TRAINING--
IT'S A SECRET. I'M NOT TELLING ANYBODY THIS. IT'S JUST BETWEEN US.
Stephen: WE'LL CUT OFF THE CAMERAS. WE'LL EDIT THIS PART OUT. YOU ARE SOMETHING OF A FASHION ICON. YOU HAVE DONE ART INSTALLATION PIECES. YOU WENT AND PUBLICLY NAPPED AT MOMA, RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, YOU'RE VERY COOL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE VERY COOL. YOU LOOK COOL. YOU DO COOL THINGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I LIKE TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF PEOPLE WHO I THINK ARE EXTRAORDINARILY COOL. I ASKED THIS QUESTION OF DAVID BIRN-- IS IT A BURDEN TO BE SO COOL?
TO BE SO COOL.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE ORDINARY IN ANY WAY, PEOPLE GO, "NOT AS COOL AS I THOUGHT."
I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A BUTTERFLY NET AND YOU'RE COMING AT ME AND I'M BACK OFF.
Stephen: I DON'T MEAN CRAZY. A LITTLE ECCENTRIC, MAYBE.
MAYBE.
Stephen: IS THERE PRESSURE TO BE ARTIE?
NO, I MEAN, HOW CAN I ANSWER THAT? I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND THE SECRET OF HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE-- LIKE WHAT DID YOU-- WHAT'S THE LEAST-- WHAT'S THE MOST LOW-BORO THING YOU'VE DONE RECENTLY? YOU SEEM VERY ARTIE, VERY HIGH-BROW. WHAT'S THE MOST COMMONUE KNOW, COMMON MAN LOW-BRIE THING YOU HAVE DONE?
WHERE DO I START? I LIVE IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND. THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I WAS WASHING MY DOGS WHO HAD ROLLED IN A DEAD SEAL ON THE BEACH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THEY ROLLED IN A DEAD SEAL.
AND I COME TO MANHATTAN AND IT'S ALL VERY SPARKLY AND I GET A VELVET JACKET AND SIT DOWN WITH YOU. THIS IS HIGH-BROW FOR ME. BELIEVE ME, WHERE I LIVE, IT'S UNDERGROUND LOW.
Stephen: I BET THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND STILL SEEMS COOL, SEEMS KIND OF COOL. IT'S NOT THE LOW-LANDS OF SCOTTLAND. IT'S THE HIGH-LANDS" OF SCOTT LANT.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: I WAS IN THE HIGHLANDS OF NEW JERSEY YESTERDAY PICK UP MY DRY CLEANING. SO YOU STILL LIVE-- YOU'RE NOT FROM SCOTLAND, THOUGH, YOU'RE FROM LONDON?
I'M FROM THE LOWLANDS, BUT I THEN MOVED TO THE HIGH LANDS.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? I MADE A JOKE BUT I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?
YOU HAVE BEEN.
Stephen: I HAD DRIVEN AS FAR NORTH ONCE WHEN I WAS 22, JUST ABOVE LOCH NESS, ACTUALLY, INVERNESS.
THAT'S MORE OR LESS WHERE I LIVE AND THERE'S MORE TO GO AS WELL.
Stephen: IT GETS NARROW UP THERE.
AND NOT MANY ROADS. BUT IT'S QUITE A SMALL COUNTRY, SCOTLAND, BUT LIKE LOTS OF LITTLE COUNTRIES IT'S HOPPING WITH STUFF.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT SNAF OFF FROM THE U.K., BECAUSE THERE'S TALK IT MIGHT SNAP OFF LEAK A GRAHAM CRACKER AND GO TO EUROPE.
THE REALITY IS WE'RE IN EUROPE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ?AI EUROPE. AND THE OTHER REALITY IS WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY. IT'S JUST ENGLAND THAT ISN'T.
Stephen: OH, WOW, WOW. THROWING SOME SHADE. THROWING SOME SHADE. SHADE ENGLAND, AFTER 800 YEARS.
I'M JUST BEING ACCURATE. I LIVE NAY VILLAGE-- I SAY "VILLAGE." IN SCOTLAND WE TALL IT A TOWN BUT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS IT'S NOT SUPER-SIZED. NERN. THEY SAY IT'S THE FASTEST TOWN IN SCOTLAND, NEEERN! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE.
YES.
Stephen: THE SAME DIRECTOR WHO DID "SNOW PIECER."
AND "THE HOST" AND "MEMORIES OF MURDER" AND MOTHER."
Stephen: IT'S CALLED "OKJA." AND WHAT IS THE MOVIE ABOUT?
IT'S A LOVE STORY BETWEEN A YOUNG GIRL AND HER BEST FRIEND WHO IS A MASSIVE PIG, THE SIZE OF A-- AN ELEPHANT.
Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR CHARACTER PLAYS THE-- THE BIOENGINEERING SORT OF FARM CONGLOMERATE OWNER WHO CREATED THIS PIG?
YES. IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FOOD INDUSTRY.
AND PLAY THE HEIR, TO A REALLY SCARY DYNASTY WITH A HIDEOUS TOXIC PAST, AND I'VE DECIDED TO MAKE IT ALL SEXY AND MODERN AND WOKE. AND SO-- ( LAUGHTER ) I DECIDE TO FEED THE WORLD BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE WORLD'S HUNGRY AND NO ONE'S FEEDING THE WORLD. SO I CREATE GENETICALLY MODIFY-- I SAY THAT WE SECRETLY DISCOVERED THIS PIGLET ON A FARM IN CHILE, AND IT'S ALL TERRIBLY NATURAL AND ORGANIC, BUT WE GENETICALLY MODIFY A MASSIVE PIG TO FEED THE WORLD AND HOLD THE COMPETITION TO SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIG. AND IT ALL GOES BADLY WRONG.
Stephen: AND IT ALL GOES BAD AND IN THIS NEXT CLIP, I BELIEVE, YOU'RE UPSET.
I'M UPSET BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN BAD P.R., AND P.R., AS WE KNOW, IS THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING.
THE SYNTHESIS OF OLD MIRANDO, AND NEW MIRANDO WAS IMPECCABLE. I TOOK NATURE AND SCIENCE, AND I SYNTHESIZED, AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SAID ABOUT OUR SUPER PIGS? LUCY MIRANDO IS PULLING OFF THE IMPOSSIBLE. SHE IS MAKE US FALL IN LOVE WITH A CREATURE THAT WE ARE ALREADY LOOKING FORWARD TO EATING. I MEAN, THESE ARE JOURNALISTS WHO NEVER WRITE ABOUT PIGS. THEY NEVER WRITE ABOUT PIGS! THEY WROTE ABOUT OUR PIGS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND IT'S DELICIOUS, RIGHT?
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.
Stephen: "OKJA."
"OKJA." AND IT'S GOING TO BE ON NETFLIX.
Stephen: IT PREMIERES ON NETFLIX, IN FACT, AND IN SELECT THEATERS ON JUNE 28.
GOT TO SEE IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TILDA.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OUR FRIEND ANDY COHEN. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, INFORMATION, OH, KIDS. OH, KIDS. YOU KNOW MY GUEST AS THE HOST OF WHAT HAPPENS LIVE WITH ANDY COHEN." PLEASE WELCOME THE ALWAYS-LIVELY ANDY COHEN! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING WITH ALL THE THINGS YOU DO. YOU SQUEEZED US INTO YOUR SCHEDULE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, YOU'RE AN OPEN BOOK.
I AM AN OPEN BOOK. T.M.I.
Stephen: YOUR BOOK "SUPERFICIAL:  MORE ADVENTURES FROM THE ANDY COHEN DIARIES" JUST CAME OUT IN SOFTBACK TODAY.
YESTERDAY, PAPERBACK. A GREAT BEACH READ.
Stephen: GREAT BEACH READ BECAUSE IF IT GETS WET, YOU CAN RING IT OUT. IT'S FANTASTIC.
THAT'S NOT WHY IT'S A GREAT BEACH READ.
Stephen: ARE YOU STILL KEEPING A DIARY?
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT. THAT'S TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE, AND IT BECAME EXISTENTIALLY EXHAUSTING.
Stephen:  DID YOU ONLY DIARY FOR THOSE TWO YEARS.
I DID IT BEFORE THAT. IT WAS MY SECOND BOOK OF DIARY. I HAD THE OCCASION TO HAVE TEA WITH THE QUEEN OF SOUL LAST MONTH, ARETHA FRANKLIN, AND I WAS LIKE, I THINK I MIGHT NEED TO START WRITING ANOTHER BOOK. I DID WRITE THAT DOWN. SHE SUMMONED ME TO TEA.
Stephen: I HAVE NEVER BEEN INVITED TO TEA WITH ARETHA FRANKLIN OR RUTH BARED GINSBURG, OR ANYONE.
I THINK HE WANTED TO PRIME ME FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE "ATLANTA HOUSEWIVES" IF TRUTH BE TOLD.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?
WELL, I THOUGHT SHE WANTED TO COLLABORATE WITH ME ON SOMETHING. YES.
Stephen: DO A DUET?
THE AMAZING THING WAS AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION-- WE HUNG OUT ABOUT 40 MINUTES-- AND SHE SAID, "LET ME GET YOUR NUMBER." AND I SAID, "GREAT." AND SHE PUT MY NUMBER IN HER PHONE AS, "MR. COHEN/HOUSEWIVES." WHICH WAS SO GREAT. IF I MET YOU AT A BAR AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN, THIS GUY. LET ME GET YOUR NUMBER." I WOULD PUT, LIKE, "STEPHEN WASPY SOUTHERNER." SO I'M "MR. COHEN/HOUSEWIVES TO ARETHA FRANKLIN. I LIKE IT, WHEN SHE BOOTY TEXTS ME LATER. YEAH.
Stephen: AN DIERK YOU UP?
YEAH, RIGHT, EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU PRODUCE-- HOW MANY SHOWS D DO YOU PRODUCE?
A LOT. A LOT OF HOUSEWIVES. I'M AN E.P. ON "LOVE CONNECTION" ON FOX.
Stephen: WHICH YOU'RE THE HOST OF. NOT POLITICALLY, BUT JUST AS A PRODUCER OF REALITY TELEVISION.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PRODUCTION THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT AS A DRAMA?
WELL, I THINK-- WELL, IT'S SOME KIND OF A DRAMA. AND I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT IS THAT HE'S-- HIS RE-- HAS REMAINED AS A SEASON ONE "REAL HOUSEWIFE ORANGE COUNTY." SHE HAS NEVER-- USUALLY THEY EVOLVE AS THE YEARS AGO. THERE'S A SEASON ONE VERSION WHO WILL DO ANYTHING TO STAY ON THE SHOW. AND THEN THEY EVOLVE, AND THEY GET THEIR MAKEUP AND HAIR RIGHT. AND WE SAY, "LOOK, YOU HAVE TO WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON TWITTER. YOU'RE BEING CRAZY ON TWITTER." SEASON TWO, THEY'RE BETTER. HE'S STUCK IN THE SEASON ONE "HOUSEWIFE" MODE AND HAS A REAL "HOUSEWIFE TAG LINE."
Stephen: HOLD OWAIT.
HE CAME UP WITH-- HE HAS MANY, BUT HE CAME UP WITH A TAG LINE IN THE INTERVIEW HE DID WITH "TIME" MAGAZINE ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO. AND IT WAS-- I CAN STAND AND DO IT?
Stephen: SURE.
IT WAS... "THINGS CAN'T BE THAT BAD. I'M PRESIDENT, AND YOU'RE NOT." ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THAT'S A GOOD TAG LINE.
Stephen: THAT'S A TAG FOR THE PROMO RIGHT THERE. I WOULD WATCH THAT SHOW. AND I DO.
YES.
Stephen: AND I DO WATCH THAT SHOW.
WE ALL DO.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT HE NEEDS? HE NEEDS AN ANDY COHEN UPON.
YEAH.
Stephen: GO STRAIGHTEN THAT PLACE OUT.
JUST WHAT I WANT TO DO ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OKAY, YOU, I FOUND OUT TODAY, YOU USED TO HOST THE "MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT."
I HOSTED A FEW PAGEANT FOR HIM.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
IT WAS-- IT WAS FINE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT CAME TO THE POINT-- NO, I ACTUALLY LOVED HOSTING THE PAGEANT.
Stephen: DID HE EVER COME INTO YOUR DRESSING ROOM BACKSTAGE?
LIGHT GROPING-- NO. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE BRINGING THE PAGEANT TO MOSCOW, MISS UNIVERSE... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT'S DOSSIER, RIGHT?
RIGHT. AND I E-MAILED THE HEADLINE OF THE ORGANIZATION, AND I SAID, "LISTEN, YOU REALIZE THAT ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVEED IN THE PAGEANT WHO AREN'T THE WOMEN ARE DAY OF GAY DUDES. AND YOU ARE BRINGING ALL THESE GAY GUYS TO RUSSIA WHERE PUTIN HAD JUST PASSED A LOT OF ANTIGAY LEGISLATION. I SAID, "I THINK THIS IS WRONG, AND I THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER, AND FOR ME TO HOST THE SHOW AND DIE TRAVELOGUE ABOUT HOW GREAT MOSCOW IS, THAT SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD." AND SO THEY DIDN'T MOVE IT. AND I SAID, "OKAY I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT." AND WORD GOT OUT NAI WAS NOT GOING TO DO IF AND BOYCOTTING THIS PAGEANT. HE CALLED THE "POST" AND SAID, "WE NEVER OFFERED HIM THE JOB."
Stephen: OH... WHAT A TOOL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW I KNOW WHY IT WAS SO URGENT TO DO THE PAGEANT IN MOSCOW.
Stephen: GOTTA GET OVER THERE.
I KNOW.
Stephen: "LOVE CONNECTION," LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. THE CHUCK WOOLRY CLASSIC FROM 1983.
YES.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOW THE HOST OF "LOVE CONNECTION." ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT IT?
SO MUCH. WE HAVE THEM RATE EACH OTHER'S LOOKS BASED ON FIRST IMPRESSIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DATE AND I REVEAL THE SCORES.
Stephen: TO EACH OTHER AT THE END?
YES, IT'S AMAZING, YEAH, IT'S AMAZING.
Stephen:  DO THE SCORES GO UP OR DOWN?
NO, IT WOULD BE-- USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER, AND THEY EITHER STAND BY THEIR SCORE OR THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I GAVE YOU A THREE, BUT AS IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE A GREAT PERSON AND NOW I THINK YOU'RE A 10." THAT'S KIND OF THE GOAL.
Stephen: SURE. ( LAUGHTER ).
AND THEN, ALSO, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LOVER MONEY TWIST AT THE END OF EVERY EPISODE.
Stephen: LOVE OR MONEY?
YEAH, IF THE AUDIENCE PICKS SOMEONE DIFFERENT THAN MY LOVE CONNECTION AND THEY'RE STANDING OVER THERE, I CAN GO ON A SEXY OVERNIGHT DATE WITH MY LOVE CONNECTION, STEPHEN, OR I CAN CHOOSE THE AUDIENCE PICK AND GET $10,000.
Stephen: SO IF I LIKE SANDRA BUT THE AUDIENCE PICKED SARAH.
YES.
Stephen: WAIT ARE, SANDRA AND SARAH THERE?
YES.
Stephen: AND THEY KNOW--
YES.
Stephen: SANDRA KNOWS I PICKED SANDRA, BUT HOW MUCH MONEY?
10 GRAND.
Stephen: THAT'S A LOT OF GREEN, BABY DOLL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND $10,000 IF I GO, "NO SANDRA, YES, SARAH.
YES.
Stephen: BUT THEN SARAH KNOWS SHE WASN'T MY CHOICE AND I'M ONLY DOING IT FOR THE CASH.
I KNOW!
Stephen: I'LL WATCH IT.

Stephen: YOU HAVE A TOUGH GIG. CORRESPONDENT FOR "THE DAILY SHOW."
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
Stephen: NO, NO. IT IS-- IT IS A-- IT IS A CAREER DEAD END.
IT IS. YOU JUST STOP.
Stephen: BUT NOW YOU'RE GETTING OUT THEREOF. YOU'RE SHAKING THE DUST TO THAT PLACE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET-- YOU'RE GETTING THE SLOT ON COMEDY CENTRAL AT 11:30 AFTER "THE DAILY SHOW."
THE JORDAN KLEPPER SLOT.
Stephen: EXACTLY, EXACTLY. THAT'S WHAT --
Stephen: THAT'S A TOUGH RADIO TO HOE RIGHT THERE. THEY CALL THAT "DEAD MAN'S CURVE."
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S HAUNTED, YOU KNOW?
REALLY.
Stephen: WE HAD HASAN MINHAJ ON HERE LAST NIGHT, AND HE-- EVERY CORRESPONDENT HAZE NIGHTMARE STORY OF THE FIELD PIECE YOU GET SENT OUT. YOU GET SENT OUT WITH AN IDEA, AND YOU'VE GOT TO BRING THE STORY BACK. AND SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO YOU WOULDN'T ORDINARILY SPEND TIME WITH.
YEAH, YOU GO OUT INTO A WORLD THAT YOU MIGHT NOT NORMALLY BE A PART OF.
Stephen: YEAH.
I WENT TO A LOT OF TRUMP RALLIES OVER THIS PAST ELECTION CYCLE.
Stephen: YEAH.
DONALD TRUMP, HE BASEMENT PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I WOULD TALK TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE AT THE RALLIES. IT ACTUALLY WAS FASCINATING TO GO OVER THE COURSE OF THAT YEAR. THEY-- THEY SHIFTED. I MEAN, I WOULD SAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT, THEY FELT LIKE CAMPAIGN RALLIES, A LITTLE BIT MORE... GOING ON. I WOULD ASK SOMETHING BLET'S SAY, "WAS BARACK OBAMA A MUSLIM?" AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I WOULD SAY ONE OUT OF 10 PEOPLE WOULD COP TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NEAR THE END THAT WAS SO NORMALIZED, THAT WAS PROBABLY A SEVEN OUT OF 10. AND THE IDEA OF SOME SORT OF FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY GOING ON WAS PREVALENT EVERYWHERE. AND WE WERE THE FAKE NEWS. I MEAN, THEY WERE RIGHT ABOUT US. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU'RE PART THE OF THE PROBLEM.
PART OF THE PROBLEM. WE FOUND OURSELVES INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AT ONE OF THE LAST TRUMP RALLIES WE WERE ADDAT. THERE WAS A GROUP HANGING OUT BEHIND THE CAMERAMAN, AND THEY WERE SNICKERING, AND WE WERE LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON. THE CAMERAMAN SAID,"THEY'RE LOOK AT THE BATTERY PACK." AND IT SAID L.V.C., WHICH IS THE NAME OF THE RENTAL COMPANY. AND THEY SAID IT'S A NAME OF THE SECT OF THE F.B.I. AND WE'RE WORKING FOR HILLARY CLINTON. AND THAT WAS JUST THE GENERAL VIBE BY THE EDGED. IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING-- IT'S NOT AS IT SEEMS ANYMORE. EVERYTHING IS AN ATTACK ON WHAT THEY HOLD DEAR.
Stephen: YOU'RE FROM MICHIGAN RIGHT?
KALAMAZOO.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE LIKE TO HAVE A FEW PEOPLE FROM THE HOME TOWN OF EVERY GUEST.
YES, I APPRECIATE THAT.
Stephen: WE HAD SOME PEOPLE FROM NERN EARLIER. IT'S A FUNNY SOUNDING TOWN, KALAMAZOO. WHAT GOT YOU INTO COMEDY? WAS IT BECAUSE YOUR TOWN ITSELF WAS FUNNY? WHAT INSPIRED YOU.
THE MATO OF KALAMAZOO IS, "YES, THERE REALLY IS A KALAMAZOO."
Stephen: YOU'RE KIDDING?
NO, THAT'S LITERALLY ON ALL OF THE T-SHIRTS.
Stephen: WOW.
IT'S DEFENSIVE RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
Stephen: THAT IS SELF-LOATHING AT A LEVEL I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A TOWN. "WELCOME TO CLEVELAND-- NO, WAIT!"
LET ME FINISH!
Stephen: "JORDAN KLEPPER SOLVES GUNS," DO YOU SOLVE GUNS?
I COME REAL CLOSE. I'M HOPING FOR THE SEQUEL.
Stephen: YOU WENT OUT THERE TALKING WITH PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE GUN DEBATE?
BOTH SIDES OF THE GUN DEBATE.
Stephen: IS THERE REASON FOR HOPE? IT IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION.
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF "THE DAILY SHOW" IS YOU GO OUT AND TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. I DID A BUNCH OF PIECES ON GUNS, AND I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY DID SHARE SAY COMMON POINT OF VIEW, AND THERE WAS COMMON GROUND ON BASIC STUFF THAT HAS BEEN OVERLY POLITICIZED ON BACKGROUND CHECKS, ON FUNDING, THINGS LIKE THAT. PEOPLE DID SHARE THE SAME POINT OF VIEW. IT GOT REALLY PARTISAN, IT GOT REALLY WIDE. AND I THOUGHT WITH SOME SPECIAL, LET'S TALK TO PEOPLEED  PEOPLEED MIDDLE AND MOST PEOPLE ARE IN THE MIDDLE. I WENT BACK TO MY HOME TOWN, MICHIGAN, BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE.
Stephen: IT'S LITERALLY MET MIDDLE.
IT'S CALLED THE MIDWEST, BUT YOU TAKE AWAY THE "WEST" AND IT'S BASICALLY THE MIDDLE. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AGAINST THE POLITICAL MACHINE TO TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF I DIDN'T SOLVE IT, I AT LEAST FELT BETTER THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WERE TRYING.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET THEM NEXT TIME. JORDAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. "JORDAN KLEPPER SOLVES GUNS" IS ON COMEDY CENTRAL JUNE 11. JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE JOHN MULANEY, RICHARD BRANSON, AND MUSICAL GUEST, HALSEY. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN IN LONDON WITH HIS GUESTS TOM CRUISE, JENNIFER HUDSON, AND RUSSELL BRAND. GOOD NIGHT!
