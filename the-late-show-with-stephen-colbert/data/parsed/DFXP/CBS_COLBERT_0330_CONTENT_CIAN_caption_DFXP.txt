INTRODUCING THE GALAXY S8. THEY SAID HOW CAN WE DESIGN A SMARTPHONE THAT WON'T CATCH ON FIRE? WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH WAS A SMARTER, MORE INTUITIVE PHONE THAT DOESN'T SET YOUR HAIR ABLAZE. THE GALAXY HAS BEEN OVERHAULED WITH REVOLUTIONARY NEW FEATURES -- LARGER SCREEN DISPLAY, BETTER CAMERA AND NO FIRE. BECAUSE AT SAMSUNG, WE THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE A PHONE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF HAVING YOUR HEAD MELT LIKE THE GUY IN INDIANA JONES. THE SAMSUNG GALAXY SA, IT WON'T SET YOUR HAIR ON FIRE. BUT IT WILL ATTRACT BEES! OH, THE BEES! OH, MY EYES, MY EYES!
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ALLISON JANNEY, SHERYL SANDBERG AND MUSICAL GUEST MARTY STUART, FUTURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! GREAT TIME. OH, MY GOODNESS! IT'S LOVELY TO BE HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S A HUGE WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP. ON SATURDAY, HE WILL REACH A HUNDRED DAYS IN OFFICE. BOY, IT SURE SEEMS LONGER ( LAUGHTER ) JIMMY, CAN I SEE WHAT I LOOKED LIKE ON INAUGURATION DAY. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I'VE REALLY GOT TO MOISTURIZE. THE FIRST 100 DAYS ARE A TIME TO REFLECT ON ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND TRUMP HASN'T GOT A LOT. HE STILL HASN'T FILLED HIS CABINET, HE DIDN'T REPEAL OBAMACARE, THERE ARE STILL MUSLIMS. BUT HE DID SIGN A LAW MAKING IT EASIER FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO BUY GUNS, AND FOR HIBERNATING BEARS TO BE HUNTED. SO HE TOOK CARE OF HIS BASE: INSANE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MURDER YOGI. OF COURSE, TRUMP THINKS THIS -- MURDER YOGI! YAY! ( APPLAUSE ) CAREFUL WHAT YOU APPLAUD FOR. OF COURSE, TRUMP THINKS THIS FIRST 100 DAYS THING IS UNFAIR, TWEETING: "NO MATTER HOW MUCH I ACCOMPLISH DURING THE RIDICULOUS STANDARD OF THE FIRST 100 DAYS, AND IT HAS BEEN A LOT-- INCLUDING S.C. -- MEDIA WILL KILL!" NOW, YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT "INCLUDING S.C." MEANS. WELL, IT COULD BE "SUPREME COURT," OR "SPICER CATASTROPHE," "SARAH CONNOR." I DON'T KNOW. OR MAYBE "STEPHEN COLBERT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GOTTA SAY, DONALD TRUMP'S DONE A LOT FOR ME IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, MR. PRESIDENT. NOW I FEEL DIRTY. ( LAUGHTER ) TO MARK HIS FIRST HUNDRED DAYS, TRUMP SAT DOWN FOR A WIDE-RAMBLING INTERVIEW WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. AND HE WAS ASKED: "AS A CANDIDATE, YOU PUT OUT A 100-DAY PLAN. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT PLAN?" AND HE ANSWERED: "SOMEBODY, YEAH, SOMEBODY PUT OUT THE CONCEPT OF A HUNDRED-DAY PLAN." YEAH, WHO WAS THAT AGAIN?
THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF MY ADMINISTRATION. THIS 100-DAY PLAN. WHAT FOLLOWS IS MY 100-DAY ACTION PLAN TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IT'S A CONTRACT BETWEEN DONALD J. TRUMP AND THE AMERICAN VOTER.
STEPHEN: THE "J" STANDS FOR "JUST KIDDING." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) PSYCH! JUST -- ( APPLAUSE ) BESIDES, THAT CONTRACT WOULD NEVER HOLD UP IN COURT, SINCE IT WAS SIGNED BY AN E.K.G. MACHINE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE THING THAT I NOTICED ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW IS THAT, IN A SIT-DOWN, ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION A LOT OF HIS ANSWERS WERE "UNINTELLIGIBLE." 16 TIMES. ARE THEY NOT ALLOWED A FOLLOW UP QUESTION? FOR INSTANCE, "HUH?" IT WAS STUFF LIKE THIS:
SECRETARY MNUCHIN IS A VERY TALENTED PERSON, VERY SMART. VERY SUCCESSFUL... (MUMBLES) I MEAN, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING MAJOR TAX REFORM. HERE'S PART OF YOUR STORY, IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG-- (MUMBLES) -- AND I SAY THIS TO PEOPLE-- I NEVER REALIZED HOW BIG IT WAS. EVERYTHING'S SO -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO 16 TIMES, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 16 UNINTELLIGIBLE. DOES HE JUST START TALKING WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HE'S GOING TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE? HE'S LIKE A THIRD GRADER FAKING HIS WAY THROUGH HIS BOOK REPORT. "AND ASLAN THE LION IS A VERY FAMOUS CHARACTER FROM "THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE." WHY IS WHY I BELIEVE HE REPRESENTS -- ( MUMBLING ) BUT IT IS A TECHNIQUE USED BY SOME OF OUR GREATEST ORATORS. LIKE JOHN F. KENNEDY:
STEPHEN: OF COURSE, THI --
ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU, ASK WHAT -- ( MUMBLING ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: OF COURSE, THIS FRIDAY, DAY 99, WE MAY HAVE A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IF CONGRESS DOESN'T PASS A BUDGET. AND TRUMP IS SO DESPERATE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR HIS FIRST 100 DAYS THAT HE THREW IN FUNDING FOR THE BORDER WALL. WHICH MAY KILL THE BILL AND MAKE THE UNITED STATES FINANCIALLY INSOLVENT. SO TRUMP REALLY IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY LIKE ONE OF HIS BUSINESSES. ( APPLAUSE ) DESPITE ESTIMATES THAT THE WALL WILL COST $25 BILLION, TRUMP WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A MORE COMPETITIVE BID, RIGHT OUT OF HIS ASS. ( LAUGHTER )
I THINK $10 BILLION OR LESS. AND IF I DO A SUPER-DUPER HIGHER, BETTER, BETTER SECURITY, EVERYTHING ELSE, MAYBE IT GOES A LITTLE BIT MORE.
STEPHEN: "SUPER-DUPER HIGHER BETTER BETTER." SOUNDS LIKE TRUMP IS EITHER BUILDING A WALL OR A BLANKET FORT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BAD HOMBRES, NO. NO. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT EVEN WITH ALL THOSE TREMENDOUS ADJECTIVES, TRUMP KNOWS THE WALL IS A TOUGH SELL. WHICH MIGHT BE WHY HE TWEETED: "EVENTUALLY, BUT AT A LATER DATE, SO WE CAN GET STARTED EARLY, MEXICO WILL BE PAYING, IN SOME FORM, FOR THE BADLY NEEDED BORDER WALL." "SO WE WILL BUILD THE WALL, OR NOT, STARTING TODAY, OR TOMORROW, WHEN TODAY WILL BE YESTERDAY, SO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: GET IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HE ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO PICK UP SOMETHING HOT WITH HIS WRISTS. LIKE THIS.
Jon: HOT POTATO. #.
Stephen: I NEVER THOUGHT TRUMP WOULD SEEM HESITANT ABOUT HIS WALL, BUT ALSO JUST THIS MORNING HE TWEETED: "THE WALL IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN STOPPING DRUGS FROM POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND POISONING OUR YOUTH-- AND MANY OTHERS! IF--" ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S IT. "IF "-- .
Jon: A CLIFFHANGER.
Stephen:.
Stephen: IT JUST CUTS OFF. NO TWEETS FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF. THEN THE NEXT TWEET IS NOT ABOUT THE WALL. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN THREE HOURS AFTER THE FIRST TWEET, HE FINISHES THE SENTENCE: "THE WALL IS NOT BUILT, WHICH IT WILL BE, THE DRUG SITUATION WILL NEVER BE FIXED THE WAY IT SHOULD BE! #BUILDTHEWALL" HOW IS HE GOING TO HASHTAG "BUILD THE WALL" WHEN IT TAKES HIM THREE HOURS TO HASHTAG "BUILD A SENTENCE?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNDERBUDGET, THOUGH. UNDERBUDGET. ( PIANO RIFF ) ♪ YEAH, YEAH YEAH ♪
Stephen: ALSO P IN THE SAME ASSOCIATED PRESS INTERVIEW, TRUMP CROWED ABOUT HIS BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT SO FAR: "I HAVE, SEEM TO GET VERY HIGH RATINGS. I DEFINITELY -- YOU KNOW CHRIS WALLACE HAD 9.2 MILLION PEOPLE, IT'S THE HIGHEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE SHOW. CBS 'FACE THE NATION' HOST JOHN DICKERSON HAD 5.2 MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S THE HIGHEST FOR 'FACE THE NATION SINCE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN. IT'S A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE.
Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, I KNOW YOU'RE PROUD OF YOUR RATINGS BUT IT'S NOT GENERALLY A GOOD THING TO COMPARE YOURSELF TO 9/11. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT E? MY FIRST HUNDRED DAYS HAVE BEEN HUGE, TITANIC. OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) WE'RE BLOWING UP, OKAY? BIGGER THAN ANYTHING SINCE NAGASAKI." NOTHING -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AGAIN, I'M MODELING THE BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER PERSON. H THIS IS ME SPEAKING. THIS IS THE HINT IT'S NOT ME. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE TITANIC JOKE WAS FINE! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ HOT POTATO ♪
Stephen: NOTHING MATTERS TO DONALD TRUMP MORE THAN RATINGS. WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED IF HE PLANNED TO FIRE EMBATTLED PRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER, HE SAID "I'M NOT FIRING SEAN SPICER, THAT GUY GETS GREAT RATINGS. EVERYONE TUNES IN." IT'S TRUE. YOU CAN'T TEAR YOUR EYES AWAY FROM SEAN SPICER-- IT'S LIKE WATCHING A CAR CRASH THAT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, BUT NAGASAKI, NO WAY! ( LAUGHTER ) NONE OF THIS IS GOING ON THE AIR AT THIS POINT! ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE HAD A GREAT RUN. THE PRESIDENT EVEN PROUDLY NOTED THAT HIS PRESS SECRETARY ATTRACTED NEARLY AS MANY VIEWERS AS A DAYTIME SOAP OPERA. OH, SEAN SPICER IS A SOAP OPERA. THAT EXPLAINS WHY HIS CHARACTER IS CONSTANTLY GETTING AMNESIA ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT EVEN THOUGH TRUMP BRINGS THE MEDIA BOFFO RATINGS, HE COMPLAINED TO THE A.P. THAT THEY REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A FAIR SHAKE.
I USED TO GET GREAT PRESS. I GET THE WORST PRESS. IT HAPPENED DURING THE PRIMARIES, AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WON, I SAID, "WELL THE ONE THING GOOD IS NOW I'LL GET GOOD PRESS." AND IT GOT WORSE. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS SO HANDY! THAT IS SO HANDY, THE "UNINTELLIGIBLE." ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO HIS STAFF HAS BEEN SHOWING HIM HAPPY COVERAGE. IF ROLLING BACK ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS GETS THE PRESIDENT MORE PRESS NATIONALLY THEY SHOW HIM A MORE POSITIVE HEADLINE, TRUMP SAVES COAL JOBS, SOMETIMES IN A LOCAL PAPER. SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO BE VERY LOCAL. MR. PRESIDENT, HERE'S A HEADLINE FROM THE KUSHNER FAMILY GAZETTE. GRANDPA MAKES CHRISTMAS TREE RATING FUND APPROVAL AMONG GRANDKIDS 65%! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU! ALLISON JANNEY IS HERE! WHEN WE RETURN, I'M TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE. VERY IMPORTANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND PANNED BAND, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. I'M GOING TO STAND HERE. I LIKE TO TELL THESE JOKES STANDING UP IF YOU DON'T MIND. DON'T ADJUST YOUR TVs AT HOME. THIS IS ALL PLANNED. I'M A HUGE FAN OF SPACE AND SCIENCE. THIS MORNING ASTRONAUT PEGGY WHITSON BECAME AN AMERICAN HERO, WHEN SHE BROKE A NASA RECORD, BY HITTING HER 534TH DAY IN SPACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS, PEGGY. HERE'S THE THING. AND BY THE TIME SHE RETURNS TO EARTH SHE WILL HAVE BEEN UP THERE FOR 666 DAYS. I'M NOT A SUPER STICIOUS MAN, BUT MAYBE COME BACK ONE DAY EARLY, ONE DAY LATE -- ( LAUGHTER ) YOU DON'T WANT TO SET ANY RECORDS FOR BIRTHING DEMON SPACE BABIES. NOT WORTH RISKING, IS WHAT I'M SAYING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TODAY, AFTER BREAKING THE RECORD, COMMANDER WHITSON RECEIVED A CALL FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP-- WHO SHOWED A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SPACE PROGRAM.
TELL ME, MARS, WHAT DO YOU SEE A TIMING FOR ACTUALLY SENDING HUMANS TO MARS? IS THERE A SCHEDULE AND WHEN WOULD YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING?
STEPHEN: "I'M ASKING FOR A FRIEND WHOSE WIFE WANTS TO GET FURTHER AWAY." ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT'S ROOM SERVICE LIKE ON MARS? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THERE WAS ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT REALLY SEEMED TO GRAB TRUMP'S ATTENTION.
WATER IS SUCH A PRECIOUS RESOURCE UP HERE THAT WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP OUR URINE AND MAKING IT DRINKABLE. AND IT'S REALLY NOT AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
STEPHEN: OH, I BET HE IS ( LAUGHTER ) ONCE IT'S DRINKABLE, YOU REALLY SAVE ON THE HOTEL DRY CLEANING ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) HONESTLY, THOUGH, I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE, TRUE STORY, THE MACHINE THAT PURIFIES URINE IN SPACE WAS ALMOST NAMED AFTER ME. BACK WHEN I WAS THE HOST OF A DIFFERENT SHOW, NASA HELD AN ONLINE CONTEST TO NAME A MODULE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND THEY WERE, I WANT TO SAY, DUMB ENOUGH TO MAKE IT AN OPEN CONTEST WHERE YOU COULD SUBMIT ANY NAME AND HAVE PEOPLE VOTE FOR IT SO I MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED TO VIEWERS THAT THEY SUBMIT MY NAME AND -- I WON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IT WAS REALLY FUN. ABSOLUTELY MURDERED 'EM. AND N.A.S.A., BECAUSE THEY ARE REASONABLE AND LIARS, SAID, "LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING TO NAME A MODULE AFTER YOU. BUT THERE ARE SOME NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT AREN'T NAMED YET-- ONE OF THEM IS A URINE FILTER. I SAID, WHAT'S THAT?
THEY SAY PEA IN A TUBE AND THEY CAN BRING IT UP THERE. I SAID, CAN YOU BRING SOME DOWN TO EARTH? WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO ON AIR IS HAVE A COCKTAIL OF BOURBON AND ASTRONAUT PE PEE ON MY SHOW BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST HEROIC THING I COULD IMAGINE. THEY SAID, NO. WOULD YOU LIKE A TREADMILL NAMED AFTER YOU? I SAID, I WOULD LOVE IT. I ASSUME, IN MY HONOR, THE ASTRONAUTS HANG THEY WET SONGS ON THE TREADMILL BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I DO WITH MINE. ANYWAY, CHEERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE. MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE PLANET, SATURDAY WAS "EARTH DAY," WHICH TRUMP ALREADY CELEBRATED BY CUTTING THE E.P.A.'S BUDGET BY 31%. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: NO, NO, IT'S FITTING. NEXT YEAR, EARTH DAY MIGHT BE A MEMORIAL SERVICE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HE WANTED TO ASSURE THE COUNTRY HE CARES, TWEETING: "I AM COMMITTED TO KEEPING OUR AIR AND WATER CLEAN BUT..." BUT? ( LAUGHTER ) NOTHING GOOD COMES AFTER "BUT." ESPECIALLY WHEN TRUMP SAYS IT. "DO YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN TO YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE?" "I DO, BUT..." HE CONTINUES, "ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH ENHANCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. JOBS MATTER!" OBVIOUSLY, JOBS MATTER. AND, OH, YEAH, ECONOMIC GROWTH ALWAYS ENHANCES THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S WHY GOD BUILT THE GARDEN OF EDEN NEXT TO THAT TIRE PLANT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TO CELEBRATE EARTH DAY, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS TOOK TO THE STREETS IN THE MARCH FOR SCIENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHICH IS A LOVELY IDEA. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO DO IT. I THOUGHT SCIENCE WAS ONE THING EVERYONE AGREES ON. IT'S LIKE HAVING THE MARCH FOR ORGASMS. ( LAUGHTER ) NO ONE COULD BE AGAINST THAT. WELL, MAYBE MIKE PENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ALLISON JANNEY. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK. MY FIRST GUEST IS A SEVEN-TIME EMMY AWARD WINNER WHO IS NOW STARRING ON BROADWAY IN "SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION." PLEASE WELCOME ALLISON JANNEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HI YA!
HI YA!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER, IT WAS HERE RIGHT BEFORE THE CONVENTIONS?
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE YESTERDAY. SO YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Stephen: I KNOW THE FEELING. HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION?
I'M HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE, YOU INHABITED THE GREATEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY OF ALL TIMES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I CAN'T THINK OF A CHARACTER I WOULD LIKE TO BE MORE LIKE AND AM NOTHING LIKE.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT LIKE C.J.?
NO, I WISH I COULD BE LIKE HER AND I FEEL SORRY ABOUT MR. SPICER. HE'S REMARKABLE BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS IN A STATE OF FIGHT AND FLIGHT AT THE SAME TIME.
Stephen: NOT EASY. THAT'S NOT EASY. ( LAUGHTER )
AND I HAD AARON IN MY COCKPIT AND HE'S NOT SOMEONE I'M SURE KNOWS HOW TO FLY A PLANE.
Stephen: OR A COCKPIT. OR A COCKPIT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET A REUNION OF THE WEST WING? WE'VE HAD THE GILMORE GIRLS.
WE'VE LITTLE REUNIONS OURSELVES NOT ON CAMERA BUT BEHIND CAMERA.
Stephen: CAN I GET INVITED TO ONE OF THOSE?
YES.
Stephen: STOP BY. I'M TRYING TO GET THEM TO COME SEE "SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION." SO I'LL LET YOU KNOW AND WE'LL GO OUT ON THE TOWN.
Stephen: HARTY SHEEN. AND RICHARD AND THEY'RE ALL FANTASTIC PEOPLE. I LOVE THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WILL MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
Stephen: YOU, I UNDERSTAND, HAVE A THEATER BACKGROUND FROM WAY BACK, YOU STUDIED THEATER AT CANYON COLLEGE.
YEAH, BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE I COULD DO. I HAD TO MAJOR IN PSYCHOLOGY AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH RATS. I COULD NOT DO IT. I COULDN'T DEAL WITH THE RAT LAB PART OF PSYCHOLOGY. SO I --
Stephen: CAN YOU -- GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
YOU'RE SO CUTE.
Stephen: YOU'RE CUTER. ( LAUGHTER )
SO I WENT INTO THE THEATER DEPARTMENT AND THEY BUILT THE NEW THEATER --
Stephen:ATES QUIET AREA. HAD FRIENDS THAT GO THERE, VERY QUIET.
BEAUTIFUL AREA OF THE COUNTRY AND THEY BUILT THIS BEAUTIFUL THEATER AND ONE OF THEIR VERY FAMOUS GRADUATES CAME BACK TO DIRECT THE FIRST PRODUCTION IN THAT THEATER AND WHO DO YOU THINK THAT WAS?
Stephen: ALLISON JANNEY. NO, PAUL NEWMAN.
Stephen: OH! WOW!
HE WENT BACK TO DIRECT THE FIRST PLAY AND I GOT MYSELF CAST IN THAT PLAY, BY HOOK OR CROOK.
Stephen: YOU GOT TO MEET HIM.
MEET HIM AND WORK WITH HIM. JOANNE WOODWARD WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING ME TO COME TO NEW YORK AND DO THEATER AT THE NEW YORK PLAY HOUSE. THEY STARTED MY --
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR AUDITION FOR PAUL NIEWMEN?
I BASICALLY TOLD -- YOU HAD TO GET UP AND TALK ON STAGE ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANTED AND I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO APPEAL TO HIS LOVE OF RACE CAR DRIVING, AND I HAD JUST GOTTEN -- I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT YEAR BUT I GOT A VOLKSWAGEN CHIRACO, AND I MADE UP THE STORY ABOUT IT BECAUSE I GREW UP IN DAYTON, OHIO, AND I SAID IT USUALLY TAKES TWO HOURS AND 50 MINUTES TO DRIVE TO CANYON BUT I CAN MAKE IT IN AN HOUR AND TEN WHEN THE COPS ARE NOT THERE AND I CAN PUNCH IT -- I MADE UP THE WHOLE STORY AND PROBABLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REASON I GOT THE PART BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK I CAT FISHED HIM INTO --
Stephen: YOU SEDUCED PAUL NEWMAN IS WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO TELL ME WITH YOUR LOVE OF VOLKSWAGENS.
NO, RACE CAR DRIVING!
Stephen: RACING. SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE DESCRIBING TRAFFIC. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL ASPECTS OF CAR. NOW, THE PLAY YOU'RE IN RIGHT HERE --
"SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION."
Stephen: A BEAUTIFUL PLAY. IT IS.
Stephen: THE ETH THE ETHEL BARRYMORE THEATER.
JOHN PLAYED DR. DRE, GORGEOUS PERFORMANCE. BEAUTIFUL ACTORS IN THIS PLAY, SUCH A TIMELY PIECE, FOR THOSE WHO SAW FIRST TIME, IT RESONATES EVEN MORE NOW. IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLAY, AND I'M SO HONORED TO BE A PART OF IT, AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO -- YOU HAVE TO COME SEE IT.
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TO. TELL ME WHEN MARTIN SHEEN IS GOING TO BE THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) I REALLY WANT TO GO SEE IT. THE PLAY IS FAMOUS FOR BEING BEAUTIFUL BUT ALSO THETITE APPROXIMATELY "SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION" HAS BECOME SORT OF A BIWORD IN A GAME.
YES.
Stephen: IN OUR CULTURE. THE IDEA BEING THAT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD, THERE ARE ONLY SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION BETWEEN YOU AND ANY OTHER PERSON SO WE'RE ALL CONNECTED.
YES, EXACTLY.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, FOR A SECOND. DO YOU HAVE SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION BETWEEN YOU AND THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD?
YES, I DO, ABSOLUTELY. I WAS CAST IN A WOODY ALLEN MOVIE CALLED SEE CELEBRITY "BACK WHEN, AND I HAD TO PLAY THIS REAL ESTATE AGENT AND WAS AT THIS BIG, FANCY PARTY -- I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE, BUT I WAS AT THIS PARTY, IT WAS, LIKE, 25 TABLES OF PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE FILMING MY SCENE AND MY CHARACTER HAS TO SAY, OH, YES, I'VE GOT A FABULOUS TRI-PLEX ON EAST 83r 83rd STREET, YOU MUST COME LOOK AT IT. I'M MAKING UP LINES, BUT WOODY ALLEN SAYS TRIPLEX OR TRI-PLEX (PRONOUNCING). (PRONOUNCING). I SAID, TRIPLEX. HE SAID, YOU BETTER FIND OUT. THE GIRL SAID, THAT MAN IN REAL ESTATE IS SITTING OVER THERE DOING A CAMEO, HE WAS FIVE TABLES OVER THERE ACROSS THIS HUGE ROOM, AND THERE WAS DONALD TRUMP. I SAID, WELL, I GUESS I'LL GO ASK DONALD TRUMP, AND I MARCHEDO OVER AND SAID, EXCUSE ME, MR. RUMP, I'M ALLISON JANNEY I'M PLAYING A SMALL PART OVER THERE AND HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE TRIPLEX -- WELL, YOU DO HIM BETTER THAN ME. I CAN'T DO HIM. HE SAYS I LIKE TRIPLEX (PRONOUNCING). SO I MARCHED OVER AND DID ANOTHER TAKE AND WOODY ALLEN CAME OVER AND SAID, WHICH IS IT? I SAID, MR. TRUMP SAID TRIPLEX (PRONOUNCING) SO WE'LL GO WITH THAT, AND HE STARTED WALKING AWAY AND I SAID, BUT I LIKE TRIPLEX (PRONOUNCING) BETTER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M MISSING MY WARMUPS BECAUSE I'M HERE WITH YOU.
Stephen: I DO VOCAL WARMUPS EVERY DAY. WHY DON'T WE DO THEM TOGETHER.
DO YOU KNOW GOOD ONES?
Stephen: I KEEP A LIST OF THEM DOWN HERE. I DO THIS BEFORE THE SHOW EVERY DAY. I CAME ON TO DO THESE FOR PEOPLE EARLIER IN THE SHOW. WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO? ( SPEAKING IN PHRASES )
Stephen: "LATE SHOW" WARMUPS.
OKAY. ( TRUMPET SOUND ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I HONESTLY FORGET WE ALWAYS PUT THAT HORN UP WHEN WE DO THIS. YOU DO THE FIRST ONE AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN MATCH THE SECOND ONE.
MILEY CYRUS SIDE-BOOB SIGHTING.  CYRUS SIDE SIGHTING.
Stephen: REINCE PRIEBUS RINSES HIS PREVIOUS. HAVE YOU SEEN HIS BRAND-NEW PENIS? ( LAUGHTER ) HAVE YOU, BY THE WAY? BEAUTIFUL. IT TAPERS. LOVELY.
LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
Stephen: DO THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS THE FINAL LATE SHOW VOCAL WARMUP. ALLISON JANNEY TOGETHER. BASHFUL CHAPS SHOE ASHLESS CHAPS. NOBODY'S HAASES ARE MEANT FOR THE MASSES 'TIS NOT WHAT BASHFUL CHAPS BELIEVE ASS TO BE. BOOM! ALLISON JANNEY, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SHERYL SANDBERG! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS FACEBOOK'S CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AND FOUNDER OF THE "LEAN IN" MOVEMENT. PLEASE WELCOME SHERYL SANDBERG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: WELL, WE LAST SPOKE WHEN YOU DEAD "LEAN IN" FOR -- WHEN YOU DID "LEAN IN" FOR GRADUATES IN 2014. SINCE THEN, YOU'VE EXPERIENCED GREAT LOSS. FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW, IN 2015, YOUR HUSBAND DAVE DIED SUDDENLY, AND YOU HAVE NOW WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED "OPTION B:  FACING ADVERSITY, BUILDING RESILIENCE AND FINDING JOY." THE BOOK TO A LARGE DEGREE IS ABOUT YOU COPING WITH YOUR LOSS AND TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT IT AND TO SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE AND TO LEARN OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES OF LOSS. WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SHARE THIS MOST PERSONAL OF EXPERIENCES?
WHEN I LOST DAVE SUDDENLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE UNIMAGINABLE, AND YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE LIVED IT TOO. I'M SURE OTHER PEOPLE HERE AS WELL. I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T GET THROUGH IT. I WAS WORRIED MY CHILDREN'S HAPPINESS WOULD BE DESTROYED IN THAT INSTANT WE LOST DAVE. SO I TURNED TO MY FRIEND AND WHO IS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND ASKED HIM HOW WE GET THROUGH IT. HE TAUGHT ME SOMETHING WHICH IS WE'RE NOT BORN WITH A FIXED AMOUNT OF RESILIENCE. IT'S LIKE A MUSCLE, WE CAN BUILD IT IN OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER. IN THIS BOOK, "OPTION B," WHEN WE LAUNCHED IT WAS OUR ATTEMPT TO SHARE WHAT WE LEARNED. MY HUSBAND DAVE WAS A REMARKABLE MAN. HE GAVE SO MUCH TO OTHER PEOPLE. I THINK MY HOPE IS THAT IF ANYONE CAN DO BETTER FACING ANY FORM OF ADVERSITY, IT HONORS THE LIFE THAT HE LED. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT TREMENDOUS GRIEF IS THAT IT'S OVERWHELMING, YOU KNOW. IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A BOOK WHERE SOMEONE SHOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO THROUGH GRIEF, THOUGH I ASSUME YOU'RE STILL IN IT BECAUSE IT NEVER REALLY LEAVES YOU. BUT WHEN YOU'RE STRUCK WITH TREMENDOUS LOSS, YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S NEVER GOING TO GET BETTER. DID YOU EVER FEEL AT ANYPOINT THAT I WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THIS MOMENT?
ABSOLUTELY. I WROTE A Facebook POST AT THE END OF THE JEWISH PERIOD OF MOURNING WHERE I WROTE, I WILL NEVER FEEL A REAL MOMENT OF JOY AGAIN. MY FRIEND TOLD ME NOT TO PUBLISH THAT, IT'S NOT TRUE. THE GRIEF IS STILL THERE, I DO MISS DAVE, BUT I HAVE MOMENTS OF JOY. A CUP OF COFFEE, MY KIDS GIVING YOU AN UNSOLICITED HUG, THE KIND YOU CONTINUE ASK FOR.
Stephen: DID YOU GET ANGRY. A LOT.
Stephen: AT? MY PILLOW. AT ANYONE.
Stephen: THE UNIVERSE, GOD? ALL OF IT. ALL OF IT. AND YOU STRUGGLE WITH THAT, WITH WHAT CAN YOU DO. I ALSO STRUGGLED WITH A REAL FEELING OF ISOLATION.
Stephen: MM-HMM. ALL OF THIS HARDSHIP, NOT JUST DEATH BUT CANCER, SOMEONE GOING TO JAIL, LOSING A JOB, IS IT USHERS THE THIS GINORMOUS ELEPHANT INTO THE ROOM AND PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
Stephen: PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, I THINK. IF YOU HAVE A DEATH IN THE FAMILY OR A TREMENDOUS LOSS OR IF YOU'RE UNDERGOING A GREAT ILLNESS, PEOPLE SOMETIMES DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY FOR FEAR YOU'RE BRINGING UP A SUBJECT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO SOMEONE WHO'S HAD A LOSS? WHAT CAN THEY DO?
I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I USED TO THINK IF SOMEONE WAS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING HARD IF I BROUGHT IT UP I WAS REMINDING THEM. YOU CAN'T REMIND ME DAVE WAS DIED. YOU KNOW THAT. I FELT MORE ISOLATED. YOU CAN SAY, I KNOW YOU'RE SUFFERING AND I'M HERE TO GO THROUGH WIT YOU. WE'RE GETTING THROUGH IT IS SO POWERFUL.
Stephen: MY EXPERIENCE WITH GRIEF HAS BEEN YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIX IT. YOU'RE A FIXER, YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO FIXING THINGS. YOU CAN ONLY EXPERIENCE IT, SO IT'S A POWERLESSNESS, IT'S LIKE BEING PULLED OUT WITH THE TIDE.
MY RABBI TOLD ME LEAN INTO THE SUCK.
Stephen: IS THAT FROM THE TALMUD? THAT WAS NOT MY TORAH PORTION.
LEAN INTO THE SUCK. NOT EXACTLY WHAT I MEANT WHEN I WROTE LEAN IN, BUT IT WAS GOOD ADVICE. WHEN I ACCEPTED THE GRIEF WILL COME AT INCONVENIENT TIMES, IT ACTUALLY PASSED FASTER BECAUSE I STOPPED FIGHTING IT.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU CAN'T, YOU KNOW. ONE TO HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND HARDEST LESSONS IN LIFE IS THAT EVERYONE SUFFERS, YET YOU HAVE TO FIND JOY EVEN IN THAT EXPERIENCE, AND IT MIGHT FOR ME JUST BE THE GRATITUDE THAT I AM HERE ABLE TO REMEMBER THAT PERSON.
AND THAT IS IT. THE GREATEST IRONY OF ME IS I COME OUT OF THIS YEARS LATER STILL MISSING DAVE, STILL SADDER, BUT I AM MORE GRATEFUL BECAUSE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME DAVE WOULDN'T GROW OLD. NEVER. MY COUSIN LAURA TURNED 50 TWO MONTHS AGO AND I CALLED AND SAID HAPPY BIRTHDAY. BUT I'M CALLING BECAUSE IN CASE YOU WOKE UP WITH THAT, OH, MY GOD, I'M 50 THING -- HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- THIS IS THE YEAR DAVE WON'T TURN 50. I WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER JOKE ABOUT GROWING OLD AGAIN BECAUSE IF WE GROW OLD WE ARE LUCKY. AND I KNOW THAT NOW. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU FOR WRITING THIS BOOK. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT GRIEF, AND SOME PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE SHARED WITH THEM, SO THEY KNOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF GREAT LOSS CAN BE JOY AND LOVE AND GRATITUDE FOR YOUR LIFE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "OPTION B" IS OUT NOW. SHERYL SANDBERG, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY MARTY STUART. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
