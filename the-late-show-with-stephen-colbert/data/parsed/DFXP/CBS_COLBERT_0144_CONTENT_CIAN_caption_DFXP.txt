TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ANTHONY ANDERSON EUGENE LEVY AND CATHERINE O'HARA AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY COLDPLAY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! Captioning sponsored by CBS ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY!
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: YOU TOUCHEDDED ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: CHRIS MARTIN, EVERYBODY. CHRIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAN. UNBELIEVABLE. SO BEAUTIFUL. CHRIS, THAT IS---- THAT GUY, HE JUST TOOK THAT THING-- THANK YOU. THANKS, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS )
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HE JUST TOOK THAT THING TO ANOTHER LEVEL.
Jon: MAN.
Stephen: ANOTHER LEVEL. UN, THERE'S GENIUS, AND THEN THERE'S CHRIS MARTIN. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HOW LUCKY AM I? I JUST GOT TO HANG OUT WITH CHRIS MARTIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE MY JOB, YOU KNOW, BUT LIKE MOST OF YOU, SOMETIMES IT CAN FEEL LIKE A GRIND. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, THE HEAVENS OPEN UP AND EVERYTHING JUST CLICKS. I'M GUESSING THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE FOR A DOCTOR ON SUNDAY, WHO TREATED A WOMAN WHO CAME IN WITH A SHARK ON HER ARM. HERE'S WHY IT'S GREAT FOR THE DOCTOR. IT DOESN'T EXACTLY TAKE. DR. HOUSE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG HERE. "WHAT DO YOU THINK, DOC?" "WELL, MY DIAGNOSE I GUESS YOU HAVE A CASE OF SHARK ON YOUR ARM. I'M GOING TO WRITE YOU A PRESCRIPTION FOR 'TAKE THE SHARK OFF YOUR ARM.' THAT'LL BE $500. AND, I'M SORRY, THE SHARK'S OUT OF NETWORK." SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT BITE-- DONALD TRUMP. HOW FAR DIGET IN? HOW FAR DIGET? I GOT 90 SECONDS, 90 SECONDS. EVIDENTLY, DONALD TRUMP DOES BETTER IN ONLINE POLLS THAN PHONE POLLS BECAUSE VOTERS ARE RELUCTANT TO ADMIT TO ANOTHER PERSON THAT THEY SUPPORT HIM. LET'S TEST IT OUT. HOW MANY TRUMP SUPPORTERS DO WE HAVE HERE TONIGHT? ( LIGHT APPLAUSE ) OKAY, YOU'RE ALL LIARS. SO DONALD TRUMP SEEMS UNSTOPPABLE, LIKE THE TIDE OR A FUEL TRUCK CAREENING TOWARD A PRESCHOOL. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN-- TRAGIC AND SPECTACULAR. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN FOLKS HAVE NOT STOPPED TRYING TO STOP HIM. OVER THE WEEKEND, PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH AT RUTGERS, AND TOOK TOOK A LITTLE SWIPE AT TRUMP.
CLASS OF 2016, LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE. IN POLITICS AND IN LIFE, IGNORANCE IS NOT A VIRTUE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: TRUE. IT'S TRUE. IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. IGNORANCE IS NOT A VIRTUE. IGNORANCE IS BLISS, AND IF TRUMP WINS, WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY BLISSFUL FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF US. OF COURSE, DONALD DOESN'T LET ANYTHING GO, OTHER THAN AGEING WOMEN. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH! OH! MAN!
Stephen: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS. I JUST READ WHAT'S IN THE THING. SO HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED ON TWITTER, SAYING THIS IS A PRIMARY REASON THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THE WORST PRESIDENT IN U.S. HISTORY. WELL, AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I APPLAUD DONALD TRUMP FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO STAND UP FOR IGNORANCE. AFTER ALL, AMERICA WAS FOUNDED ON IGNORANCE. CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WENT TO HIS GRAVE, THINKING HE FOUND INDIA. AND DID NOT YANKEE DOODLE FAMOUSLY PUT A FEATHER IN HIS CAP AND CALL IT MACARONI? IT'S NOT MACARONI. IT'S A CAP. OVER IN BRITAIN, THEY'RE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE ON IT. AND IN AN EFFORT TO REACH YOUNG VOTERS, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON JOINED TINDER. ING IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE. , OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE'S TINDER PROFILES CLAIM THEY'RE THE PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND. THIS ONE IS TRUE. TINDER'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN ENGLAND. THEY SWIPE THE OTHER WAY, AND THEY ADD AN EXTRA "U" WHEN THEY TYPE "U UP?" HAVE YOU BEEN TO ENGLAND?
Jon: YEAH, I'VE BEEN OVER THERE.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE IT OVER THERE?
Jon: I'VE BEEN OVER THERE A FEW TIMES.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO ENGLAND THIS SUMMER?
Jon: NO, NOT THIS SUMMER.
Stephen: ANYBODY TRAVELING THIS SUMMER? ANYBODY? NO, YOU'RE NOT, BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS ARE MISSING THEIR FLIGHTS RIGHT NOW, DUE TO AIRPORT SECURITY LINES THAT LAST FOR HOURS. TRAVELERS ARE WEARY, ANGRY, DIRTY, SLEEPING IN CHAIRS. BASICALLY, AMERICA'S AIRPORTS HAVE BECOME AMERICA'S BUS STATIONS. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO A PASSENGER TOOK OF THE LINE TO GET THROUGH SECURITY AT CHICAGO'S MIDWAY AIRPORT.
OKAY, HERE'S THE START. LET'S SEE HOW LONG THIS THING IS. HERE'S THE SECURITY LINE. OH, GUESS WHAT? IT'S JUST GETTING STARTED. YEP, STILL IN LINE. YEP. ARE YOU (BLEEP) KIDDING ME T.S.A.? WHAT THE (BLEEP)? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S AN UNDERSTANDABLE FEELING. IT'S AN UNDERSTANDABLE FEELING. THAT LINE IS SO LONG, BY THE TIME THAT BABY GOT THROUGH, HE LOOKED LIKE THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS ) HIS FIRST WORDS: "WHAT THE (BLEEP), T.S.A.!" ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) TO CHILL OUT THE STRESSED PASSENGERS, SOME AIRPORTS HAVE RESORTED TO BRINGING IN MINIATURE THERAPY HORSES AND EVEN CLOWNS. THE THERAPY HORSES, OF COURSE, ARE THERE TO COMFORT YOU AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE CLOWNS. PLAIZ OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S A WELCOME SIGHT. OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF STRANDED PASSENGERS OUT THERE, SO TO ANYONE WATCHING THIS AT THE AIRPORT RIGHT NOW, I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME. IT'S TIME FOR STEPHEN COLERT'S "JUST THE TIP:  SUMMER TRAVEL EDITION." PEOPLE LOVE "JUST THE TIP." THE PEOPLE LOVE "JUST THE TIP." ALL RIGHT. TIP ONE: ACCEPT THAT YOU LIVE IN THE AIRPORT NOW. HELP IS NOT COMING BECAUSE IT CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SECURITY LINE. STIP 2, STEP 2-- STIP 2:  SUSTENANCE IS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL. REMEMBER, ONE CINNABON CONTAINS ENOUGH CALORIES FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK, PLUS IT DOUBLES AS A PILLOW. AND A WIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST-- JUST-- JUST LET IT-- JUST LET IT COOL DOWN FIRST. TIP 3: COMMANDEER A POSITION NEAR AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET. HE WHO CONTROLS THE CHARGING STATION IS LORD OF TERMINAL C! CHEAPER CHEERM BOW BEFORE ME! ( APPLAUSE ) TIP 4: IT'S TIME FOR A SHOW OF FORCE. ROLL A BAGGAGE CART THROUGH THE GLASS WALL OF THE ADMIRAL'S CLUB AND PROCLAIM, "I AM THE ADMIRAL NOW. PREPARE TO BE BOARDED." TIP FINALLY: IF BY SOME MIRACLE, YOU DO REACH THE FRONT OF THE SECURITY LINE, REQUEST THE PAT-DOWN, JUST TO FEEL SOMETHING. NOW, LET'S FEEL OUR FRIENDS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY.
Jon: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH, MY GOODNESS. HEY, DID YOU ALL SEE "CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR"? HAVE YOU SEEN THAT MOVIE YET? I SAW THE "CIVIL WAR." I LIKED IT. A LITTLE TOO LONG, BUT THEN AGAIN, SO WAS THE REAL CIVIL WAR. BUT I COULD NOT HELP BUT NOTICE WATCHING IT IN THE THEATER, THRILLED BY THE MOVIE, SO MANY OF THE CHARACTERS SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON: IRON-"MAN." ANT-"MAN." SPIDER-"MAN." MOVIE BLACK PANTHER... "MAN." THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE IS KIND OF A SAUSAGE-FEST. AND I GOTTA SAY, ALL THAT SPANDEX REALLY SHOWCASES THE SAUSAGE. AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT. IN FACT, IT WAS JUST REPORTED THAT "IRON MAN 3'S" VILLAIN, ALDRITCH KILLIAN, WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WOMAN ORIGINALLY. BUT ACCORDING TO THE WRITER OF "IRON MAN 3," "WE WERE GIVEN A NO-HOLDS-BARRED MEMO SAYING THAT CANNOT STAND." THIS IS SHOCKING. "IRON MAN 3" HAD A WRITER? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND YOU WON'T-- I THOUGHT THEY JUST BLEW STUFF UP. AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHY THEY HAD TO CHANGE HER INTO A HE. EVIDENTLY, MARVEL DECIDED THE TOY WOULDN'T SELL AS WELL IF IT IS A FEMALE. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) COME ON, IT MAKES SENSE. GIRLS DON'T PLAY WITH DOLLS. THIS IS SO DISAPPOINTING. BACK IN THE 80s, WE WEREN'T SO HUNG UP ON THE GENDER OF OUR HOLLYWOOD ACTION FIGURES. I COLLECTED HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. EVERYONE HAD MERYL STREEP FROM "SOPHIE'S CHOICE." I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH WHETHER TO OPEN THAT ONE AND PLAY WITH IT OR KEEP IT IN THE BOX. IT WAS A REAL... QUANDARY. BUT I DON'T WANT TO SINGLE OUT "IRON MAN 3," BECAUSE IT'S HARDLY THE ONLY FILM THAT WAS WRITTEN WITH A FEMALE VILLAIN ONLY TO HAVE IT CYNICALLY GENDER SWAPPED AT THE LAST MINUTE. TAKE DARTH VADER. HE WAS FIRST WRITTEN AS DARELENE VADER, A TALENTED, POWERFUL WOMAN WHO STRUGGLED TO BALANCE HER IMPERIAL AMBITIONS WITH RAISING HER REBELLIOUS TWINS. OR DOCTOR DOOM-- WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE A MAN? ARE YOU SAYING A WOMAN CAN'T BE A DOCTOR? OR BE AN EVIL TECHNO-SORCEROR? THEY'D BETTER FIX THIS IN THE NEXT "FANTASTIC FOUR" MOVIE. AND THERE BETTER NOT BE ANOTHER "FANTASTIC FOUR" MOVIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANTHONY ANDERSON.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS STARRED IN THE "BARBERSHOP" AND THE "SCARY MOVIE" MOVIES. HE NOW STARS IN "BLACK-ISH" ON ABC. PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY ANDERSON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
HEY, MAN, THE BAND IS GREAT! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UH-HUH. ROY AYERS, 1976. "UBIQUITY ALBUM." MY LIFE, MY LIFE. I KNOW MUSIC, BROTHER, I KNOW MUSIC.
Stephen: THAT'S A DEEP CUT. THAT'S A DEEP CUT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE, AND CONGRATULATIONS. "BLACK-ISH" HAS WON A PEABODY AWARD.
YES, SIR, YES, SIR.
Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU GUYS.
Stephen: PEABODY'S ARE THE BEST. THEY'RE BETTER THAN ANYING AWARD.
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE? I NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY I NEED TO GET.
Stephen: I HAVE FOUR. THANK YOU FOR ASKING. IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING FOR ME TO SAY THAT WITHOUT YOU ASKING.
THAT'S WHY I LED IN. SO PEOPLE CAN KNOW OUT THERE WHAT YOU DO. I HAVE TWO.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TWO.
I HAVE TWO.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE. THAT'S NOT EASY.
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING ME TO THROW OUT THAT I HAVE TWO WITHOUT ASKING YOU THIS QUESTION.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. HOW MANY GRAMMYS NOW?
62.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT.
NO.
Stephen: WELL, I HAD LAURENCE FISHBURNE ON THE SHOW A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND I ASKED HIM A QUESTION I'D REICH TO THROW AT YOU. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACK AND BLACK-ISH?
MMM. THE HUE OF THE PERSON'S SKIN.
Stephen: REALLY? NOT AS BLACK?
NOT AS BLACK.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO BE BLACK TO BE BACK-ISHTHAT'S NOT WHAT LAURENCEMEAN SAID I HAD A SHOT AT BLACKISHNESS. I HAD A SHOT.
WITH A BAND LIKE THAT, ARE YOU ALL THE WAY BLACK, BROTHER.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I SAID. I THINK THAT'S WHY. I THINK HE KIND OF SAID THE SAME THING THAT I WAS GETTING A BIT OF A CONTACT BLACK.
YEAH, CONTACT BLACK. LIKE A CONTACT HIGH, CONTACT BLACK.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
YOU CAN ROLL THROUGH THE 'HOOD BECAUSE OF YOUR BAND.
Stephen: REALLY.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: I SHOULD MAYBE CARRY A PICTURE WITH ME OF MY-- "THIS IS MY BAND! IT'S ALL COOL! IT'S ALL COOL!"
AND YOU'LL GET A PASS.
Stephen: I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU SAID THE BLACK-ISH PULLS BACK THE VAIL ON BEING BLACK FOR AMERICA.
YEAH, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY-- YOU KNOW, IT COMES FROM OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S LIKE, YO, MAN, YOU SHOWING TOO MUCH. WE'RE GIVING THEM A PEEK INTO OUR WORLD AND OUR LIFE AND WHAT'S GOING ON.
Stephen: REALLY, PEOPLE SAY YOU SHOW TOO MUCH?
YEAH, LIKE WE DID AN EPISODE "THE NOD."
Stephen: WHAT IS "THE NOD?"
YOU HAVE EVER WATCHED YOUR BAND AND THEY COME IN AT EACH OTHER AND THEY SEE BLACK PEOPLE AND THEY JUST LIKE... THAT'S THE NOD.
Stephen: THAT'S THE NOD? IS THAT TRUE, JON?
SEE, THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: IF I DO THAT-- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHAT IF I WAS HOLDING A PICTURE OF MY BAND.
HOLING A PICTURE OF YOUR BAND, YOU'RE COOL.
Stephen: IS THAT LIKE MOTORCYCLE DRIVERS THAT KIND OF GIVE THEMSELVESES THIS WHEN THEY DRIVE DOWN, THEY SAY HI TO EACH OTHER OR THE JEEP WE'VE.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT A BLACK GUY IN A JEEP CHE WAVE AND NOD AT THE SAME TIME?
OH, YOU'RE GETTING COMPLICATED.
Stephen: SORRY.
YOU'RE GETTING COMPLICATED. BUT THE NOD CAME ABOUT, CAMMIE BARIS, WHO IS MY PARTNER THIS SHOULD ADVENTURE WAS WALKING ACROSS THE STUDIO LOT ONE DAY WITH A BUNCH OF WHITE EXECUTIVES AND HE WOULD PASS A BROTHER AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE BROTHER AND THE BROTHER ACKNOWLEDGED HIM AND A FEW BROTHERS WALKED BY. ANDUN SOME WHITE GUYS WALKED BY AND THE WHITE GUYS DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WHITE GUYS. SO THEY SAID, "MAN, YOU KNOW ALL THOSE BROTHERS?" AND HE SAID, "NO, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, BUT IT'S JUST THE UNIVERSAL WAY OF SAYING HELLO TO ANOTHER BROTHER WHEN YOU PASS HIM ON THE STREET."
Stephen: THAT'S VERY PLEASANT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, I'M GUESSING-- I'M GUESSING THE PHRASE "THAT'S VERY PLEASANT" IS NOT BLACK-ISH.
FAR FROM IT, BROTHER.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO GUESS.
SOMEBODY JUST TOOK A PICTURE OF YOUR BAND AND RIPPED IT UP IN YOUR FACE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF "BLACK-ISH," A CLIP OF "BLACK-ISH" FROM THIS SEASON. THIS IS AN UPCOMING CLIP, I THINK.
OKAY.
Stephen: THIS IS AN HOMAGE YOU GUYS HAVE DONE TO "GOOD TIMES." LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS.
OKAY, COOL.
DADDY, I'M PREGNANT.
OH, THELMA!
I'M GOING TO NEED MORE RED PAINT.
WHITE JESUS, WHITE JESUS, YOU HAVE FORSAKEN ME.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE IS CLEARLY ONLY ONE BED IN HERE THAT WE ALL SLEEP IN.
OKAY, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE.
BOY, DO YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A CHILD?
DID YOU EVEN CONSIDER THE COST. THE DIAPERS, THE FORMULA, THE MEDICAL-- SHOTS!
WE'LL SKIP THE SHOTS.
WE SKIPPED THE SHOTS WITH J.J.
WE'LL NEED THE SHOTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DOES "BLACK-ISH" OWE A DEBT TO "GOOD TIMES?"
YEAH, BECAUSE "GOOD TIMES" WAS BLARK UNAPOLOGETICALLY BLACK. NO, IT'S A SHOW THAT, YOU KNOW, I GREW UP ON WATCHING.
Stephen: ME, TOO.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH.
WHO WAS YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER.
Stephen: IT WAS J.J., OF COURSE, THE DINE-O-MITE KID
THAT'S WHAT YOU USED TO CALL HIM GROWING UP.
Stephen: HE WAS THE DINO MIGHT KIT KID.
THE DINO MIGHT KID, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
LET ME HEAR YOU SAY DINO MIGHT. DO DINO MIGHT LIKE J.J. J.
Stephen: I NEED A BIGGER MOUTH, DINO MIGHT!
WHAT YOU NEED YOU NEED A BIGGER MOUTH, STEPHEN. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT JIMMY J.J. WALKER.
Stephen: HE HAD A LARGE MOUTH. HE HAS A LARGE MOUTH.
YOU COULD DRAW A FREIGHT TRAIN THROUGH THAT.
Stephen: I'LL GIVE YOU A J.J. WALKER. "J., J., WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT?" "I FOUND THIS."
I WANTED YOU TO DO THIS.
Stephen: DINO MIGHT.
THERE YOU GO! THERE YOU GO! HE GOT IT BLACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE.
NOW YOU ARE STRUTTING AROUND LIKE A PEACOCK. HEY!
Stephen: I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. NORMAN LEAR DID NOT WRITE THAT LINE. THE FIRST LADY HAS SAID IT'S HER FAVORITE SHOW, "BLACK-ISH." THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY WATCH THAT SHOW AND SAY, "THAT'S OUR FAMILY."
IT FEELS GREAT TO HAVE OUR SHOW RESONATE WITH THE PEOPLE THE WAY THAT IT DOES, AND ESPECIALLY THE FIRST FAMILY. AND TO BE INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND FOR TO HAVE THEM SAY, "YOUR SHOW IS INCREDIBLE. THIS IS WHAT WE WATCH."
Stephen: YOU DID YOU HANG OUT.
YEAH, I HANG OUT. I GOT TO HANG OUT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN THE PRESIDENT ONE OF THESE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE PRESIDENT-- GOOD.
Stephen: THANKS.
THAT'S GOOD.
Stephen: THANKS.
DI, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT GAVE IT TO ME FIRST.
Stephen: WHAT?  !
YES, YES.
Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC!
YES.
Stephen: THAT'S FAB TASK. DID YOU EVER SHOOT ANYTHING WITH HIM? DON'T ASK HIM TO DO A SECOND TAPE.
NO.
Stephen: HE'S A BUSY MAN.
HE A BUSY MAN AND HE NAILS IT ON THE THE FIRST TAKE.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
HE HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR AND A GREAT SENSE OF COMEDIC TIMING.
Stephen:  IT'S KIND OF UPSETTING.
HERE WE ARE, WE TRAINED FOR THIS OUR ENTIRE LIVES.
Stephen: AND HE NAILS IT ON THE FIRST TAKE,ABLE UNBELIEVABLE. I DIDN'T EVER EXPECT TO HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WAS COOLER THAN ME.
I'LL BE HONEST, I DIDN'T EVER EXPECT TO HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT WE GOT HIM.
Stephen: YEAH.
WE GOT HIM.
Stephen: LESS THAN A YEAR, THOUGH. LESS THAN A YEAR, THOUGH.
YEAH, THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.
Stephen: ENJOY HIM WHILE YOU CAN.
I WISH HE COULD RUN FOR ANOTHER EIGHT YEARS. I'LL BE HONEST.
Stephen: HE, AT THE END-- AT THE END OF HIS EIGHT YEARS NOW, SOME PEOPLE-- AND YOU CAN TELL ME, YOU BEING BLACK-ISH-- HAVE SAID HE IS EMBRACING HIS BLACKNESS MORE. FOR INSTANCE HIS SPEECH AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY.
MY ALMA MATER.
Stephen: OH, YOU WENT TO HOWARD.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIS RECENT SPEECH, HIS COMMENCEMENT SPEECH THERE.
I LOVED THE SPEECH. I WAS A LITTLE UPSET AT MYSELF THAT, YOU KNOW, I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL, LIKE, 12 YEARS TOO EARLY FOR HIM TO BE THERE AND TO GIVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH. BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, YOU KNOW, TO WATCH HIM STANDING THERE AT THE PODIUM AND GIVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH. IT JUST BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES OF ME BEING ON THE YARD AND ON CAMPUS THERE.
Stephen: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PEABODY. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE FINALE OF "BLACK-ISH" TOMORROW.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND THANKS FOR STOPPING ME.
HEY, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
SEASON TWO FINALE THE SEASON 2 FINALE OF OF "BLACK-ISH" TOMORROW ON ABC. ANTHONY ANDERSON, EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MY NEXT GUESTS ARE COMEDY LEGENDS AND CURRENT STARS OF THE HIT SHOW "SCHITT'S CREEK."
YOU KNOW, THE BLOOMFIELD ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) KID USED TO THROW THEIR PARENTS AN ANNIVERSARY PARTY EVERY YEAR.
IF WE'RE TRUTHED TELLING, THE BLOOM FIELD ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE TOO FRIENDLY WITH ONE ANOTHER. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF FAMILY SKINNY-DIPS WITH EACH OTHER.
JOHN, ARE YOU READY?
YES, SWEETHEART.
HAPPY, ANNIVERSARY!
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ONGOING LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER. YOU DID IT.
OKAY, KIDS. THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU SOUND LIKE THE INCESTUOUS BLOOMFIELDS.
HAVE A BLESSED DAY. PLEASE WELCOME EUGENE LEVY AND CATHERINE O'HARA. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
WOW. WOW.
Stephen: STANDING OVATION. NOT EVERYBODY GETS A STANDING OVATION OUT HIRE.
THAT'S VERY KIND. YOU'RE VERY ENCOURAGING.
WOW. WE JUST SPENT 20 MINUTES CHATTING WITH CHRIS MARTIN BACKSTAGE, SO OUR NIGHT IS DONE.
Stephen: KIND OF ADORABLE, ISN'T HE?
HE'S A DOLL.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, THAT KID'S GOING PLACES.
I THINK SO!
Stephen: I AM KIND OF AT A LOSS FOR WORD TO HAVE THE TWO OF YOU OUT HERE BECAUSE I AM STAR STRUCK AND COMEDY STRUCK BECAUSE THE TWO OF YOU ARE TWO OF MY DEEPEST, MOST SINCERE COMEDY HEROES.
WOW!
Stephen: I STARRED IN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I STAR-- HONEST TO GOD. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE. I'M NERVOUS TO INTERVIEW BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SCREW IT UP. I STARTED IN CHICAGO AT THE SECOND CITY AND YOUR PICTURES WERE ON THE WALL THERE AT SECOND CITY PUP GUYS WERE SECOND CITY TORONTO.
YEAH, TORONTO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TORONTO SECOND CITY. YE, WE STARTED-- TORONTO STARTED IN 1973. YOU GUYS, OF COURSE, STARTED IN 1959.
Stephen: YEAH.
YOUR CAST.
WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE A CHICAGO SECOND CITY SHOW TILL-- IT WAS, LIKE, MID-70s WHEN WE SAW OUR FIRST CHICAGO SHOW, AND THERE WAS, WE NOTICED A BIG DIFFERENCE.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE?
WELL, THE THING WAS, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS KIND OF YOU OF-- YOU KNOW YOU WOULD DO SCENES THAT WERE KIND OF LONGER-- I SAY "YOU." YOU WEREN'T AROUND BACK IN THE MID-70ss. BUT BACK THEN THEY WERE DOING NICE AND LONG SCENES, RELATIONSHIP SCENES, CHARACTER-- BEAUTIFUL SCENES. I WASN'T-- I-- AND I THOUGHT, WELL, HOW REQUEST THEY COA SCENE THIS LONG KIND OF WITH VERY FEW LAUGHS AND YET THE SCENE-- ( LAUGHTER ) THE SCENE WAS WORKING. THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL SCENES.
Stephen: YEAH.
YOU GUYS WERE KIND OF ENCOMPASSING THE SPIRIT OF MIKE NICHOLS AND ELAINE MAY. AND TORONTO WE WERE ENCOMPASSING THE SPIRIT OF THE THREE STOOGE S.
Stephen:  I'M OKAY-- I'M OKAY WITH THAT, TOO.
HONESTLY. IF WE WENT 15 SECONDS OUT A LAUGH, UNLIKE TONIGHT-- ( LAUGHTER )
WE'VE GOTTEN USED TO IT NOW.
Stephen: DID YOU PANIC?
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
Stephen: DID YOU GUYS MEET EACH OTHER RIGHT AWAY? WERE YOU DRAWN TO EACH OTHER RIGHT AWAY? BECAUSE AT SECOND CITY, YOU END UP-- IN CHICAGO WOULD END UP SORT OF HAVING BUDDIES THAT YOU WOULD WORK WITH FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. PAUL DONNELLO WAS ONE OF MY FIRST BUDS. HE WORKS WITH ME NOW. WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ALMOST 30 YEARS NOW. WERE YOU BUDDIES BACK THEN, TOO.
WE WERE LATE BLOOMERS GETTING TOGETHER. NOT UNTIL AFTER SECOND CITY. EVEN IN S.C.-TV, WE DIDN'T DO COUPLES. EUGENE USED TO DO CHICAGO-STYLE LONG RELATIONSHIP SCENES WITH ANDREA MARTIN.
ANDREA MARTIN, ORIGINALLY IT WAS GILDA RADNER-- ( APPLAUSE ) UPON WE WERE IN THE SAME-- THE LATE GREAT GILDA RADNER. AND SO WE DID SCENES TOGETHER. WE DID SCENES WHERE SHE DID CHARACTERS THAT EVENTUALLY BECAME CHARACTERS SHE DID ON "S.N.L.." BACK THEN THEY HAD DIFFERENT NAMES, BUT NEVER THE LESS JUST AS FUNNY.
Stephen: HERE IS A PHOTO FROM 1981 FROM S.C.-TV, ON THE COVER OF "TV GUIDE." THERE YOU ARE AND THERE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE. ( APPLAUSE )
ALL I CAN SEE IS THAT WE'RE NERVOUS. REALLY? YOU LOOK NERVOUS IN THIS PHOTO?
WE DID THE SHOW FOR SO LONG WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING IT, AND SUDDENLY I GUESS WE WENT TO NBC AND WE WERE DOING SOME PRESS, AND STRANGERS WOULD TALK TO US ABOUT IT. BUT WHENEVER WE DID P.R., LIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW WE HAD TO POSE EXPSHES WE'D POSE AND WE'D ALL BE OFF STAGE WITH EACH OTHER MAKING FUN-- "YOU THINK YOU LOOK GOOD!"
Stephen: THE SHOW MADE FUN OF SHOW BUSINESS SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD TO TAKE SHOW BUSINESS SERIOUSLY.
THE GOOD THING ABOUT SC-TV, IT WAS THE INMATES RUNNING THE ASYLUM.
Stephen: WAS THERE A SCENE FOR THE YOUNG ONES OUT THERE WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW SC-TV, AND GO WATCH THIS. THIS IS THE THING I WANT YOU TO SEE FIRST FROM SC-TV.
LOLA HEATHER TON.
WE DID VEGAS CHARACTERS. WE DID FUN GAME EXPHOAZ HIGH-Q., THAT WAS FUN,UN, BAD STUDENTS ON A-- AN ACADEMIC SHOW, YOU KNOW, WHICH EVERYONE WAS-- THEY'RE THE MOST FUN TO DO. YOU SEE THEM ALL THE TIME ON "IS THE NEED LIVE." YOU SEE THEM EVERYWHERE. EVERYONE LOVES BAD GAME SHOWS WHERE NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT ANSWER.
Stephen: ALEX TREBLE.
WHICH WAS ALEX TREBEK I WAS ACTUALLY DOING.
Stephen: CLEVERLY DISGUISED, CLEVERLY DISGUISED.
CLEVERLY DISGUISED LIKE A GUY THAT USED TO DRIVE A GARBAGE TRUCK THEY WORKING ON WORK MY WAY THROUGH UNIVERSITY WHO CONSTANTLY DRANK A WARM BOTTLE OF BEER ALL DAY IN THE CAB OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK WRAPPED IN A BROWN PAPER BAG. NOBODY KNEW IT WAS LIQUOR IN THAT BAG. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS AS CLEVERLY DISGUISED AS THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) WE-- WE-- WE HAD TO CHANGE THE NAMES BACK THEN. WE COULDN'T USE THE REAL NAMES.
Stephen: REALLY? IS IT CANADIAN LIBEL LAWS OR SOMETHING? BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE CANADIAN, RIGHT?
Stephen: ARE YOU STILL CANADIAN.
I'M BOTH. I'M DUAL. I'M FLUID.
Stephen: FLUID FLOOUD.
CITIZENSHIP-WISE.
Stephen: IT'S ON A CONTINUUM NOW. IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
I'M CANADIAN, KATHERINE IS BY. I AM 100% CANADIAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'D LIKE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CANADA WHEN WE COME BACK AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT "SCHITT'S CREEK." WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE EUGENE LEVY AND CATHERINE
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH CATHERINE O'HARA AND EUGENE LEVY. OKAY, I WANT TO GET TO CANADA IN JUST A MINUTE, BUT FIRST, THE SHOW ON POP TV IS CALLED "SCHITT'S CREEK."
"SCHITT'S CREEK."
S-C-H--
YOU MIGHT NOTICE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN IT HAS THE LOGO "SCHITT'S CREEK" BECAUSE I AM REQUIRED BY THE NETWORK TO HAVE THAT LOGO UP WHENEVER I SAY THE NAME OF YOUR SHOW.
SO THEY CAN SEE HOW IT IS SPELLED.
THEY'LL GET WITH IT IN TIME. LISTEN, IT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE NAME FOR OUR SHOW. OUR SHOW IS ABOUT A WEALTHY, WEALTHY FAMILY WHO LOSE EVERYTHING.
Stephen: THEY USED TO HAVE THE SECOND BIGGEST VIDEO RENTAL STORE IN AMERICA.
THAT'S RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) A CHAIN OF VIDEO STORES, SECOND LARGEST IN NORTH AMERICA. SO THEY LOSE-- AND THEY BOUGHT A TOWN WHEN THEY HAD MONEY AS A JOKE.
AS A JOKE GIFT FOR THEIR SON.
WHICH I GAVE TO MY 16-YEAR-OLD SON AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT. AND THE REASON WE BOUGHT IT AS A JOKE WAS BECAUSE THE TOWN WAS CALLED "SCHITT'S CREEK." AND NOW THAT THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING, THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO LIVE IS "SCHITT'S CREEK." THAT IS THE PREMISE OF THE SHOW. AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT A FAMILY, THIS WEA FAMILY, WHO NEVER REALLY FUNCTIONED AS FAMILYY, LEARNING TO ON IN TWO AJOINING ROOMS IN A "SCHITT'S CREEK" MOTEL.
WE RAISED OUR KIDS I CAPTIVITY. STORY, VERY WEALTHY CAPTIVITY. NOW, THEY'RE LEARNING TO SURVIVE IN THE WILD, THE REAL WORLD. WE HAD A SCENE THE OTHER DAY WHERE ANNIE MURPH WHOA PLAYS OUR DAUGHTER WAS HELPING TO CHANGE SHEETS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AND SAID, "IS THERE ANOTHER SHEET EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE?" "WHY DO YOU ASK?" "BECAUSE ON THE LABEL IT SAYS 'TWIN'."
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION.
IT IS.
Stephen: DO EACH OF YOU HAVE CHILDREN?
YES, I DO.
OH, DAN LEVY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE YOUR SON DANNY.
MY SON, DAN, AND I CREATED THE SHOW AND PRODUCING THE SHOW AND MY DAUGHTER IS ON THE SHOW, AND DAN, MY SON, PLAYS MY SON ON THE SHOW. AND THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER THING TO TALK ABOUT. ( APPLAUSE ) 7.
Stephen: I GOT ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO GO OVER WITH YOU.HER THING THAT EVERY LOVES YOU FROM THEY CERTAINLY LOVE YOU FROM IS THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IN CHRISTOPHER GUEST MOVIES "WAITING FOR GUFFMAN." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "BEST IN SHOW." "AND A MIGHTY WIND." DO YOU ENJOY IMPROVISING YOUR LINES MORE THAN DOING WRITTEN MATERIAL?
WELL, IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO GO.
YEAH.
I MEAN, AN IMPROVISED MOVIE, LIKE THESE MOVIES WHERE WE KIND OF HAVE A WRITTEN OUTLINE BUT WE DON'T WRITE THE DIALOGUE, IS A VERY, VERY FUN WAY TO SHOOT A MOVIE BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. WE DON'T HAVE ANY REHEARSALS. SO IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO IMPROVISE, AND YOU ALWAYS USE KIND OF IMPROVISATION IN-- IN A SCRIPTED SHOW. YOU ALWAYS-- YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND.
Stephen: ARE YOU IMPROVISING IN "SCHITT'S CREEK"?
I'M IMPROVISING RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
WE ALL ARE.
Stephen: BECAUSE I'M JUST READING EVERYTHING ALL OF OF HERE. I READ EVERYTHING OFF OF THAT.
I WISH I HAD THAT.
WE DO A LITTLE IMPROVISING OFF "SCHITT'S CREEK."
Stephen: DOES IT ALWAYS WORK?
NO.
Stephen: SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IMPROVISING IN "SCHITT'S CREEK," AND DOESN'T WORK YOU FIND YOURSELF JUST UP ( BLEEP ) CREEK.
