THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. WITH SAMANTHA BEE, AND GILIAN JACOBS. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH! HEY WHAT'S GOING ON MY FRIENDS? WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY, I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COL BETTER. I AM FEELING BLESSED TONIGHT, THANKS TO ONE MAN: WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND GUY ORDERING A MARTINI AT THE BOWLING ALLEY, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. THE MOOCH! THE MOOCH! I WAS WORRIED WHEN SEAN SPICER LEFT, THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE OF THE WHOIRS WOULD LOSE SOME FLAVAH. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE PLACED BY A GUY WHO SERVES UP VERY SPICY QUOTES. WE PLAYED THIS LAST NIGHT, BUT I JUST WANT SECONDS.
WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT WASHINGTON IS, PEOPLE DO NOT LET YOU KNOW HOW THEY FEEL. THEY'RE VERY NICE TO YOUR FACE, AND THEN THEY TAKE A SHIV OR A MACHETE AND THEY STAB IT IN YOUR BACK. I DON'T LIKE IT. I'M A WALL STREET GUY, AND I'M MORE OF A FRONT STABBING PERSON.
Stephen: YEAH, HE WOULD NEVER STAB SOMEONE IN THE BOOK. BOOK -- MOUNTAIN THAT'S RUDE. "A GENTLEMAN STABS SOMEBODY FROM THE FRONT SO YOU CAN WATCH THE LIFE DRAIN OUT OF THEIR EYES." KEEP 'EM OPEN, KEEP 'EM OPEN. TRUMP HIRED SCARAMUCCI TO GET RID OF THE WHITE HOUSE LEAKERS. BUT DON'T CALL HIM A HITMAN. HE'S JUST A GUY WHO WAS CONTRACTED TO WHACK SQUEALERS BY A POWERFUL DON. AND THE LATEST LEAK THAT HAS THE MOOCH'S FUSILLI IN A TWIST OCCURRED YESTERDAY WHEN POLITICO PUBLISHED SCARAMUCCI'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM REVEALING THAT HE HAS ASSETS WORTH AS MUCH AS $85 MILLION. HOW HUMILIATING. YEAH. NOW EVERYONE KNOWS HE'S THE POOREST PERSON WORKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  NOW AS MUCH -- THAT'S GOT TO HURT. AS MUCH AS I'VE ENJOYED WHAT SCARAMUCCI SAID ONE WEEK ON HIS JOB, WE GOT AN INCREDIBLE TASTE OF UNFILTERED MOOCH TODAY, WHEN "NEW YORKER" REPORTER RYAN LIZZA PUBLISHED DETAILS OF A CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH SCARAMUCCI LAST NIGHT. I'M GOING TO READ YOU SOME OF THE QUOTES, BUT BE WARNED, IF YOU ARE PUT OFF BY FOUL LANGUAGE, THE MOOCH THINKS YOU SHOULD MOOCH YOURSELF IN THE HEAD. I WANT TO GIVE A QUICK WARNING TO THE CBS CENSORS: YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK OUT THE EMERGENCY EXTRA BLEEPS FOR THIS ONE. BUT IT'S NOT MY FAULT. I'M JUST COMMUNICATING TO YOU THE ACTUAL WORDS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE. THE ONE IN WASHINGTON! HERE'S HOW IT STARTED: LIZZA REPORTED YESTERDAY ABOUT TRUMP'S DINNER WITH SCARAMUCCI, SEAN HANNITY AND SOME OTHER GUYS. THE MOOCH CALLED UP LIZZA TO TRY TO GET THE NAME OF WHO LEAKED ABOUT THE DINNER, BUT LIZZA PROTECTED HIS SOURCE. SO THE MOOCH SAID, "OKAY, I'M GOING TO FIRE EVERY ONE OF THEM, AND THEN YOU HAVEN'T PROTECTED ANYBODY, SO THE ENTIRE PLACE WILL BE FIRED OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS." MOOCH, YOU DO REALIZE THAT IF -- HE'S STILL NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE NAMES. AND IF YOU DO FIRE EVERYBODY, YOU HAVE TO REPLACE EVERYBODY WITH PEOPLE WHO NOW KNOW THEY'RE WORKING FOR A GUY WHO WOULD JUST FIRE EVERYBODY? THE MOOCH WAS PRETTY SURE HE KNEW WHO THE LEAKER WAS: CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS, WHO HE DESCRIBED AS "A ( BLEEP ) PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC, A PARANOIAC." THE GUY' GUY'S PARANOID, OKAY? "HE THINKS HIS OWN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR IS TRYING TO STAB HIM IN THE BACK. AND AGAIN, FRONT STAB." FRONT STAB, HOLD STILL, HOLD STILL! KEEP 'EM OPEN I WANT TO SEE! THEN THE MOOCH DID THE BEST PRIEBUS IMPRESSION. LIZZA WRITES, HE CHANNELED PRIEBUS AS HE SPOKE. "LET ME LEAK THE ( BLEEP ) THING AND SEE IF I CAN (BLEEP)-BLOCK THESE PEOPLE THE WAY I (BLEEP) -BLOCKED SCARAMUCCI FOR SIX MONTHS." OH PLEASE, MOOCH, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD BLOCK YOU FROM BEING A (BLEEP) AND HIS WORDS, NOT MINE! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
WE LOVE YOU.
Stephen:  AND THE MOOCH WAS FEELING A LITTLE HURT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TREATING HIM AT HIS NEW JOB. QUOTE: "I'VE ASKED PEOPLE NOT TO LEAK THINGS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND GIVE ME A HONEYMOON PERIOD. THEY WON'T DO IT." "HEY EVERYONE, I'M ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, I'M A FRONT-STABBER, I'M HERE TO FIRE EVERYONE, NOW BE NICE TO ME." OKAY, BE A LITTLE BIT NICE TO ME, OKAY? I'M SOMEBODY'S LITTLE BOY! (APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  AND THE MOOCH SAYS HE WAS DOING THIS FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS. "I'M NOT TRYING TO BUILD MY OWN BRAND OFF THE ( BLEEP ) STRENGTH OF THE PRESIDENT. I'M HERE TO SERVE THE COUNTRY." AND ADDED, "I'M NOT STEVE BANNON, I'M NOT TRYING TO SUCK MY OWN ( BLEEP )." [ AUDIENCE SCREAMS ] (APPLAUSE)
Stephen:  LOOK, IF BANNON COULD DO THAT, HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE. THOUGH I GOT TO SAY, WE NEVER SEE HIM EVER ANYMORE. GOOD FOR YOU, STEVE! BUT ALL GOOD BADDA-BINGS MUST COME TO AN END, BECAUSE SCARAMUCCI SIGNED OFF BY SAYING OF PRIEBUS, "YEAH, LET ME GO, THOUGH, BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO START TWEETING SOME ( BLEEP ) TO MAKE THIS GUY CRAZY." ADDING, "CAN WE MAKE THIS OFF THE RECORD? NO? OKAY. MOOCH OUT." ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  HEY, HO! SO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT HE GETS OFF THE PHONE I GOT TO TWEET SOME STUFF TO MAKE THIS GUY CRAZY. THEN SCARAMUCCI TWEETED: "IN LIGHT OF THE LEAK OF MY FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE INFO-- WHICH IS A FELONY-- I WILL BE CONTACTING @F.B.I. AND THE @THEJUSTICEDEPARTMENT. HASHTAG-SWAMP, @REINCE45." HANG ON! HANG ON! HE JUST TAGD @REINCE 45? THAT MEANS EITHER THE MOOCH JUST PUBLICLY ACCUSED WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS OF A FELONY, OR THERE ARE 44 OTHER REINCES ON TWITTER. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. YES! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
NUMBER 45, NUMBER 45.
Stephen:  BUT HOLD ON A SECOND, A FELONY? YOUR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. THAT'S DISCLOSE PART OF DISCLOSURE. YOU'RE THINKING OF "FINANCIAL IXNAY ON THE ONEY-MAY" FORMS. HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT? YOU WENT TO HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. WHAT DID YOU STUDY THERE? A VHS COPY OF "MY COUSIN VINNY?" ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen:  HEY HEY WHAT? HEY HEY! SCARAMUCCI WOKE UP WITH A RAGING MOOCH-OVER TODAY. BECAUSE THIS MORNING HE CALLED IN TO CNN WITH LIZZA ON THE OTHER LINE.
WHEN I WAS ON A PLAIN TO NEW YORK I HAD TO CALL MY MOM. I WAS TEASING YOU AND IT WAS SASH CAST TICK. IT WAS ONE ITALIAN TO ANOTHER.
Stephen:  I.T. WAS ONE ITALIAN TO ANOTHER I WAS VISITING MY MOM. YOU KNOW? GIVE ME THE LEAKERS AND MAYBE YOU NEVER SEE YOUR MOM. I FORGET, DOES SHE HAVE A FRONT? BUT WHILE HE WAS THERE ANYWAY, SCARAMUCCI WAS WILLING TO TALK ON ONE CONDITION.
I JUST SPENT ABOUT 15 MINUTES ON THE PHONE TALKING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS GIVEN ME HIS FULL SUPPORT AND HIS FULL BLESSING, AND I'M GOING TO READ YOU SOMETHING, CHRIS. BEAR WITH ME. THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOLD ME, IF YOU'RE NICE TO ME IN THIS SEGMENT, HE'LL LET ME COME BACK ON THE SHOW. IS THAT COOL?
Stephen: "YEAH, CHRIS, IS THAT COOL? YOU PLAY NICE, I PLAY NICE. YOU GOT A NICE SHOW THERE. HATE TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO IT." AND THE MOOCH LET THE LEAKERS KNOW, HE'S ON TO THEM.
I'VE INTERVIEWED MOST OF THE ASSISTANTS TO THE PRESIDENT. I'VE INTERVIEWED MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNICATIONS TEAM AND THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL EVERYBODY, WE HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD IDEA OF WHO THE LEAKERS ARE, WHO THE SENIOR LEAKERS ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: I'VE ALSO DONE SOME RESEARCH ON WHO'S SHARING INFORMATION DAMAGING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER THIS COMPOSITE POLICE SKETCH. IF YOU SEE THIS MAN APPROACH WITH CAUTION. THEN THE MOOCH REMINDED US HOW DANGEROUS THESE LEAKERS REALLY ARE.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AGAIN, WHETHER YOU GUYS LIKE THE GUY, DISLIKE THE GUY, HE'S THE SMARTEST PERSON I'VE EVER WORKED FOR. THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THINK IT IS THEIR JOB TO SAVE AMERICA FROM THIS PRESIDENT. THAT IS NOT THEIR JOB.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB. THAT IS THE JOB OF ROBERT MUELLER. I THINK THAT'S HIS JOB, I'M NOT SURE. WE'LL FIND OUT. WE'LL FIND OUT. THEN, THE MOOCH STRESSED HOW BAD THESE LEAKERS ARE:
THE WHITE HOUSE LEAKS ARE SMALL POTATOES, RELATIVE WITH THINGS GOING ON ABOUT LEAKING THINGS ABOUT SYRIA OR NORTH KOREA OR LEAKING THINGS ABOUT IRAQ. THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF LEAKS THAT ARE SO TREASONOUS, THAT 150 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN HUNG FOR THOSE TYPES OF LEAKS.
Stephen:  ABSOLUTELY. 150 YEARS AGO, IF PEOPLE WERE LEAKING THINGS ON THE INTERNET, THEY WOULD BE HUNG FOR WITCHCRAFT. NO ONE WOULD PUT UP WITH THAT, NO. HIS MESSAGE IS SUBTLE BUT THE MOOCH DOESN'T LIKE LEAKS AND HE KNOWS WHO'S ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE:
IT'S ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY REPREHENSIBLE. AS YOU KNOW FROM THE ITALIAN EXPRESSION, THE FISH STINKS FROM THE HEAD DOWN. BUT I CAN TELL YOU TWO FISH THAT DON'T STINK. OKAY? AND THAT'S ME AND THE PRESIDENT.
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S STOP RIGHT THERE. I'VE HEARD THE STINKS THING. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. HERE'S THE FISH. IF IT STINKS FROM THE HEAD DOWN, AND THE FISH IS THE WHITE HOUSE, ISN'T DONALD TRUMP THE HEAD OF THE FISH? BUT THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU AND TRUMP ARE DIFFERENT FISH, WHO WORK AT THE FISH? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS METAPHOR. I THINK YOU MIGHT BE FISHED IN THE HEAD. YEAH, THAT'S GOING ON US. NOW, LET'S GET BACK TO REINCE PRIEBUS. SCARAMUCCI SAYS, DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, HE AND REINCE ARE CLOSE.
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CHIEF OF STAFF, WE HAVE HAD ODDS. WE HAVE HAD DIFFERENCES. WHEN I SAID WE WERE BROTHERS FROM THE PODIUM, THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE ROUGH ON EACH OTHER. SOME BROTHERS ARE LIKE CAIN AND ABEL. OTHER BROTHERS CAN FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER AND GET ALONG. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS REPAIRABLE OR NOT.
Stephen: "YEAH, WHO KNOWS? SOME BROTHERS ARE LIKE CAIN AND ABEL, SOME ARE LIKE MARIO AND LUIGI. OKAY? WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. WILL WE GO DOWN A PIPE TO SAVE THE PRINCESS, OR WILL I BASH HIS HEAD IN WITH A ROCK AND THEN LIE TO GOD ABOUT IT?" W.H.O. KNOWS. AM I MY PRIEBUS KEEPER? AND I MY PRIEBUS KEEPER? WHO KNOWS, WHO KNOWS? THE QUESTION IS: REINCE PRIEBUS, WHY ARE YOU STICKING AROUND AND TAKING THIS ABUSE? JUST LEAVE, AND ENJOY THE EASY LIFE ON SPICER ISLAND. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  AND THE MOOCH ISN'T JUST HANDLING THE LEAKING. YESTERDAY, HE MET WITH BBC'S SENIOR DRIVEWAY CORRESPONDENT TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PASS A HEALTHCARE BILL.
I'M WONDERING WHETHER THE PRESIDENT FEELS HE'S BEEN FRONT-STABBED BY SOME OF THE SENATORS WHO VOTED DOWN THAT REPEAL OF OBAMACARE.
IF YOU'VE READ "TEAM OF RIVALS," IT TOOK LINCOLN THREE OR FOUR TIMES TO GET WHAT HE WANTED FROM THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH WAS THE FULL ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.
Stephen: "YEAH, IT TOOK THREE OR FOUR TIMES PLUS A CIVIL WAR, SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BY THE WAY, THAT JOHN WILKES BOOTH? TOTAL COWARD. I WOULD'VE FRONT-SHOT HIM. HEY, ABE... BOOM!" ERS BY SCARAMOOCH. STAB YOU WITH MY GUN! THE MOOCH ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THAT OUR MULTIMILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE MOGUL PRESIDENT IS NO ELITIST.
WHAT PART OF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ELITE? THE BUSINESS SIDE, THE POLITICS SIDE, THE INHERITANCE SIDE? AWAY PARTLY OF DONALD TRUMP, MANY PEOPLE IN THE U.K. DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. HE'S A CELEBRITY. A BILLIONAIRE.
HOW ABOUT THE --
OH MY GOD, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. HOW ABOUT THE CHEESEBURGERS, HOW ABOUT THE PIZZAS THAT WE EAT?
EVERYBODY EATS CHEESEBURGERS AND PIZZAS! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. SEE-- YOU'RE COMING ACROSS A LITTLE BIT ELITIST...
Stephen: "OKAY, YOU'RE COMING ACROSS A LITTLE BIT ELITIST THERE, MARY POPPINS. SUPERCALA-STAB-ALICIOUS! BIBBITY BOPPITY STAB! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, STICK AROUND!

I WAS TIRED.
Stephen:  FLAMING TOBOGGAN RIDES, THERE IS AN OAK TREE SOMEWHERE IN THE HILL.
AND BEFORE CRASHING INTO THE OAK TREE --
Stephen:  IT'S FUN NOW BUT ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE TO TELL MOM WHAT HAPPENED TO TIME.  BUT WHILE HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE MOOCH'S LATEST MOOCHING?
SURE DID. I LOVE THAT HE'S REFERRING TO HIMSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON. THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
Stephen:  ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN.
DAY SIX. SO TOMORROW -- DIGNITY IS OURS!
Stephen:  IT'S REALLY NICE THAT WE'RE GETTING A REALLY INTERESTING CAST OF CHARACTERS ALL THE TIME.
THE CASTING COULDN'T BE BETTER.
Stephen:  CAST OF CHARACTERS.
HE FOLLOWS ME ON TWITTER. HE FOLLOWS EVERYONE HERE ON TWITTER. HE REALLY IS --
Stephen:  16,000 PEOPLE ON TWITTER.
I WAS WORRIED HE WOULDN'T BUT
Stephen:  HI TO UNMOOCH. NOW DO YOU EVER THINK THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO NORMAL?
NO I DON'T. THAT'S MY FINAL ANSWER.
Stephen:  YOU DON'T THINK THINGS WILL GET BACK TO NORMAL?
THAT'S MY FEELING, I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE AGAIN.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE GOLDEN PARACHUTE, MAPLE PARACHUTE. YOU ARE CITIZENS OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES --
WE ARE IN IT TO WIN IT HERE STEPHEN, WE'RE NOT JOKING AROUND. WE CHOSE THIS PLACE, AND WE INTEND TO FIX IT! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
SO FAR, NO ONE'S LISTENING TO ME SO THAT'S FINE. MY BIG PLAN HASN'T PANNED OUTTO SO FAR.
Stephen:  BUT YOU STILL HAVE YOUR CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP.
WE TO.
Stephen:  WHEN CORTEZ CAME HERE TO THE NEW WORLD HE BURNED HIS SHIPS SO HIS MEN DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY COULD LEAVE AT ANY MOMENT. THEY HAD TO CONQUER MEZO-AMERICA. I REALIZE THAT'S NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE.
AT ANY MOMENT, I COULD JUMP INTO THE ARMS OF JUSTIN TRUDEAU. I DON'T HAVE TO LEAP INTO HIS ARMS. HE COULD HOLD ME IN A BABY BJORN, THAT WOULD BE OKAY. HE'S STRONG.
Stephen:  NOW YOU HAVE KIDS.
I DO.
Stephen:  TWO.
THREE, WE HAVE THREE.
Stephen:  THREE?
WE ARE PROLIFIC. WE ARE BUILDING OUR OWN SOCIETY.
Stephen:  YOU ARE GOING INTO A ZONE DEFENSE AGAINST YOUR KIDS.
WE HAVE.
Stephen:  HOW OLD ARE THEY?
11 AND NINE AND SIX. I FORGOT.
Stephen:  THEY HAVE A SENSE WHAT MOM DOES?
THEY HAVE A SENSE.
Stephen:  DO THEY WATCH THE SHOW?
THEY DO NOT WATCH THE SHOW, IT'S A TIRTY SHOW. THEY DON'T THINK I'M COOL. THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN IT WHATSOEVER.
Stephen:  ARE YOU SURE THEY DON'T WATCH THE SHOW?
THEY DON'T WATCH THE SHOW NOT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO IMPRESS THEM. THEY DON'T CARE, ABOUT ME AT ALL!
Stephen:  DO THEY KEEP UP WITH THE NEWS LIKE THEIR MOM?
THEY DO.
Stephen:  HOW DO THEY KEEP UP WITH THE CRAZINESS OR THIS IS JUST THE WORLD?
THEY DRAW PICTURES OF IT.
Stephen:  THEY DO?
THEY DO.
Stephen:  AND THEY SHOW THE PICTURES TO THE COUNSELORS?
IT'S LIKE AN IMPRESSIVE HAND HOVERING.
Stephen:  YOU DO USE SALTY LANGUAGE ON YOUR SHOW? DON'T TALK LIKE MOMMY?
THEY DO LOVE SALTY LANGUAGE, THAT DOESN'T COME FROM ME. THEY JUST KNOW IT, THEY ABSORB IT. I CAN GET THEM DO ANYTHING JUST BY LETTING THEM USE ONE PIECE OF SALTY LANGUAGE IN A CONVERSATION.
Stephen:  THAT'S THEIR TREAT?
THAT'S THEIR TREAT. IT'S THE GREATEST PARENTING COUP I EVER CAME UP WITH. I'M SUCH A SMART PARENT, CHECK IT OUT. THEY DON'T WANT TREATS. THEY DON'T WANT CHOCOLATE. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THEY DON'T CARE NOR CAKES AND OTHER THINGS NORMAL CHILDREN LIKE, BUT THEY DO LIKE TO SWEAR. I'LL BE VERY CAGEY, OKAY GUYS I REALLY WANT YOU TO CLEAN YOUR ROOMS. CAN YOU HAVE ONE SWEAR. IF YOU CLEAN YOUR ROOMS DILIGENTLY YOU CAN SIT TOGETHER WITH ME AND DO ONE HIGH QUALITY SWEAR.
Stephen:  IN THE CONTEXT OF A SENTENCE?
YOU SHOULD TO USE YOUR SWEAR IN A PROPER SENTENCE AND IT HAS TO MAKE SENSE FOR SWEAR.
Stephen:  CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A WORD YOU MITES ALLOW THE CHILDREN TO SAY? WE'LL BLEEP IT.
YOU WILL?

Stephen:  HEY EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK. I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. WE WERE TALKING EARLIER IN THE SHOW TONIGHT ABOUT SCARAMUCCI. HE TALKED ABOUT I'M NOT A BACK STABBER, I'M MORE OF A FRONT-STABBER.
THAT'S VERY CORDIAL.
Stephen:  DO YOU LIKE FRONT STABBERS OR BACK STABBERS?
I GUESS I WOULD PREFER FRONT STABBERS? I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT COMING, I GUESS I WOULD LIKE IN THE BACK. IT HAS TO BE A FATAL BLOW. HE'S QUICK.
Stephen:  I STILL HEAR HIM CACKLING.
AND THAT WHOLE MOMENT WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME? THEN YOU --
Stephen:  I DON'T THINK YOUR KIDS SHOULD WATCH THIS SHOW EITHER.
I'M A REALLY GOOD MOM! I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.
Stephen:  SOMETHING READY READY -- REALLY EXCITING. YOU TOOK YOURSELF AND YOU WENT TO IRAQ.
YES I DID.
Stephen:  I WEREN'T MANY, MANY YEARS AGO BUT JUST BAGHDAD, WHERE DID YOU GO?
WE ACTUALLY WENT TO IRAQI KURDISTAN. NORTHERN IRAQ AND A COUPLE OF CITIES THERE. IT WAS FASCINATING THERE. I JUST LOVED GOING.
Stephen:  WAS THE WAR THERE NOW?
WHEN WE WERE THERE THE FIGHTING WAS VERY INTENSE IN MOSUL AND WHERE WE WERE WAS 40 TO 50 MILES AWAY FROM MOSUL. DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THAT FAR, AND OTHERS SAID, IS THAT MOSUL OVER THERE? :00 THE
Stephen:  THERE WAS A FABULOUS PHOTO OF JARED KUSHNER, A LITTLE BIT OF HIS STYLISH -- ARE THESE ALL KURDISH SOLDIERS?
IT'S A KUSHNER HOMAGE. WHO SPENT TIME WITH THE FEMALE PESHMERGA SOLDIERS, WE DID A LOT OF INTERESTING STUFF. WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING, WE WILL HAVE A BUNCH OF PIECES, THE NEXT TWO WEEKS WE'LL HAVE PIECES FROM IRAQ. BUT WE ENDED UP DOING OUR FIRST TRUMP POSITIVE PIECE IN KURDISTAN. THEY DO, THEY LOVE HIM. THERE ARE SO MANY BABIES BEING BORN AND THEY ARE BEING NAMED TRUMP. MALE OR FEMALE.

INTRODUCE US TO YOUR BABY. HE'S SO CUTE! WHAT HAPPENS IF I TUSSLE HIS HAIR? IS THAT NORMALIZING YOU? TK HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?
FOUR OR --
Stephen:  HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?
FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. I LOVED I.T.
Stephen:  DID YOU GO STRAIGHT STRAIT THERE OR --
WE WENT THROUGH TURKEY ON THE WAY THERE AND QATAR ON THE WAY BACK.
Stephen:  WERE YOU AFRAID FOR YOUR SAFETY AT ANY TIME WHEN YOU WERE OVER THERE?
I THINK IT WAS BEFOREHAND. I WAS VERY WORRIED BEFOREHAND. I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. BUT ONCE WE WERE ON THE GROUND I NEVER FELT UNSAFE AT ALL. WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME. MET SUCH INTERESTING PEOPLE AND SAW AS MUCH INTERESTING THINGS. I MET SOME AMAZING PEOPLE! TUC
Stephen:  YOU WERE ABLE TO GET OFF THE INTERNET OR OFF TWITTER WHEN YOU WERE OVER THERE?
NO, YOU COULDN'T ESCAPE. I TRIED TO ESCAPE, THAT'S WHY I WENT TO IRAQ.
Stephen:  MILITARY FLIGHTS?
NO COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS, COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS STILL GO INTO KURDISTAN. WE CAN ALL GO, ANY ONE OF US CAN GO.
Stephen:  MAYBE SPRING BREAK.

Stephen:  LONG TIME FOR A YOUNG LADY. YOU LIVED IN PITTSBURGH AND --
I GOT ONE CLAP FROM PITTSBURGH.
Stephen:  ONE WHILE YOU'RE ON. YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES. DO YOU LIKE THE HIP L.A. SCENE, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'D BE COOL ENOUGH TO BE IN LOS ANGELES, TO BE AN ACTOR OUT THERE.
IT'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF COOL. I NOTICE I'VE BEEN GIFTED A LOT OF CRYSTALS SINCE I MOVED TO LOS ANGELES.
Stephen:  REALLY?
I DON'T KNOW IT'S AN ENERGY THING, IT'S A HEALING THING. I'VE BEEN TOLD I'M SUPPOSED TO CHARGE THEM IN THE MOONLIGHT. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE?
Stephen:  I HAVE NOT.
WELL IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET THE FULL HEALING POWER YOU GOT THE GET A FULL MOON BUT I GUESS ANY OLD MOON WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING.
Stephen:  SO SOMEONE GAVE YOU CRYSTALS AND TOLD YOU TO PUT THEM OUT IN THE MOONLIGHT?
NOT SOMEONE, MULTIPLE PEOPLES.
Stephen:  CRYSTALS ARE A THING AGAIN?
THEY ARE WORRIED. THEY ARE --
Stephen:  GRASPING AND STRAWS.
STRAWS COMPRESSED INTO BEAUTIFUL CRYSTALS.
Stephen:  OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO USE THEM BEFORE THE ECLIPSE. ONCE YOU'VE CHARGED THEM WHAT DO YOU THEN DO WITH THEM?
I GUESS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HOLD THEM FOR POWER. SOME LADIES IN LOS ANGELES DO MORE THAN JUST HOLD THEM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MOM I UNDERSTAND.
(LAUGHING).
Stephen:  I WAS GIVEN CRYSTALS MANY YEARS AGO ON TOUR. SOME OF US WERE IN YREKA, CALIFORNIA. A WOMAN APPROACHED ME AND SAID YOU HAVE TO HOLD THESE IN YOUR HAND ALL NIGHT. I HELD THEM IN MY HAND ALL NIGHT. SHE SAID FEEL HOW WARM THEY ARE NOW? I SAID YES. SHE SAID SEE, THEY WORK! BUT YOU DO HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MOM. DOES SHE COME OUT AND VISIT YOU IN LOS ANGELES, TAKE HER TO THE SCENE? GO PARTYING WITH YOUR MOM?
HER ONE REQUEST WAS THAT WE GO SEE A DRAG SHOW.
Stephen:  OH THAT'S FUN.
THIS HAS BEEN A LONG RUNNING THING. AS A CHILD WE LOVED MOVIES LIKE TU LONG FU AND PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT. MY MOTHER'S ONE REQUEST WAS I TAKE HER TO A DRAG SHOW. I SAID I'M GOING TO MAKE IT HATCH, WE'LL GO TO A DRAG SHOW. BUT REALLY IT WAS JUST A CLUB, MEN WERE DANCING IN TINY LITTLE SHORTS, AND PEOPLE WERE GRINDING ON MY MOX WHICH IS NOT A SIGHT A DAUGHTER SHOULD SEE. AND SOME THOUGHT MY MOTHER AND I WE'RE COUPLE AND THEY WERE PROPOSITIONING MY MOTHER AND I TO GO HOME WITH THEM AND PARTICIPATE IN A GROUP ACTIVITY.
Stephen:  LET ME ASK YOU, WERE THERE CRYSTALS INVOLVED? >
LET ME ASK YOU YOUR CHARACTER, MICKIE --
MOUSE.
Stephen:  YOU'LL GET A SUBPOENA HERE.
SHE SCARCE ME. I'M VERY INTIMIDATED BY HER AS A CHARACTER. SHE DRINKS, DOES DRUGS. I'VE NEVER DONE DRUGS IN MY LIFE EVER! ALL RIGHT!
Stephen:  SOMEONE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE.
ONE PITTSBURGH PERSON AND ONE NO DRUG. YOUR CHARACTER WANTS TO INHALE THE SMOKE YOU CAN'T HOLD IT LIKE THIS, LIKE MY LIPS WERE PURSED AS THEY COULD BE. IT'S LIKE NO NO, SHE WANTS TO INHALE THE NICOTINE, PLEASURABLE FOR HER. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I GET A DRAG AND START COUGHING.
Stephen:  GRAB IT LIKE THAT SMOKE IT LIKE THAT.
IS THAT THE WAY?
Stephen:  JUST LIKE THAT.
I WANTED TO DO THIS, AND I WAS TALKED OUT OF IT.
Stephen:  REALLY? THAT IS ALMOST LIKE YOUR VAPPING. VAPORS DO THIS.
THAT'S WHAT I SEE ON THE STREETS. DOES THAT LOOK GOOD? I SHOULD STICK TO -- M.
