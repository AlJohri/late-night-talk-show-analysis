Jon: YES.
Stephen: BIG NEWS OUT TO HAVE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TODAY, BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT HIDLESWIFT! WE REVIEW ALL HER INSTAGRAHAM PICS! APPARENTLY, IT ALL STARTED WHEN TOM AND TAYLOR DANCED AT THE MET GALA, WHICH I ATTENDED. AND I GOT TO TAKE SOME CREDIT BECAUSE I'M THE FIRST ONE TO NOTICE THAT THEY'RE BOTH ATTRACTIVE. AND NOW, PICTURES HAVE HIT THE TABLOIDS OF THE COUPLE CAVORTING BY THE OCEAN, CANOODLING AND SHARING A KISS. (AUDIENCE REACTS) SO NOW WE HAVE HIDDLESWIFT. ALTHOUGH, PERSONALLY, I WOULD'VE GONE WITH "TAY-TOM SWIDDLE-STON." I WISH YOU TWO THE BEST. BUT TOM, DON'T YOU DARE BREAK HER HEART. AND TAYLOR, IF HE DOES -- I'VE GOT THE BREAKUP ALBUM READY. IT'S CALLED "HIDDLE-SCHOOL DROPOUT," AND THE FIRST SINGLE GOES: ♪ OUT OF LUCK ♪ MY HEART'S ON THE GRIDDLE ♪ CUZ I'M STUCK ♪ STUCK IN THE HIDDLE WITH YOU ♪ IT GOES ON FROM THERE. IT'S A HUGE HIT, AND I GET HALF THE MONEY. SO I CAN'T STOP THIS. BUT I'VE GOT SOME WORDS FOR YOU, TOM HIDDLESTON. I'M HURT. I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING WHEN YOU WERE HERE ON MY SHOW. JIMMY, SHOW US TOGETHER. LOOK AT THAT! IT'S CRACKLING WITH CHEMISTRY! I THOUGHT WE WERE #HIDDLESTEPH! AND NOW I TURN ON MY INTERNET TO SEE YOU CAVORTING WITH LITTLE MISS BLANK SPACE? AND I CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF! OKAY, WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK. TOM, TAYLOR, WE'LL BE A POWER TRIO: COLBIDDLESWIFT. (LAUGHTER) IT WILL BE SO GREAT. LOOK AT THE FUN WE COULD BE HAVING, GOING FOR A ROMANTIC STROLL ON THE BEACH. BUT A WORD OF WARNING I'M NOT A STRONG SWIMMER. PLEASE... (LAUGHTER) HEY, ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, HERE'S A SENTENCE I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER SAY AGAIN: "MARCO RUBIO IS IN THE NEWS." (AUDIENCE REACTS) NOW, WHILE HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, RUBIO MADE IT CLEAR HE COULDN'T STAND BEING A SENATOR.
I'M MISSING VOTES BECAUSE I AM LEAVING THE SENATE, I'M NOT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION. A LOT OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING IN THE SENATE ISN'T GOING TO GO ANYWHERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX AMERICA WITH SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN.
STEPHEN: IN FACT, AS ONE FRIEND OF RUBIO'S TOLD THE WASHINGTON POST IN OCTOBER --
HE HATES IT.
STEPHEN: YES, THE SENATE IS A USELESS HUSK OF BUREAUCRATIC SEWAGE AAAAND HE MIGHT BE RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOW. THAT WAS A QUICK TURNAROUND. HEY! "SCREW YOU, SUCKERS! I'M OUTTA HERE! KISS MY CUBAN ASS! I'M GONNA BE PRESIDENT!" WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "HEY FELLAS. TOUGH JOB MARKET OUT THERE! WHELP, BACK TO THE GRINDSTONE. THEY STILL HAVE FREE COFFEE IN HERE? (LAUGHTER) ELSEWHERE IN THE SENATE, THIS AFTERNOON JOHN MCCAIN SAID THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORLANDO ATTACK. (AUDIENCE REACTS) HOLD ON. HOLD ON. NOW SOME ARE SAYING THAT MCCAIN ONLY SAID THIS BECAUSE HE'S FACING A TOUGH RE-ELECTION FIGHT, WHILE OTHERS ARE SAYING IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A DICK. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE WHICH OF THOSE IT IS. YOU DECIDE. SPEAKING OF WHICH: DONALD TRUMP HAS DOUBLED DOWN -- ON HIS CALL TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE U.S., AND HE'S BEING  CRITICIZED BY FELLOW REPUBLICANS. TRUMP IS FED UP WITH THE G.O.P.'S NAGGING.
THE REPUBLICANS -- HONESTLY FOLKS, OUR LEADERS HAVE TO GET TOUGHER. THIS IS TOO TOUGH TO DO IT ALONE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK I'M GOING TO BE FORCED TO. I THINK I'M GOING TO BE FORCED TO. OUR LEADERS HAVE TO GET A LOT TOUGHER AND BE QUIET. JUST PLEASE BE QUIET. DON'T TALK. PLEASE BE QUIET.

I BOOKED MY FIRST GIG WHEN I WAS 8, AND IT WAS ON BARNEY.
Stephen: BARNEY? BARNEY AND FRIENDS, BIG PURPLE DINOSAUR.
Stephen: WHAT WAS BARNEY LIKE?
BARNEY WAS ACTUALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE INSIDE THE SUIT. I'VE ALWAYS GONE FOR OLDER GUYS. EVEN WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I THOUGHT THE GUY INSIDE THE SUIT WAS HOT.
Stephen: BECAUSE BARNEY HIMSELF IS 92 MILLION YEARS OLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT WAS AN OLDER GUY. SO THE GUY WAS JACKED IN THERE?
YEAH, HE HAD TO BE BECAUSE THE SUIT IS, LIKE, 100 POUNDS.
Stephen: WOW! THAT CHANGE MISVIEW OF THAT SHOW.
I KNOW, RIGHT?
Stephen: AND NICK, HOW OWLED WERE YOU?
MY FIRST JOB WAS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY ON BROADWAY.
Stephen: WHAT SHOW? A CHRISTMAS CAROL, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST AND "LES MIZ." I STARTED WHEN I WAS SEVEN.
Stephen: AND NO CHILD STAR MELTDOWN UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE NOW.
I HAD ABOUT THREE.
Stephen: NICK, CATCH UP! SHE'S WAY AHEAD OF YOU AT THIS POINT.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING? HOPEFULLY NOT ANYTIME SOON.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU FIRST MEET.
DEMI WAS READING TO BE ON THE TV SHOW MY BROTHER AND I HAD CALLED JONAS. SHE DIDN'T GET IT BUT BOOKED THE LEAD IN CAMP ROCK WHICH WAS A BETTER PROJECT ANYWAY WHICH WASN'T SAYING A WHOLE LOT, BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN OUR TV SHOW, THAT'S FOR SURE, AND THAT'S HOW WE BECAME FRIENDS. WE WERE IN SCHOOL SHOOTING THE FILM AT THE SAME TIME AND ALSO WRITING MUSIC ABOUT MY BROTHER THAT SHE WAS --
OH, MY GOD, IT WAS SO FUNNY BECAUSE WE WERE --
Stephen: KIND OF. KIND OF. I WAS A LITTLE BURNED, A TENDER AGE OF 15 AND YOU WRITE A SONG ABOUT IT.
Stephen: WHO BURNED YOU, BARNEY?
NO, GOD BLESS HIM, BUT HIS BROTH SNORE OH, HIS BROTHER?
RIGHT. I WAS WRITING MY FIRST ALBUM AND WRITING A SONG CALLED "NAY GET CAUGHT" AND HE WAS IN THE ROOM, WE WERE ALL WRITING TOGETHER. AND HE SAID, MAYBE WE HAVE A HAPPY ENDING, AND I SAID, NO, I THINK HE GETS CAUGHT AND EVERYBODY SEES HE'S A HEARTBREAKER. AND NICK SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE JUST WRITE THE CHO CHORUS? HE WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH. HE'S BEEN STUCK IN THE MIDDLE A LONG TIME.
Stephen: WELL, NOW YOU'RE ON A 42-CITY TOUR. IT'S CALLED "FUTURE NOW." YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FROM THE HUNGER GAMES.
WE DO.
Stephen: WHAT DOES "FUTURE NOW" MEAN? IS IT FUTURE IS NOW.
SO I CAME UP WITH IT, AND IT WAS, LIKE, WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG PAST TOGETHER, GROWING UP TOGETHER THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE AND ON THE TOUR IT'S NOW. SO I WAS, LIKE, THE FUTURE IS NOW, I THINK WOULD BE A GREAT NAME. AND HE'S LIKE DROP THE "IS."

UM -- URUGUAY.
Stephen: URUGUAY, OKAY. I WAS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND IT WAS, LIKE, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY EVERY DAY, I FELT LIKE. I WOKE UP ONE DAY AND I WAS, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT COUNTRY I'M IN.
Stephen: WOW. I NOTICE SOMETHING ABOUT SOME OF THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHY YOU HAVE DONE AND SOME OF THE VIDEOS YOU'VE DONE. HERE'S ONE. (LAUGHTER) HERE YOU ARE IN THE WATER. HERE YOU ARE IN THE SHOWER. HERE YOU ARE IN A BATH. LET'S SEE --

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ONE.
Stephen: I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES! YOU GUYS, ARE YOU INVOLVED IN POLITICS AT ALL? HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANY OF THE CANDIDATES? I SAW YOU -- THERE IS A PICTURE OF YOU HERE WITH DONALD TRUMP. (AUDIENCE REACTS) IS THERE A STORY BEHIND THIS PHOTO HERE?
THERE IS A PRETTY FUNNY STORY. I WAS HOSTING MISS U.S.A. MAYBE THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO.
Stephen: BACK WHEN HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.
AND HE WAS THE OWNER OF THE MISS UNIVERSE ORGANIZATION.
Stephen: RIGHT. O I'M UP THERE AND THE PROMPTER GIVES YOU ALL THE SCRIPT FOR THE SHOW AND WAS WORKING THE WHOLE TIME UNTIL IT COMES TIME TO INTRODUCE MR. TRUMP AND THE PROMPTER WENT OUT. I WAS ALL BY MYSELF WITH NOTHING, NO SCRIPT. SO I SAID ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, DONALD TRUMP. AND WHEN HE CAME UP, HE SAID, THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON. (LAUGHTER)

Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU, JON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS, EVERYBODY! QUICK SURVEY FOR THE AUDIENCE: ANYBODY HERE. WRITE LOVE LETTERS? (CHEERING) LOVE LETTERS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. WHEN I FIRST STARTED DATING MY WIFE, SHE LIVED IN NEW YORK AND I LIVED IN CHICAGO AND WE WERE BOTH YOUNG ACTORS AND WE COULD NOT AFFORD TO TALK ON THE PHONE AND THERE WAS NO INTERNET AT THE TIME, SO WE WROTE EACH OTHER LOVE LETTERS. I WROTE HER ALMOST EVERY DAY. IT'S WHAT ALMOST MADE ME A WRITER. I DIDN'T LIKE THE ACT OF WRITING, I THINK I WAS DYSLEXIC, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. BUT I KNOW I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH HER UNLESS I WROTE HER EVERY DAY AND THAT TURNED ME INTO A WRITER. NOW WE HAVE BOXES AND BOXES OF LOVE LETTERS THAT MY CHILDREN WILL NEVER GET TO READ. (LAUGHTER) UNTIL I AM OLD ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE CUTE AND NOT CREEPY. ANYWAY, SO I REALLY LIKE LOVE LETTERS. I FOUND OUT THAT A LOVE LETTER WRITTEN BY JOHN F. KENNEDY WENT UP FOR AUCTION TODAY. IT SHOWS J.F.K. AT HIS MOST ROMANTIC, ONLY THE ONE SMALL QUIBBLE IS HE WAS MARRIED TO SOMEONE ELSE AT THE TIME. (LAUGHTER) WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE? THE LETTER IS TO PAINTER AND SOCIALITE MARY PINCHOT MEYER, WHO WAS A KENNEDY FAMILY FRIEND WITH BENEFITS. (LAUGHTER) THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND HERE'S WHAT IT SAID: "WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE SUBURBIA FOR ONCE, COME AND SEE ME, EITHER HERE OR AT THE CAPE NEXT WEEK OR IN BOSTON. YOU SAY THAT IT IS GOOD FOR ME NOT TO GET WHAT I WANT. AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS, YOU SHOULD GIVE ME A MORE LOVING ANSWER THAN THAT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY YES?" WHICH IS THE PRESIDENTIAL EQUIVALENT OF "YOU UP?" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE DO THESE THINGS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE I AM HARD. (LAUGHTER) I APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE. THE LETTER'S EXPECTED TO GO FOR AT LEAST $30,000, AND WHEN I HEARD THAT, I DID WHAT ANY HISTORIAN WOULD DO -- GO UP TO MY ATTIC AND SEE IF I HAD ANY PRESIDENTIAL LOVE LETTERS LYING AROUND. TURNS OUT, I DID, AND I'M GOING TO SHARE THEM WITH YOU. RIGHT NOW. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. (APPLAUSE) THE FIRST ONE'S FROM OUR FIRST PRESIDENT, GEORGE WASHINGTON, TO HIS FUTURE WIFE MARTHA. HE WROTE, "MY DARLING MARTHA, I CANNOT TELL A LIE. YOU'VE GOT AN BUTT LIKE A VIRGINIA HAM. I'M GOING USE MY WOODEN TEETH TO TEAR ME OFF A PIECE OF THAT." (LAUGHTER) KIND OF SWEET. HE WAS THE FATHER OF OUR COUNTRY. OKAY. HERE'S ONE FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO HIS FUTURE WIFE, MARY TODD. "MY DEAREST MARY. I YEARN FOR YOUR GENTLE KISS, YOUR SWEET CARESS. I THINK THAT PROVES PRETTY DEFINITIVELY TO FUTURE HISTORIANS THAT I LIKED WOMEN." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THERE ARE RUMORS. THERE ARE STORIES. WHICH IS FINE. OKAY. OH, HERE'S A VERY RARE LETTER FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON TO HIS LOVER AND SLAVE, SALLY HEMMINGS. "MY DEAREST SALLY, I AM YOURS. I MEAN, TECHNICALLY YOU ARE MINE. BUT WHO'S KEEPING TRACK." (LAUGHTER) I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP.
Jon: OH!
Stephen: IT'S A TRUE STORY. IT'S HISTORY. THIS ONE'S A LITTLE RACY, FROM WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT TO HIS LOVER MARY BETH WHITESHAW. "MY SWEET AND NAUGHTY GIRL: SITTING HERE NAKED IN MY BATH, I CAN'T HELP BUT WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH ME, PREFERABLY WITH SOME KIND OF CROWBAR, BECAUSE I'M STUCK AGAIN. COME QUICKLY, MY LOVE."

THE PRUDES AND PURITANS WILL SAY IT'S WRONG OF ME TO LOVE A MOOSE, BUT YOUR ENGORGED DEWLAP INFLAMES MY--" LET'S JUST STOP THERE. IT GETS PRETTY -- THAT IS A GOOD LOOKING MOOSE, THOUGH, I'VE GOT TO SAY. THIS ONE'S FROM WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, WHO DIED OF PNEUMONIA A MERE 32 DAYS INTO HIS TERM, TO HIS MISTRESS AMANDA. "MY TURTLEDOVE. WORDS ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO EXPRESS... AND I'M DEAD!" (LAUGHTER) FINALLY, FROM HARRY TRUMAN TO HIS BELOVED WIFE BESS, IN THAT WONDERFULLY BLUNT MIDWESTERN STYLE: "DEAR BESS.
