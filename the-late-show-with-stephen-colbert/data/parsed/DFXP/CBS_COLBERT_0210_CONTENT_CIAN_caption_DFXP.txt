KNOW WHY. THE INTERVIEW ALSO REVEALED THAT TRUMP EATS A FAIR AMOUNT OF FAST FOOD BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO HIM, "AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN IT." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN IT? DONALD, THE ONLY THING WE KNOW LESS ABOUT THAN WHAT'S IN FAST FOOD IS WHAT IS IN YOUR TAX RETURNS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN GOOD DR. ASKED THE 70-YEAR- THEN GOOD DR. ASKED THE 70-YEAR- OLD CANDIDATE TO DIAGNOSE HIMSELF.
WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE MIRROR, HOW OLD IS THE PERSON YOU ARE LOOKING AT? WHAT DO YOU SEE?
I WOULD SAY, I SEE A PERSON THAT'S 35 YEARS OLD. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: 35? DONALD, THAT'S NOT YOUR REFLECTION, THAT'S YOUR WIFE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!
Jon: COLD BLOODED! IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. TRUMP ALSO SAID HE DOESN'T EXERCISE THAT OFTEN BUT, EVEN, SO HE'S GOOD ENOUGH AT GOLF TO PLAY WITH THE PGA. THAT'S A REAL MEDICAL SHOCKER. JUDGING BY THE SIZE OF HIS HANDS, I WOULD HAVE GUESSED MINIGOLF. (PIANO RIFF)
Stephen: NOW, SPEAKING OF WHICH, ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, OVERALL, MOST U.S. MEN ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR GENITALS. SO SATISFIED, IN FACT, THAT MANY WOULD LIKE TO TEXT YOU A PICTURE OF THEM. THE RESEARCHERS BEHIND THIS SURVEY CAME UP WITH A SCALE CALLED THE "INDEX OF MALE GENITAL IMAGE," ALSO KNOWN AS "TINDER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS INDEX ASKED HOW MEN FELT ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR GENITALS, SUCH AS PENIS LENGTH, GIRTH, SHAPE, AND SCENT. LOOK, FELLAS, IF YOU CAN GET YOUR NOSE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SMELL YOUR OWN GENITALS, FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) SECOND OF ALL... SECOND OF ALL... WHEN DO YOU EVER GO OUT? ( LAUGHTER ) RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT OUT OF THE NEARLY 4,000 MEN SURVEYED, A TOTAL OF 86% WERE CLASSIFIED AS "SATISFIED" WITH THEIR PENISES. WHILE THE OTHER 14% SAID, "YES, OF COURSE I'M SATISFIED. WHY, WHAT DID YOU HEAR? HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO LISA?" YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS SOME WAY THEY COULD BE SURVEYED, I'M NOT SURE IF THE PENISES WOULD BE ALL THAT SATISFIED WITH THE MEN THEY WERE ATTACHED TO. "EHH, HE'S OKAY. COULD BE A LITTLE TALLER. ALSO, WHY WON'T HE LET ME SLEEP?" NOW, SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE
Stephen: YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THIS ELECTION IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, AND WHETHER BIG DONORS RECEIVED FAVORS FROM HILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, IT HAS DONE REAL CHARITY WORK-- EARTHQUAKE RELIEF IN HAITI, EXPANDED ACCESS TO H.I.V. DRUGS IN AFRICA, AND ONE ASSUMES THEY'RE WORKING ON A CURE FOR SECRET PNEUMONIA. BUT NOW-- SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT. BUT NOW TRUMP IS UNDER FIRE FOR HIS CHARITY, THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, BECAUSE IT GAVE AN ILLEGAL DONATION TO FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND RUSH CHAIRMAN WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE THE THETA MATERIAL, PAM BONDI, WHEN SHE WAS CONSIDERING INVESTIGATING FRAUD AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. AND YESTERDAY, WE LEARNED THAT NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN IS INVESTIGATING TRUMP'S FOUNDATION. WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE TRUMP FOUNDATION. ALL WE KNOW IS THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE FOUNDATION'S MONEY COMES FROM PEOPLE OTHER THAN TRUMP. AND TRUMP IS TRULY GENEROUS WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. FOR INSTANCE, IN 2010, TRUMP GOT A TROPHY FROM THE PALM BEACH POLICE FOUNDATION FOR HIS "SELFLESS SUPPORT" OF ITS CAUSE. AND THAT'S UNUSUAL, BECAUSE TRUMP USUALLY MARRIES HIS TROPHIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AGAIN, BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. AND THIS SELFLESS GIFT TRULY HAD NO "SELF" IN IT BECAUSE THE $150,000 HE GAVE TO THE PALM BEACH POLICE CAME DIRECTLY FROM A NEW JERSEY CHARITY WHO GAVE THE MONEY TO HIS FOUNDATION. THAT $150-GRAND COULDN'T BE A MORE OF A RE-GIFT IF IT WAS ON AN iTUNES GIFT CARD. BEST OF ALL, IN THE TRUMP CHARITABLE SPIRIT, TRUMP MAY HAVE ACTUALLY MADE MONEY THAT NIGHT BECAUSE THE GALA WAS HELD AT HIS MAR-A-LAGO RESORT, AND THE POLICE FOUNDATION PAID TO RENT THE ROOM. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THAT'S THE SOUL OF CHARITY: YOU SCRATCH MY BACK, AND I RENT YOU A BACK-SCRATCHER. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, ONE OF THE FOUNDATION'S BIGGEST CAUSES SEEMS TO BE "FUN THINGS TO PUT IN DONALD TRUMP'S OFFICE". BECAUSE IN CHARITY AUCTIONS, IT SPENT $12,000 ON A FOOTBALL HELMET AUTOGRAPHED BY TIM TEBOW, AND $20,000 ON A SIX-FOOT-TALL PAINTING OF DONALD TRUMP. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT PAINTING. DO WE HAVE THAT, JIMMY? ( LAUGHTER ) THERE YOU GO. YES. THAT, OF COURSE, IS ACTUALLY VIGO THE CARPATHIAN FROM "GHOSTBUSTERS TWO," BUT THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT THIS AFTERNOON, I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD MADE IT UP. ( LAUGHTER ) IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HE WOULD BUY. AND WITH ALL THIS GOOD WORK, IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE TRUMP FOUNDATION HAS A STAFF OF FOUR TRUMPS: DONALD, IVANKA, ERIC AND DONALD JR., WHO WORK A GRUELING HALF-HOUR A WEEK, AND THAT INCLUDES TWO 15-MINUTE BREAKS. ( LAUGHTER ) GOT TO HAVE 'EM. YOU GOTTA REST. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU GOTTA REST. BUT DESPITE ALL THIS CONTROVERSY, THE TRUMP FOUNDATION IS CONTINUING ITS CHARITABLE OUTREACH WITH THIS NEW AD WE SOMEHOW EXCLUSIVELY ACQUIRED. ♪ ♪
EVERY WEEK, CHILDREN LIKE THESE ARE FORCED TO WORK FOR DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MINUTES ON A HEARTBREAKING TASK-- TRYING TO MAKE DONALD TRUMP LOOK GENEROUS. THAT'S WHY THE TRUMP FOUNDATION NEEDS YOUR HELP. FOR JUST THE PRICE OF A CUP OF COFFEE-- INSIDE A NEW LEXUS-- YOU CAN HELP DONALD TRUMP BUY SO MANY THINGS, LIKE SOME SOLID GOLD DESKTOP CLACKY BALLS, A DIAMOND TROPHY THAT SAYS MOST CHARITABLE AND A TIGER SIGNED BY PEYTON MANNING. THE TRUMP FOUNDATION, AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU HELPED OUT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, MY FRIENDS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY-NOMINATED  ACTRESS WHO STARS IN ABC'S "BLACK-ISH." PLEASE WELCOME TRACEE ELLIS ROSS! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. THAT IS AN ABSOLUTELY STUNNING DRESS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN IT.
DOLCE & GABBANA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IS THIS YOUR FIRST EMMY NOMINATION? CONGRATULATIONS.
IT IS. WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY IT, I THOUGHT I LIKE THAT SOUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WERE YOU AWAKE WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT?
STEPHANIE ANDERSON, WITH-- ANTHONY ANDERSON DID THE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND I WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF MY TELEVISION. HE'S A VERY ENERGETIC HUMAN.
Stephen: YES, HE IS. AND SO I WAS VERY EXCITED FOR HIM. AND WHEN IT GOT TO MY CATEGORY, I THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD, ARE THEY DOING THE E OF THE ELLIS OR THE R OF THE ROSS, AND THEN I THOUGHT, THEY PASSED THE Es! AND THEN I GOT SO EXCITED I GOT UP, RAN AROUND MY DINING ROOM TABLE, OPENED THE FRONT DOOR, RAN OUTSIDE AND RAN AROUND AND I THOUGHT, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THERE IS NOWHERE TO GO! CALL SOMEBODY!"
Stephen: SO YOU WERE RUNNING AROUND SCREAMING IN YOUR FRONT YARD?
TOTALLY.
Stephen: DID THE NEIGHBORS THINK THERE WAS A FIRE?
OH, THEY'RE TOTALLY USED TO THAT.
Stephen: YOU JUST INFORMED ME OF SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT, THE EMMYS ARE ALPHABETIZED. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
ANTHONY, WHEN THEY DID HIS CATEGORY, HIS NAME WAS FIRST. HE MUST HAVE PICKED THE NAME AA, ANTHONY --
Stephen: OR ACE ACME. NOT AS GOOD.
Stephen: YOUR FAMILY CELEBRATED WHEN YOU GOT NOMINATED. THIS IS A FULL-PAGE AD, CONGRATULATIONS TO MY DAUGHTER TRACEE ELLIS ROSS -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- SO SWEET. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOUR MOM, THE FONT OF "MOM" IS BIGGER THAN "TRACEE ELLIS ROSS." ( LAUGHTER )
I HADN'T ACTUALLY NOTICED THAT.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT'S LIKE A YEARBOOK TIMES A HUNDRED.
Stephen: IT IS. DID ANYBODY SIGN IT?
NO, BUT YOU SHOULD SIGN IT.
Stephen: HOLD ON. "STAY SWEET. HAVE A GREAT SUMMER."
YOU SHOULD MAKE A HEART OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WE'LL HAVE THIS SHELLACKED AND FRAMED.
EXACTLY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH, I'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH SOME OF YOUR CO-STARS, AND I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION, WHAT IS BLACK-ISH?
OKAY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THE BLACK EXPERIENCE, I DON'T THINK I KNOW THE BLACK-ISH EXPERIENCE. WHAT IS BLACK-ISH AS OPPOSED TO BLACK?
OKAY.
Stephen: GOOD QUESTION. IT'S THE HOT SEAT. 30 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK.
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SHOW EXPRESSES, BEING BLACK IS NOT A MONOLITHIC EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: MM-HMM.
SO OUR SHOW EXPLORES WHAT IT IS TO BE BLACK TODAY AND HOW THAT EVOLVED AND HOW IT'S CHANGING AND WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE IS FOR THIS FAMILY. SO-- THAT DOES NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.
Stephen: NO, ANYTHING ANSWERS MY QUESTION.
SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS. IT'S EXPLORING WHAT BLACK IS TODAY.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO BE BLACK TO BE BLACK-ISH BECAUSE I'M DEFINITELY NOT BLACK. DOES ANYONE HAVE A SHOT AT BEING BLACK-ISH? COULD I HAVE A SHOT AT BEING BLACK-ISH?
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU MISSED THE POINT BY ASKING THAT QUESTION. ( LAUGHTER ) HOWEVER... HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND THAT, WITHIN THAT QUESTION IS YOUR DESIRE TO BE BLACK.
Stephen: TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER IS WHAT MY DESIRE IS BECAUSE I AM WHITE.
YES, AND I AM HALF WHITE.
Stephen: REALLY? YES.
Stephen: I AM ALL WHITE. ( LAUGHTER ) AS A MATTER OF FACT, IN WEBSTER'S, THERE IS A LITTLE PICTURE OF ME NEXT TO THE WORD "WHITE." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GREW UP ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
BUT I THINK THE THING IS, THOUGH, I BELIEVE IN A COLORFUL WORLD. SO IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU NEEDING TO BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU ARE. IT'S ABOUT TWO PEOPLE CELEBRATING WHAT THEY ARE AND FINDING THE CONNECTION IN THAT AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU WERE A MODEL WHEN YOU STARTED.
A SHORT TIME.
Stephen: A SHORT, FUN TIME? YES.
LOTS OF NOT EATING.
Stephen: THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE FUN AT ALL.
THERE WERE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES. WHEN I WAS IN MY EARLY 20s-- I'M 43 NOW SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT AGO, 21 TO 23, I WALKED INTO A FASHION SHOW IN PARIS AND DID SOME MODELING. MOST OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE LIKE, "COULD YOU STOP TALKING AND BE SEXY?" I WOULD BE TELLING JOKES AND BEING SILLY.
Stephen: DID YOU GO TO FASHION WEEK?
I CAUGHT A SHOW, I WENT TO THE MARC JACOBS SHOW. I CAUGHT A SHOW.
Stephen: WOW. DID ANYBODY GET WOBBLY ON THE HIGH HEELS?
THESE WERE NOT HIGH HEELS. THEY WERE PLATFORM EXTRAORDINARY SHOES.
Stephen: THEY WERE HIGH THOUGH.
BEYOND HIGH, FOUR BRICKS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
Stephen: I WATCH FASHION SHOWS LIKE I WATCH NASCAR, I'M WAITING FOR THE ANKLES TO SNAP.
THAT'S TERRIBLE!
Stephen: WHY? THAT'S HILARIOUS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY, HONEYMOON SALAD?
Stephen: LETTUCE ALONE, NO DRESSING.
IS IT LIKE A SKINNY MARTINI WHERE THEY PUT A LOT OF VODKA AND NOTHING ELSE.
Stephen: JUST WAVE THE VERMOUTH BOTTLE AT IT?
YES.
Stephen: ABE WOULD SAY $8 WITH THE EARLY BIRD SPECIAL WITH THE SCROD. HE WOULD DO THIS EVERY NIGHT. JUST LIKE I DO.
NOT AT ALL!
Stephen: YOU HAVE A CHARACTER.
YES.
Stephen: WHO IS THIS?
CLYDE.
Stephen: THIS IS ACTUALLY YOU.
OKAY. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH ACCENT)
COULD I BE OFFENDED CLYDE IS BORING BECAUSE TRACEE IS BORING? MY NAME IS HER NAME-- (PRONOUNCING NAME)
Stephen: COULD THAT MEAN MUSHROOM?
YES. (SPEAKING FRENCH)
BUT I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH, ONLY SPEAK WITH A FRENCH ACCENT.
Stephen: SO WHAT WOULD SHE MAKE OF MY OUTFIT?
OH, IT'S NOTHING.
Stephen: NOTHING? NO, IT'S NOTHING, NOTHING IS HAPPENING HERE, NO STYLE, IT'S JUST CLOTHING. NOW, THIS... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WILL TELL YOU, STEFAN, I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND.
Stephen: I WANT TO BE BLACKISH. ( LAUGHTER ) "BLACK-ISH" SEASON THREE PREMIERES SEPTEMBER 21 ON ABC. TRACEE ELLIS ROSS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT JUST MIGHT CALM YOU DOWN. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! HEY, I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND DRAMATIC, BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE, AND I THINK IT'S THE ELECTION THAT'S GOING TO KILL US. SEE, TENSIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER, BECAUSE WITH LESS THAN EIGHT DAYS UNTIL EARLY VOTING STARTS, DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE TIED IN THE POLLS. WHICH MEANS NO MATTER WHO YOU SUPPORT, YOUR PRETTY UPSET. I MEAN, THAT CANDIDATE MIGHT WIN?! THE UNTRUSTWORTHY ONE, WITH THE QUESTIONABLE FOUNDATION?! THE ONE WITH THE FAMOUS DAUGHTER AND THE MARRIAGE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?! AND WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH STUFF?! THAT PERSON CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK HEALTHY. PLUS, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, THEY'RE FROM NEW YORK. LOOK, THAT PERSON IS FROM NEW YORK, WHOEVER YOU SUPPORT, THAT OTHER ONE. LOOK, DEMOCRACY'S HAD A GREAT RUN, AND SO-- OH, EXCUSE ME. THAT GENTLE TAP ON MY SHOULDER MEANS IT'S TIME FOR... A "LATE SHOW" POLITE REMINDER. TONIGHT'S POLITE REMINDER: THERE'S NO NEED TO REACH FOR THE PISTOL, OR THE PLASTIC BAG AND THE DUCT TAPE. JUST STEP OUT OF THE BATH AND PUT THAT TOASTER DOWN. YOU SEE, HERE'S THE POLITE REMINDER-- A TIE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES AROUND THIS TIME IN THE CAMPAIGN HAS HAPPENED IN EVERY ELECTION OF THIS CENTURY. ROMNEY AND OBAMA WERE TIED AROUND NOW. OBAMA AND JOHN McCAIN WERE TIED ON SEPTEMBER 17-- TWO DAYS FROM NOW. GEORGE W. BUSH AND AL GORE ARE  STILL  TIED. ONE OF THEM WON THE VOTE, THE OTHER WON THE PRESIDENCY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S EVEN! SO, OF COURSE HILLARY AND TRUMP ARE TIED RIGHT NOW. IT'S INEVITABLE. IN FACT, A LATE-BREAKING TIE IS ALMOST AS INEVITABLE AS YOU THOUGHT HILLARY WAS. AND THIS HAS BEEN "THE LATE SHOW" POLITE REMINDER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, IN A RELATED STORY, NATIONAL POLLS SHOW 7.6% OF VOTERS ARE STILL UNDECIDED. REALLY? ( LAUGHTER ) GIVEN HOW PASSIONATE PEOPLE ARE ON BOTH SIDES, HOW CAN YOU STILL BE UNSURE? THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "HMM, WHAT DO I WANT FOR BREAKFAST? CHEERIOS OR A BOWL OF HORNETS? I BET THEY STAY CRUNCHY IN MILK." ( LAUGHTER ) AND YET, EVERYBODY IS CHECKING THE POLLS EVERY DAY. EVERYONE'S DESPERATE FOR ANY WAY TO READ THE TEA LEAVES. WELL, THE GOOD PEOPLE AT SNAPPLE WANT TO HELP-- WITH TEACISION 2016. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: YOU GOT TWO DIFFERENT BOTTLES BEING PUT UP THIS YEAR. THIS TEA WITH A RED LABEL, WHICH COULD REPRESENT REPUBLICANS, OR DONALD TRUMP'S FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS TEA WITH A BLUE LABEL, WHICH COULD REPRESENT DEMOCRATS, OR INDICATE THE FLAVOR "SECRET BLUE-MONIA." ( LAUGHTER ) SO GO OUT AND GET WHICHEVER ONE SUITS YOU MOST. IT'S AS EASY AS BUYING A CANDIDATE... OR A TALKSHOW HOST! BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING YOURSELF, "WAS THIS A PAID PROMOTION OF SNAPPLE'S DELICIOUS AND FUN TEACISION 2016?" FUN FACT: YES, IT WAS! AND IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE UNDECIDEDS, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO: YOU JUST MIX THEM TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT? IT'S A POETIC AND BEAUTIFUL WAY TO BUY TWICE AS MUCH SNAPPLE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANDREW RANNELLS. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS THE TONY AND GRAMMY AWARD- WINNING STAR OF "THE BOOK OF MORMON" AND "GIRLS." PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW RANNELLS! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU! WHAT'S HAPPENING? NICE TO SEE YOU! IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU.
Stephen: IT HAS. THE FIRST TIME YOU AND I MET, I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF INTRODUCING YOU AT THE TONYs FOR "THE BOOK OF MORMON." ( APPLAUSE )
WE HAD BEEN DOING THE SHOW BUT OUT OF CONTEXT LIKE THAT IT'S TERRIFYING TO BE THRUST ON TO THAT STAGE IN FRONT OF TENS OF PEOPLE, HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE WATCH THE TONYs. BUT I WAS REALLY SCARED AND THEN THAT SONG STARTED AND I WAS, LIKE, IT'S GOING TO BE FINE, IT'S GOING TO BE FINE, THEN ALL THE MOISTURE LEFT MY MOUTH, SO I STARTED SINGING, AND I LOOKED LIKE EITHER JIM CARREY FROM THE MASK OR A COKE WHORE-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, WHAT WERE THE TWO CHOICES?
JIM CARREY OR COKE WHORE WHICH IS ODDLY THE SAME THINGS I SAID I WANTED TO BE WHEN I GROW UP. ( LAUGHTER ) YES, BUT IT WAS GOOD. AND THEN I GOT TO SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE AT A PARTY WHICH WAS MORE FUN AND I WAS DRUNK AND--
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. WHEN YOU DO THIS, YOU STILL LOOK HAPPY.
WELL, YOU CAN DO THIS AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SMILE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORK THE MUSCLE. I'M GOING TO REMEMBER THAT NEXT TIME I'M, LIKE, NOT FEELING VERY HAPPY AT DWAYNE REED.
Stephen: GOOD PROM PHOTO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OH, MY PROM PHOTO.
Stephen: RIGHT THERE. CAN YOU TELL I WAS AGGRESSIVELY OVERCOMPENSATING FOR BEING A GAY STUDENT IN AN ALL-BOYS CATHOLIC SCHOOL?
Stephen: YEAH.
AND THAT'S MY FRIEND RANDI NEWTON WITH WHOM I'M STILL FRIENDS TODAY. I WAS 17 IN THAT PHOTO AND I THINK SHE WAS 20. IN HIGH SCHOOL, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND A 20-YEAR-OLD IS LIKE, WHAT THE WHAT? SHE'S SHOWING UP, SHE'S NOT EVEN WEARING A PROPER PROM DRESS, SHE'S WEARING LIKE A COCKTAIL DRESS, THE PRIEST LOST THEIR (BLEEP) MINDS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THEN EVERYBODY ASSUMED I WAS SUCH A PLAYER. THEY'RE LIKE, OH, RANNELLS BROUGHT THAT GIRL AND DOING SHOW TUNES WITH HER. WASN'T HAVING SEX! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AS WELL YOU SHOULDN'T. YOU'RE FROM OKLAHOMA.
OMAHA, NEBRASKA.
Stephen: ONE OF THOSE STATES GETS AN APOLOGY NOW.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE FROM NICE PEOPLE. YOU HAVE BEEN IN SOME OBSCENE SHOWS. "THE BOOK OF MORMON" IS BRILLIANT BUT MAY BE THE DIRTIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
I GUESS.
Stephen: AND GIRLS GETS DOWN AND DIRTY AT TIMES.
TREY PARKER, WHEN WE WERE REHEARSING, HE WOULD SAY I DON'T KNOW IF THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO GO FOR THIS. TREY WOULD SAY, I'M FROM THE MIDWEST AND RANNELLS IS FROM THE MIDWEST, THAT'S WHERE ALL THE DIRTY PEOPLE ARE FROM.
Stephen: FROM THE CENTER. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
SOME PEOPLE ASSUME IT'S THE COAST, THOSE ARE THE HEATHENS. NO, IT'S RIGHT IN THE CENTER.
Stephen: THE MIDWESTERN PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THEY'RE BEING DIRTY SO IT COUNTS.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT PEOPLE ON THE COAST ARE SO FILTHY THEY CAN'T EVEN TELL ANYMORE.
THEY DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: SO "GIRLS" RAPPING WRAPPING UP.
YES, WE'RE FINISHING.
Stephen: HOW DID THE GIRLS CHANGE OVER THE SEASONS?
OUR FIRST JOB ON TELEVISION. I'M NOT THE AGE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE SHOW BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE PROPER AGE.
Stephen: YOU COULD BE ANY AGE BETWEEN 20 AND 42 AND I WOULD BELIEVE YOU.
I'LL TAKE BOTH SIDES OF THAT.
Stephen: OKAY.
NO, IT'S BEEN GOOD. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THE CAST IS, LIKE, IT MUST BE CRAZY, YOUNG ACTRESSES.
Stephen: COOL.
NO, IT'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BONE DENSITY AND, LIKE, NON-- LIKE THEY CAN'T HAVE DAIRY. IT'S A LOT OF TALK LIKE THAT. IT'S MORE LIKE THE GOLDEN GIRLS THAN GIRLS, GIRLS. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP GOING THEY WILL ALL LOOK LIKE RUE McCLANAHAN.
THEY SHOULD.
Stephen: YOU ARE THE BIG STAR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT IS THIS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT IS THIS?
WELL, THAT IS FROM A SHOW YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF CALLED POKÉMON LIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) 2000, I BELIEVE IT WAS. YEAH, RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL. I WILL NOT SAY THIS ACTRESS' NAME BECAUSE I'M SURE SHE WOULD PROBABLY SUE ME.
Stephen: SHE'S IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE I SEE WE WERE IN THAT SHOW TOGETHER AND IT'S AS IF WE DID PORN TOGETHER OR MADE A SNUFF FILM TOGETHER.
Stephen: THAT'S MORE MIDWESTERN DIRTY, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS CBS, WE DON'T SAY "SNUFF FILM" HERE.
MY CAREER HAS DONE BETTER?
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING BACK TO BROADWAY OR FOR A REMAKE OF "FALSETTOS."
YES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'RE BUILT FOR THIS SHOW.
I'M VERY FLATTERED. IT'S A SHOW THAT'S NEVER BEEN REVISED. I'M A HUGE FAN. IT WAS IN THE TONY AWARDS IN 1992 AND I WAS SO BLOWN AWAY BY IT. IT'S A REALLY CRAZY THING THAT I ACTUALLY GET TO BE A PART OF IT WITH A GREAT CAST.
Stephen: YOU ALL GET MIDWESTERN DIRTY.
LITTLE ANTHONY ROSENTHAL, THE 12-YEAR-OLD, IS MAKING HIS BROADWAY DEBUT.
