Stephen: OKAY, I'M WITH JIMMY SPIT HILL, AMERICA'S CUP TWO-TIME CHAMPION. JIMMY, THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON BOARD AMERICA'S SUPER CHARGED HYDROFOIL SAILPOET. HOW FAST ARE WE GOING RIGHT NOW?
STEPHEN, WE HAVEN'T EVEN LEFT THE DOCK YET. ( LAUGHTER ) GET IT OUT, BUDDY.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES DAVID DUCHOVNY. AARON TVEIT. AND A PERFORMANCE BY WORLD-CLASS JUGGLER ALEXANDER KOBLIKOV. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"!  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY!
Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? HEY, EVERYBODY! HI, UP THERE. HEY! IS WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. HELLO. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." OI AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY, FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. THANK GOD IT IS FRIDAY, WHICH IS TOTALLY IS. I IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN NEW YORK, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN TIMES SQUARE. AND IF YOU DO LIVE IN NEW YORK, YOU ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TIMES SQUARE, BECAUSE WE DO NOT SET FOOT IN THAT HELLSCAPE. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S ABOUT THE UNLICENSED COSTUMED CHARACTERS WHO DRESS UP AND TAKE PICTURES FOR TIPS. YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE UNLICENSED BY THEIR SLIGHTLY-IRREGULAR COSTUMES AND THEIR TENDENCY TOWARD RACISM AND VIOLENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THESE GUYS AND GALS ARE ALWAYS RUNNING AFOUL OF THE LAW. OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS ALONE, AN ELMO WAS ARRESTED FOR SHOUTING ANTI-SEMETIC RANTS, CHEWBACCA AND A STORMTROOPER WERE ARRESTED FOR INTIMIDATING A MAN INTO GIVING THEM $10 EACH, AND COOKIE MONSTER WAS ARRESTED FOR GROPING A TEENAGER. ( LAUGHTER ) "C" IS FOR-- YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT "C" IS FOR. ( LAUGHTER ) IF THERE WAS ONLY A SUPERHERO WHO COULD PUT A STOP TO SOMETHING LIKE, THIS LIKE SPIDER-MAN. UNFORTUNATELY, SPIDER-MAN WAS FINED $370 FOR PUNCHING A TOURIST. WOW! YOU CAN PUNCH TOURISTS IN TIMES SQUARE FOR ONLY $370? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT IS CHEAPER THAN "HAMILTON." ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, THE CITY IS TRYING OUT A NEW WAY TO BRING ORDER TO THE TROUBLED AREA.
IT'S A NEW, BRIGHTER LOOK FOR TIMES SQUARE -- THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW COLOR-CODED DESIGNATED ZONES PAINTED OVERNIGHT. AREAS WITH THE GREEN PAINT WILL BE SO-CALLED CHILL ZONES WHERE PEDESTRIANS CAN RELAX WITHOUT CONCERN ABOUT BEING APPROACHED BY THE TOPLESS PAINTED LADIES AND OTHER CHARACTERS.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE RUNNING TO HOME BASE WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING TAG, EXCEPT INSTEAD OF PLAYING TAG, YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME CALLED "SUPER MARIO GRAB-ASS." AND THEY'RE NOT JUST ADDING CHILL ZONES. THERE ARE VIOLET-HUED EXPRESS LANES, WHERE PEOPLE CAN WALK WITHOUT HASSLE. AND THERE ARE THE AZURE BLUE DESIGNATED ACTIVITY ZONES WHERE COSTUMED AND UNCOSTUMED CHARACTERS CAN POSE FOR PICTURES IN EXCHANGE FOR TIPS. I THINK THIS IS GREAT THAT THEY'RE CONTAINING CHARACTE CHARACTERS IN THESE BOXES. AND THEY'LL DEFINITELY WORK BECAUSE A MAN WHO'S WILLING TO PUNCH A TOURIST OVER $10 WILL CERTAINLY RESPECT THE AUTHORITY OF A COLORED SIDEWALK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, BE CAREFUL. JUST BE CAREFUL. HEY, HERE'S A QUICK QUESTION. WHO HERE ENJOYS SHOUTING AND CLAPPING? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ME, TOO, ME, TOO. THAT'S NICE. I'M SORRY, I MISREAD THAT. I'M SORRY, I MISREAD THAT. WHO HERE LIKES MARIJUANA ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO, YOU DUMMIES. NOW THE COPS HAVE YOU ON TOP ADMITTING IT. I'VE GOT ONE MORE THING FOR TO YOU CHEER ABOUT BECAUSE RECENTLY, RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT CHRONIC MARIJUANA USE IS ABOUT AS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AS NOT FLOSSING. BAD NEWS ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE NOT FLOSS CATEGORY GIVE YOU BAD BREATH AND YOUR ALTOID TIN IS FILLED WITH WEED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HEAR. I HEAR. I HEAR THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE KEEP IT. NOW, THE STUDY FOUND THAT OVER THE COURSE OF MARIJUANA USERS' LIVES, SMOKING POT HAD NO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS, EXCEPT A HIGHER RATE OF GUM DISEASE, AND FROM THIS MOMENT ON, PARANOIA ABOUT GETTING GUM DISEASE. YOUR DENTIST TOTALLY KNOWS. SO IT TURNS OUT POT ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS. AND I'M SURE THIS NEWS IS REALLY RESONATING WITH MY INTERN, STONEY VON DANKINGTON. SAY HI TO STONEY, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, STONEY, DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS? YOU MUST BE PRETTY EXCITED, RIGHT?
I'M PRETTY STOKED. I'M PRETTY STOKED. HEY, STEPHEN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?
Stephen: STONEY IT'S NOWHERE NEAR 4:20, OKAY. IT'S LIKE 11:40 AT THIS POINT.
11:40! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!
Stephen: TIME TO SMOKE WEED MAYBE.
WHAT? NO, 11:40 IS THE PERFECT TIME TO NOT FLOSS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S VERY NICE. THAT'S VERY NICE. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FLOSS, WHY ARE YOU PULLING OUT ALL THAT FLOSS?
WHY ARE YOU ASKING, MAN? ARE YOU A DENTIST? YOU KNOW, LEGALLY, YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF YOU'RE A DENTIST.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK I LEGALLY HAVE TO DO THAT, BUT, NO, I'M NOT A DENTIST.
SORRY, SORRY, PARTY FOUL. YOU WANT TO PARTAKE IN THE FLOSSY-TOSSY?
Stephen: NO, THANKS, STONEY. FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET SO MUCH ENJOYMENT FROM JUST WASTING FLOSS.
OH, THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SUPER HIGH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: STONEY VON DANKINGTON, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT KID-- THAT KID JUST GOT A COLLEGE CREDIT FOR THAT. NOW SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. HEY, FOLKS, WHILE I'VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION, HAS ANYBODY HERE HEARD OF "STAR WARS?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY IS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEWEST FILM IN THE "STAR WARS" CONTINUUM: "ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY." I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT ONE. BUT I'M JUST AS EXCITED FOR "ROGUE ONE PART 2: ROGUEY-O DRIFT." I HOPE IT'S CALLED. THAT'S WHAT I HOPE IT'S CALLED. HERE'S THE DEAL WITH "ROGUE ONE." LAST WEEK, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FILM IS GETTING A BUNCH OF RESHOOTS, USUALLY A SIGN THAT A MOVIE NEEDS FIXING. BUT I SAY WHILE THEY'RE IN THERE ANYWAY, LET'S PUT IN SOME STUFF WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE IN A "STAR WARS" MOVIE. HOW HAVE WE GONE SEVEN FILMS WITHOUT SEEING THE STORMTROOPER CANINE UNIT OR COOL TEENAGE YODA? OR HOW ABOUT CHEWBACCA IN A CHEWBACCA MOM MASK? BUT MOST OF ALL, I HOPE WE SEE MORE OF A CHARACTER THAT WAS ONLY HINTED AT IN THE FIRST TRAILER THAT CAME OUT. YOU SEE, A LOT OF FOLKS WERE EXCITED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD DARTH VADER BREATHING IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE TRAILER. IT'S POSSIBLE. "STAR WARS" SUPERFANS EITHER HEARD VADER OR THEIR OWN HYPERVENTILATING. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I'LL TELL YOU, I LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY TO THAT FIRST TRAILER, BECAUSE  AM A SUPERMAN. I'VE BEEN A FAN SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD. J.J. ABRAMS IS A FRIEND OF MINE. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, I WENT THERE. I WENT THERE. BUT I AM WAY MORE EXCITED ABOUT ANOTHER CHARACTER WHO YOU NEVER SEE IN THE TRAILER. YOU ONLY HEAR. NOW, SHARP-EYED LISTENERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO PICK THIS CHARACTER OUT. JIM.
STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD. JYN ERSO.
FORGERY OF IMPERIAL DOCUMENTS, POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, RESISTING ARREST.
THIS IS A REBELLION, ISN'T IT? I REBEL. (WHOOPING SOUNDS)
Stephen: OKAY, DID YOU CATCH IT? IT'S THE EXCITING NEW "STAR WARS" CHARACTER, WHOOPI WILLY. LET'S HEAR WILLY'S CATCHPHRASE AGAIN. ( WHOOPING SOUNDS ) WELL-- ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S A SECOND TRAILER OUT NOW NOW SO WE GET TO SEE WHERE HE FIT INTO THE SCR AND BECAUSE J.J. ABRAMS IS A Y FRIEND OF MINE, HE GOT A COPY. HE SENT IT TO ME. WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK. JIM?
WE HAVE A MISSION FOR YOU. A MAJOR WEAPONS TEST IS IMMINENT, AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO DESTROY IT. ( WHOOPING SOUNDS )
WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THEY CATCH YOU? WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THEY BREAK YOU? IF YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT, ( WHOOPING SOUNDS ) Y( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( WHOOPING SOUNDS ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FANTASTIC! EVERYBODY LOVES WHOOPING WILLY. KIDS, WHEN "ROGUE ONE" COMES OUT, BE SURE TO GO TO THE MOVIE DRESSED LIKE WHOOPING WILLIE AND YELL HIS CATCHPHRASE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM. REAL "STAR WARS" FANS WILL  LOVE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DAVID DUCHOVNY.
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. I AM SO HAPPY THAT OUR FIRST GUEST IS BACK TONIGHT. YOU KNOW HIM FROM THE TV SERIES "THE X-FILES" AND "CALIFORNICATION." HE NOW STARS IN "AQUARIUS."
YOU ARE REALLY GOOD LOOKING. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING, BUT YOU'VE GOT GREAT SKIN, DOESN'T HE SARGE.
VERY SUPPLE.
SUPPLE, SMOOTH, TIGHT, TAUGHT-- IT'S TAUT, REALLY, ISN'T IT? I BET THE GIRLS PILE OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR LIKE ?O BANKS. LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE WANT SERGEANT AND I AREN'T GET ANYTHING YOUNGER, DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO LATE TO START MOISTURIZING WITH A LITTLE COCOA BUTTER BEFORE BED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ON, BUT KISS MY ASS.

Stephen: IT'S NICE TO YOU HAVE BACK.
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW WHERE I LEARNED THAT MOVE.
Stephen: WHICH MOVE?
WATCHING "CHOPPED" WITH MY DAUGHTER.
Stephen: TRYING TO FORCE SOMEONE'S FACE INTO A BURNER?
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: I MISSED THAT EPISODE.
"CHEF, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US TODAY?" "I'VE GOT A BLOND GUY'S HEAD."
Stephen: THAT SOUND DELICIOUS. THAT'S GREAT. YOU PUT A LITTLE BALSAMIC VINEGAR ON IT, I WOULD EAT THAT.
A REDUCTION OF SOME KIND.
Stephen: WHY CAN'T WE EAT OUR FOOD THE WAY IT IS. WHY DO WE HAVE TO REDUCE IT FIRST?
IT'S REALLY REDUCTIVE.
Stephen: I REDUCE MY FOOD TO TEARS. I SAY THINGS TO MY SPINACH I CAN NEVER TAKE BACK.
WHY IS THE CHEF ALWAYS DOING STUFF? WHY IS HE ALWAYS DOING? THE CHEF COOKS. THE CHEF MAKES. NO, WHY IS HE DOING IT?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
STEPHEN!
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT YOU'RE MY GUEST SO I AGREE WITH YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
A BALL SAGE REDUCTION, WHY IS HE DOING IT.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT SOUNDS FANCIER. YOUR MOM COOKS. MY MOM COOKED ME A MEAL--
SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. SHE COOKED.
Stephen: NO, SHE DIDN'T.

Stephen:  NO HEAD CHEESE.
ON SPECIAL DAYS. MAYBE A SEDER.
Stephen: I THINK HEAD CHEESE MIGHT BE CHAFE?
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
Stephen: I REALLY ENJOYED HAVING YOU ON LAST TIME BUT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT YOU DROPPED THE "F" BOMB SO MANY TIMES ON THE SHOW TACTUALLY GOT WRITTEN UP IN "USA TODAY." "STEPHEN COLBERT AND DAVID DUCHOVNY ARE MEAN TO CBS CENSORS ON THE 'LATE SHOW'." SO, PLEASE, PLEASE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S A FAMILY SHOW. PLEASE.
I-- I-- I-- I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. I DO. AND I'M-- I'M VERY VERY SORRY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I'LL PASS IT ON.
( BLEEP ) I AM SORRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BOOK, BY THE WAY. YOU WERE ON HERE LAST TIME WHICH IS CALLED.
"BLEEP BUCKEY DENT."
Stephen: RIGHT. IT'S A HUGE HIT. YOU TRY YOUR HAND AT WRITING. YOU TURN OUT TO BE A GOOD WRITER. WHEN YOU WERE ON LAST TIME YOU TALKED ABOUT THE VALUE OF FAILING AND CELEBRATING THE LOSERS. WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR YOU TO FAIL AT WRITING A BOOK?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU FAILED AT PROFESSIONALLY? YOU HAVE FAILED AT ANYTHING?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT?
WELL, I WROTE AND DIRECTED A MOVIE THAT CAME OUT IN ABOUT 2006, I THINK, CALLED "HOUSE OF "D"." WAIT FOR APPLAUSE. NOT FORTHCOMING. FAILURE. RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: "HOUSE OF "D"."
IT CAME OUT IN CANADA AND IT CAME OUT TO MIXED REVIEWS.
Stephen: DID YOU FLEE TO CANADA?
I DID. AND I WAS JUST ACTING IN CANADA, AND MY DRIVER WAS FRENCH CANADIAN AND, OBVIOUSLY, DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH VERY WELL BECAUSE LEFT THE REVIEW IN THE CANADIAN PAPER OPEN ON MY SEAT.
Stephen: FOR YOU.
FOR ME TO READ. OBVIOUSLY, HE DIDN'T READ ENGLISH BECAUSE THE HEADLINE WAS, "DUCHOVNY GETS AN 'F'." AND THE FIRST LINE OF THE REVIEW WAS A QUESTION, "HAS DAVID DUCHOVNY'S BRAIN BEEN ABDUCTED BY ALIENS? IS THAT-- IS THAT-- IS THAT FUNNY? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NOW, NOW, WITH SOME TIME. DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM THAT? DID YOU TAKE ANYTHING FROM IT?
I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH. I WENT TO WORK. MY HEAD WAS SPINNING. I GOT AN "F," YOU KNOW.
Stephen: HOUSE OF "D" GOT AN "F."
HOW CLEVER, HOW CLEVER. THAT WAS A FRIDAY. I DID MY WORK. I FELT PROUD THAT I WAS ABLE TO ACT THAT DAY AS ( BLEEP ) AS I FELT. I'M SORRY FOR USING THAT WORD. OKAY. WELL, I FELT LIKE A PROFESSIONAL. DIMY JOB.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT A PRO DOES. A PRO DOES THEIR JOB WHEN THEY DON'T PARTICULARLY FEEL LIKE IT.
THANK YOU. I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING. I FELT FANTASTIC, AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. AND I REALIZED MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAD BEEN TERRIFIED OF GETTING AN "F," AND WHEN I WOKE UP THAT SATURDAY MORNING I WAS ALIVE AND I WAS FINE AND I WAS LIKE, YOU SURVIVED. YOU ACTUALLY CAN GET AN "F" AND MOVE ALONG. SO I WAS THANKFUL TO THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
I MEAN-- IT'S-- IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO MAKE A STEADY DIET OF "F"s.
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT IT WAS-- IT WAS LIBERATING IN SOME WAY TO HAVE RECEIVED IT IN SUCH A PUBLIC FORUM AND TO SURVIVE.
Stephen: NOW, "F" STANDS FOR FANTASTIC. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU ALSO-- YOU ALSO NOW TOOK-- YOU DID, LIKE, A MUSICAL TOUR.
EUROPE, YEAH.
Stephen: LIKE, WITH A ROCK BAND, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU PUT OUT AN ALBUM AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A MUSICIAN?
WELL, I DON'T TELL YOU A LOT, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I MEAN THIS IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY--
I'M NOT --
I DID NOT KNOW PUBLICLY, NOT LIKE IT'S A SECRET.
IT IS KIND OF A SECRET. I'M NOT A POPULAR MUSICIAN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: LIKE, WHEN DID YOU START DOING THIS?
IN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN PLAYING GUITAR.
Stephen: FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO, AND NOW YOU WENT ON AN 11-CITY TOUR OF EUROPE, RIGHT?
YES, 11 CITIES IN 14 OR 15 DAYS. AND IT WASN'T LIKE THE BON JOVI VIDEO WHERE WE MOPEY AND TIRED GET ON THE PRIVATE PLANE.
Stephen: YEAH.
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. WE WERE IN TAXIS AND RICKSHAWS AND, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: YOU WERE IN RICKSHAWS IN EUROPE? ( LAUGHTER ) THE STORY IS NOT HOLDING TOGETHER, DAVID DUCHOVNY. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK--

I HAVE, YES.
Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE PRESENTING AT THE TONYSS.
I AM PRESENTING AT THE TONY AWARDS WHICH I'M VERY VERY, EXCITED ABOUT.
Stephen: THIS SUNDAY.
THIS SUNDAY. IT'S KIND OF A CRAZY THING. WHEN YOU START WORKING AT THE THEATER, YOU WATCH THE TONY AWARDS. IT'S A VERY FUN THING EVERY YEAR. AND THEN THIS THING HAPPENS WHERE YOU SAY, "I KNOW PEOPLE PERFORMING IN THE TONYS." AND THEN YOU'RE IN A SHOW AND YOU GET TO PERFORM. AND NOW I'M PRESENTING AND I HAVE FRIENDS NOMINATED THAT I'M PRESENTING. IT'S VERY SURREAL.
Stephen: DOES IT MAKE YOU NERVOUS, LIKE YOU'RE REALLY PERFORMING ON STAGE?
OH, I'M VERY NERVOUS. BOTH TIMES I PERFORMED ON THE TONY AWARDS I DEFINITELY MIGHT HAVE HAD A FLASK WITH ME SO I COULD CUT THE EDGE A LITTLE BIT. IT'S VERY NERVE-RACKING-- IT'S A LIVE THING.
Stephen: THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU. THIS IS AN INTERVENTION.
THANK YOU GUY,S. WOW, WE FINALLY DID IT. GOOD.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE MOST NERVE-RACKING PART OF IT? YOU GO OUT THERE AND ANNOUNCE THE NAMES AND SAY THIS GUY WON.
THIS ONE WILL BE OKAY. BUT I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WATCH AWARDS SHOW AND THE PEOPLE DRAW OUT WHO IT IS. THEY FUMBLE WITH --
THE ENVELOPE.
THE ENVELOPE. I'VE NEVER BEEN NOMINATED FOR A TONY AWARD, BUT I CAN SIT THERE AND IMAGINE THAT PROBABLY THEY'RE VERY NERVOUS, SO I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF PRESET MY THUMB ON THAT THING, AND POP IT RIGHT OVER.
Stephen: JUST TEAR THE BAND-AID RIGHT OFF.
I DON'T WANT TO PROLONG IT. I TRY. I'M A GIVE.
Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW CALLED "BRAINDEAD."
"BRAINDEAD."
Stephen: HERE ON THE CBS.
HERE ON THE CBS.
Stephen: AND THIS WAS FROM THE SAME PEOPLE WHO CREATED "THE GOOD WIFE."
IT IS.
Stephen: IS THIS, LIKE, A PRESTIGE DRAMA? ARE YOU LIKE SEXY LAWYERS WHO ARE FIGHTING EACH OTHER, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
IT'S NOT A PRESTIGE DRAWM. IT'S A POLITICAL SATIRE COMEDY TOLD THROUGH THE LENS OF A HORROR FILM. ( LAUGHTER ) IF THAT MAKES SENSE. OKAY --
IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE MOST OF OUR POLITICS IS HORRIBLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SO IMAGINE THIS, IMAGINE A WORLD-- ( APPLAUSE ) IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE SPACE BUGS HAVE CRASHED ON EARTH, AND EATEN POLITICIANS' BRAINS, AND CHANGED THEM-- IF YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE THAT.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. SO ALIEN CREATURES--
ALIEN CREATURES.
Stephen: ARE THESE INTELLIGENT ALIEN CREATURES?
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW YET.
Stephen: BUT THEY EAT THE BRAINS--
THEY EAT THE BRAINS OF POLITICIANS AND RADICALIZE THEM. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I HAVE A LITTLE NOTE HERE THAT SAYS THE FIRST EPISODE IS CALLED "THE INSANITY PRINCIPLE."
THE INSANITY PRINCIPLE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE INSANITY PRINCIPLE.
IT'S BASICALLY LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE BACKDROP OF OUR CURRENT POLITICAL SYSTEM IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT.
Stephen: EVERYONE SEEMS INSANE.
EVERYONE SEEMS INSANE. AND HOPEFULLY THE BUGS IN AND THE COMEDY GIVE US A VIEW AND EXPLAIN AND PERHAPS WE CAN LAUGH AT THE ABSURDITY TOGETHER.
Stephen: WHY DO THE BUGS EAT ONLY THE POLITICIANS' BRAINS?
YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE RULES. THE BUG, IF THEY GO INTO SOMEONE'S BRAIN, IF THEY TRY TO FIGHT IT, THEIR HEAD EXPLODES. SO MAYBE THE POLITICIANS, THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH GOING ON TO UP THERE TO START. WITH. THEY'RE A LITTLE SUSCEPTIBLE MAYBE.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP AND THE TWO OF YOU ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM.
WE ARE.
Stephen: JIM.
I SAW YOU IN OUR WAITING ROOM TRYING TO POACH.
POACHING, SERIOUSLY. SHE ONLY ASKED FOR MY HELP BECAUSE SHE KNEW YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT. WOULD YOU STOP FOLLOWING ME. IT LOOKS LIKE I'M COLLABORATING WITH THE DEMOCRATS.
OH, ABOUT THAT PRO-CHOICE RALLY WHAT, ARE YOU WEARING?
Stephen: THAT'S COLD.
ZING.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: DO YOU-- DO YOU PERSONALLY SUBSCRIBE TO THAT THERE ARE ALIENS OUT THERE, THAT WE HAVE EVER BEEN VISITED BY ALIENS?
I DO.
Stephen: SO IT DOESN'T SCARE YOU AT ALL?
OH, NO, IT'S SCARY. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF WATCHING "FIRE IN THE SKY" WHEN AIR FORCE A KID.
Stephen: WHAT'S "FIRE IN THE SKY."
IT'S A BA GUY WHO GOT ABDUCTED AND REMEMBERED HIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE THROUGH FLASH BACK. THEY PUT A PROBE DOWN HIS THROAT. AFTER I SAW THIS MOVIE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET ABDUCTED BY ALIENS WHEN I WENT TO BED.
AND SLEPT WITH MY BASEBALL BAT NEXT TO MY BED JUST IN CASE. A PART OF ME THOUGHT, AN ALIEN SPECIES COMING TO EARTH WILL BE DETERRED BY MY BASEBALL BAT.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER SWING OUT AT MOM AND DAD DURING THE NIGHT?
I WAS READY TO GO. NO, THANK GOODNESS, I DIDN'T.
Stephen: WOW.
WHO KNOWS?
Stephen: NOW YOU JUST CARRY THE FLASK.
NOW I JUST CARRY THE FLASK, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU STARTED ACTING AT A FAIRLY YOUNG AGE.
I DID.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO DO THE CLASSIC ACTOR THING WHERE YOU WAIT TABLES AND SUFFER OR DID IT JUST HAPPEN FOR YOU?
I SUFFERED IN MY OWN WAY. I THINK EVERYBODY KIND OF GOES THROUGH THEIR LICKS EARLY ON. BUT, NO, I WAITED-- I WORKED IN A RESTAURANT KIND OF THE SUMMER BEFORE I GOT THE BIG JOB THAT BROUGHT ME TO NEW YORK IN MY HOME TOWN. I BARTENDED MOST NIGHTS, BUT I WAITED TABLES ONE NIGHT A WEEK AND IT WAS JUST NOT FOR ME. I DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
21, 20, 21.
Stephen: I WANTED TO CATCH YOU THERE. YOU SAY BARTENDER AND I WONDERED IF YOU BROKE THE LAW.
I MIGHT HAVE. I DEFINITELY VIOLATED NEW YORK STATE LIQUOR LAW S.
Stephen:  THAT'S IT YOU?  NEVER CAME TO NEW YORK AND WORKED THE BARS.
I DID TWO TOURS OF TWO BROADWAY SHOWS, AND THE SECOND ONE, THE NATIONAL TOUR OF "HAIRSPRAY" RIGHT WHEN THE TOUR ENDED THEY MOVED ME TO THE NEW YORK COMPANY. I ACTUALLY WAS VERY LUCKY I MOVED TO NEW YORK FOR A JOB. THAT IS VERY, VERY LUCKY.
Stephen: I WAITED TABLE FOR FIVE YEARS. I HATE YOU.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
Stephen: I MEAN THAT IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY. I HATE EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T DNT HAVE TO WAIT TABLES.
I WAS VERY LUCKY AND SOMEHOW, MIRACULOUSLY, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP IT GOING.
Stephen: I HOPE YOU KEEP IT GOING AND GOOD LUCK THIS SUNDAY OPENING THE ENVELOPE, THANK YOU.
Stephen: "BRAINDEAD" PREMIERES MONDAY AT 10:00 ON CBS, AND HE'LL BE PRESENTING ON SUNDAY AT THE TONY'S! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WELCOME BACK. WE'RE BACK HERE AT THE BEAUTIFUL "LATE SHOW." PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE SHOW MIGHT KNOW THAT I ENJOY SAILING. THAT'S HOW I GOT ON THE COVER OF "HOMELESS SEA CAPTAIN MONTHLY." VERY PROUD OF THAT. IN THE SAILING WORLD, THERE'S NO BIGGER RACE THAN THE FABLED AMERICA'S CUP. IT'S JUST LIKE THE STANLEY CUP, BUT ALL THE ICE HAS MELTED AND YOU'RE ON A BOAT. NEXT YEAR, THEY'RE RACING FOR THE CUP IN BERMUDA, AND I WAS RECENTLY INVITED TO SAIL WITH TEAM U.S.A. YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW EXCITED I WAS. LUCKILY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE BECAUSE I FILMED IT. JIM. IT'S BEEN ALMOST 100 YEARS SINCE THE AMERICAS CUP WAS LAST HELD IN BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK HARBOR. IN MAY, THE RACE MADE ITS TRIUMPHANT RETURN SO I HEADED DOWNTOWN TO MEET ORACLE TEAM U.S.A. CAPTAIN, JIMMY SPITHILL, IN FREEZING, TORRENTIAL RAIN. WHAT A GORGEOUS DAY FOR SAILING. IS THIS GOOD SAILING WEATHER, JIMMY?
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
Stephen: YOUR ACCENT KIND OF CONFUSES ME A BIT. WHERE IN AMERICA ARE YOU FROM, JIMMY?
I'M FROM THE DEEP SOUTH, BROTHER.
Stephen: IF YOU WIN A THIRD AMERICAS CUP CHAMPIONSHIP, DO YOU LET YOU BE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN? IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. ARE YOU TRYING TO SKIP THE LINE?
THAT WOULD BE NICE.
Stephen: DON'T LET DONALD TRUMP KNOW YOU'RE NOT FROM THE UNITED STATES. HE'LL KICK YOU OFF THE BOAT. JIMMY, WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DOING TODAY HERE IN NEW YORK HARBOR ON THIS BEAUTIFUL, I WOULD SAY MID-DECEMBER DAY.
WE'RE HERE FOR PRACTICE DAY OF THE AMERICAS CUP WORLD SERIES SERIES. WE'RE RACING THE FASTEST BOAT IN THE WORLD. RAIN WING OFF AND STICK IS ON THE BOAT. THERE ARE HYDROFOILS UNDER THE BOAT, IT'S VERY, VERY FAST.
Stephen: WHEN IT GETS OUT OF THE WATER IT TAKES OFF.
YOU'LL EXPERIENCE THAT ON BOARD. YOU'LL LITERALLY HAVE TO REALLY HOLD ON QUITE TYPE.
Stephen: NOW THE AMERICAS CUP HAS BEEN CALLED THE OBSERVERAIRE DEATH RACE, BUT BECAUSE I AM NOT A BILLIONAIRE, THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT.
NO, NO, YOU'RE FINE. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
Stephen: NO GUEST HAS EVER FALLEN OFF ONE OF THESE BOATS, RIGHT?
WE HAD ONE GUEST, ONE FAMOUS GUEST, IN SAN FRANCISCO, WHEN WE WERE RUNNING THE SAME WORLD SERIES, AND HE DEPARTED THE BOAT. BUT OUR CHASE BOAT PICKED HIM UP.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T GO BACK FOR HIM?
WE'RE RACING. YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK?
Stephen: JUST WONDERING. JUDGE WONDERING. TELL MY WIFE I LOVE HER. LET'S DO THIS THING.
BRING IT. YOU'RE ON.
