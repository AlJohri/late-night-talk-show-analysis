HE'S BEEN THERE BEFORE, NOW DENNIS RODMAN IS MAKING A TRIP BACK TO NORTH KOREA TODAY, MORE ON HIS CONTROVERSIAL VISIT.
AND NOW, INTRODUCING YOUR 2017 NORTH KOREAN GLORIOUS LEADER, KIM JONG-UN!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES OLIVIA WILDE. EDDIE IZZARD. AND MISICAL GUEST NICK CAVE AND THE BAD SEEDS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON! HEY, EVERYBODY! THAT'S NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S UP? WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAVE A SEAT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. EVERYONE OUT THERE-- I'M SURE YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT AMERICA'S FAVORITE NEW REALITY TV SHOW, "SO YOU THINK YOU CAN TESTIFY ABOUT RUSSIA." TODAY'S CONTESTANT:  ATTORNEY GENERAL AND LAST SURVIVING LITTLE RASCAL, JEFF SESSIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK HE WAS SPANKY. I THINK HE WAS SPANKY, WASN'T HE?
Jon: THAT WAS SPANKY.
Stephen: ANYWAY, AS SOON AS SESSIONS SAT DOWN, EVERYONE HAD THE SAME QUESTION:  IT ARE YOU NOW, OR HAVE YOU EVER HIDDEN ANY POTS OF GOLD? ( LAUGHTER ) COMMITTEE CHAIR RICHARD BURR STARTED BY REMINDING US THIS WAS TO BE A NON-PARTISAN AFFAIR.
I'M HOPEFUL THAT MEMBERS WILL FOCUS THEIR QUESTIONS TODAY ON THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND NOT SQUANDER THE OPPORTUNITY BY TAKING POLITICAL OR PARTISAN SHOTS.
Stephen: OKAY, NO POLITICAL OR PARTISAN SHOTS. HOW ABOUT WHISKEY SHOTS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, SWEET DARKNESS, COVER ME. READY TO WATCH THE SENATE. SESSIONS MAY BE SMALL, BUT HE'S SCRAPPY. FOR INSTANCE, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONJECTURE ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS. AND SESSIONS WAS A PART OF THE CAMPAIGN AS THE FIRST SENATOR TO ENDORSE TRUMP, BUT HE WAS HAVING NONE OF IT.
AND THE SUGGESTION THAT I PARTICIPATED IN ANY COLLUSION THAT I WAS AWARE OF, ANY COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO HURT THIS COUNTRY-- WHICH I HAVE SERVED WITH HONOR FOR 35 YEARS-- OR TO UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS AN APPALLING AND DETESTABLE LIE.
Stephen: I SAY, "PISTOLS AT DAWN, SIR! PISTOLS AT DAWN!" ( APPLAUSE ) WHICH-- WHICH-- WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT A GREAT IDEA SINCE THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN IS NAMED BURR. NOW AT THIS ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED, SESSION CLAIMED TO HAVE HAD NO CONTACT WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS DURING TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. BUT WE LATER FOUND OUT HE MET WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEY KISLYAK TWICE, BUT HE'S ALMOST COMPLETELY 100% PRETTY SURE HE DIDN'T DO IT A THIRD TIME, MAYBE.
I GUESS I COULD SAY THAT I POSSIBLY HAD A MEETING, BUT I STILL DO NOT RECALL IT.
Stephen: "I MEAN, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. WHO CAN SAY WHO MET WITH WHOM AND WHO PROMISED TO LIFT SANCTIONS ON WHAT BEFORE TAKING CELEBRATORY SHOTS OF WHATEVER." SESSIONS WAS ASKED ABOUT ONE OF THE MORE INCRIMINATING ASPECTS OF COMEY'S TESTIMONY, THAT TRUMP CLEARED THE ROOM AT THE WHITE WHITE HOUSE, INCLUDING SESSIONS.
WELL, I WOULD JUST SAY IT THIS WAY:  WE WERE THERE. I WAS STANDING THERE, AND WITHOUT REVEALING ANY CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE, WHAT I DO RECALL IS THAT I DID DEPART. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I DON'T-- WE KNOW YOU DEPARTED, ATTORNEY GENERAL SHERLOCK. ( LAUGHTER ) WHY WON'T YOU TELL US ANY PART OFT HE CONVERSATION? SOMEBODY HELP ME OUT HERE.
JUST SO I CAN UNDERSTAND, IS THE BASIS OF THAT UNWILLINGNESS TO ANSWER BASED ON EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE?
I'M NOT CLAIMING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S POWER, AND I HAVE NO POWER.
Stephen: NO POWER? REALLY? I NEED A SECOND OPINION. SENATOR THEODEN?
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT CHECKS OUT. SO YOU'RE NOT-- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, SENATOR SESSIONS-- OR ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS -- YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING, EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT HASN'T CLAIMED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, AND YOU HAVEN'T CLAIMED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. SO WHAT ARE YOU CLAIMING, WHITE PRIVILEGE? BECASUE I HEAR THAT'S A THING. SESSIONS, THERE IS SOME PRIVILEGE-- ( APPLAUSE ) THERE IS SOME PRIVILEGE BEING CLAIMED. SESSIONS DID TELL US ONE THING ABOUT LEAVING COMEY ALONE WITH TRUMP.
I DO RECALL BEING ONE OF THE LAST ONES TO LEAVE.
Stephen: "I'M A PARTIER BY NATURE, AND AS A RULE, I GO ON AND ON TO THE BREAKA-BREAKA-DAWN AND, ADDITIONALLY, BURN THE MOTHER DOWN." AND IT SEEMS-- I'M PARAPHRASING, OBVIOUSLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S VERY NICE. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THAT? DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THAT? NOW, IT SEEMS THAT OREGON SENATOR RON WYDEN FOR ONE LITTLE MINUTE THERE, REALLY GOT UNDER SESSIONS' SKIN.
MR. COMEY SAID THAT THERE WERE MATTERS WITH RESPECT TO THE RECUSAL THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC, AND HE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM. WHAT ARE THEY?
I-- THAT-- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?
Stephen: THAT'S A CLASSIC LEGAL STRATEGY, THE OLD SWITCHEROO. "CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?" "WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHERE I WAS? IF YOU DON'T KNOW, I MUST BE INNOCENT!" MEANING, WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR JOE MANCHIN TRIED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHO IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS CONNECTED TO RUSSIA.
TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, SIR, DID ANY OF THESE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS MEET WITH RUSSIAN OFFICIALS AT ANY POINT DURING THE CAMPAIGN? YOU CAN JUST GIVE A YES OR NO ON THIS. PAUL MANAFORT.
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT HE HAD DONE SO. HE SERVED AS CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN FOR A FEW MONTHS.
STEVE BANNON.
I HAVE NO INFORMATION THAT HE DID.
GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN.
I DON'T RECALL IT.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE WAS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND MICHAEL FLYNN. THAT'S WHY HE WAS FIRED. SESSIONS REALLY SEEMS TO KNOW NOTHING. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS THE FIRST SENATOR TO ENDORSE TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT WASN'T JUST DEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS -- REMEMBER IT WASN'T JUST A PARTISAN THING. IT WASN'T PARTISAN SHOTS. THE REPUBLICANS ALSO ASKED SOME VERY TOUGH QUESTIONS, TOO.
DO YOU LIKE JASON BOURNE OR JAMES BOND MOVIES?
NO. (LAUGHTER) YES, I DO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE JAMES BONDS MOVIES? YES, I DO. WHERE'S THE FOLLOW-UP? DANIEL CRAIG OR SEAN CONNERY? THIS IS A TRAVESTY. THIS IS A TRAVESTY WRAPPED IN WRONG SAUCE. THINGS HAVE BEEN LITTLE DICEY WITH NORTH KOREA, WHAT WITH THEIR REPEATED MISSILE TESTS. BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC, BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY HAS SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED DIPLOMATS IN THE WORLD. ALSO, WE HAVE DENNIS RODMAN, WHO FLEW INTO NORTH KOREA AGAIN TODAY. SO THIS IS BASKETBALL DIPLOMACY. IS THIS ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT TRUMP?
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AT ALL?
I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'M OVER HERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH NEED.
Stephen: SOMETHING YOU BOTH NEED? YOU MEAN A DISTRACTION FROM THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION? WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN DENNIS RODMAN MET SERGEY KISLYAK FOR A SECRET GAME OF ONE-ON-ONE. I LIKE KISLYAK DUNCHING ON RODMAN? SO WHAT SECRET FUNDING BACK CHANNEL DID DENNIS RODMAN USE TO GET TO NORTH KOREA? HE TOLD US ON TWITTER. "I'M BACK! THANKS TO MY SPONSOR potcoin.com." YES, POT COIN, WHICH ACCORDING TO ITS WEBSITE "IS AN ULTRA-SECURE DIGITAL CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY." ( COUGHS ) "DUDE, WHAT IF THERE WAS AN IMAGINARY MONEY WE COULD USE TO BUY WEED? ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO, WHAT IF WE SENT DENNIS RODMAN TO NORTH KOREA? ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) , OF COURSE,-- DON'T TOUCH THAT NOW. OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A DIPLOMATIC MISSION HAD A PRIVATE SPONSORSHIP. WHO CAN FORGET WORLD WAR II'S YALTA CONFERENCE, BROUGHT TO YOU BY LITTLE ZIPPY'S COCAINE BUZZ TONIC! LITTLE ZIPPY'S: IT'S A BLITZKRIEG ON YOUR BRAIN! SO WHY DOES POT COIN CARE ABOUT NORTH KOREA? WELL, MARIJUANA ENTHUSIASTS HAVE BEEN TOUTING THE COUNTRY AS A STONER'S PARADISE WHERE CANNABIS IS LEGAL. A STONERS PARADISE? REALLY? YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET HIGH THERE, BUT GOOD LUCK WHEN YOU GET THE MUNCHIES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I HOPE YOU LIKE BARK. MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT IN WASHINGTON. HE WAS IN WISCONSIN TODAY. MUST HAVE BEEN COMFORTING FOR HIM TO BE IN A STATE WHERE "CHEESEHEAD" IS CONSIDERED A COMPLIMENT. YOU LIKE THAT?
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: THE TRIP-- JOKE SNUCK UP ON ME. ( LAUGHTER ) THE TRIP WAS ALL PART OF DONALD TRUMP'S RENEWED FOCUS ON EMPLOYMENT, AS HE TWEETED THIS MORNING. "HEADING TO THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN TO TALK ABOUT JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! BIG PROGRESS BEING MADE AS THE REAL NEWS IS REPORTING." AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT "REAL NEWS" IS CAPITALIZED. THAT MEANS THE PRESIDENT HAS SEEN THE SHOW WE MAKE FOR HIM EVERY WEEK, "REAL NEWS TONIGHT. AND I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE REPORT W TWEETING ABOUT.
WELCOME TO REAL NEWS TONIGHT. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.
JOB, JOB, JOBS?
JOBS. JOB, JOB, JOB, JOBS.
JOB, JOBS, JOB, JOB, JOB, JOB, JOB.
JOBS, JOB-JOB, JOB?
JOBS! JOB, JOB, JOB, JOB, JOOOOLS! JOBS.
JOBS.
AND COMING UP NEXT, GOLF, GOLF CLEAVAGE, GOLF.
JOBS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OLIVIA WILDE IS HERE! BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE FAKE INTERVIEW WITH MELANIA TRUMP. STICK AROUND ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY, RIGHT OVER THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE, HE HAS BEEN A BACHELOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY SAY HE'S BEEN LONELY, ISOLATED, AND HAS PUT ON WEIGHT. AND IT'S REALLY STARTING TO SHOW. HERE'S TRUMP AT THE INAUGURATION. AND HERE'S WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE NOW: OKAY? ALL RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. BUT THOSE BACHELOR DAYS ARE OVER FOREVER, BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND, AFTER ALMOST FIVE MONTHS OF LIVING APART, MELANIA TRUMP MOVED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S LIKE THEIR SECOND HONEYMOON. AND FOR DONALD, HIS FOURTH. SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING? HERE TO TELL US LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, PLEASE WELCOME MELANIA TRUMP! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, MADAME FIRST LADY.
MY PLEASURE, STEPHEN.
Stephen: SO, HOW ARE YOU ADJUSTING TO LIFE IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
OH, I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. SEE? ( LAUGHTER ) THESE ARE MY HAPPY EYES. IT WAS SO LONELY IN NEW YORK DOING WHATEVER I WANTED, WHENEVER I WANTED. I CALLED IT MY PRISON OF FREEDOM. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS-- THAT SOUNDS LONELY. NOW, YOU WERE THE ONLY FIRST LADY IN MODERN HISTORY NOT TO MOVE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE PRESIDENT. WHY WAS THAT?
WELL, AFTER THE INAUGURATION, BARRON HAD TO FINISH SCHOOL. THEN I HAD TO WAIT FOR THE COMCAST GUY TO TURN OFF MY CABLE. BUT NOW, THERE IS NOTHING. NO REASON WHATSOEVER WHY I SHOULDN'T BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU COULD LOOK FOR AN EXCUSE, BUT TRUST ME, YOU WILL NOT FIND ONE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY, WELL, THAT'S NICE. AND, WELL, MA'AM, NOW THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I'M SURE YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO GET STARTED ON THE ISSUE YOU TALKED ABOUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
OH, DEFINITELY. I CANNOT WAIT TO START FIGHTING... ILLITERACY?
Stephen: IT WAS ACTUALLY CYBER-BULLYING.
CYBER-BULLYING THE ILLITERATE. IT'S SO CRUEL. THEY CAN'T EVEN READ WHAT THESE BULLIES ARE TYPING. LAUGH.
Stephen: THAT'S AN INSPIRING MESSAGE. NOW THAT YOU'RE DOWN THERE, ARE YOU ALL MOVED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE?
YES, I BROUGHT EVERYTHING I NEED FOR A LONG STAY. A TOOTHBRUSH
Stephen: A TOOTHBRUSH? REALLY? THAT'S IT?
OH, NO, NO, I HAVE A FEW OTHER THINGS. LIKE THIS PICTURE OF THE MOST CHERISHED MOMENT OF MARRIAGE TO MY HUSBAND.
Stephen: I-- I-- I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY-- ISN'T THAT YOU SLAPPING AWAY HIS HAND IN ISRAEL.
FAKE NEWS, STEPHEN. IT WASN'T A HAND SLAP. HIS HANDS ARE SO SMALL, I THOUGHT IT WAS A MOSQUITO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, THAT CHECKS OUT. CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL. CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.
AND, OF COURSE, I NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT MY ROLLAWAY ROLLAWAY LADDER. SO IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, I CAN ESCAPE FROM A SECOND-FLOOR WINDOW.
Stephen: WITH YOUR HUSBAND.
OK.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE ARRIVING AT THE WHITE HOUSE AT A VERY DRAMATIC TIME. AFTER JAMES COMEY'S TESTIMONY LAST WEEK, SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.
THEY ARE! I MEAN, THEY SHOULDN'T SAY SUCH THINGS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: SO YOU EXPECT YOUR HUSBAND TO SERVE OUT HIS ENTIRE TERM?
OH, YES. WE WILL BE TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 1,315 DAYS, 11 HOURS, 55 MINUTES, AND 20 SECONDS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WOW. THAT'S PRETTY PRECISE.
YES, AND ACCURATE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HERE'S THE THING: AMERICA TOOK A VOW, AND DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT, FOR BETTER OR WORSE, FOR RICHER OR EVEN RICHER, IN SICKNESS AND IN NO HEALTH CARE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE MUST HONOR THAT. NO MATTER HOW OFTEN AMERICA FANTASIZES ABOUT BEING WITH JUSTIN TRUDEAU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) WE STAY, WE MAKE THE BEST OF IT, AND YOU'LL FIND IN YOUR GREATEST MOMENTS OF DOUBT, YOU CAN ALWAYS DRINK. MAKE AMERICA GRAPE AGAIN!
Stephen: MELANIA TRUMP, EVERYONE! MADAM FIRST LADY, WHAT AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OLIVIA WILDE. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. HERE WE GO, JUST THAT RIGHT THERE. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM MOVIES LIKE "TRON: LEGACY," TV SHOWS LIKE "HOUSE," AND NOW HER BROADWAY DEBUT IN "1984!" PLEASE WELCOME OLIVIA WILDE! HELLO. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M SO GOOD. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN.
YES GR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ON HERE FOR SO LONG, SINCE THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE, YOU CONCEIVED AND BORE A CHILD.
YEAH, TWO OF THEM!
Stephen: NO, NO, NO, ONLY ONE.
MAYBE I SAW YOU IN BETWEEN.
I SAW YOU IN BETWEEN YOUR ELDEST IS OTIS AND YOUR NEWEST IS DAISY. A BOY AND A GIRL.
YES, YES.
Stephen: HOW DOES THE OLDER ONE-- BECAUSE I HAVE CHILDREN OF MY OWN-- AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS TAKE TO THE NEW ADDITION OF THE FAMILY.
NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen: HOW DOES OTIS TAKE?
HE'S LIKE A DRILL SERGEANT. I DON'T KNOW WHO LET HIM WATCH "FULL METAL JACKET," BUT HE IS SO HARD ON HER. IT'S LIKE BOOT CAMPED. SO SHE WILL COME OUT REALLY RIPPED AND WITH A GREAT ATITUTE TOOUD.
Stephen: ANY "SEND THIS ONE BACK." ANY OF THAT STUFF?
"YOU DON'T LIVE HERE," IS WHAT HE SCREAMS AT HER.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER?
I HAVE AN OLDER SISTER WHO IS SO NICE TO ME SO I'M NOT USED TO THIS. I THINK HE'S AWARE THAT SHE'S SHARING ME WITH HER BECAUSE I'M ON BROADWAY AND AS EVERYONE WHO IS IN A PLAY WILL TELL YOU, YOU MISS A LOT OF BEDTIMES, AND IT'S TOUGH BUT-- I MEAN, YOU MUST MISBEDTIME, BUT YOUR KIDS ARE, LIKE, 20.
Stephen:  YEAH, MY BOYS ARE BOTH TALLER THAN I AM AND MY DAUGHTER IS SMARTER THAN I AM. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I SAW YOU THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE TONY AWARDS. DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME AT THAT?
I HAD A GREAT TIME. THAT WAS AMAZING. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE TONYS IS EVERYONE WHO GOES UP ON STAGE IS SO GOOD AT BEING ON STAGE, ACCEPTING AN AWARD, PRESENTING AN AWARD, THEY'RE REALLY, REALLY GOOD AT IT, AND THEY HAVE SUCH PRESENCE. AND, YOU KNOW, MOVIE AND TV STUFF, IT'S LESS SO. IT'S LIKE-- THEY'RE NOT-- NOOSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO, SO IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING. THE AGREEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE ALS WATCH. I'M A BIT FAN OF THE AGREEMENT.
Stephen: ME, TOO, IT'S A CBS SHOW. ANYTHING THAT'S ON CBS, THE BEST AWARDS.
BEST AT EVERYTHING.
Stephen: WELL, I SAW YOUR PLAY, I SAW YOU IN "1984" LAST SATURDAY NIGHT.
WHAT AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU THERE.
Stephen: IT'S A BRILLIANT PRODUCTION. BRILLIANT, REALLY POWERFUL PRODUCTION. BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOCKED ME MOST ABOUT THE PRODUCTION IS THIS IS YOUR BROADWAY DEBUT MIP NO IDEA BECAUSE YOU LOOKED PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE.
OH!
Stephen: AND ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY CLAIMED THE STAGE.
THAT IS SO KIND OF YOU.
Stephen: I'M NOT A KIND PERSON. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO I'VE HEARD.
Stephen: I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WEREN'T GOOD.
I BELIEVE YOU. I THINK I LOVED THIS PLAY SO MUCH AND I FEEL IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TELL THIS STORY. AND SO I THINK ALL MY JITTERS ARE SORT OF CONSUMED BY MY SENSE OF PURPOSE. I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE'RE OUT THERE SAYING SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID. AND I HAVE TO SAY, HAVING YOU THERE WAS SUCH AN HONOR BECAUSE WHAT OUR PLAY IS ABOUT IS THAT THE TRUTH MATTERS, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE ALL ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOW IS ABOUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S JUST-- IT REALLY KIND OF CRYSTALLIZES EVERYTHING FOR ME. BUT I-- I REALLY-- I BELIEVE IN IT SO MUCH. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEING IT ARE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PLAYS THEY'VE SEEN. WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE SEEING IT WHO DON'T GO TO A LOT OF BROADWAY, AND THEY SAY IT'S LIKE BEING ON A RIDE. IT'S PROVOCATIVE. IT'S SUBVERSIVE.
Stephen: IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
EXCITING.
Stephen:  ONE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS-- AND WHEN I HEARD THAT YOU GUYS WERE GOING TO MOUNT THIS ON BROADWAY, I WAS EXCITED. "1984" ITSELF HAS TREMENDOUS CURRENCY NOW. I GOT THIS LITTLE DATA HERE FROM MY PRODUCER. THE BOOK SOLD OUT ON AMAZON BY JANUARY 26 OF THIS YEAR. PEOPLE SUDDENLY WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN A SURVEILLANCE STATE THAT IS TRYING TO UNDERMINE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST SO THEY CAN CONTROL WHAT WE DO IN THE PRESENT.
YOU KNOW WHAT TIPPED IT OFF.
Stephen: WHAT.
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING "ALTERNATIVE FACTS." THAT SUDDENLY EVERYONE RACED TO AMAZON TO BUY THE BOOK. THEY WERE LIKE, "THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR."
Stephen: AFTER SEAN SPICER WENT OUT AND SAID IT WAS THE BIGGEST CROWD EVER AND THE INAUGURAL. AND THEN SHE SAID HE IS OFFERING ALTERNATIVE FACTS.
THAT IS DIRECTLY OUT OF "1984". IT'S SO RELEVANT, AND IT'S REALLY DISTURBING. I WISH THE PLAY WASN'T SO RELEVANT, BUT IT IS.
Stephen: THE THING ABOUT-- THE THING THAT KIND OF STRUCK ME WHEN I WAS IN THE AUDIENCE, OF COURSE, WE REMEMBER THE IDEA OF BIG BROTHER AND THE IDEA OF A SURVEILLANCE STATE, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'VE ALL KIND OF GOTTEN USED TO.
WE HAVE.
Stephen: SINCE, SADLY, 9/11, WE HAVE SEEN SORT OF THE NECESSITY OF SURVEILLANCE, AND WE'VE GOTTEN USED TO OUR PHONES ARE BEING TRACK AND THE CAMERA ON OUR COMPUTER IS PROBABLY WATCHING US, AND OUR TV IS TRACK US ALL THE TIME TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THE SIT COMES WE WANT.
YEAH.
Stephen: I'M SURE THAT DATA IS NOT BEING USED IN ANY OTHER WAY.
RIGHT...
Stephen: THE THING THAT STRIKES YOU IS OH, THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT. THE STORY IS ABOUT WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT TRUE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: HOW DO WE AGREE ON THE PAST SO WE CAN MANUFACTURE CONSENSUS IN THE MOMENT, AND THE CAMERA IS POINTED AT YOU, THE CITIZEN AT HOME, TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING THE NARRATIVE THAT THE STATE IS PUTTING OUT.
EXACTLY. AND SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE BIG BROTHER AND WHAT "1984" IS ALL ABOUT IS THAT THE TOTALITARIAN STATE SPOKEN ABOUT IN THE BOOK AND THE PLAY WAS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED. THIS IS A PARTY THAT PEOPLE VOTED IN, AND THAT THEY HAVE SLOWLY ACCEPTED TO BE THE ONLY WAY. AND THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE POWER OF INDIVIDUALITY. AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT THE PLAY IS ABOUT, IS REMEMBERING YOUR OWN POWER AS A CITIZEN. AND SO I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS MATERIAL IS RELEVANT NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU SIT ON. IT FEELS RELEVANT IN DIFFERENT WAYS, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU-- WHAT YOU THINK OF OUR PRESIDENT. BUT IT DEFINITELY IS SOMETHING THAT'S UNIVERSALLY IMPORTANT, THAT WE ARE POWERFUL INDIVIDUAL. WE MUST QUESTION EVERYTHING.
Stephen: THAT'S SORT OF WHAT THESE RUSSIAN HEARINGS ARE ABOUT.
YES! >( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY, I'LL PLAWD THE INDIVIDUAL POWER. WHY NOT? WITH THESE RUSSIAN HEARINGS -- IT'S INTERESTING, THE RUSSIAN HEARINGS ALSO DOVETAIL WITH THE IDEA BECAUSE IT'S THE IDEA THAT A SOMETIMES ALLY-SOMETIMES ADVERSARY IS MANIPULATING WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT TRUE FOR THE VOTERS TO TRY TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION ON WHO WE VOTE FOR.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: AND THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO INVESTIGATE THAT AND JUST ACCEPT THE VAIL OF LIVES WE'VE BEEN SOLD.
EXACTLY. AND SOMETHING THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE BOOK AND PLAY WHICH IS NOW A PART OF OUR LIVES IS SHIFTING ENEMIES AND WAR HYSTERIA, AND STAYING IN A KIND OF GENERAL STATE OF ANXIETY. AND THE ANXIOUS STATE OF THE-- OF LIFE THAT WE'VE SEND, WHICH KIND OF MAKES US FEEL DEFENSIVE. IT MAKES US ACCEPTING, THAT WE WOULD NEVER ORDINARILY ACCEPT, BEYOND SURVEILLANCE, AS YOU SAY, THERE ARE SO MANY LIBERTIES WERE WILLING TO --
Stephen: YOU'RE A FAMOUS PERSON AND THERE ARE CAMERAS POINTED AT YOU ALL THE TIME.
IN MY HOUSEHOLD, I TOOK THE ALEXA-- WE HAD THE ALEXA FOR A WHILE,UN --
Stephen: SURE, SURE, THE AMAZON THING.
AND I PUT HER IN THE CLOS EAT I PUT ALEXA IN THE CABINET, BECAUSE MY SON JUST STARTED TALKING TO ALEXA AND ASKING HER FOR THINGS AND I REALIZED IT WAS BECOMING THIS PRESENCE IN OUR HOUSE THAT WAS SO BIZARRE. AND, OF COURSE, IT'S RECORDING EVERYTHING --
Stephen: YOU'RE AFRAID HE MIGHT LOVE HER MORE. "ALEXA, SEND BACK DAISY." "REVERSE SHIPPING COSTS." ( LAUGHTER ).
SO I DO GET A LITTLE NERVOUS WHEN IT SUDDENLY BECOMES CLEAR THAT WE ARE BUYING INTO THIS SURVEILLANCE. BUT IT ARE WORRIES ME LESS THAN-- YOU KNOW, IT WORRIES ME LESS THAN THE IDEA OF COLLUSION. IT WORRIES ME LESS THAN ACCEPTING LIES COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE PRESS SECRETARY. IT WORRIES ME LESS THAN THE PRESIDENT CLAIMING THE FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR IS A LIAR. THERE ARE THINGS THAT WORRY ME MUCH MORE. AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE THAT WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE QUESTIONING WHAT WE'RE ACCEPTING, AND WE HAVE TO JUST REMEMBER THAT IT'S OUR JOB TO BE CURIOUS CITIZENS AND JUST TAKE BACK THE POWER AS MUCH AS WE CAN, AND TO RESIST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: REVOLUTIONARY LEADER. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE WONDERFUL IN THE SHOW.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: AND THE SHOW IS BRILTD AND CHALLENGING. "1984" OPENS ON BROADWAY JUNE 22. OLIVIA WILDE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH EDDIE IZZARD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"." FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST IS AN EMMY AWARD-WINNING COMEDIAN WHO HAS PERFORMED IN 43 COUNTRIES IN FOUR LANGUAGES. PLEASE WELCOME EDDIE IZZARD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO HAVE YOU ON.
VERY GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: HAVE NOT SEEN YOU SINCE-- I WAS JUST SAYING TO YOU BACKSTAGE, SINCE WE WERE AT THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY AND/OR KEEP FEAR ALIVE AT THE MALL IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
IT WAS A CATCHY TITLE, WASN'T IT?
Stephen: IT WAS. THE PRINTER MADE A LOT OF MONEY.
NO IT WAS-- YES, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO BE THERE. AS A SPIRITUAL ATHEIST THAT I AM. GOOD START TO A THING IN AMERICA.
Stephen: SURE, WHY NOT?
I DON'T BE IN THE GUY UPSTAIRS. I BELIEVE IN US. I BELIEVE IN HUMANITY. I THINK THERE'S MORE GOOD WILL THAN ILL WILL IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: IT IS NICE. YOU CAN SOMETIMES-- YOU CAN SOMETIMES HAVE THAT REINFORCED WHEN YOU SEE A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE GET TOGETHER WITH GOOD WILL.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: LOVE FOR EACH OTHER.
ABSOLUTELY. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR POLITICS LAST YEAR WENT WEIRD IN YOUR COUNTRY AND MY COUNTRY. IN FRANCE IT'S GONE KIND OF BEAUTIFUL THIS YEAR.  ( APPLAUSE ) YES. AND AS YOU MENTION, I'M NOW PERFORMING IN FOUR LANGUAGES-- IT'S UP TO 45 COUNTRIES NOW YOU KNOW AROUND THE WORLD. COMEDY EXISTS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. SENSE OF HUMOR IS HUMAN AND NOT NATIONAL. THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING. THE FRENCH HAVE THIS, AND THE GERMANS DON'T HAVE-- IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S ACTUALLY-- IT'S ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S THE REFERENCES THAT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF. I DO IT TO NATIONAL REFERENCES. I TRAVEL AROUND. HUMAN SACRIFICE. I START MY SHOW-- IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE WE ALL DID IT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE HUMAN SACRIFICE --
Stephen: AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST OF THE CULTURE.
15 YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WE DO IT ON TWITTER NOW.
EXACTLY. BUT IT'S A BRILLIANT THING. IT'S-- EVEN THOUGH THE CRAZINESS OF THE POLITICS, NO ONE, EVEN TRUMP, IS NOT SAYING HUMAN-- MAYBE TRUMP IS SAYING HUMAN SACRIFICE. NEARLY EVERYONE HAS STOPPED IT. SO THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING THAT HUMANITY DID SAY, "WHOA! BACK IN THE DAY, SOMEONE WAS GOING, THE WEATHER IS BAD, THE CROPS ARE FAILED, THE GOD OBVIOUSLY HATE US SO WE'RE GOING TO KILL STEVE. THAT IS INSANE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILILY BROAD CAREER. YOU-- YOU'VE BEEN IN STAND-UP FOR OVER 30 YEARS. YOU HAVE TWO EMMYS. TONY NOMS FOR LEAD ACTORS. YOU ARE IN THE "OCEAN" MOVIES AND A NEW MEMOIR CALLED "BELIEVE ME:  A MEMOIR OF LOVE, DEATH, AND JAZZ CHICKENS." IS THAT-- IS THERE A STORY BEHIND JAZZ CHICKENS?
I DON'T EVEN MENTION THEM EXCEPT FOR IN THE TITLE. THEY'RE NOT MENTIONED IN THE BOOK AT ALL. WE WORKED OUT THE TITLE AND THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO THIS, YOU HAVE TO BE CRAZY SO I SHOVED IN JAZZ CHICKEN. THEY SAID YOU CAN DO THAT.
Stephen: EVERY SULT CULTURE IT'S SAID HAS JAZZ CHICKENS.
THEY COULD SAVE THE WORLD.
Stephen: YOU STARTED OUT AS A STREET PERFORMER. WE HAVE THIS SHOT HERE.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE BACK SIDE IS DOING.
Stephen: YOU'RE WRAPPED UP IN CHAINS. IS THIS COFFENT GARDEN?
YAND FOR FOUR YEARS I WAS A STREET PERFORMER AND I USED TO GO OUT IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WHO DID NOT WANT TO SEE ME WHICH IS THE HARDEST PERFORMING EVER. PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: I'VE DONE IT MANY TIMES.
I'VE SENT TWO AUDIENCES WAY, DISMISSED-- WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH, WHICH WAS AMAZE AGO.
Stephen: IN THE THEATER?
NO. IN THE STREET.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SEND THEM AWAY IN THE STREET. "I WANT YOU OUT OF THE CITY BY SUNDOWN."
WIFS MY PARTNER AT THE TIME AND WE WERE REALLY GIVING IT OUT AND THE AUDIENCE WAS JUST, YEAH, YEAH. AND AT A CERTAIN POINT I SAID,"YOU GUYS ARE JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH, AND WE'RE REALLY GIVING IT OUT HERE, AND THERE'S NO LOVE COMING BACK SO YOU MAY AS WELL GO." AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T GO. AFTER THAT, THAT WAS TOO INTERESTING. I MADE IT TOO DRAMATICALLY INTERESTING.
Stephen: DID THEY GET BETTER?
NO, THEY JUST STAYED. BUT I --
Stephen: DID YOU MAKE GOOD MONEY DOING THIS? WHAT KIND OF CASH WOULD YOU MAKE?
VERY LITTLE MONEY.
Stephen: ENOUGH TO DRINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YEAH, PEOPLE WOULD THROW BITS OF BROKEN BOTTLES AT YOU AND HELICOPTER PARTS. ENOUGH. SOME PEOPLE DID GOOD.
Stephen: WERE YOU EVER ON THE MOUND IN EDINBOROUGH?
YES, I DID THESE GREAT, LONG, IMPROVISED SHOWS WHICH WE GO ON AND ON AND ON BECAUSE I CAN GO ON AND ON. I DO TALK A LOT. I'M RUNNING FOR A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IN FOUR YEARS' TIME.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND. AFTER YEARS OF COMEDY-- WE'VE HAD SEVERAL ENTERTAINER/CELEBRITY PRESIDENTS. OBVIOUSLY WE HAD RAIG BE, OBVIOUSLY MR. TRUMP AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE AL FRANKEN WHO IS A SENATOR.
SENATOR AL FRANKEN I KNOW WELL. AND HIS POLITICS AND STYLE I AM TRYING TO EMULATE. HE TOOK A 233,000 MAJORITY LAST TIME HE WAS ELECTED.
Stephen: AL PRETTY MUCH DROPPED THE COMEDY IN THE SENATE FAIR LONG-- HE JUST RECENTLY STARTED MAKING JOKES AGAIN.
COMEDY IS INTERESTING. IT IS NOT A BUILDING TOOL. IT TEARS DOWN POMPOSITY AND STUPIDITY IN CERTAIN PRESIDENT S.
Stephen:  THANK GOD.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. I LIKE BUILDING-- I CAME OUT AS TRANSGENDER THAT YEARS AGO. I'VE NOW RUN OVER 18 MAR THORNGZ RAISED MONEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M DOING STAND-UP GIGS IN FOUR LANGUAGES, GERMAN, FRENCH, AND SPANISH. AND I'M TRYING TO BE A 21st CENTURY PERSON IN THE POSITIVE INCLUSIVE-- WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD WORK THIS SEARCH RICHE THE 21st CENTURY. SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE --
Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO GET A SEAT, A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT?
I'M NOT SURE WHERE. WHEREVER WILL HAVE ME IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
YOU CAN DO THAT THERE. YOU HAVE TO LIVE WHERE YOU REPRESENT HERE?
I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I HAVE PLAYED EVERYWHERE --
Stephen: SPEAK FOUR LANGUAGES.
I'M GOING TO BEG THEM, "PLEASE, HAVE ME." I AM A HARD WORKER.
