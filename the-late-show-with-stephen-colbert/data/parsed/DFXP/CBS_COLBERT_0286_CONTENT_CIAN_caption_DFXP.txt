AND NOW THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT'S POST-GAME INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE BIG GAME?
I SAY THE PATRIOTS WILL WIN.
Stephen: WE ALREADY KNOW THE PATRIOTS HAVE WON.
IN PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT AND SAID I'M RIGHT SNIEM SAYING IT. YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE HALF TIME SHOW. WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT LADY GAGA AND DANCERS?
THEY'RE POISONING THE YOUTH OF OUR COUNTRY.
Stephen: SO WHO WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE SEEN PERFORM AT THE HALF-TIME SHOW.
PUTIN.
Stephen: VLADIMIR PUTIN. DO YOU THINK HE WOULD LOOK GOOD IN LADY GAGA'S SPANNINGLY OUTFIT?
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YES.
Stephen: HE WOULD PROBABLY DO IT WITHOUT A SHIRT ON. YOU'VE SEEN HIM BARE-CHESTED IN PERSON, H NEW.
IT WAS VERY SMOOTH.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ) SO YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD ALLOW A MURDEROUS DICTATOR TO PERFORM AT THE HALF TIME SHOW?
I HAVE TO STICK UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS, RIGHT.
Stephen: SURE. WELL, THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME, SIR. ( LAUGHTER )
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES PAUL GIAMATTI, WENDY WILLIAMS AND OUR MUSICAL GUEST. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY IS STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WHOO! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. EVERYONE WATCH THE SUPERBOWL LAST NIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HELL OF A GAME. INCREDIBLE. FULL OF SURPRISES. THE BIGGEST COMEBACK IN SUPERBOWL HISTORY. ATLANTA HASN'T BEEN BURNED THIS BADLY SINCE 1864. THE FALCONS WERE RUNNING AWAY WITH IT. I ALMOST TURNED IT OFF. IT WAS 28-3. THEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER, F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY ANNOUNCED HE WAS OPENING AN INVESTIGATION INTO MATT RYAN'S EMAILS. ( LAUGHTER ) HE CLAIMS IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT, I THINK IT DID. IT RATTLED RYAN, THE CLEARLY.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: IT ALL ENDED WITH TOM BRADY TAKING HOME HIS FIFTH RING. IT WAS ANOTHER INSPIRING REMINDER THAT IN AMERICA, RICH WHITE MEN MARRIED TO MODELS CAN STILL MAKE IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: IT'S A STORY OF HOPE.
Stephen: IT REALLY IS A STORY OF HOPE. OF COURSE, THE PLAY OF THE GAME HAD TO BE JULIAN EDELMAN SOMEHOW REELING IN THIS PASS WITHOUT THE BALL TOUCHING THE GROUND. IT'S A PLAY BEING RE-ENACTED ALL OVER THE BOSTON AREA TODAY BY HUNGOVER DADS WITH THEIR BABIES. ( PIANO RIFF ) BABY'S FINE. OF COURSE, THIS WAS GOOD NEWS FOR PATRIOTS FAN DONALD TRUMP. HE WATCHED THE GAME FROM WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FOOTBALL-THEMED WEDDING, WITH HIS WIFE, MELANIA TRUMP, SEEN HERE NOT READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL. I'M GUESSING AT THIS POINT SHE'S NOT A HUGE FAN OF LOCKER ROOM TALK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS REMEMBER -- REALLY? REALLY? YOU WENT FROM AW TO CLAPPING AWFULLY FAST. I'LL TAKE YOUR PITY. OF COURSE, THE OTHER MVP OF THE NIGHT WAS HALFTIME PERFORMER LADY GAGA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE DID A FANTASTIC JOB, DIDN'T SHE?
Jon: SHE'S INCREDIBLE, MAN.
Stephen: SHE DID A FANTASTIC JOB. SHE STAYED AWAY FROM ANYTHING POLITICAL, INSTEAD OPTING FOR A UNIFYING MESSAGE.
ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: SHE REALLY CAPTURED THE NATIONAL MOOD OF WANTING TO HURL YOURSELF OFF A BUILDING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE! ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) TELL THE STATUE OF LIBERTY I LOVE HER. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, GAGA WASN'T ENTIRELY NONPOLITICAL. CLEARLY, THE HALFTIME SHOW WAS A PRO-IMMIGRATION ARGUMENT FOR REFUGEES FROM THE PLANET "SEX-TACULON". YOU SCORED ONE TO HAVE COMMERCIALS THIS YEAR, DIDN'T YOU? 1/2 INSIDE THE LINES.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE, EVERYBODY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) INCREDIBLE. YEAH. THAT'S WHY YOU GOT INTO JAZZ, FOR THE COMMERCIALS, RIGHT?
Stephen: OF COURSE, THE GAME IS FUN. BUT WE KNOW EVERYONE TUNES IN FOR BILL O'REILLY'S INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OF COURSE HE ASKED ABOUT THE HEAD COACH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
DO YOU RESPECT PUTIN. I RESPECT HIM. PUTIN IS A KILLER. WE HAVE A LOT OF KILLERS. WHAT, YOU THINK OUR COUNTRY'S SO INNOCENT?
STEPHEN: OOOH, I KNOW THAT ONE. YES. ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, COMPARED TO PUTIN. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF BAD THINGS OVER THE YEARS, BUT WE EVENTUALLY FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. THEN KEN BURNS DOES A DOCUMENTARY. THERE'S A PROCESS. YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE STEPS. THAT'S HOW IT GOES! ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HE SAID THAT! A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID, YOU THINK OUR COUNTRY'S SO INNOCENT? HAS THERE BEEN A PRESIDENT WHO HATES AMERICA MORE? I MEAN, BESIDES JEFFERSON DAVIS. IT'S LIKE PUTIN IS THE BAD GUY IN A MOVIE AND SAYS TO TRUMP, "YOU AMERICANS THINK YOU ARE SO MORALLY SUPERIOR, BUT WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT YOU AND I." AND TRUMP GOES, "YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE KILLERS." I'M SORRY, WHAT? I'M SORRY, WHAT? I'M SORRY, WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY, TRUMP? "WE'RE KILLERS TOO. I'LL HELP YOU KILL EVERYBODY." "OKAY, THIS IS CREEPING ME OUT." ( APPLAUSE ) "LOOK, DON'T CALL ME, OKAY?" IN FACT, IT TURNS OUT VLADMIR PUTIN WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE INTERVIEW, BECAUSE THE KREMLIN TOLD REPORTERS, "WE CONSIDER SUCH WORDS FROM THE FOX TV COMPANY TO BE UNACCEPTABLE AND INSULTING AND WE WOULD PREFER TO GET AN APOLOGY." IF I WERE YOU, FOX TV COMPANY, I WOULD APOLOGIZE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD, BUT THAT GUY'S A KILLER! ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND YOU KNOW PUTIN WAS WATCHING, BECAUSE HE LOVES THE SUPER BOWL. HE LOVES IT SO MUCH THAT, ACCORDING TO PATRIOT'S OWNER BOB KRAFT, DURING A VISIT TO RUSSIA IN 2005, PUTIN STOLE KRAFT'S SUPER BOWL RING. WOW. THAT'S BAD. NOT AS BAD AS STEALING OUR ELECTION BUT A CLOSE SECOND. WE'LL GET ANOTHER ELECTION. CAN'T GET THAT RING BACK. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, BOB KRAFT, WHO'S A FRIEND OF TRUMP'S, WANTS HIM TO GET THE RING BACK. MAYBE TRUMP CAN GET IT WHEN HE'S KISSING IT. NEXT TIME. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT TRUMP'S BEEN PRESIDENT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, AND YESTERDAY THE NEW YORK TIMES GAVE US A BEHIND-THE-SCENES GLIMPSE OF THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE. APPARENTLY, THINGS ARE SO DISORGANIZED THAT, AFTER MEETINGS, VISITORS WANDER AROUND, TESTING DOORKNOBS UNTIL FINDING ONE THAT LEADS TO AN EXIT. ( LAUGHTER ) OUTSIDE, CHRIS CHRISTIE IS WANDERING AROUND SEEING IF THERE'S A WAY HE CAN STILL GET IN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT HERE'S THE CRAZIEST PART: APPARENTLY, TRUMP'S AIDES HAD TO MEET IN THE DARK, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPERATE THE LIGHT SWITCHES IN THE CABINET ROOM. WELL, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IF YOU FIND A BIG RED BUTTON, THAT IS NOT THE LIGHTS. DON'T TOUCH IT. ( APPLAUSE ) JUST LEAVE IT. COULD THINGS REALLY BE THIS DISORGANIZED AT THE WHITE HOUSE? HERE TO TELL US, LIVE FROM THE WEST WING IS TRUMP STAFFER ALAN DENNINGS. ALAN? ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY. JIM, I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE SATELLITE HERE.
NO, I'M RIGHT HERE, STEPHEN. JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THAT LIGHT SWITCH YET.
STEPHEN: GOT IT. SO, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THESE REPORTS OF DISARRAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE?
NOT AT ALL, STEPHEN. THE TRUMP TEAM HAS THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE AND A CLEAR VISION OF -- ( CRASHING SOUND ) AHH! MY KNEE!
STEPHEN: ARE YOU OKAY THERE, ALAN?
PERFECT, STEPHEN! JUST TRIPPED OVER A PILE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS. BUT I'LL BE FINE AS LONG AS I DON'T TOPPLE MARTHA WASHINGTON'S PRICELESS MING-- ( SHATTERING NOISE ) OH NO!
STEPHEN: ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE A SECOND AND FIND THE LIGHT SWITCH?
NO, I'VE GOT IT. IT'S RIGHT-- ( CRASHING SOUND ) WHOA! HOLD ON, JUST GOT TO-- ( SILLY SOUND EFFECTS )
STEPHEN: WAIT, WAS THAT AN ELEPHANT?
NO, I JUST STEPPED ON STEVE BANNON. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: ALAN DENNINGS, EVERYONE. SAY HELLO TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE TRUMP-O'REILLY INTERVIEW LATER. WE'LL BE TOUCHING ON THAT AFTER THE SHOW. I HEARD THIS BEFORE THE SHOW -- EARLIER TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS DOWN IN FLORIDA ADDRESSING U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND. SURPRISINGLY, HE DIDN'T ORDER THEM TO NUKE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. BUT HE DID MAKE A VERY BOLD CLAIM ABOUT THE MEDIA'S COVERAGE OF TERROR ATTACKS.
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE DETERMINED TO STRIKE OUR HOMELAND AS THEY DID ON 9/11. ALL OVER EUROPE IT'S HAPPENING. IT'S GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE IT'S NOT EVEN BEING REPORTED AND, IN MANY CASES, THE VERY, VERY DISHONEST PRESS DOESN'T WANT TO REPORT IT. THEY HAVE THEIR REASONS, AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
STEPHEN: OKAY, THE PRESIDENT IS ACCUSING THE MEDIA IS REFUSING TO COVER MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACKS. WHY? "REASONS." IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. YOU KNOW THE OLD NEWS ADAGE, "IF IT BLEEDS, DON'T TALK ABOUT IT." BUT IN ONE CASE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT. IN ONE CASE THERE WAS A TERROR ATTACK THE PRESS DID NOT TALK ABOUT -- IT'S SOMETHING CALLED THE BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. I LAUGH WHEN I'M SCARED, TOO. AND I WASN'T GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS STORY, BECAUSE IT HAPPENED LAST THURSDAY, AND THE CRAZY TRAIN HAS GONE WAY DOWN THE TRACK SINCE THEN, AND I FIGURED THIS TIRED HOBO MISSED HIS CHANCE TO JUMP IN THE BOXCAR. BUT TODAY THE PRESIDENT JUST GAVE ME A REASON TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN. HERE'S THE DEAL: IT WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT LAST WEEK BY WHITE HOUSE SPOKESWOMAN AND PERSON WHO HASN'T SLEPT SINCE THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION, KELLYANNE CONWAY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A SIX-MONTH BAN ON THE IRAQI REFUGEE PROGRAM AFTER TWO IRAQIS CAME HERE TO THIS COUNTRY WERE RADICALIZED AND THEY WERE MASTERMINDS BEHIND THE BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GET COVERED.
STEPHEN: YES! IT DIDN'T GET COVERED. ON THE FLIMSY EXCUSE THAT THERE WAS NO BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE. I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER WHERE WE WEREN'T WERE WHEN WE DIDN'T HEAR THAT NOTHING HAPPENED. NOW, KELLYANNE CONWAY NOW SAYS THAT IT WAS JUST AN "HONEST MISTAKE." EVEN THOUGH SHE TALKED ABOUT THE NONEXISTENT MASSACRE TO TMZ AND COSMOPOLITAN. SO IT COULD BE MORE MEDIA BIAS. I SAY THEY NEED TO PRESENT BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY-- THE THINGS THAT DID HAPPEN AND THE THINGS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! LET THE VICTIMS OF THE BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE DECIDE IF THEY WERE KILLED! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO FAR, NOT ONE OF THEM HAS COME FORWARD. NOW I DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS. JUST BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T AN INSIDE JOB. THINK ABOUT IT. IF AMERICA ISN'T GOING TO BE ATTACKED, WHO ISN'T GOING TO DO IT? US. THAT'S WHY I'M A BOWLING GREEN TRUTHER. I DEMAND THAT THE MEDIA NOT RELEASE THE REPORTS THAT THEY DID NOT DO ON THE ATTACKS THAT DID NOT OCCUR,  AND I WILL NOT REST UNTIL THEY DON'T. ( LAUGHTER ) MY SACRED PROMISE TO YOU, WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS IT DOESN'T DEVELOP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE LATEST ON DONALD TRUMP'S VOTER FRAUD. ♪
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. FOLKS, I'M SURE YOU GUYS ALL KEEP UP WITH THE NEWS. YOU'RE THE IT-GETTERS. REMEMBER HOW TRUMP SAID 3 TO 5 MILLION PEOPLE VOTED ILLEGALLY AND, IF IT WERE TRUE, IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY BUT IT'S NOT TRUE SO IT'S NOT? THAT LIL' THING? WELL, IN THE SUPER BOWL SUPERBILL O'REILLY INTERVIEW STARRING DONALD TRUMP AS THE SO-CALLED PRESIDENT, HE ADDRESSED IT HEAD-ON.
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE REGISTRATION, YOU HAVE ILLEGALS, YOU HAVE DEAD PEOPLE, YOU HAVE THIS -- IT'S REALLY A BAD SITUATION. IT'S REALLY BAD -- AND --
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROVEN CORRECT IN THAT STATEMENT?
I THINK I ALREADY HAVE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID I'M CORRECT.
BUT THE DATA HAS TO SHOW THAT 3 MILLION ILLEGALS VOTED.
FORGET THAT, FORGET ALL OF THAT.
STEPHEN: YESSS. FORGET ALL OF THAT. JUST FORGET THE DATA. THAT'S NOT THE EVIDENCE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST FORGET IT! AND THIS IS REALLY BOTHERING TRUMP. ACCORDING TO ONE OF TRUMP'S OWN ADVISERS, "TRUMP HAS BEEN STEWING ABOUT HIS POPULAR VOTE COUNT FOR WEEKS." AND I BELIEVE HE'S BEEN STEWING FOR WEEKS. THAT'S WHY HIS MEAT LOOKS SO TENDER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ TENDERIZE ♪ ♪ WHOA, TENDERIZE ♪ BUT THE ONLY EVIDENCE TRUMP HAS EVER HAD FOR HIS CLAIM IS THE TWITTER FEED OF TEXAS BUSINESSMAN AND GUY WHOSE FIRST NAME IS 60% THE LETTER G, "GREGG PHILLIPS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S YOUR ANALYSIS, GREG-G-G-G?
OUR ANALYSIS IS WHAT IT IS AND WE BELIEVE THE TRUTH IS TRUTH AND IF -- IF THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM UM, UM, BELIEVE THE SAME IS TRUE AND THEN, UH MAYBE THEY ARE.
DO YOU HAVE THE PROOF?
YES.
WILL YOU PROVIDE IT.
YES.
CAN I HAVE IT?
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: SO SHOULD I GUESS ALL THREE MILLION NAMES? AARON AARDMAN? AARON AARDMORE? STOP ME WHEN I HIT ONE! THEY STILL MAKE PHONE BOOKS, BY THE WAY. NOW, THIS KIND OF ACCUSATION IS CALLED, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO TECHNICAL HERE-- "BULL ( BLEEP)". IN FACT, THE LARGEST INVESTIGATION -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUGE! HUGE! HUGE BULL (BLEEP) FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN FACT, THE LARGEST INVESTIGATION OF VOTER IMPERSONATION EVER, FOUND JUST 31 INCIDENTS OUT OF A BILLION BALLOTS CAST. BY THE WAY, 31 OUT OF A BILLION... ALSO MY CURRENT YELP REVIEW. FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AND EVEN THOUGH TRUMP SAYS 3 MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR CLINTON ILLEGALLY, SO FAR, IN THE 2016 ELECTION THERE WERE JUST FOUR DOCUMENTED CASES OF VOTER FRAUD. OKAY, COULD BE FOR FOUR... COULD BE 3 MILLION. SO, LET'S SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO HERE. FOUR TIMES -- PLUS, DIVIDED -- THAT ADDS UP TO -- STILL BULL (BLEEP). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. SO -- MY CALCULATIONS. SO, DESPITE ALL THE ZERO EVIDENCE, WHY DOES TRUMP BELIEVE THERE'S VOTER FRAUD?
IT WAS A COMMENT THAT HE MADE ON A LONG STANDING BELIEF.
STEPHEN: OH, HE BELIEVES IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING HE BELIEVES. IT'S AN ARTICLE OF FAITH. I GET IT. MY WIFE DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S VOTER FRAUD, I BELIEVE THERE IS. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GONNA RAISE THE KIDS. WE'LL FIND SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE. AND YET, DESPITE THE LACK OF "ANY" EVIDENCE, TRUMP STILL TWEETED THAT HE WOULD LAUNCH A MAJOR INVESTIGATION INTO VOTER FRAUD. OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT A MAJOR INVESTIGATION OF SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN SOUNDS LIKE? SOUNDS LIKE A CASE FOR CBS'S NEWEST CRIME DRAMA, "CSI: MAJOR INVESTIGATION OF SOMETHING I READ ON THE INTERNET."
DON'T WORRY. WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRIME.
WHAT CYME? EN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW YOUR HUSBAND?
LIKE A SECOND AGO. HE'S PROBABLY ALREADY DEAD.
I'M RIGHT HERE! ♪ WHO ARE YOU ♪
Stephen: TUESDAYS ON CBS, AND I'M BEING TOLD IT'S ALREADY CANCELED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR YOU KNOW FROM "SIDEWAYS," "CINDERELLA MAN," AND "JOHN ADAMS." HE NOW STARS IN SHOWTIME'S "BILLIONS." PLEASE WELCOME, PAUL GIAMATTI! ♪ COME TOGETHER RIGHT NOW ♪ ♪ OVER ME ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WOW! WOW! MAN! WHOO!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YA. NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: I LIKE THE CASUAL GGIAMATTI.
I SPEND SEVEN MONTHS IN A SUIT AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO WEAR A SUIT ANYMORE. THEY MADE ME PUT A SWEATER ON BACKSTAGE TO LOOK BETTER. I SHOWED UP JUST IN A T-SHIRT.
Stephen: YOU LOOK VERY NICE.
THANKS A LOT.
Stephen: I LIKE THIS. IS THIS FOR A PART?
IT'S BECAUSE I GOT BORED ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH SHAVING AND I WAS, LIKE, I'M JUST GOING TO STICK WITH THIS. I'M PLAYING THE DEVILED HAM GUY. THAT'S WHAT I'M PLAYING. FLAP FLAP. >( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WE WERE EARLIER IN THE SHOW ABOUT THE SUPER BOWL. DID YOU HAVE A SUPER BOWL PARTY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO, I MISSED IT. I SKIPPED THE SUPER BOWL.
Stephen: JUST MISSED IT? I WAS GOING TO GO TO A PARTY BUT DIDN'T.
Stephen: YOU WERE ACTUALLY INVITED TO A PARTY?
YEAH, I JUST FELT UNDER THE WEATHER AND DECIDED NOT TO GO.
Stephen: AND THEN NOT WATCHED THE GAME.
I WATCHED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ON THE INTERNET.
Stephen: WHO WERE YOU FOR? THE FALCONS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T PULL THAT HARD. REMIND ME NOT TO HAVE YOU PULL FOR ME.
OKAY.
Stephen: ARE YOU NOT A SPORTS GUY?
NOT A BIG FOOTBALL GUY.
Stephen: NOT A BIG FOOTBALL GUY.
NO, I'M NOT. I'M NOT A HUGE SPORTS GUY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I LIKE WATCHING HOCKEY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITHOUT A BALL IN HOCKEY. YOU'RE ALWAYS PLAYING EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PUCK.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: DID YOU PLAY HOCKEY.
NO.
Stephen: DID YOU PLAY ANYTHING?
I WAS A SWIMMER.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR STROKE.
BACKSTROKE.
Stephen: BACKSTROKE. YES.
Stephen: WEREN'T YOU AFRAID OF SLAMMING INTO THE WALL?
NO, I GOT VERY GOOD AT BEING ABLE TO DOWABLE TO COUNT OFF --
Stephen: THE TILES? THAT'S WHAT FLAGS ARE FOR ATTEND OF THE POOL.
Stephen: I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST CELEBRATING. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN YOU SEE THE FLAG, WHAT DO YOU DO?
I'VE GOT FIVE STROKES LEFT SO I WON'T HIT THE WALL.
Stephen: DID YOU WIN ANYTHING, MEDDLES?
NO, NEVER GOT ANY MEDDLES. NOPE. I WAS NOT VERY GOOD. I WAS PERFECTLY MEDIOCRE. I WAS BAD BUT I ENJOYED IT.
Stephen: NOW, MANY PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM YOUR AWARD-WINNING ROLE AS JOHN ADAMS ON HBO.
CORRECT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A TREMENDOUSLY POLITICAL GUY, BUT YOU PLAYED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO WAS VERY CONTINUE VERSEL IN HIS DAY. ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN JOHN ADAMS AND DONALD TRUMP?
SURE. THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF FEISTY CHAPS. THEY BOTH SORT OF DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING SITTING DOWN. YOU KNOW, ADAMS DID THIS WHOLE ALIEN SEDITION ACT WHICH WAS TO KEEP THE FRENCH OUT, AT THAT POINT. SO WE HAVE HIM TO THANK THAT WE DIDN'T GET OVERRUN BY THE FRENCH.
Stephen: OH. O SE DICIOUS TALK, YOU COULD BE THROWN IN JAIL AND MADE IT HARDER FOR IMMIGRANTS TO BECOME CITIZENS. THE AIL JEN ACT WAS JOHN ADAMS AND IT'S STILL ON THE BOOKS.
Stephen: HE AND SCWEFERSEN, THEY THEY RESPECTED AND HATED EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THIS IS HOW DIRTY POLITICS WAS BACK IN THE DAY. WHEN WE SAY IT'S DIRTY NOW. WHAT DID JEFFERSON HAVE A NEWSPAPER GUY WRITE ABOUT ADAMS? I LOVE THIS.
A TOOTHLESS, HAIRLESS OLD HERMAPHRODITE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHILE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
YES. WHY GOT BRUTAL WITH EACH OTHER.
Stephen: THEY DUELED BACK THEN.
HAMILTON KILLED BURR AS WE KNOW.
Stephen: WHAT?! ORRY, DID I JUST SCREW UP THE MUSICAL FOR EVERYBODY? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO PEOPLE RECOGNIZE YOU MORE AS JOHN ADAMS OR ARE YOU THE I WON'T DRINK MERLOT GUY FROM "SIDEWAYS"? WHICH ONE DO YOU GET NAILED FOR?
SORT OF BOTH. I GET THE PER LOW GUY A LOT. MERLOT GUY, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO CALL HIM FROM NOW ON. THAT WAS THE PART I PLAYED, MERLOT GUY.
Stephen: THAT WAS IN THE SCRIPT.
EXACTLY, MERLOT GUY. I WENT TO THE STEAKHOUSE THE OTHER NIGHT AND THE WINE EXPERT COMES UP AND HE'S, LIKE, I'VE WAITED TEN YEARS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU THE WINE LIST. AND I WAS, LIKE, DUDE, I DON'T KNOW (BLEEP) ABOUT WINE. I WAS, LIKE, I'M SO SORRY, MAN. I DON'T KNOW (BLEEP) ABOUT WINE. ( APPLAUSE ) I FELT LIKELY BAD. THE GUY WAS SO PSYCHED. WHAT A JERK. I SHOULD HAVE LIED TO HIM.
Stephen: HE WOULDN'T KNOW? THEY MAKE IT ALL UP. JUST SAY, I'M GETTING HINTS OF LEATHER AND DRIED CHERRIES. ( LAUGHTER ) SO MUCH GREAT STUFF ON THE TV.

Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I SAID. BEFORE THE SUPER BOWL, YOU THREW SOME SHADE AT GA-GA.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR SHADE, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I KNOW SHADE, GIRL.
I WAS TRYING TO BE CAPTAIN OF SECURITY FOR THE COUNTRY AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE MORE THINGS TO BE INVOLVED WITH THAN THE SECURITY OF LADY GAGA JUMPING OFF THE ROOF. LIKE THE SUPER BOWL IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST EVENTS.
Stephen: I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE SUPER BOWL. I WATCHED THE SUPER BOWL.
I DON'T BUT I READ -- STUFF. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU AND PAUL GIAMATTI, BIG READERSER. COME ON. YOU SAY, I GOTTA UNDERSTAND "SHADE"?
NO, WHAT I WAS SAYING IS TBA GAY JUMPING OFF AND THEM HAVING TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER JUMPING OFF A BUILDING AND BREAKING BONES WAS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS NER-DO-WELLERS AROUND THE STADIUM.
Stephen: LIKE WE COULD END UP WITH ANOTHER BOWLING GREEN MASSACRE ON OUR HANDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CELEBRITIES, THEIR BUSINESS IS OUR BUSINESS.
YES.
Stephen: IS YOUR BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS? YOU'RE A CELEBRITY. CAN YOU POINT THAT LAYS ART YOUR OWN EYES THERE?
I MEAN, WHEN IT GETS FLIPPED MY WAY, I HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT I DON'T REALLY LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.
Stephen: WHEN HAVE YOU DEALT WITH IT?
YOU KNOW, HERE AND THERE. IT'S KIND OF COME ALONG A LITTLE LATE IN LIFE FOR ME, SO I LOOK AT MYSELF A SET-SIDER WHO ENJOYS POP CULTURE.
