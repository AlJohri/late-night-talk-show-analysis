OKAY, MR. NEESON, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
I SEE YOU. WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WEAK.
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. MAYBE A LITTLE MORE JOLLY. THINK SANTA. ( LAUGHTER ) I SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WEAK. ( LAUGHTER ) I WATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. OH, YEAH. I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WEAK. I KNOW. I'M MAKING A LIST AND CHECKING IT TWICE. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHO'S NAUGHTY OR NICE.
OKAY, I THINK-- I THINK MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE TOO--
YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING I THINK IT'S RIGHT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT SANTA IS SAYING? HE'S MAKING A LIST, NAUGHTY-NICE. HE'S DETAILED. HE'S SINGLE MINDED. HE'S AN EYE IN THE SKY BRINGING SWIFT JUDGMENT ( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY, BUT HE'S ALSO BRINGING TOIRS TO CHILDREN.
NOT THE NAUGHTY ONES. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THAT REINDEER THAT RAN OVER GRANDMA. I WILL LOOK FOR HIM. I WILL FIND HIM. AND I WILL KILL HIM. BUT DO YOU MIND IF I IF I TRY SOMETHING-- AND THAT'S NOT A QUESTION. ( CLEARS THROAT ) OKAY. RELEASE THE KRINGLE!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES LIAM NEESON AND SHEPARD SMITH FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THAT'S-- THAT'S EXACTLY-- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE "LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I'M SORRY-- I FORGOT WHO WON THE ELECTION. DOSVIDANYA. ( LAUGHTER ) DOBRO POZHALOVAT "LATE SHOW." YA STIVEN KOLBERT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE GOT TO BRUSH UP. I'M HOPING THEY ASK ME TO DO THE KREMLIN CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER THIS YEAR. IT'S A TOUGH CROWD. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW. HI, VLAD! THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY KEEPS TELLING US THAT RUSSIA, PUTIN SPECIFICALLY, HACKED OUR ELECTION. BUT NOW, DONALD TRUMP IS TWEETING STUFF LIKE, "IF RUSSIA OR SOME OTHER ENTITY WAS HACKING, WHY DID THE WHITE HOUSE WAIT SO LONG TO ACT? WHY DID THEY ONLY COMPLAIN AFTER HILLARY LOST?" THEY DID COMPLAIN BEFORE SHE LOST, DONALD! I COMPLAINED, TOO. THE PRESIDENT DID. YOU TALKED ABOUT IT. YOU ASKED THEM TO HACK HILLARY!
RUSSIA, IF YOU ARE LISTENING, I HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
Stephen: OH, YOU KNOW WHERE THE RUSSIANS MIGHT FIND THOSE EMAILS? WHEREVER YOU'RE HIDING YOUR TAX RETURNS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST LOOK. LOOK THERE! LOOK THERE!
Jon: OH, OOOOH!
Stephen: SO CHECK ONE'S CALENDAR. FIVE WEEKS FROM TODAY, DONALD J. TRUMP WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. THEY'RE ALL GOING, "TRUMP!" NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT. WILL HE DIVEST HIS BUSINESSES? WILL HE HOLD PRESS CONFERENCES? WILL STATE DINNERS BE REPLACED WITH HAPPY MEALS ON HIS JET? ( LAUGHTER ) "MERKEL, KEEP YOUR GRUBBY HANDS OFF MY HAPPY MEAL TOY." BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO DO ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS A CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER, AND JUST THIS WEEK, WE FOUND OUT HIS TRANSITION TEAM HAS BEEN SEEKING NAMES OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INVOLVED IN CLIMATE MEETINGS. THEY'RE MAKING LISTS. WHAT'S NEXT? CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS? "SIR, ARE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A MEMBER OF CHANNEL 7's ACCUWEATHER NEWS TEAM? IS YOUR REAL NAME STORMY SPRINKLES?" ANSWER THE QUESTION, SIR!" THE CLIMATE CHANGE COMMUNITY IS SO FREAKED OUT-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- SCIENTISTS ARE FRANTICALLY COPYING U.S. CLIMATE DATA, FEARING IT MIGHT VANISH UNDER TRUMP. AGAIN, IF YOU WANT TO HIDE SOMETHING PUT IT WHEREVER HIS TAX RETURNS ARE. OF COURSE, AMERICAN SCIENTISTS ARE NOT ON THEIR OWN. IN TORONTO, EXPERTS WILL COPY IRREPLACEABLE PUBLIC DATA AND COMPILE A WEB SITE TO HARBOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THAT EVEN FACTS ARE MOVING TO CANADA. ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD-BYE, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL MISS YOU! DON'T FORGET TO WRITE! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS GET ME DOWN. UH-UH! IT'S NOT GOING TO BANK DOWN MY CHEER. I LOVE THIS TIME OF YEAR. I THINK THIS TIME OF YEAR IS FANTASTIC NO MATTER WHAT HOLIDAY YOU CELEBRATE: CHRISTMAS, CHANNUKAH, KWANZAA, THE SOLSTICE. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SEASON I CAN'T-- I JUST-- I HATE TO SAY IT THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T GET BEHIND. I'M ABOUT TO TAKE DOWN THIS SEASON JUST ONE LITTLE NOTCH IN PART ONE OF MY ONE-PART SEGMENT, STEPHEN COLBERT'S "BAH, HUMBUG!" TONIGHT'S HUMBUGGERY: MISTLETOE. THIS IS ONE IS AMESSED-UP TRADITION. IF YOU CATCH SOMEBODY UNDERNEATH MISTLETOE, TRADITION SAYS YOU CAN KISS THAT PERSON WHETHER THEY WANT IT OR NOT! IT SHOULD BE CALLED "MISTLE-TRUMP." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DONALD TRUMP SAID, DONALD TRUMP SAID, IF YOU'RE A STAR YOU CAN GRAB THEM BY THE HOLLY, AND THEY CAN'T STOP YOU. AND BEFORE YOU GO CALLING ME A PARTY POOPER, YOU SHOULD KNOW THE REAL POOPER HERE IS MISTLETOE, BECAUSE THE WORD "MISTLETOE" IS DERIVED FROM THE ANGLO-SAXON WORDS "MISTEL," MEANING "DUNG," AND "TAN," MEANING "TWIG." "OOH, KISS ME, I'M STANDING UNDER THE (BLEEP)-STICK! SO ROMANTIC!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MISTLETOE-- WE CAN SAY (BLEEP) STICK ON CBS, CAN'T ME? THEY'RE TELLING ME WE CAN SAY (BLEEP) STICK ON CBS. THAT'S THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO ME. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, CBS. MISTLETOE GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE BIRDS POOPING OUT THE SEEDS ONTO TWIGS IS THE WAY IT SPREADS IN THE WILD. LET'S JUST BE GRATEFUL THAT'S NOT HOW SANTA SPREADS CHRISTMAS CHEER. AND THIS PART OF THE STORY IS IMPORTANT. YOU MAY NOT KNOW, BUT MISTLETOE IS POISONOUS. WHY NOT JUST HANG UP A BAG OF CYANIDE CAPSULES? ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, IT CAN CAUSE DROWSINESS, NAUSEA, AND BLURRED VISION, AND WE ALREADY HAVE EGGNOG FOR THAT! SO THIS YEAR, MISTLETOE WILL HAVE NO PLACE IN MY CELEBRATIONS. I WILL STICK TO THE NICE, NORMAL TRADITIONS: PROPPING UP A SLOWLY-DYING PINE TREE AND WAITING FOR AN ANCIENT ELF-MAN WITH A STOCKING FETISH TO BREAK INTO MY HOME. MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( "JINGLE BELLS" )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN! I LOVE THAT SONG. I LOVE IT. I LOVE THAT. THAT IS ONE GREAT SONG. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. EVERYBODY CAN SING ALONG. WE ARE IN PRIME CHRISTMAS CAROL SEASON RIGHT NOW.
Jon: YEAH. IT'S THAT TIME, EVERYBODY PLAYING ON THE SONGS ON THE ROAD RADIO. I MEAN, I LOVE ALL CHRISTMAS MUSIC.
Stephen: YOU DO, YEAH.
Jon: EXCEPT FOR ONE SONG.
Stephen: WHAT SONG IS THAT ♪ JINGLE BELLS, BATMAN SMELLS ROBIN LAID AN EGG. ♪ BATMOBILE LOST A WHEEL AND JOKER GOT AWAY ♪
Stephen: YEAH, I USED TO SING THAT SONG WHEN I WAS A KID.
Jon: I'M NOT INTO THAT SONG, MAN. IT'S A SAD STORY. THE JOKER GOT AWAY JUST BECAUSE BATMAN HAD CAR TROUBLE.
Stephen: ALSO, ROBIN... OVULATED SOMEHOW. THEY KIND OF GLOSS OVER HOW THE EGG GOT OUT OF ROBIN, BUT IT'S A PRETTY UPSETTING IMAGE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S WEIRD.
Jon: REAL STRANGE. IT'S NASTY, YOU KNOW. THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE LIBERTY, BEING THE MUSIC DIRECTOR, OF PUTTING BATMAN REFERENCE INTO ALL THE CHRISTMAS SONGS.
Stephen: SO THE KIDS WOULD HAVE OPTIONS, OH, YEAH, ALL OF THE SONGS.
Stephen: ALL THE CHRISTMAS CAROLS?
Jon: ONLY THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ONES.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD. YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LEGAL. WHAT ABOUT A MEDLEY? WE CAN DO A MEDLEY RIGHT NOW. WHY DON'T WE ALL SING ALONG TO JON'S MEDLEY OF CHRISTMAS BATMAN SONGS. THAT WOULD BE FUN. JUST LOOK AT YOUR LITTLE MONITORS HERE. WE'LL HAVE ALL THE LYRICS THERE. JUST FOLLOW THE BOUNCING BAT SIGNAL.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, EVERYONE RISE. PLEASE RISE. PLEASE RISE. I'M TALKING TO YOU, NOT MYSELF. PLEASE RISE. FOR OUR FINALE. SUNG TO THE TUNE OF "ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH."
Stephen: WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. LIAM NEESON IS HERE! AND WHEN WE COME BACK, I'VE GOT SOME HOLIDAY PROCLAMATIONS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO OBEY. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. HAPPY HOLIDAYS. HAPPY HOLIDAYS. HAPPY FRIDAY.
Jon: HAPPY FRIDAY!
Stephen: HAPPY FRIDAY TO YOU, JON.
Jon: HAPPY FRIDAY!
Stephen: HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, I JUST WANT-- THIS IS THE LAST SHOW OF THE WEEK. THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW OF THE WEEK. I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL WEEK NEXT WEEK. I'LL BE PRESENTING THE "BEST IN 'LATE SHOW' RETROSPECTACULAR END-OF-YEAR WRAP-UP-ABRATION," FEATURING MY FAVORITE MOMENTS FROM THE "LATE SHOW" THIS YEAR, TO SAY GOODBYE TO 2016, OR, IF YOU PREFER, "KISS MY ASS" 2016. TUNE IN NEXT WEEK. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. THE FACT THEY CAN DO THIS, I CAN JUST TAKE ANY OF THE SHOWS I WANT, MIX THEM UP AND GO, HEY, LOVE IT. OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU WHY. AS THE HOST OF A TALK SHOW, I'M IN A POSITION OF ENORMOUS POWER AND YET THERE IS THOSE OUT THERE EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN I AM POWERFUL. HISTORY'S MOST FEROCIOUS DESPOTS, LIKE GENGHIS KHAN, KIM JONG UN, JUSTIN BIEBER. ALL THREE OF USE AND I REALIZE THERE'S FOR, BUT I'M SO POWERFUL I'M CALLING IT THREE. ALL OF US HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON: WE BRING THE HEAT OF THE SWEET BEATS, AND WE ALL HAVE A BIG FURRY HAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MY HEAD, ANY AND ALL PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. LET IT BE WRITTEN THAT IF YOU GIVE SOMEONE AN iTUNES GIFT CARD FOR CHRISTMAS, THEY'RE ALLOWED TO USE THAT CARD TO JIMMY OPEN YOUR FRONT DOOR AND STEAL YOUR WALLET TO BUY THEMSELVES AN ACTUAL PRESENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN ADDITION, IF YOU GIVE ME SOCKS FOR CHRISTMAS, I GET TO FILL THEM WITH D-CELL BATTERIES AND THEN HIT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I DECLARE PILOTS WILL NO LONGER START THEIR ANNOUNCEMENTS WITH "THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING." FROM NOW ON THEY WILL SAY, "ATTENTION PEASANTS, IT IS I, YOUR SKYLORD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE TERM "ALT-RIGHT" IS OFFICIALLY BANNED. ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) FROM NOW, WE WILL CALL THESE PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE: ANGRY VIRGINS WITH MACKLEMORE HAIRCUTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS DAY UNTIL THE END OF DAYS, HOWEVER I SPELL HANUKKAH IS THE RIGHT WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FROM NOW ON, WHENEVER I SEE A TUBA, I GET TO THROW BALLED-UP SOCKS INTO IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) WHERE ARE WE? WHERE ARE WE? WHERE AM I? OVER HERE. EVERY CAMERA I LOOK AT IS THE RIGHT ONE! ( APPLAUSE ) SINCE BOTH "CHRISTMAS" AND "HAPPY HOLIDAYS" OFFEND SOMEONE, HENCEFORTH, THE OFFICIAL SEASON GREETING IS "MAY YOUR WINTER FEAST BE AN ORGY OF DELIGHT." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, BOTH SIDES OF THE PILLOW SHALL BE THE COOL ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) GET ALL OF THE WORLD'S SCIENTISTS ON THIS. I DON'T CARE. GET IT DONE. IF YOU START A SENTENCE WITH, "I'M NOT RACIST, BUT," YOUR NEW NAME IS "RACIST BUTT." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAVING BOTH CHINOS AND KHAKIS IS TOO CONFUSING. BOTH SHALL NOW BE KNOWN SIMPLY AS DAD PANTS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE LINE IS ALWAYS TOO LONG TO MEET MALL SANTAS. FROM NOW ON, ANYONE OVER 55 SITTING IN THE FOOD COURT IS SANTA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IN ADDITION, ALL DEPARTMENT STORE SANTAS MUST HAVE REAL BEARDS AND FAKE DRINKING PROBLEMS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! MAY YOUR WINTER FEAST BE AN ORGY OF DELIGHT! WE'LL BE BACK WITH LIAM NEESON!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS A VERY PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS. YOU KNOW HIM FROM "TAKEN," "SCHINDLER'S LIST," AND "LOVE ACTUALLY." HE NOW STARS IN BOTH "A MONSTER CALLS" AND MARTIN SCORSESE'S "SILENCE."
WHAT WOULD DO FOR THEM, PRAY? AND GET WHAT IN RETURN? ONLY MORE SUFFERING. SUFFERING ONLY YOU CAN END, NOT GOD!
GET AWAY FROM ME!
I PRAY, TOO, RODRIGUES. IT DOESN'T HELP. GO ON. PRAY. BUT PRAY WITH YOUR EYES OPEN.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME LIAM NEESON! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
LOVELY TO BE HERE YOU.
Stephen:  REALLY NAILED THAT ROLE OF SANTA. I THINK YOU REALLY HAVE A SHOT AT IT. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET YOUR HOPES UP OR ANYTHING, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE. YOU HAVE A FALLBACK POSITION. IF THE WHOLE ACTING THING DOESN'T WORK OUT, YOU COULD DEFINITELY BE A MALL SANTA. AS IF LIAM NEESON NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION. YOU'VE BEEN IN "SCHLINDLER'S LIST," "STAR WARS EPISODE ONE" TWO BATMAN MOVIES, THREE "TAKEN" MOVIES. NOW "SILENCE" AND THE MOVIE "A MONSTER CALLS."
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN FOUND OUT YET. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FOUND OUT YET?
YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY. IF I SEE A FELLOW ACTOR AND THEY SAY, "HEY, HOW YOU DOING, LIAM?" I LIKE TO SAY, I HAVEN'T BEEN FOUND OUT YET?"
Stephen: ASK ME HOW YOU'RE DOING.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD. DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAY?
TRADITIONAL, WITH MY KIDS, A COUPLE OF GOOD FRIENDS COMING UP. I'LL BE IN CHARGE OF THE TURKEY, SOUTHERN FRIED THIS YEAR.
Stephen: SOUTHERN FRIED TURKEY?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO FRY IT YOURSELF?
YES.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU JUST SET YOURSELF ON FIRE, IT'S QUICKER.
YOU HAVE TO LOWER THAT BIRD IN VERY, VERY, VERY SLOWLY.
Stephen: YEAH, AND DO IT OUTSIDE, PLEASE.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
Stephen: YOU'VE DONE IT OUTSIDE? YOU'VE DONE IT ALREADY?
QUITE A FEW TIMES.
Stephen: HOW LONG-- IS IT FAST?
THREE TIMES. 15 OF-POUND BIRD, BY THE TIME YOU HEAT THE OIL, THAT TAKES ABOUT 45 MINUTES. 15-POUND BIRD, ONE HOUR. AND YOU'RE READY TO EAT.
Stephen: WOW, THAT'S NICE.
ONE HOUR.
Stephen: AND, LISTEN --
ALL THE JUICE IS KEPT INSIDE.
Stephen: IS THERE A TRADITIONAL-- IS THERE A TRADITIONAL IRISH CHRISTMAS THAT YOU CELEBRATE?
GOING TO MASS A FEW TIMES.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. A FEW TIMES?
THEN GOING TO MASS AGAIN.
Stephen: WERE YOU AN ALTAR BOY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
I WAS AN ALTAR BOY FOR A FEW YEARS.
Stephen: ME, TOO.
YOU WERE. I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE I STARTED SHOOTING UP, I STARTED GETTING VERY-- EXCUSE ME. I STARTED GETTING VERY TALL ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT SOUNDED LIKE THE PRIEST CAUGHT YOU DOING HEROIN FOR A SECOND. ANYTHING TO GET THROUGH THE SERVICE BECAUSE THOSE MIDNIGHT MASSES JUST GO ON FOREVER. YOU WERE TOO TALL TO BE AN ALTAR BOY. I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS A HEIGHT LIMIT?
YOU WOULD WALK OUT AND THERE WOULD BE A PRIEST AND ALL THESE LITTLE ALTAR BOYS AND THEN ME, YOU KNOW,.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, "TAKEN" IS A FAN FAVORITE. THERE HAVE BEEN THREE "TAKENS."
THREE ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IS THERE ANY CHANCE-- IS THERE ANY CHANCE THERE'S GOING TIEB FOURTH?
NO, THERE'S NOT.
Stephen: NO?
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY TIMES YOUR DAUGHTER CAN GET TAKEN. THE NEXT ONE, ACTUALLY, WE DO ANOTHER AND IT WILL BE,"PLEASE, WILL YOU TAKE MY DAUGHTER."
Stephen: YOU KNOW, THERE'S THE MONOLOGUE THAT EVERYBODY LOVES THAT YOU DO, "I HAVE A PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS." THAT'S MY LIAM NEESON, BY THE WAY. THAT'S LIAM NEESON AS PIRATE. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOUR FANS, LIKE, COME UP TO YOU AND DO THE SPEECH TO YOU? DO YOU HAVE UNUSUAL INTERACTIONS WITH THEM?
WHEN THE FIRST MOVIE CAME OUT, YEAH, IT HAPPENED A FEW TIMES. AND THERE WAS ONE I HAD IN A PUBLIC TOILET. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT COUNTRY IT WAS. I WAS STANDING THERE DOING MY BUSINESS, AND THIS OTHER MAN WAS THERE DOING HIS BUSINESS. AND, YOU KNOW, MEN-- WE DON'T LOOK AT EACH OTHER. YOU DO YOUR BUSINESS.
Stephen: STUDYING THE TILES.
STUDYING THE TILES. AND I HEARD THIS GUY QUOTING THE FROM "TAKEN," "I WILL FIND YOU." AND I GO HERE WE IF. AND I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TURNING TO LOOK AT HIM AND HE DID THIS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE A PARENT. WHAT ARE YOUR PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS AS A DAD?
OH, MY GOSH, STEVE GLEN YOUR BOYS ARE HOW OLD?
THEY'RE 21 AND 20. BUT LAST WEEK, THEY WERE LIKE FIVE AND SIX.
Stephen: AND ARE THEY SHOOTING UP?
IT'S CRAZY. YES. ( LAUGHTER ) AS THEY SAY BACK HOME, THEY'RE GROWING LIKE WEEDS.
Stephen: YEAH, SURE.
THERE ARE SO MANY BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT PARENTING. I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST THROW THEM AWAY AND TRUST THIS AND TRUST THAT. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN AROUND, YOU KNOW, ON THESE LEGS FOR 150,000 YEARS. WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT TO DO.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
CERTAINLY MOTHERS DO. SO TRUST THAT. TRUST YOUR INGLIRCHG DO YOU FOLLOW-- YOU CAN FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOUR KIDS ARE DOING THESE DAYS. YOU CAN TRACK THEIR PHONES. YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. DO YOU TRACK YOUR KIDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA?
I KIND VAGUELY KNOW WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS, AND I SAY THAT GENUINELY. I KIND OF --
TWITTER OR SNAPCHAT OR INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK.
I DON'T DO ANY OF THAT. I DON'T.
Stephen: YOU DON'T DO ANY OF THAT? IT'S VERY POPULAR. IT'S VERY POPULAR.
DITEXT MY ELDER BOY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO. I SAID, "GUESS WHERE I AM? I'M DOING STEPHEN COLBERT AGAIN." AND THEY SAID, "OH, GREAT, DAD. HE'S COOL. HE'S REALLY FUNNY."
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE, I REALLY LIKE ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER ONE YET. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER ONE YET. NOW YOU PLAY A PRIEST NOW, SPEAKING OF ALTAR BOYS. YOU PLAY A PRIEST NAMED FARTHER FERREIRA.
JESUIT PRIEST.
Stephen: JESUIT PRIEST.
1600s IN JAPAN.
Stephen: IN JAPAN. IS THIS WHEN JAPAN WAS CLOSED TO THE WEST?
JAPAN WAS VERY CLOSED. PORTUGAL USED TO-- THESE JESUIT PRIESTS ARE FROM PORTUGAL IN OUR FILM. THEY WOULD SEND OUT THEIR MISSIONARIES TO KIND OF APPEALS THE PEOPLE, TRY AND CONVERT THEM, WIN THEM OVER. AND THEN PORTUGAL WOULD SEND THE TRADESMEN, THE SOLDIER AND STUFF. AND GRADUALLY COLONIZED THE COUNTRY. SO JAPAN DID NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO THEMSELVES. THIS WAS IN THE 1600s, SO THEY BRUTALLY PUT DOWN CHRISTIANITY, AND TORTURED AND MURDERED PRIESTS AND JAPANESE CHRISTIANS. SO OUR FIRM DWEELZ THAT. THESE TWO YOUNG PRIESTS, ANDREW GARFIELD, AND ADAM DRIVER, WONDERFUL ACTORS WHO PLAY THE LEAD AND THEY GO TO JAPAN TO TRY TO FIND ME BECAUSE MY PRIEST WENT OUT THERE YEARS BEFORE. HE WAS A FAMOUS JESUIT. AND APOST SIZED, WHICH MEANS HE PUBLICLY GAVE UP THE RELIGION. SO THEY --
HE SAID HE WASN'T CHRISTIAN ANYMORE.
SAID HE WASN'T A CHRISTIAN ANYMORE, HAD TAKEN A WIFE, DRESSED IN A KIMONO. SO THEY DON'T WANT THIS AND WANT TO GO OUT AND FIND ME. AND IT'S A VERY, VERY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. SO THE FILM IS ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: WELL, THESE ARE ALL MEN AND PEOPLES SEEKING SALVATION. AND WE'RE IN A TIME OF YEAR RIGHT NOW WHERE WE'RE ALL REMINDED TO-- TO LOVE AND CARE FOR EACH OTHER. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU RECENTLY WENT TO JORDAN WITH UNICEF TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMPS. WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE LEAK FOR YOU?
I WENT WITH MY ELDEST BOY, MICHAEL. SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP ABOUT 10 MILES INSIDE THE JORDANIAN BORDER. EXCUSE ME. 80,000 REFUGEES, 40,000 OF THEM ARE KIDS. AND, YOU KNOW, AS TRAUMATIC AS IT WAS TO SEE THESE PEOPLE AND IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH, IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO MEET THESE YOUNG MUSLIM GIRLS, 14, 15, 16 YEARS OF AGE, WHOSE PARENTS, LOVED ONES WERE KILLED BY BARREL BOMBS, CHEMICAL WEAPONS. THEY HAD SUFFERREDLY INCREDIBLY TO GET TO JORDAN. AND THERE THEY WERE, SO FEISTY. I DON'T MEAN REBELS. THEY WERE JUST EMPOWERED WITH THE EDUCATION THAT UNICEF SCHOOLS WERE GIVING THEM. I-- WE HAD A WONDERFUL INTERPRETER, AND I NUDGED THIS LOVELY GIRL, AND I WAS TRYING TO JOKE WITH HER. AND SHE SAID, "THROUGH THE INTERPRETER. "I CAN TELL YOU MY STORY?" AND SHE GOT UP AND RAPPED FOR, LIKE, 10 MINUTES. Y DIDN'T NEED AN INTERPRETER TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW. SHAIPT TO BE ENGINEERS. THEY WANT TO BE TEACHERS. THEY WANT TO BE POLICE INSPECTORS, AND THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO SYRIA. SO IF SYRIA EVER GETS SETTLED AND GETS SORTED, THESE GIRLS ARE GOING TO BE A FORCE TO RECKON WITH.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THAT STORY. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR SOMETHING HOPEFUL ABOUT SUCH A DIRE SITUATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NEESON, IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
Stephen: "A MONSTER CALLS" AND "SILENCE" ARE IN THEATERS ON DECEMBER 23. LIAM NEESON, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SHEPARD SMITH. STICK AROUND ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

MERRY CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: MERRY CHRISTMAS. DONALD TRUMP HAS MADE IT SAFE FOR US TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN.
BIGLEY.
Stephen: I USED TO BE SO TERRIFIED TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS.
REALLY, YOU WOULDN'T BE AT OUR SHOP. YOU WEREN'T AROUND FOR THE WAR.
Stephen: THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. YOU GUYS WON THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU, FOX NEWS. YOU ARE ACTUALLY, AND I MEAN THIS SIN SERIOUS, ARE YOU MY SECOND FAVORITE BROADCASTER ON FOX NEWS. MARTHA McCALLUM, ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD, MARTHA McCALLUM IS MY FAVORITE. YOU HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST TEASERS ARE EVER ON YOUR SHOW, AND I THINK YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO PLAY HERE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE TEASER. WE GOT TO PLAY IT ON THE OLD SHOW ALL THE TIME BUT I NEVER GOT TO PLAY IT TO YOUR FACE. I NEVER GOT TO CELEBRATE THIS PARTICULAR TEASER WITH YOU. JIM, THIS IS MY FAVORITE CLIP, SHEP.
KITTY CAT MEOW, THOUSAND DOLLARS. SNOOKI'S PREGNANT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT'S GOT EVERYTHING.
IT WAS RAINING NEWS. YOU SEE, THERE WAS --
THAT'S A HARD-NEWS DAY.
IT WAS. IN OUR FAVORITE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, THERE WAS A NEW RULE, I BELIEVE, THAT SAID IF YOU YOU HAD THE CAR SEAT IN YOUR CAT.
Stephen: YOU HAD TO CLIP YOUR CAT IN?
IT'S NEW JERSEY. AND AFTER, LIKE, THREE WARNINGS, IT WAS A $1,000 FINE. AND WHILE THIS GREATNESS WAS HAPPENING IN NEW JERSEY, I GOT WORD FROM THE VOICE IN MY EAR THAT SNOOKI WAS PREGNANT.
Stephen: SO LITERALLY, WHILE YOU'RE TELLING US KITTY CAT MEOW 1,000. YOUR PRODUCER IS GOING, "DROP IT, SNOOKI IS PREGNANT."
CORRECT. "THERE IS BREAKING NEWS NOW.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME OF THE SOUND CATS MAKE, BY THE WAY. MEOW. WHAT IS IT LIKE OVER AT FOX NEWS NOW THAT ROGER AILES IS GONE? THE WHOLE CHANNEL JUST WAS BORN OUT OF HIS SKULL 20 YEARS AGO. IS IT RUDDERLESS? ARE YOU GUYS LIKE A CORK IN A TYPHOON? WHO'S CALLING THE SHOTS?
IT WAS RUPERT MURDOCH'S VISION, AND IT'S RUPERT MURDOCH WHO IS RUNG THE PLACE NOW AND IT'S FANTASTIC AND WANT GUYS WHO ARE RUNNING THE PLACE NOW, THE LADIES WHO ARE RUNNING THE PLACE NOW, I HAVE KNOWN THEM FOR 20 YEARS OR LONGER AND IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO MISS ROGER AILES ON SOME LEVEL, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
Stephen: ON WHAT LEVEL?
EVERYTHING IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.
Stephen: WE FOUND THAT OUT.
HE WAS A GREAT MENTOR TO ME AND HE WAS REALLY GOOD TO MY FAMILY BUT THERE WERE OTHER THINGS HAPPENING AND WE'RE GETTING PAST IT. I THINK OUR CHALLENGE NOW IS TO BE THE MOST OPEN AND SORT OF COMFORTABLE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY TO WORK. I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO BE LEADERS IN THAT-- IN THAT PAT OF LIFE.
Stephen: I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGE.
AND I WANT TO HELP LEAD THAT.
Stephen: YOU'VE BEEN THERE SINCE THE BEGINNING, RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN THERE SINCE--
A YEAR OBSERVER THE LIGHT CAME ON.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THE LIGHT CAME ON?
I WORKED FOR THE AFFILIATES AND TIDIED UP A BIT.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE INSTALLING THE LIGHTS. YOU SEEM LIKE A CAN-DO GUY WHO IS WILLING TO PITCH IN.
I CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATION S.
Stephen:  THE TRUMP INAUGURATION IS COMING UP. ARE YOU GOING TO BE THERE?
BIGLEY.
Stephen: ARE YOU A REASONABLE FELLA.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: PEOPLE WHO WATCH THE NETWORK GO, "WOW, SHEP, DOESN'T HUESPHOZ ANY SORT OF PARTICULAR PARTY AFFILIATION WHEN HE DOES THE NEWS, WHICH IS NICE TO HEAR. YOU ACTUALLY CALLED TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ALMOST FASCIST, OKAY.
SOMETHING HE SAID AT THAT MOMENT WAS ALMOST FASCIST.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S-- THAT'S-- ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS UNSHEP-LIKE HAIR SPLITTING, I WANT TO POINT OUT. SOMETHING HE SAID WAS ALMOST FASCIST, BUT HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE SAYS?
I WANT HIM TO BE THE GREATEST PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION.
Stephen: I DO, TOO.
AND I'M GOING TO BE FOR HIM AND WITH HIM BUT AS A JOURNALIST IT'S MY JOB TO HOLD TRUTH TO POWER AND LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS AND GIVE IT CONTEXT AND REPORT AND IT. AND LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.
IT'S ABOUT AMERICA.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. YOU ALSO SAID HE TRADES IN RACISM. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE GOT WHEN HE TRADED THE RACISM IN? WHAT-- OTHER THAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHAT DID HE WIN BY TRADING IN RACISM?
HE BROUGHT US ALL TO HIS TOWER TO WORSHIP AT HIS FEET.
Stephen: HE HAS CALLED YOU TO THE TOWER?
NO.
Stephen: IF YOU GOT CALLED TO THE TOWER-- BECAUSE A LOT OF JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THE TOWER-- IF YOU GOT THE CALL TO THE TOWER, WOULD YOU GO TO THE TOWER?
YES. WOULD I ASK QUESTIONS OF THE FUTURE LEADER OF THE SNAGS I WOULD. I WOULD ASK HIM IF A LOT --
CALL PEOPLE THERE TO WAG HIS FINGER AT THEM.
HE CAN DO THAT, BUT IF HE WAS GOING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POWER ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THEM THERE. AND WE'RE SORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THEM AND THAT'S PART OF OUR JOB.
Stephen: THE FOURTH ESTATE.
CORRECT. IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THINGS, MR. PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DO YOU FEEL THAT THE-- DO YOU FEEL THAT-- THAT-- A LOT OF PEOPLE IN POWER TRY TO MARGINALIZE THE PRESS AND DELEGITIMIZE THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA WHICH, OBVIOUSLY, HAS SOME PROBLEMS. BUT THE DELEGITIMIZING OF THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA SAY FORM ROUGHING UP THE EMPIRE EYE MEAN, ROUGHING UP THE UMPIRE SO THAT THERE'S NOBODY TO QUESTION THE PEOPLE IN POWER. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO START DISMISSING THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA.
THEY HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO DO THAT. EVERYONE LEADER SAYS DON'T BELIEVE THEM, WHEN YOU TELL THEM THINGS THAT ARE TRUE. YOU WANT A CERTAIN NARRATIVE OUT THERE AND IF THE TRUTH FLIES IN THE FACE OF THAT-- LIKE, TRUMP IS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT THE RUSSIANS DID NOT GET THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN OUR ELECTION WHILE ALL 17 OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SAY THAT THEY DID. UNLESS UNTIL THERE'S FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS MATTER, I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW YET.
Stephen: HE ALSO IS SAYING WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY SAY THIS BEFORE THE ELECTION?
WELL, THEY DID.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
THEY DID LONG BEFORE THE ELECTION. IT WAS DISCUSSED OPENLY IN THOSE SEGMENTS AND WE REPORTEDDED ON IT AS FAR BACK AS OCTOBER.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK FACT CHECKING MATTERS EXAMINE?
IT MATTERS TO US. I KNOW THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN IT MATTERS TO PEOPLE AGAIN. IT REALLY DOES MATTER TO THEM. THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN THEIR OWN RHETORIC. BOTH SIDES. THIS ISN'T ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. THEY BOTH ARE. AND AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A FACT DISSEMINATION AND WE'LL BE THERE FOR YOU WHEN THAT TIME COMES.
Stephen: I HOPE YOU WILL.
