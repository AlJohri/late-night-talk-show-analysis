AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT'S UP? THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN. LOVELY. LOVELY FOLKS. SIT DOWN! THANK YOU. LOVELY. LISTEN, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE VERY NICE. WELL, FOR DONALD TRUMP--
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO PACE TEMPERATURES. FOR DONALD TRUMP IT'S BEEN A ROUGH COUPLE OF... HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY. THE CHAOS COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE IS JUST COMING AT YOU SO FAST. IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF IT. WHAT HAPPENED TODAY. TWO WEEKS AGO, I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, I'VE GOT TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE TATTOO LASERED OFF. ( LAUGHTER ) NEVER MIND WHERE I'M GESTURING. NEVER-- NEVER MIND. BUT COME WITH ME NOW INTO THE PAST. TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST MONTH. THERE'S THIS PLACE CALLED RUSSIA, AND DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, THE PRESIDENT'S SON AND GUY EXPLAINING WHY HE DOES NOT TIP, DONALD TRUMP, JR., TOOK A SECRET MEETING WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF RUSSIANS WHO ALL SEEMED TO HAVE CONNECTIONS TO KREMLIN INTELLIGENCE. AND WHEN THIS CAME OUT-- KIND OF SHADY STUFF-- DON RUNNER RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS MEETING WITH AND THEY MOSTLY TALKED ABOUT ADOPTION. THOSE WERE LIES. INCLUDING THE LIE THAT HE SAID IT. BECAUSE LAST NIGHT WE FOUND OUT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DICTATED HIS SON'S MISLEADING STATEMENT.
Audience: OOOO!
Stephen: YEAH, HE DICTATED IT. IT'S OFFICIAL: DONALD TRUMP IS A DICTATOR. TECHNICALLY, TECHNICALLY, TECHNICALLY, TECHNICALLY CORRECT. PLUS, THAT IS SO WEAK. YOU CAN IMAGINE, DON JR. INTETS GOETZ IN TROUBLE, HE LITERALLY GOT HIS DADDY TO WRITE A NOTE FOR HIM. ( AS TRUMP ) "PLEASE EXCUSE DON JR. FROM PRISON. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S A GOOD 39-YEAR-OLD KID." ( LAUGHTER ) REPORTEDLY-- REPORTEDLY-- REPORTEDLY, WHEN THE RUSSIAN MEETING WAS REVEALED, THE PRESIDENT GATHERED HIS ADVISERS, WHO THOUGHT DON JR. SHOULD RELEASE A STATEMENT, ONE THAT THEY WANTED TO BE TRUTHFUL. YES. THEY WANTED IT TO BE TRUTHFUL. WHICH IS GREAT. SO THEY CAN JUST PLEAD, "WE'D PREFER TO BE INNOCENT." BUT THE PRESIDENT IGNORED HIS ADVISORS AND INSTEAD DICTATED A STATEMENT THAT WAS CLEARLY A COVER-UP TO HIDE THEIR EAGERNESS TO COLLUDE WITH THE RUSSIAN. NOW, THIS LOOKS BAD AND IS BAD. BUT ACCORDING TO HIS ADVISORS, TRUMP "BELIEVES HE IS INNOCENT AND, THEREFORE DNOT THINK HE IS AT ANY LEGAL RISK. AND EVERYONE KNOWS YOU CAN'T BE CONVICTED IF YOU'RE NOT GUILTY IN YOUR MIND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "YOUR HONOR, YOUR HONOR, PLEASE, IF IT PLEASE THE COURT, I ALREADY RAN THE WHOLE 'LAW & ORDER' EPISODE IN MY HEAD. AND I HAVE A TEARFUL BREAKDOWN ON THE STAND WHERE I CONFESS I'M INNOCENT. SAM WATERSON, BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE." AND AS BAD AS THIS LOOKS FOR TRUMP, IT LOOKS EVEN WORSE FOR TRUMP'S LAWYER AND NEIGHBOR YOU SWEAR HAD A WIFE A MONTH AGO, JAY SEKULOW. BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER DON JR. RELEASED HIS STATEMENT, JAY WENT ON TV TO MAKE ONE THING CLEARED:
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DRAFTING OF THE STATEMENT AND DID NOT ISSUE THE STATEMENT. IT CAME FROM DONALD TRUMP, JR.
THIS IS A 39-YEAR-OLD SON WHO'S RUNNING THE TRUMP CORPORATION AND THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, SO HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE LOOKED OVER THE SHOULDER BY HIS FATHER.
Stephen: YES, TRUMP WOULD NEVER STAND OVER HIS SON'S SHOULDER. HE'S STAND IN FRONT OF HIM, YELLING, "CLAM UP AND WRITE WHAT I SAY OR WE'RE ALL HEADED TO THE HOOSKOW!" ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ASKED ABOUT THIS REPORT-- ASKED ABOUT THIS REPORT AT TODAY'S TELEVISED PRESS BRIEFING. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER WHO CRIES IN THE ART SUPPLY CLOSET, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEFENDED THE PRESIDENT:
THE STATEMENT THAT DON JR. ISSUED IS TRUE. THERE IS NO INACCURACY IN THE STATEMENT.
Stephen: OKAY. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. "NOT INACCURATE" AND "TRUE" NOT THE SAME THING. IT'S POSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD VITAL INFORMATION. "HI, YOU KNOW THAT SMOKE YOU'RE SMELLING? I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT YOUR HOUSE IS ON..." HUCKA-SANDERS ADDED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD A WHOLESOME REASON FOR STICKING HIS FINGER IN THIS POOP PIE.
THE PRESIDENT WEIGHED IN, AS ANY FATHER WOULD, BASED ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION THAT HE HAD. HE WEIGHED IN LIKE ANY FATHER WOULD DO.
Stephen: YES, LIKE ONE ANY FATHER WOULD DO. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE FATHER-AND-SON THINGS-- PLAYING CATCH, GOING FISHING, PREVENTING YOUR SON FROM IMPLICATING YOU IN TREASON. FATHER AND SON. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THOSE SPECIAL MOMENTS. ( SINGING ) "OH, THE CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON. THERE WERE ALSO RUSSIANS IN THE CRADLE, TOO. THREE OR FOUR RUSSIANS, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. JUST TELL THEM I DID NOT COLLUDE, DAD, TELL THEM I DID NOT COLLUDE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT GETS ME CHOCKED UP. IT GETS ME CHOCKED UP, YOU KNOW. IT GETS ME CHOKED UP. "AND AS I HUNG UP THE PHONE IT OCCURRED TO ME HE'D REALLY GROWN UP JUST LIKE ME." ( APPLAUSE ) SNOW, STOP, STOP. , OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN THE OLD TRUMP WHITE HOUSE. THINGS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SINCE PRESIDENT APPOINTED NEW CHIEF OF STAFF AND DISAPPOINTED OAK TREE, GENERAL JOHN KELLY. RUMOR IS KELLY GOT THE JOB AFTER HE STOOD UP TO TRUMP, WHEN RAISED VOICES COULD BE HEARD THROUGH THE THICK DOOR TO THE OVAL OFFICE. IT WAS SEEN AS AN EARLY INDICATION THAT KELLY WAS NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP TO HIS COMMANDER IN CHIEF. NO SURPRISE. TRUMP RESPECTS PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUCK UP TO HIM, STARTING-- YESTERDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND KELLY WASTED NO TIME, HE DID NOT WASTE A MINUTE, DRAINING ALL THE FUN OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION BY IMMEDIATELY FIRING WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND MA
Audience: OOOH!
Stephen: AND MAN DEMONSTRATING HIS TRADEMARK DOUBLE-ASS PAT, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GOTTA LET HIM GO! WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU, MOOCH. GENERAL KELLY, IF WE'RE GOOD, CAN WE HAVE MOOCH BACK AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER? WE'LL FEED HIM AND WASH HIM AND TAKE CARE OF HIM AND EVERYTHING. HE CAN SLEEP AT THE FOOT OF MY BED. BUT THE MOOCH TOOK HIS DISMISSAL IN STRIDE BECAUSE AFTER BEING FIRED, SCARAMUCCI ATE AT TRUMP'S HOTEL. WOW! OUCH! I CAN'T BELIEVE THE MOOCH HAD TO EAT TRUMP'S CRAP TWICE IN ONE DAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND KELLY'S GOT HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM INSTILLING DISCIPLINE. AT THE WHITE HOUSE. YESTERDAY, TRUMP SON-IN-LAW AND MAN WONDERING HOW YOUR CHILD GOT INTO THAT SCHOOL, JARED KUSHNER, HELD AN INFORMAL MEETING WITH CONGRESSIONAL INTERNS, AND WHAT HE TOLD THE INTERNS IMMEDIATELY HAS BEENED, INCLUDING WHY HE THINKS THESE TRUMP RUSSIA ALLEGATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS, SAYING, "THEY THOUGHT WE COLLUDED BUT WE COULDN'T EVEN COLLUDE WITH OUR LOCAL OFFICES." ADDING, "I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. I SPENT THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN WITH MY HEAD STUCK IN A BUCKET." AND TO ADD INSULT TO IDIOCY, WE JUST LEARNED A "PRANKSTER TRICKED WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS INTO REPLYING TO HIS EMAILS." OH, YEAH, YEAH. HE TRICKED THEM. HE MUST USED SOME TRICKY SUBJECT LINE LIKE: "CONFIDENTIAL AND CRIMINAL: DIRT ON HILLARY. RUSSIA COLLUDE-A-PALOOZA!" CLOSE ENOUGH. WE'RE GUESSING. WE HAVE NO PROOF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE GETTING. THE FIRST OFFICIAL TO GET DUPED WAS HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER AND SENTIENT COATRACK, TOM BOSSERT. BOSSERT RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM WHO HE THOUGHT WAS JARED KUSHNER INVITING HIM TO A PARTY AND HE REPLIED: "THANKS, JARED. WITH A PROMISE LIKE THAT, I CAN'T REFUSE. ALSO, IF YOU EVER NEED IT, MY PERSONAL EMAIL IS," AND THEN HE GAVE IT TO THEM. "OH, WHAT'S THIS? AN EMAIL FROM definitely jared @notfakeemail.com? I BETTER GIVE HIM MY PERSONAL EMAIL ADDRESS, AND, SO HE KNOWS IT'S ME, I'LL SEND ALONG MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER, MY SOCIAL SECURITY, MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME, MY FIRST DOG, THE HOUSE I GREW UP IN, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO TRACE MY APARTMENT KEY. AND THIS IS EXTRA EMBARRASSING BECAUSE BOSSERT IS IN CHARGE OF CYBER SECURITY.
Audience: OOOH!
Stephen: OKAY, BUT HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN THIS WAS A SUSPICIOUS EMAIL? BY READING THE SUBJECT LINE, WHICH SAID, "SUSPECTED SPAM." COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING. MAYBE HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN E-VITE TO SEE SEAN SPICER'S HEAVY METAL BAND, "SUSPECTED SPAM." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE,-- HE'S DOING WELL. HE LOOKS GOOD. SEAN LOOKS GOOD.
Jon: LOOKING GOOD!
Stephen: HE LOOKS MORE RESTED WITH THE EYE SHADOW. OF COURSE, BOSSERT WASN'T ALONE. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI ALSO FELL FOR THE SCAM. IN FACT, THE ONLY PERSON WHO FINALLY CAUGHT ON WAS ERIC TRUMP. YES, ERIC WAS IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS WHEN SOMEONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO TALK TO HIM. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SENATOR AL FRANKEN IS HERE. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. GIVE IT UP FOR THAT BAND SITTING RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UPON FOLKS, I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU, JON, AND REMIND EVERYBODY OUT THERE, PLEASE JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE GREAT DAVE CHAPPELLE JOINING US TOMORROW NIGHT FOR TWO ACTS. TWO ACTS TOMORROW NIGHT. HE'S GOT A RESIDENCY-- HE'S DOING A RESIDENCY AT RADIO CITY-- TONIGHT IS HIS FIRST NIGHT AT RADIO CITY, RIGHT? HE'S DOING 16 DAYS IN AUGUST. GO GET TICKETS IF THERE ARE ANY LEFT. I DON'T KNOW. GO AND GET THEM ANYWAY IF THEY AREN'T THERE. I'M ALSO EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT'S GUEST. I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME BUT NEVER IN THIS ROLE. MY FIRST GUEST IS THE ONLY PERSON TO HAVE PLAYED A U.S. SENATOR ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" AND THEN BECOME ONE IN REAL LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLEASE WELCOME THE GENTLEMAN FROM MINNESOTA, SENATOR AL FRANKEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG MOVING MY HIPS LIKE YEAH ♪ GOT MY HANDS UP THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG ♪ AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE OKAY  ( CHEERS )
THANK YOU THANK YOU. NICE WELCOME.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: WE FIRST MET WHEN YOU WERE A COMEDIAN.
YES, YES. I USED TO DO KIND OF WHAT YOU DO A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: COMEDY, VARIETY.
YES. AND SATIRE.
Stephen: YOU DID THE ORIGINAL "INDECISIONS" AT COMEDY CENTRAL, '92 AND '96.
WOW, IT'S IN THE BOOK. IT'S IN MY BOOK.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS SO IMPORTANT AND NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, FOR MANY YEARS-- FOR MANY YEARS, I DID WORK AT IMPORTANT CENTRAL.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T WANT YOU FOR A MOMENT, NOW THAT I'M A SENATOR, I DON'T WANT YOU FOR A MOMENT TO THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO HERE EVERY NIGHT IS ANY LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT I DO, EVEN THOUGH IT IS LESS IMPORTANT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BUT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO THINK IT. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO THINK THAT. THAT'S VERY KIND. THAT'S SUPER GENEROUS OF YOU. THAT'S SO BIG OF YOU. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU-- WHAT YOU GUYS DO OVER-- DO OR DON'T DO OVER AT THE SENATE.
YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF "DON'T DOING."
Stephen: THERE'S A LOT OF "DON'T DO."
AND SOMETIMES --
Stephen: YES.
SOMETIMES THE DON'T DOING IS GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT-- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOST RECENT DIDN'T DO THAT DIDN'T GET DONE, WHICH WAS PASSING THE SKINNY REPEAL, WHICH WAS THE LAST-DITCH EFFORT OF THE SENATE REPUBLICANS TO JUST CREATE ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD GO INTO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WITH THE HOUSE TO HAMMER OUT A REPEAL FOR OBAMACARE.
EXACTLY RIGHT. THEY HAD THEY, YOU KNOW, HAD SEVEN-PLUS YEARS TO COME UP WITH A REPEAL-AND-REPLACE, AND EVERYTHING THEY CAME UP WITH WAS TERRIBLE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DID THEY ACTUALLY COME UP WITH ANYTHING OR WAS IT REALLY LIKE CRAMMING AT THE LAST MINUTE. LIKE, "OH, (BLEEP). WE TOLD THEM WE HAD SOMETHING. EVERYBODY START TYPING."
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU SAID? ANYWAY, I'M A SENATOR AND I CAN'T HEAR WORD LIKE THAT, LIKE WHAT YOU SAID.
Stephen: STAY AWAY FROM SCARAMUCCI. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, SO FLEETING. SO FLEETING THAT HE COMES, WHAT A GIFT. HE'S LEAK A FLOWER THAT OPENS AND THE FIRST RAY OF SUNSHINE JUST SHRIVELS ON THE VINE.
YEAH, IT WAS-- IT WAS SAD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO I'M SORRY. SO THERE WE ARE.
NO, NO, NO, EVERYTHING THEY CAME UP WITH, EVERY PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS TERRIBLE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE-- TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THEIR INSURANCE. AND INSURANCE WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE-- THIS, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY SENATOR McCAIN, SENATOR COLLINS, SENATOR MURKOWSKI WERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEROES IN-- BUT THE CREDIT REALLY GOES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP AT TOWN HALLS AND WHO MADE THEIR VOICES HEARD. I-- I'M COCHAIR OF THE RURAL-- ( APPLAUSE ) I'M COCHAIR OF THE RURAL HEALTH CAUCUS. AND I GO TO RURAL HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND NURSING HOMES, AND PEOPLE IN RURAL MINNESOTA HATEDT I HAD A WOMAN CRY AT A HOSPITAL IN PERN, MINNESOTA. THIS IS A ROUND TABLE, AND SHE SAID THAT HER MOM GETS HER HOME HEALTH CARE THAT ALLOWS HER TO STAY IN HER HOME FROM MEDICAID. SHE WOULD LOSE THAT, AND SHE AND HER HUSBAND BOTH WORK, AND SHE WAS CRYING. AND ABOUT WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WERE PROPOSING. SO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STOOD UP AND SO THEY DESERVE THIS VICTORY. AND WHAT I HOPE WE DO IS WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY TO SHORE UP THE EXCHANGES AND THE WEAKNESSES AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT --
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
I THINK IT WILL.
Stephen: BIPARTISAN-- WHAT'S THE BIGGEST BIPARTISAN THING THAT'S HAPPENED?
WELL, ME IN MY TIME IN THE SENATE HAVE DONE MANY BIPARTISAN THINGS.
Stephen: OKAY.
ON EDUCATION AND OTHER THINGS. AND I LIKE WORKING WITH MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, AND I HOPE THAT WE GET TO THE HEP COMMITTEE IT'S HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND PENSION COMMITTEE-- AND THEY WORK WITH US TOGETHER, AND THEIR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO I THINK WILL JUMP AT WORKING IN THE SHORT TERM GETTING THESE EXCHANGES. WE'VE ALSO GOT TO GET PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS DOWN. I HAVE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE BILL THAT CONTAINS THE IDEAS OF A LOT OF SENATORS TO BRING DOWN THE COSTS OF PHARMACEUTICALS, AND WE NEED TO DO THAT ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US-- WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE PICTURES AND SOME OF THE FOOTAGE, SO IT'S HARD TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING-- WERE YOU THERE WHEN McCAIN GAVE THE THUMBS DOWN?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT MOMENT LIKE? DID EVERYONE KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU HEARD AUDIBLE GASPS IN THE ROOM.
I SUSPECTED IT WOULD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE. PENCE HAD LEFT THE ROOM-- ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE AT THE SCENE OF THE MURDER.
THE LAST VOTE HE WAS THERE FOR THE ENTIRE VOTE. AND HE HAD LEFT THE ROOM. SO THAT TOLD ME THAT-- THAT HE WAS GOING TO VOTE NO. SO WHAT WAS INTERESTING THERE WAS THERE WAS APPLAUSE, AND PARTLY FROM THE GALLERY. I WAS LOOKING AT SENATOR McCAIN. AND I THINK PARTLY FROM STAFF. AND CHUCK SCHUMER JUST WENT... ( LAUGHTER ) AND EVERYONE STOPPED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T-- WE DIDN'T WANT TO GLOAT. AND WE SHOULDN'T GLOAT. THIS IS SERIOUS, SERIOUS STUFF.
Stephen: WELL, TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS STUFF-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU-- AS I SAID, WHEN I FIRST MET YOU, OH, I DON'T KNOW 15, 16 YEARS AGO, I WAS AT A ROAST, A CHEVY CHASE ROAST.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU WROTE--
YES.
Stephen: YOU WRITE IN YOUR BOOKS THE LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM. RUSH LIMBAUGH SAY BIG FAT IDIOT. STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU MADE A LOT OF FUNUE POKED A LOT OF FUN AT POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. NOW THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THEM--
RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE BEING UNFAIR?
NO.
Stephen: TO THEM.
NO.
Stephen: NO.
NO.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU WONDER SOMETIMES-- PLAWZ YOU YOU DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY AND YOU GO, "ARE THEY REAL AS VENAL AS THEY LOOK?"
I MAKE FUN-- IF YOU LOOK AT IT, GO BACK, I MAKE FUN OF THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVED IT. NEWT GINGRICH. I MADE FUN OF RUSH LIMBAUGH, BILL O'REILLY AT FOX, LYING LIARS --
Stephen: WHO IS THAT?
HE USED TO BE AT FOX NEWS.
Stephen: I HAVE NO MEMORY. ( LAUGHTER ).
EXWAW, HE AND FOX SUED ME. AND IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING.
Stephen:  OKAY.
BILL O'REILLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT SATIRE IS PROTECTED SPEECH IN THE UNITED STATES, EVEN IF THE OBJECT OF THE SATIRE DOESN'T GET IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: THANK GOD!
THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
Stephen: THANK GOD. GOOD TO KNOW. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK RIGHT HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE SENATOR AL FRANKEN, EVERYBODY. ♪ THEY'RE PLAYING MY SONG AS THE BUTTERFLIES FLY AWAY ♪ I'M NODDING ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FRIENDS, FRIENDS, WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR AL FRANKEN. JUNIOR SENATOR OR SENIOR SENATOR?
JUNIOR.
Stephen: AL HAS A NEW BOOK. IT IS CALLED "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IS THIS YOUR OFFICIAL PORTRAIT?
THAT IS, THAT IS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S AN OIL PAINTING. AND --
Stephen: OKAY.
IT HANGS... IN THE SENATE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: JUST IN THE SENATE. JUST IN THE SENATE.
IN MY OFFICE.
Stephen: IN YOUR OFFICE. OKAY, AS-- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE, BEFORE THE BREAK. THE BULK OF YOUR CAREER YOU HAVE BEEN A COMEDIAN, A SATIRIST. ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE SENATE FUN? ARE THEY FUNNY PEOPLE? BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE A BORING THUNDERDOME.
NO. ACTUALLY, A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE FUNNY, AND THAT'S HOW I BOND WITH THEM. FROM YOUR STATE, OKAY, I GET SWORN IN. I WAS SWORN IN A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE MY ELECTION WAS VERY CLOSE. IS AND JIM DEMINT, A VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, A COUPLE OF MINUTES AFTER I WAS SWORN IN SAYSES, "HOW ARE THINGS ON THE FAR LEFT?" AND I SAID, "NINE, HOW ARE THINGS FROM THE NUT CASE RIGHT?" LINDSEY GRAHAM IS VERY FUNNY. REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS RUNNING 15 OUT OF 17 IN THE REPUBLICAN --
Stephen: I THINK HE WAS 17 OUT OF 15. ( LAUGHTER )
SO I WENT UP TO HIM IN THE SENATE, AND I SAID TO HIM, "YOU KNOW, LINDSEY, IF I WERE VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, I'D VOTE FOR YOU." AND WITHOUT HESITATION HE SAID, "THAT'S MY PROBLEM." ( LAUGHTER ) LINDSAY IS VERY FUNNY. BUT WE-- ( APPLAUSE ) THERE ARE SOME SENATORS WHO AREN'T VERY FUNNY. AND TOM COBURN FROM OKLAHOMA, KNOWN AS "DR. NO" BECAUSE --
Stephen: HE IS A PHYSICIAN.
YES HE IS AN OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST, AND NO BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE ANY FEDERAL SPENDING, SO HE WOULD SAY NO TO EVERYTHING. HE WILL ADMIT THAT HE IS NOT A VERY GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR INTERACTIONS WE HAD, WE JUST KIND OF MISSED. SO I WENT TO TOM AND I SAID, "TOM, I CAN TAKE YOU TO LUNCH?" AND HE SAID, "TELL YOU WHAT. YOU CAN TAKE ME TO BREAKFAST." I SAID OKAY. SO WE MEET FOR BREAKFAST A COUPLE OF DAYSULARITY IN THE SENATE DINING ROOM, AND I SAID, "TOM, LET'S JUST HAVE FUN." AND HE SAID, "OKAY, FUN." ( LAUGHTER ) AND I SAID, "WE CAN TALK ABOUT OUR FAMILIES. TALK ABOUT POLITICS. TALK ABOUT THE CAREERS WE HAD BEFORE THE SENATE. BUT LET'S HAVE FUN." HE GOES, "OKAY." I SAID, "OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. TO BE A DOCTOR IN OKLAHOMA, DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANY FORMAL EDUCATION?" ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE-- AND HE SAID, "YES! YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND I SAID-- I SAID, "OKAY, TOM, THAT WAS A JOKE." ( LAUGHTER ) "AND THAT'S WHAT I USED TO DO IN MY CAREER." AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE BREAKFAST WE HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME. I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT JEEK JOKES WERE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUWHAT THE PROPER REACTION TO A JOKE IS. AND I GOT A NOTE LATER FROM HIM THAT DAY SAYING, "I HAD A LOT OF FUN."
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
AND WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK-- "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." WHEN I WAS WRITING THAT, I WANTED TO GET PERMISSION FROM MY COLLEAGUES WHO I WROTE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE. I CALLED HIM UP, HE'S IN RETIREMENT. HE'S IN OKLAHOMA. I SAID, "TOM--" "HI, AL." I SAID, "DO YOU REMEMBER THAT BREAKFAST WE HAD?" AND HE SAID, "YEAH, YEAH." AND I SAID, "I WANT TO USE THAT IN THE BOOK AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR PERMISSION." AND HE SAID, "WE HAVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. YOU CAN WRITE ANYTHING YOU WANT!" ( APPLAUSE ) SO HE HASN'T-- HE HASN'T CHANGED.
Stephen: NO. YOU COULD HAVE SAID, "WE ALSO HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT GUNS."
HE WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE RIGHT FOR AMERICANS TO BEAR ARMS. HE IS.
Stephen: NOW, YOU SAID, YOU WROTE IN THE BOOK "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." YOU SAY IN THE BOOK YOU'VE LEARNED WEIRD, SOCIOPATHIC POLITICAL SKILLS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT IS THE WEIRDEST POLITICAL SKILL YOU'VE HAD TO LEARN?
PIVOTING.
Stephen: PIVOTING.
PIVOTING. PIVOTING IS NOT ANSWERING A QUESTION. AND JUST PIVOTING.
Stephen: PIVOTING IS A WAY OF PIVOTING OFF, "I'M NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION."
OR I'D BE ASKED, "YOU'RE 10 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS TO NORM COLEMAN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONVINCE DEMOCRATS TO NOMINATE?" AND I'D GO LIKE, "YOU KNOW, WHEN I GO AROUND MINNESOTA, MINNESOTANS DON'T CARE ABOUT POLLING. WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS HEALTH CARE AND THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION." THAT'S PIVOTING.
Stephen: AND YOU WERE NOT GOOD AT THAT?
I WAS NOT GOOD AT THAT. I WAS TAUGHT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, AND IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO LEARN HOW TO PIVOT.
Stephen: CAN YOU DO IT NOW?
I'M OKAY AT IT.
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS AND YOU PIVOT OFF OF THEM.
OKAY, OKAY.
Stephen: TELL YOU WHAT. NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S "AL FRANKEN GIANT OF THE SENATE," NO MATTER WHAT I ASK YOU STAY ON MESSAGE AND PROMOTE YOUR BOOK. IF NORTH KOREA CONTINUES TO ADVANCE ITS MISSILE PROGRAM, SENATOR FRANKEN, SHOULD WE TAKE MILITARY ACTION?
YOU KNOW, IN MY BOOK, STEPHEN, I WRITE A LOT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVEL-HEADED LEADERSHIP. WHICH IS WHY I'M TERRIFIED OF TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SENATOR FRANKEN, DO YOU PLAN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, IN MY BOOK, STEPHEN, "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE," ( LAUGHTER ) I TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVEL-HEADED LEADERSHIP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU WIN. YOU WIN.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE," IS AVAILABLE NOW. AL FRANKEN, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A COMEDIAN WHO PROFESSIONALLY RUINS THINGS ON "ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING." PLEASE WELCOME ADAM CONOVER! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) COME ON UP HERE! ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME BACK.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALWAYS SO FRESH FACED AND NATILY DRESSED.
I DO MY BEST. IT'S ALL TV MAGIC. THERE'S A WHOLE TEAM. I GOTTA BE HONEST. THAT'S WHAT I DOUGH.
Stephen: YOU CALL YOURSELF AN "INVESTIGATIVE COMEDIAN" WHO RUINS THINGS BY REVEALING FACTS BEHIND COMMON BELIEFS. WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN OCTOBER BEFORE THE ELECTION, YOU TRIED TO YOUI RUEIN THE ELECTION BY SA IT'S NOT THE CRAZIEST ELECTION THAT AMERICA HAS EVER HAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO-- AMEND THAT STATEMENT IN ANY WAY?
THE ONE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT THAT TRUMP BROKE WAS THAT HE WON.
Stephen: A CANDIDATE LIKE HIM NORMALLY DOESN'T WIN.
GEORGE WALLACE, WHO HE HAS SIMILARITIES TO. GEORGE WALLACE DIDN'T WIN. TRUMP DID IN. NOW WE'RE IN-- I COULDN'T DO ANOTHER SHOW ABOUT HOW THERE ARE HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS FOR TRUMP BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY HISTORICALLY UNPRECEDENTED.
Stephen: HE HAS RUINED RUINING EVERYBODY. AN INVESTIGATIVE COMEDIAN, HOW DOES ONE BECOME THAT? HOW DID YOU BECOME THAT PERSON?
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN INFORMATION SPONGE IN MY LIFE. I DON'T LISTEN TO MUSIC IN MY CAR. I LISTEN TO PODCASTS. I'M JUST THAT TYPE OF-- I'M ALWAYS COLLECTING FACTS. I ALWAYS DID INTERRUPT PEOPLE IN PARTIES WHEN SAY, OTHER, OH, YOU'RE TAKING ANTIBIOTICS." I DID THAT IN MY LIFE AND IT WAS VERY ANNOYING.
Stephen: WOW, WOW, FUN GUEST, AT A PARTY.
WELL, YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE HOW I TRANSFORMED IT INTO A COMEDY CHARACTER FOR MY EGO.
Stephen: DID YOU TOUR AROUND THE COUNTRY?
NO, HONESTLY, I WENT-- I WAS DOING-- I QUIT DOING OPEN MICS, STAND-UP COMEDY OPEN MICS-- IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO OPEN MICS, THEY'RE TERRIBLE. I WAS A STRUGGLING COMIC AND I STARTED PUTTING FACTS IN MY ACT TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION.
Stephen: YOU WENT FROM STRUGGLING TO GAIN FLEE EMPLOYED THAT FAST.
I LOVE HOW YOU DESCRIBE A SHOW ON truTV, THAT'S GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT, YEAH!
Stephen: A LOT OF COMEDIANS HATE YOU NOW JUST HEARING YOU SAY, THAT BECAUSE THE STRUGGLE, THE STRUGGLE FOR YEARS, DID YOU NOT PAY YOUR DUES?
OF COURSE, I DID, OF COURSE, I DID. AS A COMEDIAN YOU DO SO MANY BAD SHOWS. DIA SHOW-- A SHOW I DID A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE THE TV SHOW WAS PICKED UP AT AN E.D.M. FESTIVAL. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS --
Stephen: WHOOP!
I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO GET AN IDEA OF WHY DIDT DIDN'T GO WELL.
Stephen: YOU DID STAND-UP WHILE THAT MUSIC WAS PLAYING?
YEAH, WAY OFF-- WAY OFF IN A DISTANCE. IT'S AN ACRONYM FOR EVERYBODY IS DOING MOLLY. AND THE COMEDY TENT WAS IN THE AREA WHERE AFTER PEOPLE HAD DONE SO MUCH DRUGS, THAT THEIR HEART STOPPED, AND THEN THE MUSIC BROUGHT THEM BACK TO LIFE BECAUSE IT'S C.P.R. ON THEIR BODIES. OH! LIKE THAT. THEN THEY WOULD GO TO, LIKE, THE CHILL-OUT AREA WHERE THE COMEDY SHOW WAS.
Stephen: SO THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE, LIKE, DEI HAD DEHYDRATED AND EXHAUSTED AND YOU WOULD DO COMEDY FOR THEM?
YES, THEY WEREN'T YOU KNOW IN LAUGHING MOOD. THEY WERE A GOOD CROWD BUT --
Stephen: THEY WERE ON MOLE, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: SO YOU WOULD TELL A JOKE AND THEY WOULD SAY, "I LOVE YOU."
YES, YES. "I'D LOVE TO TOUCH YOUR SHIRT."
Stephen: OKAY "ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING."
OKAY.
HERE WE ARE "ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING," RUIN SOMETHING FOR ME. SOMETHING THAT I THINK I KNOW ABOUT.
SOMETHING WE'RE DOING COMING UP IS-- YOU'RE A PATRIOTIC GUY, RIGHT?
Stephen, OF COURSE,.
DO YOU LIKE, SAY, MOUNT RUSHMORE.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN BUT IT'S AN AMERICAN ICON.
DON'T GO. IT'S AMERICA'S-- I'D SAY WEIRDEST NATIONAL MONUMENT. IT'S A STRANGE MONIEWRNLGT ISN'T, THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD CARVE FACES INTO THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN. IT'S AN ODD IDEA.
Stephen: IT'S TO HIDE THE GOLD INSIDE THAT'S REVEALED IN "NATIONAL TREASURE 2," RIGHT. THEY DID THAT TO THROW OFF THE TREASURE HUNT.
NOT QUITE, NOT QUITE.
Stephen: SO RUIN IT FOR ME.
SOME FACTS ABOUT IT. MOUNT RUSHMORE IS ACTUALLY UNFINISHED.
Stephen: WHAT JOOTD RUB AT THE BOTTOM-- YOU SEE THE PICTURES AT THE HEAD AND THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM, THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO DO THE WHOLE BODES. THE PRODUCT RAN OUT OF MONEY AND THE WORKERS WALKED OFF THE JOB, AND THE GFTS WAS LIKE, "THAT'S PLENTY. WE'RE DONE." AND THE REASON WAS THE SCULPTOR HAD DIED. AND HE WAS SOME MANIAC WHO HAD THIS CRAZY PLAN WHERE HE LITERALLY WANTED TO KEEP THE CONSTITUTION AND DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE INSIDE THE HEADS --
Stephen: WITH ALL THE GOLD! ( LAUGHTER ).
HE WANTED TO KEEP THEM INSIDE A MOUNT IN SOUTH DAKOTA. AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS LIKE, "NO, JUST BUILD THE STAT USE, DUMMIES." NOW THE PRESIDENT IS ON THE MONUMENT. WASHINGTON, THE FIRST PRESIDENT, TEDDY ROOSEVELT. WHY IS TEDDY ROOSEVELT ON THERE SOME.
Stephen: BECAUSE HE'S GOES?
HE WAS FRIENDS WITH THE SCULPTOR. THAT'S WHY-- LITERALLY WHY. A FINE PRESIDENT, BUT THAT'S WHY. NOT ANDREW JACKSON, YOU WHO MIGHT SAY WOULD BE PERHAPS MORE FAMOUS AT THE TIME. IT WAS TED ROOSEVELT BECAUSE GOODSON WAS LIKE, "I WANT TO SUCK UP TO MY BUDDY."
Stephen: DID PEOPLE, WHEN IT WAS FIRST COMPLETED, WE'RE SAYING THIS IS DONE, DID PEOPLE LIKE IT? IT'S INSTANTLY A HIT OR "WHAT IS ROOSEVELT DOING UP THERE?"
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT. I THINK THEY PROBABLY HAD TO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS THERE.
