PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CHIEF POLITICAL STRATEGIST, STEVE BANNON, COULD BE OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITHIN DAYS. SOURCES TELL CBS NEWS BANNON IS LOSING FAVOR AS CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY REORGANIZES THE WEST WING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES DANIEL CRAIG. TIFFANY HADDISH. AND MUSICAL GUEST BLACKBERRY SMOKE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HOW'S IT GOING? YEAH! HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY! HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE GOT A BIG SHOW-- WE'VE GOT A BIG SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. BIG DAY HERE IN THE BIG APPLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS COME BACK TO NEW YORK, AND NEW YORKERS WERE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE HIM.
NEW YORK HATES YOU! ( CLAPPING ) NEW YORK HATES YOU!
Stephen: NOW, TO BE FAIR, THAT IS A STANDARD NEW YORK GREETING. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, IT TOOK DONALD TRUMP TWO DAYS TO CONDEMN THE WHITE NATIONALISTS AND THE NEO-NAZIS WHO HELD THAT REALLY DOWN IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. THAT'S WHY.
Audience: ABOUT OOO. >I KNOW THE FEELING. THAT'S WHY I SENT HIM THIS CARD: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FRESH IRVEG. THAT'S FRESH INK. BUT EVEN THOUGH MANY CRITICIZED HOW LONG IT TOOK, THE PRESIDENT KNEW THE RIGHT THING WAS TO MAKE THE STATEMENT MONDAY, BE CLEAR ABOUT WHO WAS TO BLAME, AND THEN MOVE ON TO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. I'M JUST KIDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) HE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY IN, I BELIEVE, THE SEVENTH CIRCLE OF HELL. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. WHEN ASKED WHY HE WAITED TWO DAYS TO CONDEMN NEO-NAZIS AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.
WHEN I MAKE A STATEMENT I LIKE TO BE CORRECT. BEFORE I MAKE A STATEMENT, I NEED TO KNOW THE FACTS. BEFORE I MAKE A STATEMENT, I NEED THE FACTS.
Stephen: "OKAY, I NEED THE FACTS, OKAY. JUST ASK THE MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL VOTERS WHO REFUSED TO LOOK FOR OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE, DURING MY RECORD-BREAKING INAUGURATION. OKAY? IT'S ALL ON THE OBAMA WIRETAPS. IT'S ALL THERE, THAT'S WHAT I'M-- CHOOS OF THAT'S WHAT I'M... AND HE WAS STILL VERY ANGRY ABOUT HOW THE PRESS COVERED HIS INITIAL STATEMENT ON SATURDAY.
IF THE PRESS WERE NOT FAKE, AND IF IT WAS HONEST, THE PRESS WOULD'VE SAID WHAT I SAID WAS VERY NICE.
Stephen: AND IF YOU WERE A BETTER PRESIDENT, YOU WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING VERY NICE. BUT YOU'RE NOT. HYPOTHETICALS ARE FUN! WHO KNOWS? YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ) IF WISHES AND BUTTS WERE CLUSTERS OF NUTS, WE'D ALL HAVE A BOWL OF GRANOLA. ( APPLAUSE ) AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS EMBATTLED STRATEGIST STEVE BANNON, HE GAVE HIM HIS VOTE OF... SOMETHING.
I LIKE HIM. HE'S A GOOD MAN. HE IS NOT A RACIST, I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
Stephen: IF THE THIRD THING -- IF THE THIRD THING SOMEONE SAYS ABOUT YOU, UNPROMPTED, IS "HE IS NOT A RACIST," YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM. "OH, YOU'D LOVE JEFF. HE'S NICE, HE'S GOOD LOOKING. NOT A NECROPHILIAC, I CAN TELL YOU THAT." BUT-- JUST TACK A COLD BATH. LIE STILL. BUT IT KEPT COMING BACK TO CHARLOTTESVILLE. AND ONCE AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP WASN'T FULLY SURE WHETHER THE NAZIS SHOULD GET ALL THE BLAME.
YOU HAD A GROUP ON ONE SIDE, AND YOU HAD A GROUP ON THE OTHER. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE. I THINK THERE'S BLAME ON BOTH SIDES. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT IT, EITHER.
Stephen: THE ONLY THING I'M DOUBTING RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO STILL BE PRESIDENT BY FRIDAY, BECAUSE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT! YOU KNOW, "ONE SIDE HATES MINORITIES. THE OTHER SIDE HATES PEOPLE WHO HATE MINORITIES. OKAY, TWO SIDES. ALL RIGHT. IT'S JUST LIKE D-DAY. ALLIES AND THE NAZIS. BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF VIOLENCE ON BOTH SIDES. RUINED A BEAUTIFUL BEACH." COULD HAVE BEEN A GOLF COURSE. COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SANDTRAB. AND WHEN REPORTERS ASKED ABOUT THE WHITE SUPREMACIST ALT-RIGHT, TRUMP QUICKLY TURNED THE TABLES.
WHAT ABOUT THE ALT-LEFT THAT CAME CHARGING AT, AS YOU SAY, AT THE ALT-RIGHT? DO THEY HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE OF GUILT?
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, SIR, THE OPPOSITE OF ALT-RIGHT ISN'T THE ALT-LEFT. IT'S THE "NOT NAZIS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT HE WAS QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT NOT EVERYBODY IN THAT CROWD WERE NEO-NAZIS.
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE-- EXCUSE ME. I'VE CONDEMNED NEO-NAZIS. I'VE CONDEMNED MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS. BUT NOT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE NEO-NAZIS, BELIEVE ME. NOT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE WHITE SUPREMACISTS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. SOME OF THEM WERE ANTI-SEMITES. IT WAS VERY DIVERSE. ( APPLAUSE ) AND TRUMP CHALLENGED THE MEDIA TO BE FAIR.
TAKE A LOOK. THE NIGHT BEFORE, THEY WERE THERE TO PROTEST THE TAKING DOWN OF THE STATUTE OF ROBERT E. LEE. NOT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE WHITE SUPREMACISTS, BY ANY STRETCH.
Stephen: OKAY. THE NIGHT BEFORE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NIGHT BEFORE. YEP, JUST YOUR AVERAGE, FRIENDLY, CIVIC-MINDED, TORCH- WIELDING MOB. PROBABLY HOLDING THE TORCHES SO EVERYONE COULD SEE THEM POINT TO ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE THERE. "THERE'S ONE! THERE'S ONE OVER THERE. THERE'S A GOOD GUY. LOOK AT THAT GUY RIGHT THERE, HE'S A GOOD ONE! HEY!" ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP ALSO POINTED OUT THAT NOT HONORING THE CONFEDERACY IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
THIS WEEK, IT'S ROBERT E. LEE. I NOTICED THAT STONEWALL JACKSON IS COMING DOWN. I WONDER, IS IT GEORGE WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK, AND IS IT THOMAS JEFFERSON THE WEEK AFTER? YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHERE DOES IT STOP?
Stephen: OKAY. "SELF, WHERE DOES IT STOP?" I'M GOING TO SAY IT STOPS AT THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON AND THOMAS JEFFERSON FOUNDED. BUT I'M JUST SPITBALLING. I'M JUST-- THAT'S JUST ME.
Jon: I THINK YOU GOT IT.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. LET'S BE FAIR, JON. YOU HAVE TO BE FAIR, JON.
Jon: NO, THAT'S PRETTY FAIR.
Stephen: THEN TRUMP CONTINUED TO ATTACK-- AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS-- GEORGE WASHINGTON.
GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS A SLAVE OWNER. WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON A SLAVE OWNER?
YES, HE WAS.
SO WILL GEORGE WASHINGTON NOW LOSE HIS STATUS? ARE WE GOING TO TAKE DOWN-- EXCUSE ME. ARE WE GOING TO TAKE DOWN-- ARE WE GOING TO TAKE DOWN STATUTES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON?
Stephen: SPOKEN LIKE A GUY WHO'S SUSPICIOUSLY WORRIED THAT RACIST PRESIDENTS DON'T GET STATUES ANYMORE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "ARE WE GONNA-- WHAT DO I? DO I GET ONE? BECAUSE I LOOK--" AND GEORGE WASHINGTON WASN'T THE ONLY FOUNDING FATHER TRUMP COULD NAME.
HOW ABOUT THOMAS JEFFERSON? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOMAS JEFFERSON? DO YOU LIKE HIM?
I DO LOVE HIM.
OKAY, GOOD. ARE WE GOING TO TAKE DOWN THE STATUE? BECAUSE HE WAS A MAJOR SLAVE OWNER.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, MAJOR SLAVE OVER. EASILY IN THE TOP-FIVE SLAVE OWNERS. IT GOES JEFFERSON, WASHINGTON, MADISON, JABBA THE HUTT, AND IVANKA'S CLOTHING LINE. THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM. ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK-- I'M NOT-- I THINK SO. I THINK SO. IF I'M WRONG, I'M JOKING, OBVIOUSLY. AND HE HAD MORE TO SAY ABOUT JEFFERSON.
HE WAS A MAJOR SLAVE OWNER. NOW, ARE WE GOING TO TAKE DOWN HIS STATUTE? SO, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S FINE. YOU'RE CHANGING HISTORY. YOU'RE CHANGING CULTURE.
Stephen: YEAH, TAKING DOWN A STATUE IS TOTALLY CHANGING HISTORY. BECAUSE THE MAIN WAY ANYBODY LEARNS ABOUT HISTORY IS THROUGH STATUE-BASED STUDY. THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS 20 FEET TALL AND LOVED SITTING DOWN. THAT'S REALLY ALL HE DID. THAT'S ALL HE WAS KNOWN FOR.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S MY LINCOLN. THAT'S MY LINCOLN. AND TRUMP-- OH, LORD HELP OUR COUNTRY. TRUMP HAD THIS DEFENSE OF THE WHITE NATIONALISTS PROTESTING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW, THEY HAD A PERMIT. THE OTHER GROUP DIDN'T HAVE A PERMIT.
Stephen: COME ON, FOLKS. YOU GOTTA GIVE IT TO THE NAUGHTIES -- THEY ALWAYS DO THEIR PAPERWORK. VERY PUNCTUAL. ALSO VERY PUNCTUAL. BUT TRUMP ALSO REMINDED US ABOUT THE TRUE SOURCE OF RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY: BARACK OBAMA.
RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA, DO YOU THINK THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE OR BETTER SINCE YOU'VE COME INTO OFFICE?
LOOK, THEY'VE BEEN FRAYED FOR A LONG TIME, AND YOU CAN ASK PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: "YEAH IT WAS A MISS. BACK THEN I REMEMBER THERE WAS ONE SUPER-RACIST GUY WHO KEPT QUESTIONING WHETHER OBAMA WAS EVEN BORN HERE. IT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME.  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT IT'S JUST WRONG-- IT'S--" BUT TRUMP PROVED THAT HE HAD A PERSONAL INVESTMENT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE-- LITERALLY.
I OWN ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LARGEST WINERIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.
Stephen: IT IS NOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST WINERIES IN THE UNITED STATES, THOUGH HE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST WHINERS IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S POSSIBLE. HE IS IN THE-- ( APPLAUSE ) NOW REMEMBER LAST WEEK-- WAS IT JUST LAST WEEK. LAST WEEK WE ALL THAT GENERAL KELLY WAS GOING TO BRING SOME ORDER TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? DOESN'T THAT FEEL QUAINT NOW? "YEAH, SURE, THERE'S A BULL IN THE CHINA SHOP, BUT IT'LL BE FINE. WE JUST HIRED A NEW CHINA SHOP MANAGER." AND GENERAL KELLY WAS THERE TO WITNESS THE WHOLE THING, SEEN HERE, OVERWHELMED WITH PRIDE. THIS GUY IS A FOUR-STAR GENERAL. IRAQ, NO PROBLEM. AFGHANISTAN, WE CAN DO IT. 20-MINUTE TRUMP PRESS CONFERENCE? A QUAGMIRE FROM WHICH OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER EMERGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT DO WE DO? WHAT DO WE-- I DON'T... AND HERE'S THE THING-- DID NOT GET GREAT REVIEWS. IT DID NOT GET GREAT REVIEWS. DAVID DUKE LIKED IT. PRETTY MUCH NOBODY ELSE LIKED THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. AND HIS STAR WAS VERY QUICK TO THROW THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE BUS. THEY WERE IN DAMAGE CONTROL IMMEDIATELY WITH ONE AIDE TELLING REPORTERS, "THAT WAS ALL HIM. THIS WASN'T OUR PLAN." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, OURS EITHER. BUT THEY'RE RIGHT. IT WASN'T THEIR PLAN. AND WE KNOW THIS FOR A FACT-- AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE-- BECAUSE THEIR PLAN WAS A BRIEF, WRITTEN STATEMENT, AND WE GOT AN ACTUAL GLIMPSE OF IT WHEN TRUMP PULLED IT OUT OF HIS POCKET. AND IT SAYS-- CAN WE ZOOM IN-- IT SAYS... NOW, TRUMP NEVER READ THIS STATEMENT. BUT "THE LATE SHOW'S"" COMPUTER FORENSIC LAB HAS ENHANCED-- HAS ENHANCED THE IMAGE, HAS MANAGED TO RECONSTRUCT THE OTHER HALF OF THE PAGE. IT RESIDENT: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S ACTUALLY-- THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. IT'S WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY.
Jon: WE FIGURED THAT OUT.
Stephen: HE SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK WITH THE PLAN. THAT'S ACTUALLY MUCH MORE COHERENT THAN WHAT HE ACTUALLY SAID. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. DANIEL CRAIG IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'VE GOT AN ANSWER FOR WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE CONFEDERATE STATUES. PLEASE JOIN US. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT A CRAZY WORLD WE LIVE IN, JON.
Jon: WOW.
Stephen: YEAH. NOW, AS TRUMP POINTED OUT, CHARLOTTESVILLE HAS ONLY ACCELERATED THE CALL TO REMOVE THESE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS ACROSS THE SOUTH. YESTERDAY, A CROWD IN DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA, TOOK MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. WHOA! THAT THING BUCKLED QUICK. MUST HAVE BEEN A MONUMENT TO GENERAL  FESTUS "CRUMBLY-LEGS" JOHNSTON. AND, YESTERDAY, IN GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA, WORKERS PEACEFULLY REMOVED A STATUE OF A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER FROM A COUNTY BUILDING, GIVING IT TO THE GROUP "UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY." I HOPE THEY ENJOY IT WHILE THEY CAN. THOSE GIRLS HAVE GOT TO BE GETTING UP IN YEARS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVEN MORE OF THESE MONUMENTS WILL BE TAKEN DOWN WITH CITIES SUCH AS BALTIMORE AND LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY, ANNOUNCING THEIR DECISION TO REMOVE CONFEDERATE STATUES. NO WORD YET ON WHERE THE STATUES WILL END UP, BUT I'M GUESSING STEVE BANNON'S SUMMER HOME. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW-- NICE LITTLE GARDEN, PEACEFUL.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, I UNDERSTAND COMMUNITIES VOTING TO GET RID OF PAINFUL REMINDERS OF THE CONFEDERACY. BUT IT TURNS OUT REMOVING THEM MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY WAY. TO ACHIEVE THAT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WORD FROM OUR NEW SPONSOR.
IS YOUR TOWN FULL OF OUTDATED CONFEDERATE STATUES?
ARE YOU CONSIDERING TEARING THEM DOWN OR PETITIONING TO HAVE THEM REMOVED IN A LEGAL-TYPE FASHION?
THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY! CALL US. KOPESSKITWINS CONFEDERATE CONUMENT LOCATION SERVICE. YOU GOT YOURSELF A CONFEDERATE CERTAINLY RIDING A HORSE? LOSE THE GUY, KEEP THE HORSE.
THE HORSE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT SLAVERY WHAT ABOUT YOU GOT SOME SORT OF OLD-GUY GENERAL?
NO PROBLEM. BIGGER MUSTACHE.
GIVE HIM A HAT. BOOM, CAN'N CRUNCH.
AND WHY HAVED WITHLY ON A PODIUM WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A WATER SLIDE?
YOU JUST WENT FROM ROBERT ECHED LOS ANGELES LEE TO ROBERT E. WEEEE.
CALL TODAY.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WITH DANIEL CRAIG. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"" ALREADY IN PROGRESS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT FROM "MUNICH," "DEFIANCE," AND "THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO." OH, AND THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S ALSO JAMES BOND. PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL CRAIG! HELLO, DANIEL CRAIG. HELLO, SIR. GOOD TO SEE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IS THAT YOURS?
Stephen: THAT'S YOURS RIGHT THERE. PLEASE, HAVE A DRINK, MR. CRAIG. NOW, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. WE HAD YOU ON HERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. WE
WE DID, WAS IT YOUR 37th SHOW?
Stephen: WOW. ARE YOU A SAVANITY ON COUNTING TELEVISION PROGRAMS?
ONE OF MY SKILLS.
Stephen: CAN WE CHECK, THAT PLEASE? I WANT TO FACT CHECK THIS GUY. I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF FAKE NEWS HERE ON "THE LATE SHOW"." "MUNICH," "DEFIANCE," "THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO." BUT MANY PEOPLE KNOW YOU AS JAMES BOND, I THINK THE GREATEST BOND. I TRULY-- I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME-- THE FIRST TIME, "CASINO ROYALE" AT THE END IT SAID, "JAMES BOND WILL RETURN." I SAID, "HE ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: I WOULD SEE ANOTHER-- I WOULD SEE ANOTHER DANIEL CRAIG JAMES BOND MOVIE IN A MINUTE. NOW, YOU'VE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE ROLE OF JAMES BOND AGAIN, IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES," BACK IN JULY. THEY SAID THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE NEXT JAMES BOND. AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY.
YES, THEY HAVE. I'VE BEEN QUITE CAGEY ABOUT IT. I HAVE BEEN DOING INTERVIEWS ALL DAY AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME AND I THINK I'VE BEEN KIND OF COY. I THINK IF I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH, I SHOULD SPEAK THE TRUTH TO YOU ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: CRAILG, WE COULD USE SOME GOOD NEWS HERE. DANIEL CRAIG, WILL YOU RETURN AS JAMES BOND?
YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. DANIEL CRAIG, EVERYBODY!
DO I LEAVE NOW?
Stephen: THAT IS FANTASTIC! THAT IS FANTASTIC!
I COULDN'T BE-- I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
Stephen: THAT'S WONDERFUL. OH, HOT DAMN. I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ALL THE PEOPLE I'VE DONE INTERVIEWS WITH TODAY. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN-- I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
Stephen: YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. ( LAUGHTER ).
I THINK SO.
Stephen: YOU SAVED IT FOR HERE. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. THEY'LL ALL AGREE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO NOT GIVE THEM THE SCOOP.
I THINK THEY WILL. I THINK THEY WILL.
Stephen: HOW LONG YOU HAVE KNOWN YOU WOULD BE THE NEXT JAMES BOND? HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN HOLDING OUT, DANIEL CRAIG?
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT.
Stephen: WOW.
WE'VE JUST BEEN SORT OF TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT. I ALWAYS WANTED TO. I NEEDED A BREAK.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS WANT TO BECAUSE YOU SAID IN AN INTERVIEW, AFTER YOU FINISHED "SPECTRE," MR. "I ALWAYS WANTED TO." YOU SAID, "I'D RATHER SLASH MY WRISTS THAN PLAY JAMES BOND AGAIN."
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT THAT WRITTEN DOWN THERE.
Stephen, OF COURSE,, OF COURSE. I HAVE A TERRIBLE MEMORY. PEOPLE HAVE TO WRITE THINGS DOWN FOR ME. SO THERE IS A TIME WHEN YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE NEXT JAMES BOND.
LOOK, THERE'S NO POINT MAKING EXCUSES ABOUT IT. BUT IT WAS TWO DAYS AFTER I FINISHED SHOOTING THE LAST MOVIE. I WENT STRAIGHT TO AN INTERVIEW AND SOMEONE SAID, "WOULD DO YOU ANOTHER ONE?" AND I SAID, "NO!" AND INSTEAD OF SAYING SOMETHING WITH STYLE AND GRACE, I GAVE A REALLY STUPID ANSWER. AND IT'S --
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S LIKE ASKING A WOMAN WHO JUST GAVE BIRTH AND HAS, LIKE, A FOUR-INCH EPISIOTOMY, "WOULD YOU THRIEK HAVE ANOTHER BABY?"
IT'S NOT QUITE LIKE THAT. I DON'T, I CAN COMPARE IT TO THAT.
Stephen: YOU WOULD GET IN TROUBLE.
I WOULD GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH.
Stephen: HOW IS YOUR LOVELY WIFE?
SHE'S VERY WELL. SHE SENDS HER LOVE.
Stephen: DOES SHE?
YES, SHE SENS HER LOVE.
Stephen: L-O-V-E? HAVE I MENTIONED THAT I HAVE A RACHEL PROBLEM?
YOU DIDN'T SAY A PROBLEM. IT'S A CRUSH.
Stephen: IT'S A PROBLEM IF YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S WIFE, THAT'S A PROBLEM.
AND YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT.
Stephen: AND ESPECIALLY IF IT'S DANIEL CRAIG'S WIFE. YOU HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON DANIEL CRAIG'S WIFE.
SHE HAS A LITTLE CRUSH ON YOU, SO THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE JUST ADULTS. WE'RE JUST BEING VERY ADULT ABOUT THIS.
Stephen: TOTALLY ADULT ABOUT THIS. JUST-- BUT NOT EUROPEAN ABOUT IT, RIGHT?
NO.
Stephen: BECAUSE I HAVE-- I HAVE A GOOD MARRIAGE.
YEAH, SO DO I.
Stephen: ANYWAY, GIVE HER MY BEST. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR NEW MOVIE-- OKAY, SO BOND, POOF! WHO CARES ABOUT BOND AT THIS POINT. YOU HAVE THE NEW MOVIE WHICH IS "LOGAN LUCKY." WHAT IS WHAT IS YOUR CHARACTER'S NAME?
JOE BANG.
Stephen: HE'S AN EXPLOSIVE EXPERT, JOE BANG. THAT'S LIKE A KNIFE EXPERT NAMED "RICKY STABY."
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU DO AN EXTRAORDINARY KIND OF APPALACHIAN ACCENT IN THIS MOVIE.
EXTRAORDINARY, YES.
Stephen: IT WAS VERY GOOD.
IT WAS I KNOW YOU'RE FROM THE SOUTH SO I WAS VERY NERVOUS ABOUT COMING ON HERE AND YOU JUDGING ME.
Stephen: NO, NOT AT ALL. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. LET'S LET THE AUDIENCE JUDGE. YOU'RE IN THE BACK OF A CAR--
I THINK I'M IN THE BACK OF THE CAR, ADAM DRIVER IS IN THE FRONT, AND I'M TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF.
Stephen: ANOTHER JIM.
GUNNING FOR 100 IN THE NEONLY BLUE CAR THAT PROBABLY AIN'T EVEN ON THE MARKET YET. DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE ASKING FOR-- TO BE PULLED OVER?
SUNDOWN, A HOLIDAY WEEKEND, POLICE DEPARTMENT HIT BY BUDGET CARTS. THERE'S ONLY ONE PACONTROL CAR FOR 40 MILES.
THAT'S STILL ONE MUSKER.
IT'S BEEN HANDLED.
NELLY. I'M ABOUT TO GET NAKED. BACK HERE. SO NO PEEKIN'.
I SAID NO PEEKIN '.
WOULD YOU GIVE ME MY ARM, PLEASE?
IS IT THIS ONE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU GOT IT DOWN. YOU GOT IT DOWN.
YOU THINK?
Stephen: I THINK SO. I MEAN, THE KEY WORD IN THAT SENTENCE IS NECK-ED. YOU GET NECK-ED. DID YOU PICK UP ANY PHRASES, LIKE SOUTHERN PHRASES THAT YOU HADN'T HEARD BEFORE?
DO YOU KNOW THIS ONE (BLEEP).
Stephen: GRIN (BLEEP)?
YES.
Stephen: I'VE MET ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, BUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. YEAH. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I CAN IMAGINE
I THINK IT KIND OF MEANS YOU PAY SOMEONE A EXPLIMENT COMPLIMENT AND SORT OF TWIST THE KNIFE IN AT THE END.
Stephen: OH, OKAY, OKAY. I KNOW THAT. LIKE KIND OF A HOSTILE FRIENDLINESS.
A HOSTILE FRIENDLINESS.
Stephen: LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL PRAY FOR YOU."
IT'S EXACTLY THAT. YOU PUT IT IN A NICER WAY.
Stephen: "I'LL PRAY FOR YOU. BLESS YOUR HEART."
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
Stephen: THAT USUALLY MEANS, "YOU'RE THE DUMBEST (BLEEP) I'VE EVER MET." OKAY. NOW, OKAY, THIS IS-- THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT HERE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS CAME ABOUT? THIS IS-- THIS IS-- FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW. THIS SCENE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN "THE FORCE AWAKENS" WHERE SHE'S BEING HELD CAPTIVE BEFORE SHE'S INTERROGATED, THAT'S YOU AS THE STORMTROOPER, AND IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY YOU CAN TELL IT'S YOU. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
I SLEPT WITH J.J. ABRAM S.
Stephen:  YOU SLEPT WITH J.J. ABE RACKS? WELL, I DIDN'T GET A PART IN "STAR WARS."
AND YOU DID?
Stephen: HE IS A VERY INVENTIVE LOVER. SOME PEOPLE SAY HE MAKES LOVE TOO MUCH LIKE SPIELBERG, BUT I THINK HE'S VERY ORIGINAL.
I THINK THAT'S TRUE. HE SI AGREE. I WISH-- THAT "STAR WARS" MOST HAVE BEEN SHOT AT PINE WOOD NOW --
Stephen: IN ENGLAND.
IN ENGLAND WHERE WE SHOOT THE BONDS. MOST OF THE CREW ON THAT WERE WORKING ON THE BOND, WHICH WAS STRAIGHT AFTERWARDS, I'M GOING TO GET HIM INTO TROUBLE, BEN DICKSON, SECOND A.D., WHO I HAVE KNOWN AND WORKED WITH FOR A LONG TIME AND HE WAS MY LIAISON ON SET, AND HE WAS WORKING ON "STAR WARS" AND I HAD MEETINGS AND SAID." HOW IS IT GOING?" IT'S FANTASTIC. IT'S WONDERFUL. J.J. IS AMAZING. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. AND I SAID, "CAN I BE IN IT?" AND HE SORT OF WENT, "ARE YOU SERIOUS?" "YEAH, I'M SERIOUS." AND HE WENT TO J.J.AND HE SAID, "WE'RE SHOOTING A STORMTROOPER SCENE THIS WEEKEND. DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?"
Stephen: WOW, WOW. THERE HE IS. AREN'T YOU A LITTLE SHORT TO BE A STORMTROOPER?
OH, I HATE YOU SO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU BE, YOU GIVE WITH ONE END AND THE TAKE WITH THE OTHER!
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. LISTEN, SO IS THIS THE LAST BOND? YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE ONE AFTER THAT?
I THINK THIS IS IT. I THINK THIS IS IT. I JUST WANT TO GO OUT ON A HIGH NOTE AND I CAN'T WAIT.
Stephen: HOW YOU JUST ASKED TO BE IN THIS MOVIE AND IN IT, CAN I BE THE NEXT BOND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CAN YOU HOOK THAT UP? DONE. IT'S DONE. "LOGAN LUCKY" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. DANIEL CRAIG, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TIFFANY HADDISH. THANKS, MAN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

SEVEN YEARS AGO, THE CENSUS CAME AROUND, AND THEY SHOWED UP TO MY HOUSE AND THEY ASKED ME WHAT MY NATIONALITY WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE COUNTING TO SEE HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M AMERICAN." HE WAS LIKE, "NO, WHAT'S YOUR RACE?" I SAID, "SO ARE WE DOING THAT TODAY, BRINGING RACISM RIGHT TO MY FRONT DOOR ON THIS DAY. WHAT ARE YOU COLOR BLIND?" AND HE SAID, "YES." AND I SAID, "THIS IS MY CHANCE. AND I HAD A WHOLE CONVERSATION, LIKE 'GIRL THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS IS YOUR CHANCE? OBAMA SAID IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE. YOU CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE TODAY. AND I SAID YOU'RE RIGHT I CAN BE WHATEVER I WANT TO BE.

AND HE SAID OKAY AND CHECKED THE WHITE BOX, AND IT HAS BEEN FANTASTIC.

YEAH, I WAS LIVING IN MY GEO METRO, TWO-DOOR HATCHED BACK.
Stephen: HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING?
THIS WAS 2004, AND 2003. I WAS VERY HOMELESS, AND I WAS THE TYPE OF CHICK THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY-- LIKE, I'M VERY PRIDEFULFUL. SO I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW I WAS HOMELESS SO I KEPT MY NAILS DONE, AND MY HAIR DONE, AND HAD MY SUITCASES IN THE CAR AND I WOULD COVER THEM UP IN WITH BLANKETS. AND I WAS AT THE LAUGH FACTORY AND KEVIN HART WAS THERE AND HE WAS LIKE, "YO,ATIVE, WHAT IS WITH ALL THIS STUFF IN YOUR CAR? DO YOU LIVE IN THERE OR SOMETHING?" I SAID, I'M BETWEEN HOUSES. LEAVE ME ALONE." HE WAS LIKE, "WHERE ARE YOU SLEEPING?" I SAID,ING, BEVERLY HILLS. I PARK ON THE STREETS ON BEVERLY HILLS." HE SAID, "YOU'RE SLEEPING IN YOUR CAR? YOU'RE AWE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. YOU COULD BE WITH ANY MAN." I SAID, "LOOK, I SLEEP WITH PEOPLE TO HEEL THEM, NOT FOR A ROOF OVER MY HEAD." BECAUSE I GOT MAGICAL POWERS. THIS IS-- THIS IS, YOU KNOW, WHERE LIFE COMES FROM. IT HEELS.
