IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, EVERYBODY! WHOOO! THANK YOU, JOSEPH.
Jon: HEY! I KNOW.
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME TO THE SHOW. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO CAN THE LATE SHOW," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT, AND YOU ARE HERE ON A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT. A LITTLE LATER I WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THE BOSS.
Stephen: TIME PERMITTING, OBVIOUSLY. WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET TO IT. EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS DONALD TRUMP GUY, AND I DO MEAN EVERYONE. YESTERDAY, THE DALAI LAMA APPEARED ON A BRITISH MORNING SHOW AND SAID THIS:
HAVE YOU MET DONALD TRUMP?
NEVER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SEE HIM, THE THE WAY HIS HAIR-- SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND HIS MOUTH, SMALL. THAT IS IS MY IMPRESSION.
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD IMPRESSION. THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU NEVER MET HIM. BECAUSE HIS HAIR IS LIKE THIS, AND HIS MOUTH IS LIKE...
Jon: OH, MAN!
Stephen: I WONDER HOW THAT FEELS. HOW DOES THAT FEEL? IMAGINE BEING TRASH-TALKED BY THE DALAI LAMA.
Jon: THAT'S SERIOUS.
Stephen: I HAVE TO WONDER WHAT DID HE DO IN A PREVIOUS LIFE? I THOUGHT TRUMP WOULD HAVE AN AFFINITY WITH BUDDHISTS. I THOUGHT BUDDHISTS WOULD LEAK TRUMP BECAUSE IF HE GETS THE NUCLEAR CODES, WE COULD ALL ACHIEVE NOTHINGNESS. THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD BURN BY THE DALAI LAMA. I CAN'T IMAGINE THE DALAI LAMA AT A ROAST. "YOUR MOTHER WAS SO FAT, SHE WAS REINCARNATED AT TWO PEOPLE. NAMASTE." LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING. TECH NEWS. YOU GUYS LIKE APPLE PRODUCTS? YOU GUYS HAVE THE iPHONE AND STUFF LIKE THAT? YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS. APPLE JUST PATENTED AN EXCITING NEW INNOVATION:  A PAPER BAG. YOU KNOW IT'S THE LATEST IN BAG TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE THERE'S NO HEADPHONE JACK. NOW, WHY WOULD SOMEBODY NEED THIS NEW APPLE BAG. APPLE EXPLAINED THAT IN THIS ACTUAL QUOTE FROM THEIR PATENT APPLICATION, "BAGS ARE OFTEN USED FOR CONTAINING ITEMS." NOW, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ALL THAT TECHNICAL JARGON, BUT IT DOES SOUND LIKE APPLE IS COMING OUT WITH ANOTHER NEW PRODUCT "iTEMS." COULD BE. NOW, I'M A FAMOUS TV GUY, SO I GET ALL THE LATEST APPLE GAGEETS IN ADVANCE. SO I HAPPEN TO HAVE A BETA MODEL OF THE NEW APPLE BAG! RIGHT HERE. HERE WE GO. JUST LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL, SMOOTH DESIGN. WAY IT RESTS IN MY HANDS RIGHT THERE, IT'S JUST SO-- IT'S SO INTUITIVE. HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S ONLY $900. AND TO MAKE THE BAG EVEN MORE SLEEK AND USER FRIENDLY, APPLE HAS DONE AWAY WITH THE HOLE IN THE TOP. BUT, IF YOU REALLY NEED ONE, THEY ARE SELLING THESE HOLE ADAPTERS FOR ONLY $79 OPINION 95 RIGHT HERE. IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN REAPPLY UP THERE. I ALSO PURCHASED-- AND THESE ARE REALLY FANTASTIC. THEY'RE THE LATEST THING. I PURCHASED THESE BLUETOOTH HANDLES FOR THE BAG. I'M HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING THEM TO PAIR RIGHT NOW. WHATEVER. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, SAMSUNG HAS UNVEILED THEIR NEW GALAXY TOTE 7. CAN WE SUE THE FOOTAGE, JIM? THERE YOU GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A HOT ITEM! THAT'S A HOT ITEM.
Jon: IT'S ON FIRE!
Stephen: DO NOT STOMP THAT OUT IF IT APPEARS ON YOUR DOORSTEP. THERE IS ALSO AN EXCITING NEW PRODUCT JUST PARTHE LADIES OUT THERE. THERE ARE TWO LADIES OUT THERE. A SPANISH CAR MANUFACTURER-- AND APPARENTLY THERE IS ONE-- TEAMED UP WITH "COSMO" MAGAZINE TO DESIGN A CAR SPECIFICALLY FOR THE "COSMO" WOMAN. YOU CAN TELL IT'S BY "COSMO," BECAUSE THE SEATS CAN BE PUT IN 75 DIFFERENT POSITIONS. AND ONE OF THEM WILL DRIVE YOUR MAN WILD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. GOOD LUCK. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THE CAR FOR WOMEN. I'M SURE A MAN COULD OPERATE THIS CAR JUST AS EASILY. ALTHOUGH, HE MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE FINDING THE BUTTON THAT TURNS IT ON. I HEAR UPON I HEAR. I HEAR THERE'S A PROBLEM SOMETIMES. OH, I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT "THE LATE SHOW" WILL BE BROADCASTING LIVE THIS MONDAY AFTER THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO BE SURE TO TUNE IN, WHICHEVER CANDIDATE YOU'RE ENRAGED BY. BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE THE TWO LEAST POPULAR MAJOR PARTY NOMINEES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. LUCKILY, YOU HAVE OPTIONS, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMISSION, 1,928 PEOPLE HAVE DECLARED THEIR CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR. AND BEFORE YOU ASK, NO NONE OF THEM WAS MICHELLE OBAMA. I KNOW. THE NUMBER OF DECLARED CANDIDATES HAS MORE THAN QUADRUPLED SINCE THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE, BECAUSE THE F.E.C. HAS STARTED ACCEPTING FILINGS ON THE INTERNET. SO NOW THERE ARE SOME GOOFY CANDIDATES WHO HAVE NO REAL SHOT, LIKE "COBRA COMMANDER;" "YODA STARWARS;" AND BEST OF ALL, THERE'S A LISTING THAT SAYS GOD IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S GREAT NEWS. I WAS WORRIED THIS ELECTION WAS PROOF THERE IS NO GOD. SO GOOD LUCK WITH ALL THOSE ESPECIALLY GOOD LUCK TO GOD BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE SCANDALS IN HIS PAST. DID YOU KNOW HE TURNED LOT'S WIFE INTO A PILLAR OF SALT? THAT'S GOING TO HURT HIM WITH SOCCER MOMS.
HOLD ON A SECOND, STEPHEN. STEPHEN.
Stephen: OF.
Stephen: GOD, IS THAT YOU? YES, THAT'S ME, RIGHT BEHIND THIS THING. YEAH, HERE I AM.
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO BE IN THE RACE. THEY LOOK AT HILLARY AND TRUMP AND SAY, "GOD HELP US.
Stephen: THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE.
I THINK SO SO.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A RUNNING MATE YET?
DON'T BRING IT UP. I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO EITHER "THE SON" OR "THE HOLY GHOST." AND WHOEVER I DON'T PICK, IS GONNA BE PISSED. JUNIOR'S VERY SENSITIVE.
Stephen: HE'LL FORGIVE YOU.
MAYBE.
Stephen: ISN'T YOUR AGE GOING TO BE AN ISSUE?
NO. IF YOU READ THE BIBLE, YOU'LL SEE I'VE MELLOWED WITH AGE. BESIDES, I'VE GOT A ONE-PAGE LETTER FROM MY DOCTOR SAYING I'M EXTREMELY HEALTHY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THAT.
Stephen: GLAD TO HEAR IT. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
HE WROTE IT WHILE I WAS IN THE LIMO.
Stephen: GOD, WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THE ISSUES, LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, GLOBAL WARMING.
HEY, DON'T BLAME GLOBAL WARMING ON ME. I WAS ONE BURNING BUSH. BUT I DO HAVE A PLAN: ARKS FOR EVERYBODY! NOTHING LIKE RIDING OUT THE FLOOD ON THE HIGH SEAS, LISTENING TO YAKS DOING IT. THEY MAKE A LOT OF NOISE. I'LL TELL YOU. NOTHING LOUDER THAN A YAK IN THE SACK, STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON, GOD.
MOVE ON QUICKLY. I DON'T WANT TO QUESTION YOUR WAYS, GOD, BUT IF YOU DON'T WIN, WOULD YOU ENDORSE ONE OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES?
OOF, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, TRUMP'S ASKED FOR MY HELP, BUT HE'S GOT TINY HANDS, SO HIS PRAYERS AREN'T VERY EFFECTIVE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, I WISH YOU LUCK IN YOUR CAMPAIGN, GOD. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR CHANCES ARE?
PRETTY GOOD! EVERYWHERE BUT THE SOUTHERN STATES.
Stephen: WHY NOT THE SOUTHERN STATES?
I'M JUST NOT RELIGIOUS ENOUGH FOR THEM.
Stephen: GOD, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. THANK YOU, GOD.
OH, SPRINGSTEEN IS THE REAL GUY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE MASTER AMERICAN TROUBADOUR OF MY LIFETIME. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
YEAH!
Audience: BRUCE!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU. THANKS.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE SONG THEY WERE PLAYING "YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER."
GET OUT!
Stephen: CAN WHICH IS ON THE COMPANION ALBUM TO YOUR BOOK. IT'S CALLED "CHAPTER AND VERSE." 50 YEARS OF MUSIC ON HERE FROM YOU.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT SONG, TOO.
50 YEARS AND LOSS OF HEARING FOR ME, ALSO. RIGHT.
Stephen: SO "YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY THE COVER." HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU RECORDED THAT?
WELL, THAT WAS RECORDED IN A LITTLE CLUB CALLED THE LEFT FOOT IN FREEHOLD, NEW JERSEY-- ( APPLAUSE ) WHOA! YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I WAS 16. 16.
Stephen: WOW. WELL, IF YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY THE COVER, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COVER. THERE IT IS, YOUR NEW MEMOIR "BORN TO RUN." SO LET'S JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER. CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS GUY ON COVER OF THIS BOOK? HOW OLD ARE YOU THERE?
I'M 27.
Stephen: YOU'RE 27.
27.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU-- WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS GUY AT 27 WOULD SAY IF HE SAW THIS GUY AT 67?
OKAY. ED" WHERE MY CAR GO? WHO'S THE OLD MAN IN THE SUIT JACKET? AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH MY HAIR?" I'D SAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW.
Stephen: SO WHY DID YOU WRITE A BOOK? YOU'VE BEEN WRITING FOR YEARS, YOU KNOW. IT'S AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, BUT YOUR SONGS-- UNLESS I'M WRONG-- ARE AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL.
THEY SEEM THAT WAY.
Stephen: YEAH. THEY SEEM THAT WAY? HAVE YOU BEEN LYING TO US IN THE SONGS ALL THESE YEARS, BRUCE?
THAT'S WHAT ARTISTS DO. THEY LIE IN SERVICE OF THE TRUTH.
Stephen: REALLY.
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT YOU TELL THE JUDGE? SO WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO DO IN A BOOK THAT YOU COULDN'T DO IN SONGS?
THE BOOK IS VERY DIFFERENT. YOU HAVE-- YOU HAVE TO-- YOU STILL HAVE TO FIND RHYTHM, AND YOU HAVE TO FIND MUSIC IN THE PROEZ THAT YOU'RE WRITING, BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE SPACE TO DELVE INTO DEEPER DETAILS. AND ALSO, AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, PEOPLE KNOW IT'S IMMEDIATELY ABOUT YOUR LIFE. WHEREAS THE SONGS, THERE'S ALWAYS A QUESTION. "ARE THE GUY IN 'RACING IN THE STREET'." BOOK PEOPLE KNOW, IT'S DIRECTLY FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: WELL, IT'S-- IT'S LIKE YOUR MUSIC IN THAT IT'S-- IT'S BEAUTIFUL, INCREDIBLY MOVING. EVERY-- PRACTICALLY EVERY PARAGRAPH THAT I'VE READ IN THIS HAS BEEN LIKE POETRY.
WHOA!
Stephen: NO, BUT ALSO-- BUT, NO--
LET'S GO THERE.
Stephen: BUT IT'S ALSO LIKE LISTENING TO YOU TALK AT THE SAME TIME. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO FIND THE VICE OF THIS BOOK? WHAT WAS THE PROCESS OF WRITING THIS BOOK LIKE FOR YOU?
IT STARTED WHEN WE PLAYED THE SUPER BOWL, WHICH IS, EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN AT IT A LONG TIME, IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HAIRY-- A HAIRY EVENING.
Stephen: YOU MIGHT SLIDE ON YOUR KNEES AND GRIND YOUR GROIN INTO A CAMERA, LIKE I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU DOING.
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AFTER, IT ENDED UP BEING QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, SO I WROTE A LITTLE ESSAY TO PUT ON OUR WEB SITE, AND I KIND OF LIKED THE VOICE I FOUND IN THE ESSAY. IT FELT LIKE ME. SO WE WERE IN FLORIDA FOR A WHILE AFTER THE SUPER BOWL, AND I SAT AROUND, AND I SAID, WELL MAYBE I'LL THROW SOME MEMORIES DOWN FROM WHEN I STARTED. SO I JUST STARTED FROM THE BEGINNING. AND I SPENT ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS WRITING, AND INITIALLY I THOUGHT WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH IT. MAYBE IT WILL JUST BE FOR THE KID TO READ OR SOMETHING WHEN THEY GET OLDER. AND THEN I WROTE A LITTLE BIT MORE, WROTE A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND I PUT IT AWAY SOMETIMES FOR A YEAR, EVEN LONGER WHEN WE TOURED. AND I COME BACK TO IT AND I GO, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. MAYBE I'LL KEEP GOING. EVENTUALLY IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE I KNEW I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING A BOOK, AND-- BUT I REALLY KIND OF WROTE IT SOMEWHAT CASUALLY OVER SEVEN YEARS.
Stephen: SO THIS IS SEVEN YEARS OF YOUR LIFE REPRESENTED RIGHT HERE.
YEAH, I THINK SO. WHO YEARS IF YOU COMPACT IT ALL IN ONE SPACE.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAY IN HERE IS-- THIS THEATER, ACTUALLY, APPEARS IN THE BOOK. THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER.
INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU HAD A TURNING POINT IN YOUR LIFE. YOU AWOKE TO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. YOU SAY WHEN YOU SAW THIS. JIMMY? ♪ YOU AIN'T NOG BUT A HOUND DOG YOU AIN'T NOTHING BUT A HOUND DOG ♪
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAW ELVIS PRESLEY PLAY HERE AT THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER?
IT STILL LOOKS GREAT.
Stephen: YEAH. THAT'S 50 YEARS AGO THIS MONTH, THAT PERFORMANCE IS 50 YEARS AGO THIS MONTH.
THAT MAKES SENSE. I'M 67. SO I WAS-- SIX, SEVEN YEARS OLD.
Stephen: SO WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW IT?
IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY THAT YOUNG, BUT IT HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE HE STOOD HERE?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE STOOD, BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE PICTURES OF THE SCREAMING GIRLS FOR BOTH ELVIS AND THE BEATLES WERE UP THERE IN THAT CORNER RIGHT OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Audience: BRUCE!
CAN WE GET SOME OF WHAT FOR ME?  ( CHEERS ) LOVELY. THAT'S-- THAT'S WHY I GOT HERE.
Stephen: EXACTLY. THAT WOULD MAKE A GOOD RINGTOANG. SO WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW IT? YOU SAID IT CHANGED YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU SAW IT?
AT SEVEN I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A LIFE I HAD IT TO CHANGE, BUT WHATEVER I HAD, IT STRUCK THE ME RIGHT AWAY. AND I RAN-- I GOT MY MOTHER TO RUN DOWN TO THE STORE THE THE NEXT WEEK AND WE RENTED A GUITAR, AND I TOOK A SWING AT PLAYING IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH. I GAVE UP. MY HANDS WERE TOO SMALL, AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW-- THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TEACH IN THOSE DAYS. THERE WASN'T ANYBODY TEACHING "TWIST AND SHOUT, "OR "HOUND DOG." I GOT BORED RATHER QUICKLY AND FUT AWAY UNTIL I WAS 14 AND THE BEATLES WERE ON THIS STAGE AND IT HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN SO I GOT STRUCK TWICE BY LIGHTNING.
Stephen: WAS IT JUST THE MUSIC OR WAS IT THE SCREAMING GIRLS PART AS WELL? JUST THE MUSIC?
OBVIOUSLY-- WELL, AT SEVEN I'M NOT SURE. AT 14 IT WAS CERTAINLY, "OKAY, THIS IS FOUR GUYS. THERE'S ALL THESE WOMEN. HOW DO I GET INTO THAT BUSINESS."
Stephen: WELL, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU GOT INTO THE BUSINESS AND WE'LL DO THAT WHEN WE COME BACK WITH MORE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"." WE'RE HERE WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. TALKING ABOUT HIS BOOK REQUEST THE BORN TO RUN." NOW, BEFORE I STARTED GETTING READY FOR THIS INTERVIEW AND READ THE BOOK, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW YOU WERE RAISED A CATHOLIC. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT.
OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, YOU SAY IN HERE THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU HEARD THE MUSIC FOR THE FIRST TIME.
THAT'S WHERE I HEARD... I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT IS WHERE I FOUND THE BEGINNINGS OF MY SONG, YOU SAID.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S WHEN YOU FOUND THE BEGINNINGS OF MY SONG. IT'S A GOOD BOOK. YOU SHOULD READ IT. I MEAN-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I CRIED WHEN I READ IT. IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL BOOK. YOU SAID IT'S WHERE YOU FOUND THE BEGINNINGS OF YOUR SONG. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHERE IS THE CATHOLIC IN YOUR WORK? IT'S NOT OVERT.
IT'S PRETTY OVERT, YOU KNOW. RUNS-- NUNS RUN BALD THROUGH HAVE THE HALLS. PREGNANT PLEADING IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.  ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S-- IT'S A LITTLE OVERHEATED THAT LINE, BUT YOU GET THE IDEA OF WHERE I WAS COMING FROM. BUT NO, IT JUST INFORMED MY LANGUAGE. WHAT HAPPENED IS EVERY KAY YOU'RE IN SCHOOL, FIRST CLASS IS RELIGION, OF COURSE. AND --
WERE YOU A GOOD STUDENT OF RELIGION?
NO. I WAS-- IT ALL SCARED ME, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. BUT --
THE NUNS AND THE PRIESTS OR THE VISION OF HELL? WHAT SCARED YOU ABOUT IT?
YEAH, YOU'RE SIX AND, YOU KNOW, THE THE VISION OF HELL WAS HELLACIOUS, YOU KNOW. SO AND, OF COURSE, YOU'RE TAKING EVERYTHING INCREDIBLY LITERALLY AT THAT AGE. I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY AS REAL AS DESK YOU'RE SITTING IN. SO IT WAS A LOT IT TO DEAL WITH. BUT-- BUT AT THE END OF DAY, A LOT OF LANGUAGE FOUND THE WAY INTO MY MUSIC. AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT MY MUSIC IS WANT VERSES OF BLUES, CHORUS IS THE GOSPEL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY MY SONGS ARE BUILT, THE VERSES ARE ALWAYS BLUES AND WHEN YOU GET TO CHORUS, HOPEFULLY YOU GET A KIND OF TRANSCENDENCE THAT I GOT OUT OF GOSPEL MUSIC, YOU KNOW. AND THOSE TWO THINGS ARE AT THE CORE OF HOW I WRITE, BUT ALSO THE LANGUAGE, THE IDEAS, A LOT OF IT CAME OUT OF THE CATHOLIC EDUCATION.
Stephen: WERE YOU AN ALTAR BOY?
I WAS THE-- I WAS THE WORST ALTAR BOY ON PLANET EARTH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU WANTED TO BECOME AN ALTAR BOY BECAUSE YOU GOT OUT OF SCHOOL TO REHEARSE.
Stephen: YOU GOT OUT OF SCHOOL?
YOU GOT OUT OF SCHOOL A LITTLE EARLY EVERY WEEK TO REHEARSE AND MY MOTHER WANTED ME TO BE AN ALTAR BOY.
Stephen: WERE YOU ON STAGE AS AN ALTAR BOY. DID YOU THINK OF THAT AS BEING ON STAGE?
I WAS THE ONLY ALTAR BOY TO BE KNOCKED DOWN ON STAGE BY THE 81-YEAR-OLD MONSIGNOR WHO WAS SERVING THE MASS AT THE TIME.
Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU DO?
FIRST OF ALL, MASS THEN WAS IN LATIN ( SPEAKING LATIN ) FELLOW ALTAR BOY HERE. SO. SO YOU HAD TO LEARN ENTIRE MASS IN LATIN. SO I-- I THINK I HAD A PRAYER OR TWO DOWN BUT YOU NEVER REALLY LEARNED ANYTHING, AND I ACTUALLY NEVER LEARNED POSITIONING ON THE ALTAR. I WAS A REAL DISASTER. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, ALSO, YOU GET STUCK WITH THE EARLIEST DETAIL. SO YOU'RE THERE AT-- YOU'RE 4:30 A.M. SO YOU'RE RUNNING DOWN THE STREETS, PITCH-BLACK NIGHT. YOU HAVE YOUR CASSOCK BEHIND YOU. I'M TERRIFIED BECAUSE I KNOW I DON'T KNOW AN EFFIN THING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I SAID I JUST DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. HE SAID, "GO OUT AND LIGHT THE CANDLES." I SAID ALL RIGHT. I CAN'T LIGHT THE CANDLES. I CAN'T EVEN GET THEM LIT. AND THE MASS STARTS, AND NOW, OF COURSE, MY MOTHER, HER TWO SISTERS, ENTIRE ITALIAN AND IRISH FAMILY ARE THERE TO SEE ME MAKE MY DEBUT. AND ALONG WITH ALL THE NUNS, BECAUSE THEY GO TO EARLY MASS BEFORE THEY GO TEACH SCHOOL. AND ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER AND I GET HAULED BY MY CASSOCK FACE DOWN TO ALTAR.
Stephen: IN THE MIDDLE OF MASS?
YEAH, IN THE MIDDLE OF MASS, TO AN AUDIBLE GASP FROM THE NUNS, MY RELATIVES. WHO ARE LIKE-- THEY'RE DONE NOW. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW. THEY'RE FINISHED, YOU KNOW. SO THAT WAS-- I DON'T THINK I SERVED ANOTHER MASS. I THINK THAT WAS IT FOR ME ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU WERE A PROFESSIONAL. I HEARD YOU WENT --
I DID 11 YEARS, 11 YEARS. NEVER GOT IT RIGHT.
THAT'S PRETTY SUPPRESSIVE.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK AND THE END OF BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED "THE MAGIC TRICK." WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE MAGIC TRICK? AND TO MAKE THIS A LONGER QUESTION. PEOPLE ASK ME IF I'M INTIMIDATED ABOUT TALKING TO GUESTS AND IT'S ONLY MUSICIANS.
REALLY.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MAGIC I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS THE MAGIC TRICK TO YOU.
YOU'RE THERE TO MANIFEST SOMETHING. I MEAN, BEFORE YOU GO IN, IT'S AN EMPTY SPACE. IT'S AN EMPTY BUILDING. SO THE AUDIENCE IS GOING TO COME, AND YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW UP, AND TOGETHER YOU'RE GOING TO MANIFEST SOMETHING THAT'S VERY, VERY REAL, THAT'S VERY TANGIBLE, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PULL IT OUT OF THIN AIR. IT WASN'T THERE BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP. IT DIDN'T-- IT DIDN'T EXIST. AND IT'S-- IT'S REAL MAGIC, YOU KNOW. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT MY-- MY JOB IS EVERY NIGHT. MY JOB IS TO COME OUT THERE AND ASSIST YOU, AND FOR US TOGETHER TO CREATE-- CREATE THIS SENSE OF WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. YOU KNOW, IT IS CATHARTIC, AND HOPEFULLY ON A GOOD NIGHT WHEN WE'RE AT OUR VERY, VERY BEST, THERE'S A LITTLE TRANSCENDENCE, AND --
TRANSSUBSTANTIATION?
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT IT MIGHT BE --
THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE A TERRIBLE ALTAR BOY.
NO "P" ! I GOT IT!
Stephen: ONE THING BECOMES ANOTHER. LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU AND THE AUDIENCE BECOME ANOTHER THING.
SO WE DO BECOME A BIT OF ANOTHER THING.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'VE TURNED THE TRICK? IT'S IN THE AIR. IT'S ALWAYS IN THE AIR AT NIGHT WHEN YOU-- THERE'S A MOMENT WHEN YOU SORT OF-- YOU GET LOST IN IT, AND YOU CAN SEE GROWN MEN IN TEARS AND... NOT REALLY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHEN YOU FEEL I ITING, IS THERE A SONG YOU GO, "OKAY, I'M CALLING ON THIS SONG. WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THIS SONG NOW BECAUSE THAT WILL PUSH US OVER THE EDGE."
SOMETIMES IT DOES, BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. EVERY NIGHT, FUNNY THING ABOUT CONCERT, IT'S NEVER REPETITIVE. YOU CAN PLAY THE SAME EXACT SHOW TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW AND-- NOT A REPETITIVE EXPERIENCE. IF YOU COULD HAVE YOUR FIRST KISS ON A NIGHTLY BASIS, FOR SOME REASON, THE SHOW PROVIDES THAT SENSE OF NEWNESS REALLY REGULARLY. IT'S A VERY, VERY UNUSUAL-- IT'S AN EXPERIENCE. YOU HAD IT ONCE, YOU WOULD-- IT COULD ALTER YOU AND YOU'D REMEMBER IT YOUR WHOLE LIFE. SO TO BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE IT-- WE GO OUT THREE, FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK. WE TRAVEL THE WORLD IN FRONT OF ALL DIFFERENT AUDIENCES. BUT THE TRICK IS YOU HAVE TO MANIFEST THAT SENSE, A SENSE OF US, YOU KNOW, A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING-- WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR AUDIENCE. YOU KNOW, THAT'S A BIG PART OF.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE BREAK, BUT DON'T GO AWAY. WE'LL BE BACK MORE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NOW, WE'RE HERE WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.  ( CHEERS ) HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK, MEMORIES OF HIS LIFE CALLED "BORN TO RUN." YOU JUST PLAYED YOUR-- YOU'RE 67 YEARS OLD.
YES, I AM.
Stephen: AND YOU JUST PLAYED---
IT'S MYING ABOUT THE TOMORROW.
Stephen: YOU JUST PLAYED YOUR LONGEST U.S. SHOW, FOUR HOURS, THREE MINUTES, AND 46 SECONDS. WHY DO YOU DO SUCH LONG SHOWS?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU DO SUCH LONG SHOWS? DO YOU GO IN THINKING, "YEAH, YEAH, THIS ONE'S GOING TO BE A LONG WON."
NO.
Stephen: YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE MAGIC SHOW.
I ALWAYS THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD DEAL SHORTER. NOW, THE BAND DOESN'T COMPLAIN --
TO YOU.
EXCEPT AROUND-- AROUND THREE HOURS AND 40 MINUTES. IT'S THAT LAST 20 MINUTE THAT FOR SOME REASON EVEN GETS THE E STREET BAND SLIGHTLY-- SOMEONE MAY MENTION IT TO ME, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DURING THE SHOW OR AFTER THE SHOW?
NO, AFTER THE SHOW. WHY THEY GO THAT LONG? I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE. I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME.
Stephen: I'VE SEEN YOU UP THERE, YOU GET PRETTY SWEATY.
I DO.
Stephen: AND HOW MUCH TALCUM POWDER DO YOU GO THROUGH? BECAUSE THOSE ARE PRETTY TIGHT JEANS FOR A MAN YOUR AGE.
THERE'S A LOT OF-- THERE'S A LOT OF CHAFING THAT DOES GO ON, SO. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SHOVELING IT IN THERE AFTER THE THE SHOW.
Stephen: YOU SAID IN THE BOOK THAT YOU CALLED PERFORMING, "THE ONLY LANGUAGE I'VE EVER KNOWN TO FIGHT OFF THE NIGHT TERRORS."
YEAH, WELL, IT-- I USED ITED-- IT WAS MEDICINAL. I WAS THIS INCREDIBLY NEUROTIC YOUNG KID, A LOT OF ANXIETY, WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CHASE AWAY. SO ALL I FOUND OUT WAS AFTER I PLAYED, I CALMED-- I CALMED DOWN, AND I FELT VERY CENTERED. AND IT WAS REALLY THE FIRST THING I DID TO KIND OF MEDICATE MYSELF, YOU KNOW. AND IT MAY EXPLAIN WHY IT GOES ON SO LONG, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS AN EASY DRUG TO TAKE. BUT IT'S STILL-- IT STILL AFFECTS ME LIKE THAT. I MEAN, THE NIGHT JUST-- THE NIGHT HAS ITS OWN LIFE. AND, I MEAN, I'M COMING OUT, SO I KNOW I'M GOING TO PLAY-- WE'RE GOING TO PLAY TWO AND A HALF HOURS, WE'RE GOING TO PLAY THREE HOURS. I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER THAT. AND THE NIGHT-- IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ORGANIC AND IT DEFINES THE OWN TIME AND SPACE. AND ONCE I GET TO A CERTAIN POINT, I-- I'M-- I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE TIME, YOU KNOW. I'M HERE TO-- I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU OUT OF TIME. I'M HERE TO TRANSPORT YOU SOMEPLACE ELSE. I'M HERE TO ALTER TIME AND SPACE AND PLAY WITH IT MYSELF AND HELP YOU MOVE IN AND OUT OF-- YOU KNOW, MOVE IN AND OUT OF THINGS ON ANY GIVEN EVENING. SO IT'S-- THE TIME THING IS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS. IF IT WAS MY OWN PREFERENCE I WOULD PREFER NOT TO PLAY FOUR HOURS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
Stephen: WELL, YOU SAY YOU'RE FIGHTING OFF THE NIGHT TERRORS, WHAT ARE THE NIGHT TERRORS? AND HAVE YOU HAD THEM YOUR ENTIRE LIFE? ARE THOSE LITERAL NIGHT TERRORS? IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY, THEY WOULD COME TO YOU?
IF I DON'T PLAY REGULARLY, I'M INSIDE MY HEAD A LOT. AND I REALIZE I'M NOT MY OWN BEST COMPANY. SO I'VE KIND OF HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT MY WHOLE LIFE A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YOU'RE OPEN IN HERE ABOUT HAVING DEPRESSION.
YEAH.
Stephen: AS AN ADULT. AND YOUR FATHER DEALT WITH THE SAME THING.
YEAH, MY FATHER HAD-- WAS VERY ILL WITH IT, YOU KNOW. AND THERE WAS A LOT OF REAL ILLNESS IN MY FAMILY, IN MY FAMILY WITH IT. IT REALLY SHOT THROUGH THE IRISH SIDE OF THE FAMILY. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I CAUGHT SOME OF IT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, OCCASIONALLY IT COMES UP. BUT IT'S-- YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD MY TUSSLES WITH IT, BUT NOT LIKE MY DAD. MY DAD HAD IT VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY, AND SO DID SOME OF MY OTHER FAMILY MEMBER S.
Stephen:  YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR DAD IN THE BOOK AND IT WAS A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP AND NOT ALWAYS A HAPPY ONE. BUT YOU DESCRIBE A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF-- WELL, SOMETHING LIKE REDEMPTION BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FATHER.
YEAH.
Stephen: THE DAY BEFORE YOUR FIRST CHILD WAS BORN.
OH, WOW.
Stephen: WOULD YOU MIND SHARING THE STORY OF THE CONVERSATION YOU AND YOUR FATHER HAD.
MY DAD WAS VERY MANIC, SO HE WOULD TAKE THESE LONG DRIVING-- LONG DRIVING TRIPS. AND HE SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE ONE KAY, AND IT WAS JUST TO SAY HELLO, HE SAID. IT WAS A 500-MILE TRIP TO SAY HI. AND HE CAME IN-- IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ABOUT ME BEING ON THE CUSP OF BEING A FATHER THAT WE SAT DOWN, WE HAD A COUPLE OF BEERS, AND IT WAS LIKE A SUNDAY MORNING OR SOMETHING. AND HE SAID, "YEAH, I WAS A LITTLE ROUGH ON YOU, YOU KNOW." AND I REMEMBER SAYING, "YEAH, I KNOW. BUT YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD." AND IT WAS A VERY SMALL MOMENT, BUT IT WAS-- IT WAS SORT OF A MOMENT WHERE IT WAS ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR. PLUS I HAD MUCH, MUCH GREATER INSIGHT INTO MY FATHER'S LIFE AS I GOT OLDER. IT WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT. MY FATHER WAS A-- IT WAS A REALLY INSIDE HE WAS A SWEETHEART AND LOVING MAN. BUT HE REALLY STRUGGLED SERIOUSLY WITH SOME ILLNESS. SO IT TOOK ME-- I HAD TO GET PRETTY OLD BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD HIM AND UNDERSTOOD WHERE SOME OF THE TROUBLES WE HAD CAME FROM, YOU KNOW. SO-- AND WE-- YOU KNOW, IT WAS-- INITIALLY, WE DIDN'T COMMUNICATE VERY WELL. SO I STARTED TO WRITE-- I WROTE MY SONGS. I WROTE SONGS ABOUT HIM. AND I'D BRING RECORD OVER. WOULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BACK. WRITE ANOTHER SONG ABOUT HIM, BRING THE RECORD OVER. I KNOW MY MOTHER HAD IT ON. DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BACK. AND FINALLY, ONE DAY-- AND HE WAS LITERALLY-- HE WAS IN BED, AND HE WAS CLOSE TO HIS DEATH. AND I SAID, "DAD "WE WERE TALKING. AND I SAID, "WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE SONGS?" "THE ONES ABOUT ME." ( APPLAUSE ) SO... SO IT WAS A NICE THING.
Stephen: WELL, THE NEXT DAY YOU BECAME A DAD YOURSELF.
YEAH.
Stephen: DID THAT-- HOW DID THAT CHANGE YOU? YOU TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE GOES AWAY, YOUR-- IN THE BOOK YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL-- THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL CHAPTER ON THE BIRTH OF YOUR FIRST CHILD AND SAYING THAT ALL YOUR SELF-PROTECTION, ALL YOUR SECRETS, ALL YOUR WORRIES ABOUT YOURSELF GO OUT THE WINDOW INSTANTLY WHEN YOU HOLD YOUR CHILD. DID THAT THEN-- DID THAT CHANGE YOUR WORK? DID THAT CHANGE WHAT YOU WANTED TO CREATE?
YEAH, IT WAS-- IT WAS-- IT WAS A FUNNY EVENING. I MEAN, FIRST I WAS JUST CONCERNED IF PATTY WAS GOING TO HAVE ANY PAIN, YOU KNOW. SO I WAS --
YOU THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WOULD BE THE ONLY WOMAN WHO DID. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO I WAS-- BUT, YOU KNOW, ONCE THE-- ONCE THE BABY CAME ALONG, YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST EVERYTHING STOPPED. AND ALL YOUR DEFENSIVE MECHANISMS, ALL THE THINGS YOU DO ON PROTECT YOURSELF EVERY KAY, ALL YOUR-- ALL THE DANCES YOU DO SUDDENLY JUST, THEY'RE HALTED, YOU KNOW. UP TO RUN OUT INTO THE STREET AND SAY, "PEOPLE, STOP SHOPPING. STOP. GET OFF YOUR CELL PHONES. STOP WATCHING TELEVISION. A MESSIAH HAS COME." THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL. YOUR KIDS, YOU KNOW. HERE, IN BABYLON, LOS ANGELES, A NEW SON OF NEW JERSEY HAS BEEN BORN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BREAK AND THIS WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE THREE ACTS BUT I'D LOVE TO ASK YOU A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IF YOU'D STICK AROUND.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, TALKING ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK "BORN TO RUN." A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS HERE. THIS COMES FROM AN ANONYMOUS MEMBER OF YOUR BAND WHO SENT IT IN TO US. "I HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH YOU THAT YOU OCCASIONALLY, SPONTANEOUSLY CALL OUT A SONG THE BAND HAS NEVER PLAYED BEFORE. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUR BAND AS THEY'RE TRYING TO LEARN A SONG THEY'VE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE 10 SECONDS BEFORE 50,000 PEOPLE WHILE YOU'RE COUNTING THEM IN?"
FIRST OF ALL, THE ENTIRE BAND ARE BAR BAND VETERANS. SO THEY'VE PLAYED HUNDREDS OF NIGHTS BEFORE WE EVER STOOD OUT IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE AFTER WE HAD A RECORD DEAL. THERE'S A COMMON WELL THAT WE ALL DRAW FROM. I MEAN IF SOMETHING SAYS, "PLAY 'WILD THING'" YOU'LL BE FIRED FROM THE E STREET BAND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT. AND THERE IS A SECRET. THERE IS A LITTLE MAN UNDER THE STAGE, AND AND HE HAS A TELEPROMPTER. IF I GET A SIGN THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO PLAY "FRIDAY ON MY MIND" WE'RE GOING TO PLAY KATY PERRY, WHATEVER YEAR GOING TO PLAY. HE WITHIN SECONDS HAS THE LYRICS UP IN PRONT OF ME, YOU KNOW. SO HE'S --
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.
OKAY.
Stephen: YOUR TOP FIVE BRUCE SONGS.  ( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S TOUGH. YOU KNOW. THAT'S-- THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
Stephen: FIVE OUT OF ABOUT 300. LET'S GO. FIVE.
I'D HAVE TO PUT "BORN TO RUN" UP THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GUESS FOR ME, "RISING" WAS A BIG SONG. ( APPLAUSE ) WE PLAY "THUNDER ROAD" REALLY REGULARLY.  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT "NEBRASKA "WAS A GOOD ONE. THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. I'M TRYING TO SKIP-- WHAT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO --
"BAD LANDS "YOU PLAY EVERY CONCERT.
Stephen: IT'S YOUR LIFE, BRUCE. IT'S YOUR LIFE.
THESE FOLKS ARE ALL PLANTED NOW. CAN RACING IN THE STREET."
Stephen: THESE ARE EVERYBODY'S TOP FIVE, BY THE WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, NOW, ON COMPANION ALBUM, THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT, ON THE COMPANION ALBUM CALLED "CHAPTER AND VERSE." THERE IS A COUPLE OF DOZEN GREAT SONGS. ONE IS CALLED "HENRY BOY." "HENRY BOY" HAS AN INTERESTING STORY. THIS THEATER AS WELL WHICH I'LL GET TO IN JUST A SECOND. BUT HOW DID "HENRY BOY "COME ABOUT?
YO I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF WRITING IT OR PERFORMING IT. I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THE JOHN HAMM DEMO TAPE, THE FIRST THING I CUT ON CBS WHEN I WAS FIRST AUDITIONING.
Stephen: ON COLUMBUS RECORDS.
ON COLUMBUS RECORDS.
Stephen: JOHN HAM.
HE PRODUCED IT.
Stephen: THERE WAS AN 18-YEAR-OLD MIXER ON THAT SESSION, AND THAT IS HARVEY GOLDBERG.
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE --
AND HE'S A MIXER FOR THIS SHOW.
THIS IS A "THIS IS YOUR LIFE" MOMENT.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT BELOW US. HE'S RIGHT BELOW THE STAGE RIGHT NOW. THERE'S HARVEY! ( APPLAUSE )
HELLO, STEPHEN. HELLO, BRUCE.
Stephen: HEY, HARVEY. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO BRUCE?
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AFTER THE DEMO. AND I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT SO NOW I CAN SEE WHAT WENT ON. GOOD LUCK WITH THE BOOK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BY THE WAY, WE FOUND OUT-- WE FOUND OUT FROM THE HISTORIAN OF THIS BUILDING, THAT ELVIS PERFORMED RIGHT AROUND HERE. THEY SAY THIS IS THE SPOT RIGHT AROUND WHERE ELVIS WOULD HAVE PERFORMED. SO YOU MADE IT.
WHOOO!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WELL, THE BOOK IS "BORN TO RUN." IT'S ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD TO THE PRESENT. WHAT'S THE FUTURE HOLD FOR YOU? WHAT'S THE NEXT CHAPTER?
SAME OLD THING.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU COULD PROBABLY BE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY IF YOU WANTED.
NO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NO? AND--
I THINK I'LL PASS ON THAT ONE.
Stephen: TONIGHT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.
IT IS.
Stephen: TONIGHT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO WE GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING. WE JUST GOT A SMALL LITTLE SOMETHING.
REALLY.
Stephen: THIS IS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL SCHEMATIC OF THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER SINCE THIS BUILDING MADE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE.
I ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THOSE.
Stephen: WISH BRUCE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "CHAPTER AND VERSE" IS OUT NOW. "BORN TO RUN" IS AVAILABLE ON SEPTEMBER 27. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, EVERYBODY! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING "BORN TO RUN.  )
