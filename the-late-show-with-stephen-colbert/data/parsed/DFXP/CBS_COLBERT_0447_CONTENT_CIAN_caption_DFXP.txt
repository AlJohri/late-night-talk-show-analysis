A SPECIAL ELECTION THREE WEEKS FROM TUESDAY COULD CHANGE THE BALANCE OF THE U.S. SENATE. TODAY THE TOP THREE NEWSPAPERS IN ALABAMA RAN A FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL REJECTING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE ROY MOORE. HE IS FIGHTING OFF MULTIPLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
HERE ARE SOME OTHER ALABAMA NEWSPAPER HEADLINES. ♪ ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ ♪
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, TRUMP BURNED. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES DESUS AND MERO AND MUSICAL GUEST VIC MENSA VIRGINIA BEACHING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HOW ARE YA? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, EVERYBODY! PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S MONDAY, WHICH IS A ROUGH DAY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU THINK YOU HAD A BAD DAY, AT LEAST IT WASN'T AS BAD AS THE WEATHER CHANNEL'S CAMERAMAN WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO COVER THE DEMOLITION OF THE GEORGIA DOME.
BUS! YOU'RE IN THE WAY! BUS! GET OUT OF THE WAY BUS! UGH! WHAT THE-- (BLEEP) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH!
Stephen: I GOTTA TELL YA, THIS IS GOING TO RUIN THE WEATHER CHANNEL'S REPUTATION AS THE PLACE TO WATCH BUILDINGS EXPLODE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I JUST WANT TO SAY, CAN A BUS DRIVE IN FRONT OF 2017? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OR JUST PARK IN FRONT OF CHARLIE ROSE? ( LAUGHTER ) MONDAY ALSO MEANS THAT IT'S TIME TO DIG THROUGH TRUMP'S WEEKEND TWEETS AND PICK OUT THE KERNELS OF CORN. FIRST UP, BASKETBALL. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT WHILE HE WAS IN CHINA, TRUMP ASKED CHINA'S PRESIDENT XI JINPING TO RELEASE THREE U.C.L.A. PLAYERS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING FROM A CHINESE MALL -- EASILY, THE MOST SCANDALOUS THING TO HAPPEN IN A MALL THAT DIDN'T INVOLVE ROY MOORE. BUT TRUMP COULDN'T RESIST -- ( APPLAUSE ) BUT TRUMP COULDN'T RESIST TWEETING, "DO YOU THINK THE THREE U.C.L.A. BASKETBALL PLAYERS WILL SAY THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP?" ( LAUGHTER ) IMAGINE THANKSGIVING AT THE TRUMP HOUSE: "LET'S GO AROUND THE TABLE AND ALL SAY WHAT WE'RE THANKFUL TO ME FOR. I'LL START." ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU, ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. THE PLAYERS DID THANK THE PRESIDENT, BUT, ON FRIDAY, ONE OF THEIR FATHERS, LAVAR BALL, SHOT BACK AT TRUMP. NOW, BALL HAS MADE A CAREER OUT OF BAITING PEOPLE TO GET PUBLICITY FOR HIS COMPANY, BIG BALLER BRAND-- WHICH IS A BASKETBALL LIFESTYLE BRAND AND NOT, AS I THOUGHT, A COMPANY THAT MAKES PANTS FOR MEN WITH HUSKY TESTICLES. ( LAUGHTER ) BIG AND TALL. SO WHEN ESPN ASKED HIM ABOUT TRUMP'S INVOLVEMENT IN GETTING HIS SON RELEASED, BALL REPLIED, "WHO?" ( LAUGHTER ) OUCH! PRETENDING NOT TO KNOW HIM IS THE MEANEST THING YOU CAN DO TO DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) KNOWING WHO HE IS IS HIS WHOLE THING. THAT'S WHY HE PUTS HIS NAME ON ALL OF HIS BUILDINGS AND ONE OF HIS KIDS. WELL, SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND FAR ABOVE RESPONDING TO A PUBLICITY-HUNGRY TROLL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M JUST KIDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) PRESIDENT WHAT'S-HIS-NAME TOOK THE BAIT, TWEETING: "NOW THAT THE THREE BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE OUT OF CHINA AND SAVED FROM YEARS IN JAIL, LAVAR BALL, THE FATHER OF LIANGELO, IS UNACCEPTING OF WHAT I DID FOR HIS SON AND THAT SHOPLIFTING IS NO BIG DEAL. I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THEM IN JAIL!" ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) MR. TRUMP, MAYBE NOW'S NOT THE BEST TIME TO BE IMPLYING THAT SOMEONE'S KID SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR WHAT THEIR DAD DID. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: NOT THE RIGHT TIME.
Stephen: IN A DIFFERENT TWEET, TRUMP ANNOUNCED VICTORY OVER HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION -- 'CAUSE, LAST WEEK, U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SAID THEY WERE ENDING THE BAN ON IMPORTED ELEPHANT TROPHIES, EXPLAINING, "THE KILLING OF AFRICAN ELEPHANT TROPHY ANIMALS IN ZIMBABWE WILL ENHANCE THE SURVIVAL OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT." RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE EARTHWORMS. YOU CHOP AN ELEPHANT IN HALF, BOTH SIDES WRIGGLE AWAY --BOOM! TWO NEW ELEPHANTS. THIS GOT A LOT OF BACKLASH, WHAT WITH ELEPHANTS BEING "ENDANGERED" AND "LOVED." WELL, NO ONE BLASTED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION HARDER THAN DONALD TRUMP: "BIG-GAME TROPHY DECISION WILL BE ANNOUNCED NEXT WEEK BUT WILL BE VERY HARD PRESSED TO CHANGE MY MIND THAT THIS HORROR SHOW IN ANY WAY HELPS CONSERVATION OF ELEPHANTS OR ANY OTHER ANIMAL." ARE WE SUPPOSED TO THANK TRUMP FOR NOT DOING A TERRIBLE THING THAT NOBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT UNTIL HIS ADMINISTRATION WAS GOING TO DO IT? ( LAUGHTER ) "I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT I WILL NOT BE SETTING FIRE TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. ( LAUGHTER ) WOULD IT KILL YOU TO THANK ME?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING -- SIR, IF HUNTING ELEPHANTS AND OTHER ANIMALS IS A "HORROR SHOW," THEN YOUR SONS ARE FREDDIE KRUEGER. AGAIN, IT'S GOING TO BE AN UNCOMFORTABLE THANKSGIVING AT THE TRUMP HOUSEHOLD. "DAD, YOU SAID I COULD HAVE ONE EXECUTIVE ACTION FOR CHRISTMAS. THIS SUCKS! I'M GOING TO GO STAB A DOLPHIN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WANT TO BE CLEAR -- I HAVE NO PROOF THEY STABBED DOLPHINS. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP ALSO TOOK A SHOT AT ARIZONA SENATOR AND NUMBER FOUR REALTOR IN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA, JEFF FLAKE. FLAKE WAS CAUGHT ON CAMERA DISSING HIS OWN PARTY.
IF WE BECOME THE PARTY OF ROY MOORE AND DONALD TRUMP, WE ARE TOAST.
STEPHEN: SENATOR FLAKE, THAT'S A LITTLE TOO HARD ON TOAST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MAY I REMIND YOU, SIR -- TOAST DOESN'T CRUISE THE MALL LOOKING FOR DOUGH THAT HASN'T RISEN YET. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: FINE, FINE. TRUMP THEN FIRED BACK. "SENATOR JEF JEFF FLAKE-Y." IF THAT'S HOW THIS IS STARTING, I DON'T THINK I CAN GET THROUGH THIS ONE. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN "FLAKE-Y." SENATOR DANDRUFF. FLAKE NEWS. SENATOR FLAKE AN ORGASM. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S TOO FAR? WE FOUND THE LINE? ( LAUGHTER ) WE FOUND THE LINE? IT'S IMPLYING THAT A SITTING UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM ARIZONA WOULD FAKE AN ORGASM? HE GOES ON. "WHO IS UNELECTABLE IN THE GREAT STATE OF ARIZONA-- QUIT RACE, ANEMIC POLLS-- WAS CAUGHT-- PURPOSELY-- ON MIKE." ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, I'M GOING TO STOP THERE AGAIN. EITHER HE MISSPELLED THE ABBREVIATION FOR MICROPHONE OR -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- OR HE'S IMPLYING THAT SENATOR FLAKE WAS CAUGHT "ON MIKE," WHICH DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING VICE PRESIDENT PENCE WOULD BE INTO, BUT, IF SO, GOOD FOR YOU. LIVE YOUR BEST LIFE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO YOU LOVE IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS. TRUMP IS NOT DONE TALKING ABOUT FLAKE-Y. "SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT." ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT? FLAKE SAID SOMETHING BAD ABOUT GROVER CLEVELAND? HE'S OUR ONLY NON-CONSECUTIVE TWO-TERM PRESIDENT. ( CHEERING ) YEAH, THANK YOU. YOU GOT A CLEVELAND HEAD IN THE HOUSE? THERE'S MORE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO READ IT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW ONE SUBJECT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T TWEET ABOUT? ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE AND OLDEST TRICK-OR-TREATER ON THE BLOCK, ROY MOORE. SEVERAL WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED MOORE OF MOLESTING THEM WHEN THEY WERE AS YOUNG AS 14. THIS WEEKEND, ALL THE MAJOR ALABAMA NEWSPAPERS ENDORSED HIS OPPONENT, BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO OVERLOOK THE ALLEGATIONS. LIKE ONE ALABAMA PASTOR WHO CALLED THE MOORE CONTROVERSY A "WAR ON MEN" BECAUSE "MORE WOMEN ARE SEXUAL PREDATORS THAN MEN. WOMEN ARE CHASING YOUNG BOYS UP AND DOWN THE ROAD, BUT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT P.C." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) SIR, WHERE ARE THESE ROADS THAT WOMEN ARE CHASING THE BOYS UP AND DOWN? ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERING ) ( PIANO RIFF ) DRIVING IN ALABAMA SOUNDS REALLY DANGEROUS. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S ALSO BIG NEWS FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER, WHERE AUSTRALIANS HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF ALLOWING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES! GOOD FOR YOU, MIKE! VERY EXCITING NEWS! VERY EXCITING. FINALLY, AUSTRALIAN LESBIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THOSE SACRED WORDS: "THAT'S NOT A WIFE. 'THIS' IS A WIFE." ( LAUGHTER ) ONE OPPONENT OF THE GAY MARRIAGE VOTE WAS AUSTRALIAN HOUSE MEMBER AND WORLD'S WORST PHARRELL IMPERSONATOR, BOB KATTER. NOW THAT THE VOTE IS OVER, HE'S READY TO MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS. I WANT TO WARN YOU, THE CLIP YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE CONTAINS SCENES OF EXTREME AUSTRALIAN-NESS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, LET THERE BE A THOUSAND BLOSSOMS BLOOM, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. BUT I AIN'T SPENDING ANY TIME ON IT BECAUSE, IN THE MEANTIME, EVERY THREE MONTHS, A PERSON IS TORN TO PIECES BY A CROCODILE IN NORTH QUEENSLAND!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( SCREECHING )
STEPHEN: WHOA, THAT WAS AN ABRUPT LEFT TURN! ( LAUGHTER ) I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR KATTER WEIGH IN ON GAY ADOPTIONS. "I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THE JOY AND LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN. I SAY, LIVE AND LET LIVE. BUT WHO CARES? BECAUSE, IN THE MEANTIME, EVERY FIVE MINUTES GANGS OF KANGAROOS AND DINGOES ARE CHEWING YOUR GRANDPA'S FACE OFF." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN IS HERE. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE! THAT'S THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON, ONLY GOT A FEW MORE DAYS BEFORE THANKSGIVING. DID YOU HAVE A NICE WEEKEND?
I HAD A GREAT WEEKEND. I SAW YOU ON TV.
OH, YEAH, I DID THE HBO BENEFIT, THE UNITED TOO MANY STARS BENEFIT -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- TO HELP THOSE AUTISTIC PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES, AN I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE TO SAY, IF YOU GUYS SAW IT, IT WENT ON ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE BENEFIT SATURDAY NIGHT ON HBO TO BE INTERVIEWED BY A WONDERFUL YOUNG WOMAN NAMED CARLY FLEISHMANN WHO INTERVIEWS PEOPLE USING A DEVICE THAT TURNS HER WRITTEN QUESTIONS INTO SPEECH BECAUSE SHE HAS COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS, AND I SAW THE QUESTIONS, THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY, SHE'S AN INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT PERSON WHO IS A VERY GOOD INTERVIEWER, IF YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THE VOID OWES SHE HAS ONLINE, AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT INTERVIEWED BY HER, BUT SHE WAS DISTRACTED NOT BY HER AUTISM BUT BY HER O.C.D., AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, I WANT TO HAVE THAT INTERVIEW BY HER. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CARLY ON THIS SHOW TO INTERVIEW ME BEFORE CHRISTMAS. I HOPE YOU CAN MAKE IT, KARLY. THIS IS YOUR FORMAL INVITATION. PLEASE COME ON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FIRST FEMALER? FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND THE MOST PERSISTENT. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WE COULD JUST DO THIS ALL NIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING BACK HERE. THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER WAS MAYBE JULY OR SOMETHING OF 2016?
IS THAT RIGHT?
Stephen: IT WAS OVER A YEAR AGO.
HAS IT BEEN A WHILE? DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ON.
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.
Stephen: YEAH. HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN PRESIDENT NOW?
Stephen: 45 YEARS. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
Stephen: IF MY BONE DENSITY IS ANY INDICATION.
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY WERE DOG YEARS, NOW THEY'RE TRUMP YEARS. IT'S GOING TO BE HARD. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: USUALLY THE PRESIDENCY AGES HIM. WE'RE THE ONES GETTING OLDER VERY QUICKLY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING -- SOMETIMES THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU AND THE PRESIDENT AGREE. THERE ARE SOME RARE THINGS YOU GUYS AGREE ON.
WOW.
Stephen: FOR INSTANCE, JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE TWEETED THIS, HE SAID:  POCAHONTAS JUST STATED THAT THE DEMOCRATS LED BY THE LEGENDARY CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON RIGGED THE PRIMARIES. LET'S GO F.B.I. AN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THAT MUST HAVE FELT GOOD, THE PRESIDENT AND YOU AGREED ON SOMETHING, BECAUSE JAKE TAPPER DID ASK YOU IN AN INTERVIEW DO YOU THINK THE PRIMARIES WERE RIGGED AND YOU SAID YES!
SO LET'S DO BOTH HALVES. THE FIRST HALF, DONALD TRUMP THINKS IF HE'S GOING TO START EVERY ONE OFFTHESE TWEETS TO ME WITH SOME KIND OF RACIST SLUR HERE THAT HE'S GOING TO SHUT ME UP. IT DIDN'T WORK IN THE PAST, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK IN THE FUTURE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FAIR ENOUGH. NOT GONNA WORK! NOT GONNA WORK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO LET'S GET INTO THE SECOND HALF OF WHAT HE'S SAYING. JAKE TAPPER ASKED YOU IF YOU THOUGHT THE PRIMARIES HAD BEEN RIGGED AND YOU SAID YES. WOULD YOU LAKE TO --
LET'S CLARIFY. WE HAVE A PROBLEM AT THE D.N.C. AND NEW HEAD OF THE D.N.C. I SAID, YEAH, THERE ARE SOME THINGS -- WHO SAID THERE ARE THINGS WRONG AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A THUMB ON THE SCALE AT THE D.N.C. AND HE IS GOING TO PUT IN NEW RULES TO MAKE SURE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE PEOPLE SO WE CAN FIGHT FORWARD ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING A WEEK AGO TUESDAY WHEN DEMOCRATS WON ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: SO THE ELECTION 2018 MIDTERMS ARE LESS THAN A YEAR AWAY.
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M UP FOR REELECTION.
Stephen: YOU'RE UP FOR REELECTION? AR( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ARE THE PEOPLE BACK HOME AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE IF P THEY ARE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CAMPAIGN.
I SURE HOPE. SO I'M OUT THERE.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT 2020? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL HERE. I GET THE POINT ABOUT TRUMP YEARS AND WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW, BUT WE'VE GOT FIGHTS IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW. WE CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME OF EVERY FOUR YEARS WE'RE GOING TO GET FOCUSED AND ACTIVE IN POLITICS. RIGHT NOW -- RIGHT NOW -- I MEAN, LIKE, THIS PAST WEEK AND THE WEEK COMING UP, WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT ON TAXES WHERE THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH A TAX BILL THAT HAS A TRILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS IN GIVE WASTE FOR GIANT CORPORATIONS, FOR BILLIONAIRES, AND I WANT TO PAY FOR IT BY HAVING WORKING FAMILIES' TAXES INCREASED. EVERYBODY UNDER $75,000. AND HERE'S HOW I SEE THIS, THIS ISN'T ABOUT NUMBERS BUT VAL YIEWSSMENTS I DON'T BELIEVE ONE MIDDLE CLASS PERSON IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE HER TAXES RAISED IN ORDER TO DO TAX GIVE WASTE TO BILLIONAIRES. THAT'S -- GIVE AWAYS TO BILLIONAIRES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO GET A HUGE TAX CUT FOR CRMS. WHY CAN'T IT A HUGE TAX CUT FOR DEMOCRATS?
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACTUALLY READ IT. IT IS A TRILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS IN CUTS.
Stephen: DON'T MAKE ME READ TAX POLICY. ( LAUGHTER )
FOR GIANT CORPORATIONS.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE TRICKLE-DOWN THEORY? I MEAN, COHN HAS SAID THIS IS TRICKLE DOWN, THAT YOUOU GIVE TH MONEY TO THE TOP OF THE FINANCIAL PERMID DR. LET ME -- PYRAMID -- LET ME FINISH BEFORE YOU TEAR IT APART -- THAT THERE IS A BUCKET AT THE TOP OF THE FINANCIAL PYRAMID OF AMERICA AND IF WE FILL THE BUCKET, EVENTUALLY IT WOULD DRIBBLE DOWN TO THE REST OF AMERICA. THIS IDEA HAS BEEN SOLD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT LEAST THREE TIMES IN MY ADULT LIFETIME. WHY CAN'T HE JUST SELL IT AGAIN?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO. FINK YOU LOOK AT THE SHOTS OF HIM RIGHT AFTER HE SAID IT'S TRICK TOWN AGAIN, HE SAID IS ANYBODY BUYING THIS? BECAUSE WE HAVE THE DATA, TRICKLE DOWN DOESN'T WORK. WE HELP THE RICH GET RICHER, THE RICH GET RICHER.
Stephen: THE THEORY IS THE RICH TIP PEOPLE MORE. THAT IS LITERALLY THE THEORY. ( LAUGHTER )
HERE'S THE DEAL, WE ACTUALLY HAVE RECORDED THE C.E.O.s OF THESE BIG CORPORATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAVE BEEN DOING THEIR QUARTERLY CALL REPORTS WHERE THEY TALK TO THE ANALYSTS ON WALL STREET AND SAY BUY OUR STOCK BECAUSE WE'RE DOING A GREAT JOB AND HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING, AND THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT, SO, IF YOU GET A TAX BREAK, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT? AND THEY SAY, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE BACK  A LOT OF IT IN DIVIDENDS OR STOCK BUYBACKS TO PUMP UP THE PRICE. THEY DON'T SAY WE'RE GOING TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE, WE'RE GOING TO INVEST MORE HERE IN AMERICA. THEY SAY, WE'RE GOING TO MAXIMIZE OUR RETURNS TO OUR WEALTHIEST SHAREHOLDERS. ETTES OUT THERE AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IT. WE GOT INTO A FIGHT OVER HEALTHCARE WHERE REPUBLICANS SAID IT'S JUST FINE TO KNOCK 25 MILLION OFF THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, THAT THAT WAS JUST REALLY COOL WITH THEM. ONE POLITICAL PARTY, DEMOCRATS, SAID NO, HEALTHCARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT AND WE FIGHT FOR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DO THAT. NOW, THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES OPEN THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE TO STOP THE REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY WERE READY TO ROLL BACK HEALTHCARE. BUT WHAT WE DID DO IS WE GOT PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY ENGAGED IN THE FIGHT. WE GOT DEMOCRATS AROUND THE COUNTRY, BUT LET'S BE BLUNT, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, LIBERTARIANS AROUND THE COUNTRY, VEGETARIANS AROUND THE COUNTRY -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- WE HAD EVERYBODY, AND PEOPLE GOT OUT THERE AND SAID, I BELIEVE HEALTHCARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT, GOT IN THE FIGHT AND WE SAVED HEALTHCARE FOR 25 MILLION AMERICANS. DEMOCRACY DID THIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, I THINK, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, I HEARD THE STATISTIC TODAY SOME POLLS ARE SHOWING ONLY ABOUT 25% OF RESPONDENTS IN POLLS LIKE THIS TAX BILL AND THAT 52% OF AMERICANS STRONGLY OPPOSE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: WHICH IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY FOR PEOPLE TO BE PAYING THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SUBSTANCE AS OPPOSED TO THE MESSAGING OF A TAX BILL. BUT DO YOU AGREE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE WITH OUR TAXES? BECAUSE OUR TAXES ARE TOO COMPLICATED. PEOPLE DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR TAXES ON A POSTCARD. THAT IS WHAT THE REPUBLICANS PROMISE. WHAT YOU COULD DO TO ACHIEVE THAT END?
IF THE REPUBLICANS STARTED OUT AND SAID LET'S DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE TAXES FARER FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, THEN I AM ALL IN. I WILL JUMP IN BOTH FEET, READY TO GO, I WILL BRING THE DONUTS AND WE CAN HAVE THE MEETING AND I'LL BRING DUNKIN'. IT WILL WORK, RIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THIS TAX PROPOSAL STARTED. THIS TAX PROPOSAL STARTED WITH THE DONORS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THEY HAVE BEEN REALLY BLUNT ABOUT THIS.
Stephen: THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THE TAX CUT OR YOU GUYS ARE OUT.
FOR RETURN ON INVESTMENT. AND WHAT THESE DONORS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE SAYING, EITHER YOU PRODUCE A TAX CUT RIGHT NOW THIS TIME, OR COME 2018 ELECTIONS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE SAME KIND OF DONATIONS THAT WE'VE GIVEN YOU IN THE PAST. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS TAX CUT STARTED AT THE TOP TO PAY OFF A HANDFUL OF BIG-TIME REPUBLICAN DONORS, AN OUR ONLY CHANCE TO FIGHT THIS THING BACK IS JUST LIKE IT WAS WITH HEALTHCARE, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY OUT THERE TWEETING AND POSTING AND PROTESTING, TAKING TO THE STREETS AND SAYING NO. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE ELIZABETH WARREN. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! WE'RE HERE WITH ELIZABETH WARREN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, SENATOR WARREN, LET ME ASK YOU THIS -- THERE IS A SERIES OF SEXUAL SCANDALS THAT HAVE CREATED A NEW NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT ABUSE OF POWER.
YEP.
Stephen: AL FRANKEN, A COMEDIAN I'VE LONG ADMIRED AND A POLITICIAN I'VE RECENTLY ADMIRED, HAS BEEN CAUGHT UP IN TWO ACCUSATIONS, ONE OF WHICH HE'S ACKNOWLEDGED AND APOLOGIZED FOR. PEOPLE ARE CALLING FOR AL FRANKEN TO STEP DOWN. DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD?
SO, LOOK, I WAS JUST ENORMOUSLY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS. I KNEW SENATOR FRANKEN LONG BEFORE HE WAS SENATOR FRANKEN AND HIS WIFE FRANNIE. THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE SERIOUS, AND WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND LISTENED TO ON THIS. AL IS GOING TO BE SUBJECTED TO A HEARING IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AN INVESTIGATION. WE HAVE HAD, FOR A LONG TIME NOW IN THE SENATE, LONG BEFORE I GOT THERE, A BIPARTISAN ETHICS COMMIT Y -- COMMITTEE THAT MEETS ON A REGULAR BASIS, AND HE'S GOING TO GO IN AND ANSWER. BUT HERE'S WHERE I SEE THIS WHOLE THING GOING RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING TO WATCH THIS PLAY OUT WITH FAMOUS MEN. IT'S HAPPENED IN LOTS OF PLACES, LOTS OF THEM ARE TALKED ABOUT, AND THIS IS A MOMENT IN AMERICA, AS I SEE IT, AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS IS A MOMENT THAT'S A BIG FLASH AND THEN NOTHING REALLY CHANGES, NOBODY FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE TO ANSWER, OR IS THIS A MOMENT WHEN THERE'S REAL CHANGE? AND I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW I THINK WE'RE GOING TO KNOW IT'S A MOMENT WHEN THERE'S REAL CHANGE, IT'S GOING TO BE WHEN THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FAMOUS PEOPLE, BUT IT'S MORE GOING TO BE WHEN THE SHIFT MANAGER DECIDES THAT MAYBE GIVING THE GOOD SHIFTS ONLY TO WOMEN WHO WILL PLAY SEX GAMES BACK IN THE DRESSING ROOM IS NOT A GOOD IDEA, AND WHEN THE JERK OVER IN ACCOUNTING DECIDES THAT PRESSING UP AGAINST WOMEN WHO ARE CAUGHT AT THE PHOTO COPYING MACHINE MIGHT NOT BE SMART, AND WHEN THE BOSS DECIDES THAT TELLING THOSE DIRTY JOKES AND TALKING ABOUT WHO'S GOT GREAT AND A KILLER ASS BETTER RE-THINK HIS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. WHEN THAT SORT OF THING HAPPENS FOR WOMEN ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, THEN WE'LL KNOW THERE'S BEEN REAL CHANGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE NICE.
THAT WOULD BE NICE.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE NICE. SO WE'VE GOT TO GO HERE IN A SECOND. QUICKLY, IT'S A BIG QUESTION, IF ROY MOORE WINS, SHOULD THE SENATE EXPEL HIM?
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
Stephen: WHERE ARE WE? WE ARE STILL PRE-ELECTION. I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD CANDIDATE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA NEED TO GET OUT THERE AN I HOPE THEY SUPPORT THAT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE.
Stephen: SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD TOO SEE YOU.
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LATE NIGHT HOST DESUS AND MERO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )

YEAH, IT'S KIND OF PLAYED OUT.
Stephen: YOU STARTED A PODCAST, AND THAT BECAME A LATE NIGHT SHOW ON VICELAND. HOW DID YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN? HOW DID YOU MAKE THE LEAP FROM PODCAST TO LATE NIGHT SHOW BECAUSE I THINK IT'S WHAT A LOT OF PODCASTERS WOULD LIKE TO DO. I FEEL EVERYONE WHO HAS A PODCAST EVENTUALLY GETS A LATE NIGHT SHOW.
WHEN WE STARTED, WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE DOING. WE USED TO ESCAPE FROM OUR JOBS TO RECORD IT. IN MANHATTAN, I WOULD COME IN A SUIT AND HE WOULD ABANDON SCHOOL KIDS.
I WAS A PARAPROFESSIONAL, WHICH IS LIKE BEING A TEACHER EXCEPT KAY WORSE. MY PARA IS IN THE BUILDING! YOU GET CONSTANTLY DISRESPECTED BY CHILDREN. YOU'RE NOT A REAL TEACHER! I WASN'T. ( LAUGHTER )

STEPHEN COLD CUTS. AKA CANADIAN BACON.
Stephen: YOUNG STEPHEN COLD CUTS AKA CANADIAN BACON! CANADIAN BECAUSE I'M SO DAMN PALE? I'M AMERICAN, NOT CANADIAN.
NO, YOU'RE CAY NEAND NOW. WE ALL WANT TO CLAIM CANADA.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF WANTING TO CLAIM CANADA, DONALD TRUMP, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TRUMP AND LATE NIGHT A LOT. DO YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT HIM?
HE SENT US A NICE BOUQUET OF TRUMP STEAKS AND RUSSIAN VODKA SO WE HAVE BEEN LAYING OFF OF HIM.

I SMOKE ON THE MEAT.
