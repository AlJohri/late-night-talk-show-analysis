FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY, EVERYBODY! WHAT'S GOING ON. HI, PAUL. HI, MATT, WHAT'S GOING ON. I LIKE IT. I LIKE YOUR JACKSON POLLOCK.
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: HEY, THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S VERY NICE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. YOU'RE TOO KIND. THANKS VERY MUCH. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. WELL TODAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TODAY, IT'S 13 DAYS AFTER HURRICANE MARIA, YET ANOTHER DISASTER STRUCK PUERTO RICO: DONALD TRUMP VISITED THE ISLAND. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BEFORE THE PRESIDENT LEFT FOR SANT JUAN, HE GAVE THIS OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF HIS ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS.
IN TEXAS AND IN FLORIDA, WE GET AN A-PLUS, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK WE'VE DONE JUST AS GOOD IN PUERTO RICO, AND IT'S ACTUALLY A MUCH TOUGHER SITUATION.
Stephen: YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GIVE YOURSELF AN A-PLUS, RIGHT? THAT'S-- THAT'S NOT HOW GRADES WORK. "I HAVE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB THIS SEMESTER. I'M SAYING ALL "A"s, WHICH IS WHY I AM SO PROUD THAT I JUST ADMITTED MYSELF TO HARVARD. I CAN'T-- I JUST-- I NEVER EVEN TOOK THE S.A.T.s. I NEVER TOOK THE S.A.T.s. DISPI JUST DECIDED I GOT A 1600 ON MY S.A.T.s. I JUST DID IT."
ONCE HE WAS THERE IN SAN JUAN, TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR HOW MUCH HE LOVES PUERTO RICO.
I'VE BEEN TO PUERTO RICO MANY TIMES, I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE KNOWN, AND I'VE ALWAYS LOVED IT. AND YOUR WEATHER IS SECOND TO NONE. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU GET HIT, AND YOU REALLY GOT HIT, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
Stephen: THAT IS TRUMP-SPLAINING AT ITS BEST. ( LAUGHTER ) "YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T NOTICE WITH ALL YOUR BEAUTIFUL WEATHER, BUT YOU GUYS GOT A HURRICANE. IT WAS A HUGE ONE, BELIEVE ME. YOU GUYS KNEW YOU WERE ON AN ISLAND, SURROUNDED BY SALTY WATER. BIG, WET, SALTY, DELICIOUS. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK IT. THAT'S JUST A LITTLE TIP." AND TRUMP ADDRESSED THE DEVASTATION THIS HURRICANE CAUSED... TO HIM.
I HATE TO TELL YOU, PUERTO RICO, BUT YOU'VE THROWN OUR BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF WHAT?
Stephen: WHAT! "THE BUDGET IS OUT OF WHAT?" IT'S LIKE A FIREMAN RESCUING YOU FROM A BURNING BUILDING THEN SAYING, "DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR WATER BILL IS GOING TO BE NOW? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY SEXY CALENDARS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SELL TO PAY FOR THIS?" TRUMP EVEN TOOK TIME TO MEET WITH VICTIMS OF THE HURRICANE. ALTHOUGH, HE COULD USE SOME HELP WITH THE SMALL TALK.
WE HAVE A GOOD HOUSE, THANK GOD.
IN THE MEANTIME, HERE YOU ARE.
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU OUT.
THANK YOU.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
Stephen: "HAVE A GOOD TIME." YOU'RE AT A DISASTER SITE, NOT WORKING THE FLOOR AT YOUR CASINO! "YOU HAVIN' FUN HERE? LISTEN, I'M GONNA COMP YOU A HALF A GALLON DRINKING WATER. ENJOY YOUR HURRICANE. DON'T FORGET TO TIP YOUR FEMA WORKER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, DONALD TRUMP-- ( APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, TRUMP DIDN'T JUST GO TO PUERTO RICO TO TALK. HE ALSO HANDED OUT MUCH-NEEDED SUPPLIES IN THE TRUMPIEST WAY POSSIBLE. "HERE YOU GO. BON APETIT FROM DOWNTOWN. YES, LET THEM EAT-- ONE MORE. LET THEM EAT PAPER TOWELS." AFTER THAT, HE WENT TO A HOSPITAL AND DISTRIBUTED ANTIBIOTICS WITH A T-SHIRT CANNON. "ALL RIGHT, WHO'S GOT A FEVER."
Jon: A LITTLE BIT CALLOUS.
Stephen: THEN, TRUMP ALSO PASSED OUT SOME FLASHLIGHTS, THOUGH HE WASN'T SURE WHY.
FLASHLIGHTS. YOU DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE! YOU DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE!
Stephen: "YOU DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE"? 95% OF THE ISLAND DOESN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY. "YOU DON'T NEED FLASHLIGHTS ANYMORE, BECAUSE ALL THESE NEWS CAMERAS FROM MY POETOOP ARE POINTED HERE AT ME AND I'M HERE FOR THE LONG HALL. GOTTA GO, BYE." TWO. AND TRUMP LEARNED A LESSON ABOUT WATER PURIFICATION TABLETS.
SO, WAIT, YOU PUT IT IN DIRTY WATER--
YEAH, AND THEN YOU CAN DRINK IT AFTER TEN TO TWELVE HOURS.
WOULD YOU DO IT? WOULD YOU DRINK IT?
SURE.
REALLY?
REALLY.
Stephen: YES. YES, SHE'D DRINK IT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WATER SHE HAS. JUST LIKE SHE'S ONLY TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PRESIDENT WE'VE GOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE! SHE WISHES THE PRESIDENT WASN'T SO DIRTY. AND TRUMP DID TAKE TIME TO THANK THE FIRST RESPONDERS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT TO SEE THE REAL COAST GUARD DURING THIS INCREDIBLE TROUBLE. AND ESPECIALLY, I THINK, HERE, AND IN TEXAS. WAS INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY DID. SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT, REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING ON BEHALF OF YOUR MEN AND WOMEN?
SIR, I'M REPRESENTING THE AIR FORCE.
NO, I KNOW THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: ON.
YE, NO, LOOK, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE THE AIRFARE FORCE. I ONLY SAID 'COAST GUARD' AND POINTED AT YOU BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT IS THE AIR BUT THE COAST OF THE SKY THAT YOU ARE GUARDING? WHO WANTS PAPER TOWELS? ANY? ANY WANT-- THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO." I DON'T THINK HE COULD-- I THINK I HAVE MORE VERTICAL THAN DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S ONE THING I CAN SAY. WHO WANTS SOME PAPER TOWELS?" OF COURSE, BACK ON THE MAINLAND, THE COUNTRY IS STILL REELING FROM THE SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS. THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE HAS BEEN FINE. HAS BEEN PRO FORMA. BUT I DO HAVE A BEEF WITH ONE THING THAT WAS SAID YESTERDAY BY WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHEN SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT TIGHTER GUN LAWS.
THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE FOR A POLITICAL DEBATE, BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO UNITE AS A COUNTRY. I THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE POLICY CONVERSATIONS, BUT TODAY IS NOT THAT DAY.
Stephen: HUH, WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?
THE WHOLE GUN-CONTROL THING, THIS IS NOT THE TIME AND PLACE TO BE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS GUN- CONTROL DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A DAY, PLACE, AND A TIME FOR ALL THAT.
LET'S WAIT AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION LATER.
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN A FEW DAYS. RIGHT NOW'S NOT THE TIME.
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION.
THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THIS.
IT'S JUST NOT THE TIME TO DIVE INTO THE POLITICS AND TRY TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS ON THIS TOPIC.
Stephen: THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT A GUN TRAGEDY IS NEVER THE RIGHT TIME TO TALK ABOUT STOPPING THE NEXT GUN TRAGEDY. IT'S LIKE YOUR ALCOHOLIC UNCLE WRAPPING HIS CAR AROUND A TREE AND GETTING OUT SAYING, "TODAY'S NOT THE DAY TO TALK ABOUT MY DRINKING! OKAY? I'M STILL DRUNK RIGHT NOW. HERE'S TO THE TREE! WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? WHO WANTS TO GO FOR A DRIVE?" BUT CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOMETHING-- KIND OF DISTURBING-- SPECIFICALLY NEW LEGISLATION TO MAKE SILENCERS EASIER TO BUY BECAUSE THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH GUN VIOLENCE-- THE NOISE. THE BILL IS CALLED "THE SPORTSMEN'S HERITAGE AND RECREATIONAL ENHANCEMENT ACT." "RECREATIONAL ENHANCEMENT ACT"? THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VIAGRA AD. THOUGH IF THESE GUYS WOULD JUST TAKE VIAGRA, THEY WOULDN'T NEED SO MANY GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'LL NOTICE-- ♪ ♪ ♪
Jon: YEAH, GET IT AWAY.
Stephen: YOU'LL NOTICE THAT A SPORTSMEN'S HERITAGE AND RECREATIONAL ENHANCEMENT SPELLS OUT THE "SHARE" ACT. HOW DISARMING. IT'S LIKE IF YOU NAMED A BILL WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MICHAEL WEATHERLY IS HERE. AND WHEN WE RETURN, MORE AWKWARD CELEBRITY TEEN PHOTOS. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE STAY HUMAN AND THE BAND RIGHT OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. AS I SAID JUST A MOMENT AGO, STANDING OVER THERE, THE PRESIDENT WAS IN PUERTO RICO FOR A LITTLE OVER FIVE HOURS TODAY, AND YET, SOMEHOW, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE, AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO HELP, OBVIOUSLY. AMERICANS ARE GOOD PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HELP OTHER AMERICANS. WELL, I GOT A PART-TIME GIG AS THE SPOKES-FACE FOR BEN & JERRY'S "AMERICONE DREAM." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. LOOK, I ATE THE WHOLE PINT. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. YOU CAN JUST SERVE THIS ONE AGAIN. I GIVE ALL OF MY PROCEEDS TO CHARITY EVERY YEAR WITH THE AMERICONE DREAM FUND. WELL, LAST WEEK, NICK KROLL WAS ON TO PLUG HIS NEW NETFLIX SERIES "BIG MOUTH" ABOUT THE AWKWARDNESS OF PUBERTY, AND HE ASKED ME AND OTHER CELEBRITIES TO PUT UP AWKWARD PHOTOS, LIKE THIS ONE OF ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. WITH THE HASHTAG #PUBERME. I SUGGESTED THAT THE AMERICONE DREAM FUND COULD DONATE $1,000 FOR EVERY CELEBRITY WHO DID THAT. I ISSUED THAT CHALLENGE LAST WEDNESDAY, AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT, UNLIKE MY FACIAL HAIR AT AGE 14, THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN COMING IN STRONG. WE GOT A NEW STACK OF PHOTOS HERE FOR TONIGHT. WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS FROM "VEEP." THIS IS A 13-YEAR-OLD VERSION OF MR. TONY HALE RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT IS-- NEVER SEEN HAD HIM WITH HAIR BEFORE. HE LOOKS LIKE HE JUST SAW THE VERY FIRST VICTORIA'S SECRET CATALOG. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. OH, THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE. SEE IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE WHO THIS IS. THAT IS SAM BEEAT AGE 13. YES. ( CHEERS A( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ISN'T THAT AMAZING? BOTH MEN AND WOMEN LOOK LIKE THIS IN CANADA AT AGE 13. HER FACE SAYS "TEEN," BUT HER HAIRCUT SAYS, "MOTHER OF TWO." ( LAUGHTER ) OH! YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS! WHO'S THAT? JACK BLACK. THERE HE IS! HERE HE IS AT 12. I THINK HE'S 12 RIGHT HERE BEING DEPICTED AS AN ADORABLE JAPANESE AIPA MAY CHARACTER. ONLY EXPLAINS THE EYES THAT BIG. THIS PERSON, THIS IS AMY SEDARIS, ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOTHING-- NOTHING AWKWARD ABOUT IT. COOND OF ADORABLE. I JUST LOVE HER SO MUCH. I HAVE TO SHOW THAT PHOTO. THIS IS-- THIS IS-- WHO IS THIS? WHO IS THIS? THIS IS-- WHO IS THIS? WHO IS THIS? OH, IT'S THOMAS MIDDLE ITCH FROM SILICON VALLEY. WOW, THAT'S AMAZING. HE'S-- HE ACTUALLY LOOKS MORE GAWKY AND ADOLESCENT NOW IN HIS 40s. HE'S THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS EVER "BENJAMIN BUTTONED" BACKWARDS INTO PUBERTY. WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? OH, THIS IS-- COME OYOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO THIS IS. WEIRD AL YANUKOVYCH RIGHT THERE. UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S THE ONLY PERSON ON EARTH WHO COULD MAKE A COCONUT AND BENDY-STRAW COMBO KIND OF COOL. HERE'S CUTIE PIE HIMSELF, BRAD WHITFORD RIGHT THERE. THIS IS BEFORE THE INVENTION OF THE COMB. HE WAS-- HE'S SEEN HER IN MID-MOLT. AND THIS IS-- THIS IS-- AS HE CALLS IT HIMSELF, THIS IS THE NUCLEAR OPTION, WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU. THIS IS THE NEUTRON BOMB OF BIEWB TEE PHOTOS. HERE'S OUR GOOD FRIEND, JOHN OLIVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS-- THIS IS, I THINK-- THIS WAS TAKEN RIGHT BEFORE HE DID A 30-MINUTE DEEP DIVE ABOUT WHY STEPHANIE SHOULD GO TO PROM WITH HIM. SO REMEMBER, IF YOU WANT TO HELP, GO TO oneamericaappeal.org. THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME. THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF NEED.
WAIT, STEVE, I'VE GOT ONE MORE PHOTO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NEIL, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ONE MORE PHOTO.
Stephen: PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. I--
I HEARD-- I HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NEIL, NEIL, YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THE DISCUSSION?
I HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING FOR EMBARRASSING CELEBRITY PUBERTY PHOTOS. I JUST HEARD. I JUST HEARD.
Stephen: WE RIT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE, NEIL.
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE WALKING BY-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: JUST WALKING THROUGH MANHATTAN.
JUST WALKING BY WITH ONE SUCH PHOTO OF ME MOUNTED ON CARDSTOCK JUST COINCIDENTALLY.
Stephen: WHAT CAMERA SHOULD HE SHOW IT TO?
Stephen: SHOW IT TO THIS ONE HERE--
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO--
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GOTTA SAY, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
13. I'M 13.
Stephen: YOU'RE 13 YEARS OLD!
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT IS PRIME PUBERTY RIGHT THERE.
I'M FEELING IT.
Stephen: THAT IS NEIL DE-PUBE TYSON RIGHT THERE. YOU HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF-- YOU LOOK SELF-POSSESSED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUR GAZE RIGHT THERE.
I WAS FEELING THE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH, NEIL. NEIL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: ALWAYS HAPPY TO HAVE YOU. REMEMBER, IF YOU WANT TO HELP, GO TO Oneamericaappeal.org. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MICHAEL WEATHERLY! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

HEY, THERE, MICHAEL WEATHERLY. THERE YOU GO! NICE TO SEE YOU! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S GOING ON? NO, NO, NO. YOU FIRST. YOU FIRST. AGE BEFORE BEAUTY.
YOU KNOW, I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. I JUST WANT TO-- IF I COULD, START WITH SOMETHING. SO-- AND I'M SO GLAD THAT WE GET THIS MOMENT BECAUSE I HAD --
Stephen: I ALWAYS HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH YOU. DON'T TOUCH MY CARDS. DON'T TOUCH MY CARDS.
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW THE DREAMS STARTED --
Stephen: DID YOU SAY YOU HAD A DREAM ABOUT ME?
YES.
Stephen: THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW. WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT TO TELL ME? CBS, CBS.
IT WAS IMPORTANT AND MY WIFE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT I TELL YOU.
Stephen: YOU TOLD YOUR WIFE ABOUT THIS DREAM.
SOME THINGS YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR WIFE AND IT'S THE KIND OF MARRIAGE WE HAVE.
Stephen: I WANT TO POINT OUT. I'M NOT YOUR WIFE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO WE-- I CAME-- IN MY DREAM I CAME ON YOUR SHOW.
Stephen: IN YOUR DREAM, YOU CAME, IN YOUR DREAM, ABOUT ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST-- THESE ARE JUST JOKES, FOLKS.
THESE ARE WET DREAM JOB S.
Stephen:  GO AHEAD, YEAH.
Stephen: I'M FLATTERED. FLATTERED, FRANKLY.
SO IN MY DREERNLG I'M SITTING HERE WITH YOU AND IT'S-- IT'S NOT GOING WELL. SO --
Stephen: NOT POSSIBLE. NOT POSSIBLE WITH A MICHAEL WEATHERLY!
NO, YOU'RE-- AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH ME. YOU'RE, LIKE, TRYING TO HELP ME.
Stephen: I'M STRUGGLING?
WITH ME. BECAUSE I'M A DISASTER. AND IN MY DREAM, YOU TURN TO THE AUDIENCE, AND YOU GO, "CAN WE JUST TAKE A BREAK?" ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN YOU TURN TO ME AND SAID, "SERVING OKAY?" AND I SAID, "WELL, I'M A LITTLE TIRED." AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I CAN TELL!" ( LAUGHTER ) SO YOU TOOK ME OFF TO THE CORNER, AND YOU SAID, "EXCUSE US." AND EVERYONE, YOU KNOW, SAID, "STEPHEN, THANK YOU." I WENT OVER THERE, AND WE TALKED ABOUT STUFF-- LIFE, MARRIAGE. YOU KNOW "HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING? GOT TO BALANCE THE WORK AND THE LIFE. GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF OR WHAT KIND OF FATHER ARE YOU GOING TO BE TO YOUR CHILDREN?" I SAID, "I FEEL BETTER, STEPHEN." YOU SAID LET'S GO DO THIS." WE DID THE INTERVIEW, AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. AND I WOKE UP AND I SAID, STEPHEN COLBERT JUST FIXED ME.
Stephen: WORK WOW.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: COME WITH ME? COME WOOW ME? CAN WE TAKE A BREAK. COME WITH ME FOR A SECOND. NO, NO, COME WITH ME. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. MICHAEL, IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ON A TALK SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK OVER THERE. ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M GOOD. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A FUNNY LITTLE BIT --
Stephen: SYSTEM T.S.A., IT IS, IT IS, BUT EVERYONE'S REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW? LAUGH.
I'M SO SORRY. SHOULD I FLINGS.
Stephen: NO, NEVER APOLOGIZE. THEY'RE LIKE PIRANHA. THEY'LL TURN ON YOU IN A MINUTE.
SO CONVEY CONFIDENCE.
Stephen: YOU'RE A FRAGILE CREATURE, YOU'RE IN SHOW BUSINESS, YOU'RE A LITTLE BOY, AND YOU NEED LOVE AT ALL TIMES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO HOW YOU BEEN? ( LAUGHTER ).
I'VE BEEN TERRIFIC, STEPHEN. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
Stephen: NOW, LISTEN YOU-- WERE YOU EVER IN PUBERTY?
YES. I-- I WENT THROUGH A JOHN DENVER SORT OF PHASE THAT JUST ENDED, REALLY.
Stephen: IS THIS YOU?
THAT IS ME. I BORROWED JOHN OLIVER'S GLASSES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT IS REALLY SEX, MAN.
I GOT THE BIEBER, JOHN DENVER --
Stephen: DOROTHY HAMILL.
THERE'S ACTUALLY-- THERE'S ACTUALLY-- THERE'S PICTURES OF HILLARY CLINTON THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE THIS, ACTUALLY, WHEN SHE WAS AT YALE.
Stephen: OH, YES, YES, I'VE SEEN THOSE PHOTOS. I'VE SEEN THOSE PHOTOS
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SHOOTING FOR. VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE HILLARY FANS IN '83, BUT I WAS ONE OF THOSE.
Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD FIRST-YEAR LAW STUDENT THERE. I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOUR DAD SOLD-- I WOULD LOVE THIS. IF I WAS A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY-- YOUR DAD SOLD SWISS ARMY KNIVES.
YES, THAT IS TRUE. MY FATHER OF AN IMPORTER OF SWISS ARMY KNIFE FROM 1973 ABOUT TO THE LATE 80s.
Stephen: THAT'S WHEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE. THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE AND THAT WAS IT. YOU HAD TO GET IT FROM SWITZERLAND.
IT WAS ORIGINAL.
Stephen: I HAVE A SWISS ARMY KNIFE HERE AND THIS IS ONE OF THE DELUXE ONES. THIS HAS THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT SOME OF THE RARER VERSIONS, THE TOOLS ON A SWISS ARMY KNIFE ARE. PLEASE DON'T HURT YOURSELF. WE'RE NOT INSURED FOR THIS.
THIS ONE IS SUPER GOOD. IT'S A SAW. THAT WILL SAW THROUGH ANYTHING, THAT WILL JUST --
Stephen: THIS ONE?
OPEN IT THAT WAY.
Stephen: THERE'S THE SAW.
WE'LL DO THE-- WHERE IS THE PICTURE OF ME. YOU CAN SAW THAT IN HALF. HERE I'LL HOLD THIS SIDE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
AND NOW I CAN BE ME. SO THAT'S A SAW.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND SO ACTUALLY, WHEN I WAS IN THE FIFTH GRADE, MY FATHER WAS EXPLAINING TO ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAYING COST FOR SOMETHING AND WHOLESALE AND THEN RETAIL. AND SO I CAUGHT ON TO THIS IDEA THAT I COULD ACTUALLY GET THAT KNIFE WHICH WAS RETAILING FOR, LIKE $50 FOR $7. I ASKED DAD IF I COULD GET A FEW. AND THEN WHAT I DID WAS I BROUGHT THEM TO SCHOOL AND I STARTED SELLING THEM. AND THEY WERE MOVING LIKE HOT CAKE S.
Stephen:  YOU'RE TALK SWISS ARMY BLACK MARKET.
EVIDENCE ADDING 10%%.
Stephen: $7 AND YOU WERE CHARGING $7.70.
I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
Stephen: TWO CANDY BARS.
TRAVEL TIME, SCHOOL BUS. I WAS PUTTING IN A LOT OF HOURS.
Stephen: MR. HUBER, NOT PUBER-- ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD NOT HUMOR HIM AT ALL. MR. HUBER CAUGHT ME AND BROUGHT ME UP TO THE HEADMASTER'S OFFICE AND I HAD AT THAT POINT A DUFFEL BAG WITH ABOUT 50 KNIVES IN IT --
Stephen: YOU, THEY WOULD PUT YOU IN JAIL NOW.
YES, YES, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE 70s. AND THE HEADMASTER, MR. STERNS, LOOKED AT ME VERY STERNLY, AS HEADMASTERS SHOULD HAVE THOSE NAMES, AND HE SAID, "THIS IS VERY WRONG AND NORMALLY YOU WOULD BE HEAVILY PUNISHED." AND I SAID, "I'M SORRY." AND HE SAID, "OKAY. I NEED 10 CHAMPIONS, AND IF YOU COULD GET MY SEVEN FISHERMEN" --
Stephen: WOW, HEADMASTER ON THE MAKE YOU.
Stephen:  HAVE "BULL" SEASON TWO. OKAY. SEASON TWO OF "BULL." THE PEOPLE ARE LOVING THE BULL. AFTER 13 SEASONS OF "NCIS," WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR DRAMA ON THE PLANET. YOU CAN'T, LIKE, WALK DOWN THE STREET IN TAIPEI, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU'RE FAMOUS EVERYWHERE. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE ANOTHER HIT ON YOUR HANDS?
IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO DO BULL. AND THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT BULL IS HE'S CHANGED A LITTLE BIT IN SEASON TWO, AND HE HAS A LITTLE MORE FLIM-FLAM IN HIS GLAM. AND I'M-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHAT BULL DOES. THEY MAY NOT KNOW.
BULL IS LIKE A TRIAL SCIENTIST, WHICH MEANS THAT HE GOES INTO THE COURTROOM AND HE'S TRYING TO WIN THE CASE FUR BY READING WHAT THE JURY MIGHT BE THINKING.
Stephen: HELPING YOU PUT TOGETHER THE PROPER JURY FOR YOURSELF AND HOW TO--
BUT HE'S WORKING A LOT OF AIPGLES YOU WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE GLENN GORDON CAMERON, AND & HE HAS TAKEN THE REINS AND MOVED IT IN A TOTALLY INSANE DIRECTION WHICH I AM DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH. IT'S A FAST-PACED, REALLY ENERGETIC, QUASI-COMEDY, WHERE WE GO TO COURT.
Stephen: AND DO YOU-- DOES BULL ALWAYS HELP INNOCENT PEOPLE OR DOES HE SOMETIMES GET GOD GLT PEOPLE OFF THE HOOK AND WE JUST DON'T CARE ANYMORE AS A NATION? ( LAUGHTER ) NO, NO. HE'S-- IT MATTERS TO BULL WHETHER OR NOT-- WHETHER OR NOT GOOD IS BEING SERVED.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS INNOCENT. ARE THESE PEOPLE INNOCENT?
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU DO THE WRONG THING FOR THE RIGHT GLAENS ANSWER THE QUESTION, SENATOR. ( LAUGHTER ).
I'M JUST SAYING --
Stephen: ARE THE PEOPLE ALWAYS INNOCENT, BULL.
I'LL GIVE YOU A FOR INSTANCE. I'LL GIVE YOU A FOR INSTANCE. LET'S SAY-- I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A FOR INSTANCE, IT WILL TAKE TOO LONG. I'LL TELL THU --
Stephen: THE ANSWER IS, NO, THEY'RE NOT INNOCENT. I'LL GIVE YOU THE ANSWER. IT WON'T TAKE LONG AT ALL.
IT'S, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME GRAY AREAS. YOU CAN SPELL GRAY WITH AN "E" OR AN "A."
Stephen: TRUE.
EVEN GRAY IS A GRAY AREA.
Stephen: GUILTY! ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE A CLIP. WE HAVE A CLIP WHERE BULL IS DOING HIS BULL.
HE IS. HE'S GRAY.
Stephen: HE'S BULLING IT UP AND WHAT IS BULL DOING IN THIS CLIP? WITH WHOM IS HE BULLYING.
HE IS TALKING TO A KID WHOSE GIRLFRIEND HAD GLIOBLASTOMA, IT WAS TERMINAL.
Stephen: IT'S GETTING FUNNIER
AND HE ASSISTED IN HER TAKING HER OWN LIFE AND IS NOW BEING-- BUT IT WAS HER IDEA AND SHE DID ALL THE STUFF. HE WAS JUST AN ACCESSORY.
Stephen: THAT'S SOME DARK STUFF, MICHAEL WEATHERLY.
YES, BUT HE'S BEING ACCUSED OF MURDER AND, OF COURSE, HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO HELP HER.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
IS HE "DR. DEATH" OR A KID IN LOVE WITH A GIRL WHO'S GONE.
Stephen: JIM.
LOOK AT ME. DID I SAY, "GAME OVER? DID I SAY WE WERE DEFEATED? THEY MAY HAVE MORE POINT ON THE BOARD, BUT THE GAME IS FAR FROM OVER.
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
YOU DON'T GET A NAME LIKE "BULL" BECAUSE YOU GIVE UP BEFORE THE GAME IS OVER.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT'S YOUR NAME. YOU WERE BORN WITH THAT.
MAYBE I WAS. MAYBE I WASN'T. ( APPLAUSE ).
IT'S A GRAY AREA!
Stephen: FOR THE RECORD, FOR THE RECORD, YOUR CHARACTER'S NAME IS "DR. JASON BULL."
WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
Stephen: YES, WE DO!
OKAY.
Stephen: WELL, MICHAEL WEATHERLY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
A PLEASURE.
Stephen: ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR DREAMS. PLEASE SHARE THEM MORE THE NEXT TIME. MAKE THEM SPICY NEXT TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. "BULL" AIRS TUESDAYS AT 9:00 ON CBS. THAT'S MICHAEL WEATHERLY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH NATASHA LEGERRO. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HI! HIGHWAY ARE YOU? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS A STAND-UP COMEDIAN WHO CURRENTLY STARS ON "DICE." PLEASE WELCOME NATASHA LEGGERO! HELLO! COME UP HERE. HERE YOU GO!

Stephen: HI.
HI.
Stephen: NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK ON?
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. SOMETHING IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER.
JUST YOUR WAY OF TELLING ME I LOOK FAT?
Stephen: "GLOWING" IS THE WORD I WAS LOOKING FOR.
NO, I AM PREGNANT, THANK YOU.
Stephen: OH, CONGRATULATIONS.  ( APPLAUSE ) CONGRATULATIONS.
BUT, THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT I'VE GAINED, I'M NOT REALLY IN THE GLOWING STAGE. I'M KIND OF IN THE "WHAT'S NATASHA SAD ABOUT STAGE? HAS SHE BEEN EATING TOO MANY BURRITOS?"
Stephen: I DISAGREE. I THINK YOU LOOK LOVELY.
OH, THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
I FEEL GROSS.
Stephen: IS THIS YOUR FIRST CHILD?
IT IS MY FIRST AND MY LAST.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL GROSS, YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.
NO, NO.
Stephen: THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF FEARS AND APPREHENSIONS ABOUT THIS, TOO, LIKE YOUR BODY CHANGING.
YEAH, IT SUCKS.
Stephen: YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NO MATTER WHAT YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THEY GO, "THAT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL."
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: MY EYEBALLS ARE BLEEDING AND THERE'S HAIR ON MY CHEST.
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS.
Stephen: BECAUSE I AM THE FATHER OF THREE CHILDREN.
WHY DOES THE WIFE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING.
Stephen: I'M SORRY? I'M SORRY? I'M SORRY.  ( APPLAUSE ) HOW-- HAS THIS CHANGED-- HAS THIS CHANGED-- FOR SOME PEOPLE-- NOT EVERYBODY, I REALIZE-- BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE IT CHANGES WHAT THEY WANT TO EAT, WHAT THEY WANT TO DRINK. ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
I'VE HAD REALLY BAD CRAVINGS FOR DRUGS. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO BE SOBER. YOU KNOW?
Stephen: NO. NO.
LIKE --
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT THEN I WAS THINKING, I WAS THINKING, STEPHEN, WHAT IF I HAD, LIKE, A LITTLE TOAK, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, MAYBE THE KID WILL HAVE A FEW GLITCHES, BUT THE BAR'S BEEN SET SO LOW, IT COULD STILL GROW UP AND BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ARE OF AMERICA!
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. ♪ ♪ ♪ I WOULD LOVE IT!
LITERALLY, ANYBODY CAN BECOME PRESIDENT. WHAT AN INTERESTING TIME WE'RE LIVING IN.
Stephen: YES, WHAT AN INTERESTING FORM OF HOPE. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, YOU'RE-- YOUR HUSBAND, WAS A FRIEND OF THE SHOW. HAS BEEN ON SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU. HE'S A COMEDIAN. YOU'RE A COMEDIAN. IS IT SORT OF PREDETERMINED THAT YOUR CHILD WILL BE A COMEDIENNE, OR DO YOU HAVE HIGHER ASPIRATIONS? ( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, PEOPLE IN YOUR FAMILY YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE MORE OF? I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF AFRAID OF MY GENE S.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU KNOW, LIKE, THE PEOPLE I'M RELATED TO WHAT, IF IT COMES OUT LIKE ONE OF THEM.
Stephen: LIKE UNCLE-- LIKE UNCLE PHIL OR SOMETHING? IS THERE-- DO YOU WANT TO NAME SOME NAMES?
YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA. EQUAL WL, YOU KNOW, LIKE MY BROTHER LIFLTZ IN A VAN THAT HE PUT AN ADDRESS ON.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU PUT AN ADDRESS ON A VAN?
YOU PULL IT UP TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A HOUSE AND PUT A SIGN UP WITH A HALF-SIGN OF THEIR ADDRESS.
Stephen: NO WAY. THAT'S POSSIBLE?
HE DID IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I KNOW HOW I'M SPENDING MY RETIREMENT.
MY AUNT, SHE HAS TO BORROW HER DAUGHTER'S CAR BECAUSE HERS HAS A BREATHALYZER ATTACHED TO IT.
Stephen: OH, YOU HAVE TO BLOW ON IT BEFORE THE CAR WILL GO.
YEAH, THE STATE PUT IT ON YOUR KERR HAPPEN YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR FAMILY LIKE THAT?
Stephen: YEAH, BUT THEY WATCH THE SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M GOING TO SEE THEM EVENTUALLY. AND I'M JOKING, OBVIOUSLY. THERE ARE NONE. YOU TOURED WITH YOUR HUSBAND THIS SUMMER. THAT IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE WITH MY WIFE. YOU ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND GIGGED WITH HIM.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT LIKE TO BE STUCK IN THE VAN WITH YOUR LOVED ONE?
IT WAS FUN. I MEAN, ONE PROBLEM IS HE WAS CONSTANTLY ON HIS PHONE. LIKE, HE WAS CONSTANTLY TEXTING AND DRIVING. I ALREADY KNOW THAT'S HOW HE'S GOING TO DIE. I'VE WRITTEN HIS OBITUARY-- HE DIED DOING WHAT HE LOVED ARGUING WITH AN OUT-OF-STATE STRANGER ON FACEBOOK. SO SAD. HE GETS INTO THESE ARGUMENTS ON FACEBOOK.
Stephen: DID YOU PRY THE WHEEL AWAY FROM HIM AT ANY POINT GIMEAN, WHAT CAN YOU DO? LIKE, IS YOUR WIFE ALWAYS ON THE PHONE, OR ARE YOU GUYS NOT LIKE THAT?
Stephen: NO, MY WIFE IS PERFECT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE'S WATCHING THE SHOW. PERFECT IN EVERY WAY! SHE'S ALSO-- SHE'S ALSO CRUEL AND SEXY. THOSE ARE THE ADJECTIVES.
OH, OKAY, THAT'S NICE.
Stephen: IS SHE PREFERS, SHE PREFERS. I THINK SO.
HE'LL DO THIS THING, WE'RE DRIVING IN THE CAR-- HE'LL BE DRIVING, IT'S HIS CAR, HIS PHONE WILL RING, I'M SITTING IN THE PASSENGER STREET HE ANSWERS IT ON BLUETOOTH, THIS IS HOW HE SWOORS JUST SO YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ON SPEAKER! JUST SO YOU KNOW! NATASHA IS IN THE CAR." ARE YOUR FRIENDS CALLING YOU UP, "YOUR WIFE IS A BITCH. 9/11 IS AN INSIDE JOB. ABORTION SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. BRO." GIRLS DON'T DO THAT.
Stephen: YOU DON'T WARN THAT SOMEBODY IS IN THE CAR WITH YOU?
NOT LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT LIKE AN AMBER ALERT. ( LAUGHTER ) ARE.
Stephen: KEEP IT-- KEEP IT LIGHT, NATASHA. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING THIS PUBER-ME CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.
YES.
Stephen: TO RAISE MONEY FOR PUERTO RICO. IT TURNS OUT YOU WENT THROUGH PUBERTY.
YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN GLAMOROUS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I HAVE PROOF NOT ONLY DID YOU GO THROUGH PUBERTY, BUT THERE YOU GO. YOU COULD TUNE IN RADIO MOSCOW.  ( APPLAUSE ).
I MEAN --
Stephen: THAT IS ADORABLE!
WHAT IS THAT? I USED TO HAVE TO SLEEP WITH THEY'VE NIGHT.
Stephen: THAT'S THE MAN TRYING TO KEEP YOUR SMILE DOWN RIGHT THERE. THAT'S-- YOU WERE BLOND WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER?
MY MOM HAD ME GET A PERM AND HIGHLIGHTS. I DON'T KNOW. SHE SAID MY HAIR WAS TOO FINE. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: IT'S ADORABLE. HOW OLD ARE YOU RIGHT HERE?
THERE I'M 32.
Stephen: OH, VERY LATE-ONSET. VERY LATE HAD-ONSET. NOW YOU'RE IN SEASON TWO OF "DICE" A SERIES WITH ANDREW DICE CLAY.
YES.
Stephen: WE HAD DICE ON HERE.
HE'S AN INSANE PERSON.
Stephen: HE CAME ON, LIKE, A MONTH AGO, AND I'VE BEEN IN COMEDY FOR 30 YEARS. HE SHOCKED ME, STUFF WE COULDN'T-- WE COULDN'T EVEN BLEEP IT. WE HAD TO JUST LIFT IT OUT OF THE SHOW IT WAS TOO DIRTY.
HE IS SO ACCIDENTALLY FUNNY AND PURPOSEFULLY FUNNY. I WENT INTO A RITE-AID WITH HIM. HE STOLE A BUNCH OF CANDY AND HE COMES OUT OF THE RITE-AID AND TAKES ALL THE CANDY OUT OF HIS POCKET AND I SAID, "DO YOU NEED TO BORROW $5?" AND HE SAID, "IT TASTES BETTER WHEN IT'S FREE." WHO THINKS LIKE THAT?
Stephen: DO YOU YOUR FAMILY, YOUR PARENTS, GRANDPARENTS, IF THEY'RE STILL WITH US, DO THEY WATCH YOU ON THE "DICE" SHOW?
I TEXTED MY MOM RECENTLY TO ASK HER IF SHE WAS WATCHING. DO WE HAVE OUR TEXT CHANGE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I LOVE THE IDEA OF A LIBRARIAN --
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR MOM? YOUR MOM GETS HER TV FROM THE LIBRARY?
SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE, BUT SHE DOES GET MOST OF HER MEDIA FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WOW.
IN ILLINOIS.
Stephen: WOW. ( APPLAUSE ) YES, WHY NOT. THEY'LL ALL BE GONE, SOON.
Stephen: WHERE IN ILLINOIS?
ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS.
Stephen: LOVELY, CHEAP TRICK IS FROM THERE. THAT'S THE ONLY THING I KNOW ABOUT THEM.
