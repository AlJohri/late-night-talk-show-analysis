THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF A LOT OF THINGS, SUCH AS BEING MASTERFUL AT DIVERSION. AND WHILE HE HAS BEEN IN NEW JERSEY, PERHAPS THIS WAS-- OH, JUST SPONTANEOUS? OR PERHAPS THIS WAS PART OF A PLAN. BUT THERE WAS A WEDDING TAKING PLACE AT HIS GOLF CLUB, AND HE SHOWED UP.
I'M TOBIRKS--
AS, I'M HENRY'S BEST MAN. I AM THE ONE WHO GOT HIM IN ALL THAT TROUBLE. I'M JUST GOING TO TELL A COUPLE OF CRAZY STORIES ABOUT THIS GUY AND HOPEFULLY WHEN I GET DONE, SUSAN WILL STILL WANT TO BE MARRIED TO HIM. WOW, AS YOU GUYS ALL KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HERE TONIGHT. AND HE'S ACTUALLY REWRITTEN MY BEST MAN SPEECH. AWESOME! OKAY, HERE WE GO. HENRY HERE SEEMS LIKE A GREAT GUY, ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO JAMES COMEY, WHO IS A LIAR AND A LEAKER AND A NUT JOB. I HOPE YOU HAVE A HAPPY MARRIAGE. KEEP IN MIND I SAID "HOPE." HOPE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE FORCED TO HAVE A HAPPY MARRIAGE. YOU COULD HAVE A ROTTEN MARRIAGE. THE POINT IS I HOPE IT'S HAPPY. AND ALL THE LEGAL SCHOLARS AGREE, THAT HOPE WON'T HOLD UP AT AN IMPEACHMENT HEARING. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS SEEMS LIKE A NICE CROWD. BUT MY INAUGURATION CROWD WAS MUCH, MUCH BIGGER. THE PICTURES WERE DECEPTIVE. NOW, D.J., PLAY THAT SONG I TOLD YOU TO!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ICE CUBE. MARC MARON. AND MUSICAL GUEST JASON ISBELL AND THE 400 UNIT. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HOW ARE YOU? THAT'S VERY NICE. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE TOO KIND. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY NICE. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY HERE IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, THE BIG CITY OF DREAMS, BUT THERE IS A MASSIVE HEAT WAVE OUT WEST. TODAY, IN LAS VEGAS, THE FORECAST WAS A RECORD 117-- WORN 17-- ALSO THE AVERAGE AGE OF PEOPLE AT THE NICKEL SLOTS. AND TODAY, TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO REACH 127 DEGREES IN DEATH VALLEY. BUT, BUT, IT'S A DRY DEATH. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S SO HOT, IT'S SO HOT, THAT THE CARTOON SUN FROM THE WEATHER REPORTS IS STAYING HOME IN THE AIR CONDITIONING. THE TEMPERATURE IN PARIS, FRANCE, TODAY IS A RECORD 36 DEGREES CELSIUS, WHICH IS... HOT? I DON'T KNOW. IS IT HOT? I'M BEING TOLD IT'S HOT. IT'S ALMOST 100 DEGREES IN REAL TEMPERATURE. IN FACT, I THINK WE HAVE FOOTAGE OF AN AVERAGE PARISIAN TODAY. THE TEMPERATURE IS SO HIGH IN PHOENIX,  ARIZONA, THAT FLIGHTS ARE BEING CANCELLED BECAUSE IT'S TOO HOT FOR PLANES, BECAUSE AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES, THE AIR HAS A LOWER DENSITY, WHICH REDUCES HOW MUCH LIFT IS GENERATED. SCIENTISTS FIRST REALIZED THIS WAS A PROBLEM WHEN THEY SAW BIRDS TAKING THE BUS NORTH FOR SUMMER. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ADORABLE. THAT'S KIND OF ADORABLE. FORGET RISING SEA LEVELS AND DROUGHTS. THIS COULD BE THE DISASTER THAT FINALLY CONVINCES SKEPTICS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL: A LAYOVER IN PHOENIX. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHO'S REALLY FEELING THE HEAT?
Jon: WHO THAT?
Stephen: MR. SEAN SPICER. SPICY. HE'S FEELING THE SPICY HEAT. AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS BRIEFING, NOT ONLY DIDN'T SPICER NOT ALLOW CAMERAS. HE ALSO PROHIBITED AUDIO RECORDINGS. IT'S A BIG CHANGE FROM HIS USUAL PRESS BRIEFINGS, WHERE ONLY INFORMATION IS PROHIBITED. YES. SHHH! NO, NO, NO, NO. LOVELY, LOVELY PEOPLE.  ( APPLAUSE ) LOVELY PEOPLE. THEN WHEN ASKED WHY JOURNALISTS COULD NOT RECORD THE BRIEFING, SPICER SAID, "THERE ARE DAYS WHERE WE DECIDE THAT THE PRESIDENT'S VOICE SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO SPEAKS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION." YOUR WHOLE JOB IS SPEAKING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION! ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S LIKE CHEF BOYARDEE WHEN WE DECIDE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE THEIR OWN CANNED RAVIOLI." NOW, WHEN A REPORTER THEN TEXTED STEVE BANNON TO ASK WHY THE BRIEFINGS WERE OFF CAMERA, BANNON RESPONDED, "SEAN GOT FATTER." OH! OH! ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) OW! THAT IS A LOW BLOW FROM A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S EITHER GOT THE MEAT SWEATS OR IS SWEATY MEAT. AND INTRODUCING A CONE OF SILENCE ISN'T THE ONLY CHANGE TO WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS, BECAUSE IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT SEAN SPICER MAY BE OUT AS PRESS SECRETARY. WHAT? WHY? WHEN? SEAN, I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS! IF YOU GO, WHO WILL NOT ANSWER THEM? ( LAUGHTER ) LAUZ.  ( CHEERS ) THEY LOVE YOU! LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE! SEAN! SEAN! SEAN! SEAN!
Audience: SEAN! SEAN! SEAN!
Stephen: SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO MISS? LAUGH AND, SUPPOSEDLY, SPICER ISN'T ACTUALLY BEING FIRED. HE'S BEING PROMOTED TO WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, WHICH MEANS HE'S "LEADING A SEARCH FOR HIS OWN REPLACEMENT." OKAY, LET'S SEE HOW THAT GOES. "BILL, I SEE YOU'RE APPLYING FOR THE JOB OF WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. WHY DO YOU WANT THE JOB?" "I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT." "YOU'RE HIRED! ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) REPORTEDLY, REPORTEDLY SEAN SPIEWSER HAS REACHED OUT TO A SHORT LIST CANDIDATES, INCLUDING FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR LAURA INGRAHAM AND "DAILY MAIL" EDITOR DAVID MARTOSKO. AND BOTH ARE EXCELLENT CHOICES BECAUSE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE JOB BY REPORTERS, INGRAHAM DECLINED TO COMMENT, AND IN A PHONE CALL, MARTOSKO SAID "I CAN'T HEAR YOU," AND THEN HUNG UP. YES. "I CAN'T HEAR YOU!" THEN CLICK. THEN, WHEN ASKED TO COMMENT IN PERSON, MARTOSKO SAID, "I CAN'T SEE YOU," AND RAN INTO TRAFFIC. ( LAUGHTER ) HELLO! ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THIS MORNING, LAURA INGRAHAM DID TALK TO THE FRIENDLY FRIENDS AT "FOX & FRIENDS," AND SHE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE JOB DIDN'T EXCITE HER.
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE ROLE THAT I WOULD PICK FOR MYSELF. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LEGAL BACKGROUND.
Stephen: WELL, IF YOU HAVE A LEGAL BACKGROUND, YOU'D BE PERFECT! ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ASKED WHEN JARED WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN FACT, THERE MAY NOT BE JUST ONE REPLACEMENT BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, THE WHITE HOUSE WAS CONSIDERING ROTATING A CAST OF PEOPLE AT THE PODIUM, "IN PART TO PREVENT THE PRESIDENT FROM GROWING BORED OR ANGRY WITH HIS PRESS SECRETARY." "LOOK, I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU IF YOU'RE OUT OF MY SIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES. BECASUE I LACK OBJECT PERMANENCE." ( LAUGHTER ) ED" WHERE THE BALL GO? THE BALL WENT BEHIND THE COUCH. THE BALL IS GONE!"
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: "YOU EVER PLAY THAT PEEKABOO GAME? IT'S TERRIFYING." EARLIER TODAY, SPICER HELD A BRIEFING THAT WAS RECORDED AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY HE'S SO SCARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.
I THINK THE BRIEFING IS ONE ASPECT OF WHAT WE DO. WE'RE HERE REALLY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND REALLY LATE AT NIGHT, AVAILABLE TO ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
Stephen: YES, LATE AT NIGHT HE'LL ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ON "SPICER AFTER DARK." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ THAT IS AMAZING. WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON? OH, THIS ISN'T FOR A LITTLE WHILE, BUT THE 2018 MIDTERMS ARE STILL ONE AND A HALF "SEXY FIREMEN CALENDARS AWAY. BUT WE WON'T HAVE TO WAIT THAT LONG TO SEE HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING-- TODAY, IT'S STAYED. BECAUSE TODAY, GEORGIA HELD A SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION BETWEEN DEMOCRAT EX-BOYFRIEND YOUR MOM KEEPS ASKING ABOUT, JON OSSOFF AND REPUBLICAN AND GROWN-UP AMERICAN GIRL DOLL, KAREN HANDEL. NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL, WE TAPED THIS EARLIER, SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO ONE. THE POLLS ARE STILL OPEN. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE. LAST YEAR, IF YOU'D SAID YOU THOUGHT A DEMOCRAT COULD WIN IN GEORGIA, YOU'D BE LYING YOUR OSSOFF. BUT WITH AN UNPOPULAR DONALD TRUMP, IT COULD ALL COME DOWN TO THE BLACK VOTE. SO WITH THE RACE COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE, BOTH SIDES TRIED TO REACH OUT TO THE DISTRICT'S AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND THE CONSERVATIVE SUPER PAC "GREAT AMERICAN ALLIANCE" BEGAN AIRING A RADIO AD, WHICH THEY ALSO POSTED AS A POORLY PRODUCED TWITTER VIDEO.
HI, MY NAME IS AUTRY PRUITT, A FELLOW BLACK AMERICAN WORKING HARD EVERY DAY, JUST LIKE YOU. DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS HAVE STARTED COMING AROUND AGAIN. WE NORMALLY ONLY SEE THEM EVERY OTHER NOVEMBER SWARMING AROUND AND MAKING PROMISES TO GET OUR VOTE. BUT NOTHING EVER CHANGES FOR US, DOES IT? HERE'S WHAT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT.
PLANTATION POLITICS:  BLACK PEOPLE IN THE WORST JOBS, THE WORST HOUSING, POLICE BRUTALITY RAMPANT. BUT WHEN THE SO-CALLED BLACK COMMITTEEMEN CAME AROUND ELECTION TIME, WE'D ALL LINE UP AND VOTE THE STRAIGHT DEMOCRATIC TICKET. SELL OUR SOULS FOR A CHRISTMAS TURKEY.
LET'S NOT SELL OUT FOR ANOTHER CHRISTMAS TURKEY.
Stephen: WOW. THAT IS SOME PRETTY DAMNING AUDIO OF BALM. IT SOUNDS LIKE HE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE DEMOCRATS. OR TURKEYS. AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, DO BLACK PEOPLE GET TURKEYS WHEN THEY VOTE? ALL I GOT FOR VOTING WAS A STUPID STICKER. WHERE'S MY TURKEY, OBAMA? BUT HERE'S THE THING: THAT QUOTE CAME FROM THE AUDIOBOOK OF OBAMA'S MEMOIR, "DREAMS FROM MY FATHER." NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH TRUMP'S MEMOIR "CASH FROM MY DAD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND IN HIS BOOK, OBAMA WASN'T SAYING THOSE HARSH WORDS HIMSELF. HE WAS MERELY QUOTING A BARBER TELLING HIM ABOUT CHICAGO POLITICS BEFORE THE EARLY 1980s. IT WAS TAKEN WAY OUT OF CONTEXT. BESIDES, BARBERS SAID ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS IN THE EARLY 80s, LIKE, "TRUST ME, STEPHEN, THE LADIES ARE GONNA LOVE THE MULLET." PARTY IN THE FRONT AND PARTY IN THE BACK. IT WAS ALL PARTY BACK THEN. BUT, APPARENTLY, IT'S FAIR GAME TO USE A PRESIDENT'S AUDIO OUT OF CONTEXT IN AN ATTACK AD. SO WE AT "THE LATE SHOW"" CAN OBTAINED THIS EXCLUSIVE-- WE USED OUR POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, OUR DEEP POLITICAL OPERATIVE CONNECTIONS, FOR A LOOK AT THE GEORGIA RESPONSE.
HI, I'M A HARDWORKING ATTACK AD NARRATOR JUST LIKE YOU. REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN COMING AROUND AGAIN, BUT LISTEN TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO SAY ABOUT REPUBLICANS.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS GONE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. WE ARE LED BY VERY, VERY STUPID PEOPLE.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO JOBS, PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS REPUBLICANS ARE THE WRONG CHOICE.
I'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER UNDER THE DEMOCRATS THAN THE REPUBLICANS.
AND WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I HAVE A VERY GOOD BRAIN, AND I'VE SAID A LOT OF THINGS. I'M REALLY RICH. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
EXACTLY. SO THIS ELECTION DAY LET'S NOT SELL OUR SOULS FOR ANOTHER 4th OF JULY MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CHOCK LATE CAKE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.
HOW STUPID ARE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA?
Stephen: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ICE CUBE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I HAVE THE LATEST PROCLAMATIONS FROM A BIG, FURRY HAT. STICK AROUND ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, AS A LATE NIGHT HOST I WIELD TREMENDOUS POWER. ALMOST AS MUCH AS HISTORY'S MOST RUTHLESS TYRANTS, LIKE GENGHIS KHAN, VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND ADELE. WE HAVE BUT ONE THING IN COMMON: WE ALL HAVE GRAMMYS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WE ALL WEAR A BIG FURRY HAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MINE HEAD, ALL PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. FROM NOW ON, IF I CLICK "FORGOT MY PASSWORD," THE WEBSITE WILL JUST TELL ME WHAT MY DAMN PASSWORD IS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S ME. I PROMISE. HENCEFORTH, DAYLIGHT SAVING HAPPENS EVERY TIME I WANT AN EXTRA HOUR OF SLEEP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHICH IS EVERY DAY. IF I HAVE TO TAKE OFF MY SHOES WHEN I ENTER YOUR HOUSE, THEN I GET TO PICK WHAT YOU TO TAKE OFF WHEN YOU ENTER MINE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS MOMENT ON, IF AMAZON'S ALEXA IS ALWAYS LISTENING TO ME, THEN SHE MUST START LAUGHING AT MY JOKES. ( LAUGHTER ) I DECREE THAT PEOPLE NAMED GREG AND PEOPLE NAMED CRAIG MUST ENGAGE IN MORTAL COMBAT TO DETERMINE WHICH NAME SURVIVES. BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED BOTH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FROM NOW ON, ALL SCHOOLCHILDREN MUST NOT ONLY REMM-- I DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE. THE HAT HAS SPOKEN. I WILL NOT SAY THAT ONE NOW! NO, I WILL NOT SAY THAT ONE NOW. OKAY, I'LL SAY IT. I FORGIVE YOU. FROM NOW ON, ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN MUST NOT ONLY RECITE "THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE," BUT ALSO ALEC BALDWIN'S "PUT THAT COFFEE DOWN" SPEECH FROM "GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW AND FOREVER MORE, IT IS NOT PRONOUNCED "SHERBERT" OR "SHER-BET." IT IS PRONOUNCED "BAD ICE CREAM." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I HEREBY DECLARE THAT THEME WEDDINGS ARE BANNED THROUGHOUT THE LAND. I REFUSE TO FLY HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO WATCH THE FLASH MARRY A PREGNANT CATWOMAN. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS SUMMER'S SEXIEST LOOK IS ARMPIT SWEAT STAINS. UNTIL THE FALL, WHEN THE SEXIEST LOOK WILL BE FLAKY SKIN FROM INDOOR HEATING. ( LAUGHTER ) PEOPLE WHO SAY SOMETHING IS "AMAZEBALLS" SHALL GET KICKED IN THE "AMAZEBALLS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND LET IT BE KNOWN, ANYONE WHO PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS "ALT RIGHT" WILL NOW BE KNOWN SIMPLY AS "WRONG." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! NO! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ICE CUBE. COME BACK TO ME, HAT! COME BACK! ( BAND PLAYING) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS A RAPPER WHO'S SOLD OVER 10 MILLION ALBUMS AND AN ACTOR WITH THE BEST SCOWL IN THE BUSINESS. PLEASE WELCOME ICE CUBE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ I LIKE THE SHIRT. I LIKE THE SHIRT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MAN! THIS IS SWEET!
Stephen: IT IS.
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN CHURCH!
Stephen: IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A CHURCH, DOESN'T IT?

Stephen: NICE TO HAVE YOU ON. NICE TO MEET YOU.
OH, MAN, NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. YOU A FUNNY DUDE, MAN.

WE FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOU IN THE BOYS IN THE HOOD, THE BARBER SHOP, AND THE SEQUELS ARE WE THERE YET, AND THE SEQUELS, 21 JUMP STREET. IT LOOKS LIKE WHATEVER YOU DO, SOMEONE CAN BANK ON SOMEBODY WANTING TO SEE THAT AGAIN.
YEAH, MAN. I WON'T DO A MOVIE UNLESS THERE'S A SEQUEL. SO... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ARE THERE-- ARE THERE, LIKE, ACTION FIGURES OF YOU ANYWHERE? HAVE THEY EVER MADE TOYS OF ICE CUBE?
WHEN I DID TRIPLE LEX IN JAPAN, THEY HAD THE TOP OF A 7-ELEVEN CUP WAS, LIKE, ME SHOOTING A GUN. IT WAS CRAZY.
Stephen: WERE YOU AFRAID TO DRINK OUT OF THE NUZZLE?
IT WAS THE CREATIVITY THING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. IT'S THE CLOSEST I EVER GOT TO A TOY.
Stephen: THAT MUST BE CRAZY. WHEN YOU BECOME A BIG MOVIE STAR AND DOING THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PROMOTED AROUND THE WORLD, HAVE YOU EVER SHOWN UP TO A COUNTRY AND THOUGHT, "THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW WHO I AM," AND THERE'S A CROWD WAITING FOR YOU.
WITHOUT A DOUBT. IT'S A TRIP. WE DO CONCERTS ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND IT'S A TRIP GOING TO A COUNTRY WHERE THEY DON'T SPEAK GLRK BUT THEY KNOW EVERY CUSS WORD I SAY ON MY LYRICS.
Stephen: DO THEY KNOW IT'S A CUSS WORD, THOUGH?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY SAY IT WITH-- I THINK THEY DO, BECAUSE THEY SAY IT WITH A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE ONE OF THE BEST HANDLES, ICE CUBE. WHERE DID YOU GET THE NAME?
MY BROTHER GAVE ME THAT NAME. HE IS OLDER THAN ME. I USED TO TRY TO TALK TO HIS GIRLFRIENDS WHEN THEY CALLED. AND HE GOT TIRED-- BACK IN THE DAY, WHEN YOU HAD AN OLD REFRIGERATOR THEY WOULD PUSH IT ON THE CURB AND GUYS WOULD COME BY AND FIX IT UP. MY BROTHER WAS LIKE, "THAT REFRIGERATOR DOWN THE STREET, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU DOWN THERE, SLAM YOU IN THE FREEZER, AND WHEN THEY PULL YOU OUT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ICE CUBE THE OF THE.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT BAD ( APPLAUSE ).
SO THAT DAY, THAT DAY, WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE, I TOLD EVERYBODY MAN MY NEW NAME IS CUBE, CALL ME ICE CUBE, AND FROM THEN IT SNOWBALL GLD HOW OLD WERE YOU THEN?
THIRD GRADE NOW THE JOKE IS ON YOU, CLYDE. I'M MAKING MONEY WITH IT CLYDE, LOOK. WHO'S ICE CUBE NOW!

Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT.
YOU HAVE TO LEAN INTO IT NOW. YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH IT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MOST GUYS WHEN THEY DO A RAP NAME, GUYS LIKE YOURSELF, THEY'LL SAME, "MY NAME IS S.C.," OR SOMETHING REAL WEAK LIKE THAT. BUT I'M GOOD TO CALL YOU "DADDY COLBERT." "DADDY COLBERT" THAT'S DOAB.
Stephen: I'M A FATHER. I CAN LEAN DO THAT, DADDY COLBERT.
AND YOU REALLY WANT TO LEAN INTO IT, PIMP DADDY COLBERT.
Stephen: PIMP DADDY COBARE. THAT'S GREAT. CAN WE CHANGE MY NAME AT THE END OF THE CREDITS FROM NOW ON. I CAN BE PIMP DADDY COLBERT? I'M NOT SURE IF CBS IS GOING TO GO WITH THAT BUT I AM TOTALLY ON BOARD WITH THAT.
DON'T WORRY, CBS, THEY'LL GET IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BY THE WAY, YOU'RE ONE OF A COUPLE OF ICES OUT THERE IN THE HIP-HOP COMMUNITY. WHO WAS THE FIRST ICE, YOU OR T.?
OH, ICE T. YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE OF MY O.G.s. I LOOK UP TO ICE T.
Stephen: HE WAS FIRST?
HE WAS THE FIRST. HE WAS THE FIRST ICE. I CAN RESPECT THAT.
Stephen: IS THAT-- IS THAT YOUR WAY OF SAYING HE'S OLDER THAN YOU ARE?
NO, YOU SAID THAT! ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, ICE... ( LAUGHTER ) DADDY COLBERT... --
Stephen: PIMP DADDY! PIMP DADDY COLBERT! PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO LEAN INTO IT, MAN. YOU HAVE TO LEAN INTO IT.

Stephen: THERE ARE TWO ICE CUBES. NOW, LISTEN, THERE ARE TWO ICE CUBES OUT THERE. THERE'S THE SELF-DESCRIBED WEST COAST WARLORD. WE'VE GOT THIS FELLA RIGHT HERE, THE ICE CUBE, THIS A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW. THEN THERE'S THE "SESAME STREET" ICE CUBE.
YEAH.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. DO YOU EVER-- DO THESE GUYS EVER GET MIXED UP AND THE WRONG ONE SHOWS UP TO THE GIG?
NO, NOT AT ALL. I'M A GANGSTER THAT LOVES THE KIDS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, MAN? I LOVE KIDS.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOTHING AT ALL. NOTHING AT ALL. NOW, N.W.A. STARTED IN 1986?
YEAH, WE STARTED IN 1986.
Stephen: OKAY. AND LET'S JUST SAY THAT'S-- FOR PERS OF OUR SHOW, THAT'S NINJAS WITH ATTITUDE RIGHT NOW.
OKAY YOU.
Stephen:  HAD A MAJOR BREAKOUT SONG IN 1988, WHICH AGAIN FOR CBS' PURPOSES IS, "MAKE LOVE TO THE POLICE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
YEAH!
Stephen: "MAKE LOVE TO THE POLICE." ALL RIGHT?
YUP.
Stephen: AGAIN. NOW, IS IT-- HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT 30 YEARS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THAT SONG-- ALMOST 30 YEARS, 29 YEARS NOW-- THAT THE MESSAGE OF THAT SONG OR THE EMOTIONS BEHIND THAT SONG STILL HAVE RELEVANCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY?
I MEAN, IT'S SAD, THAT SONG IS STILL, YOU KNOW, A SONG THAT, YOU KNOW, HAS RELEVANCE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT I TRY TO DO IS UPDATE THE SONG. I HAVE A NEW SONG ON MY DEATH CERTIFICATE 25th ANNIVERSARY ALBUM --
Stephen: YOU'RE RE-RELEASING.
I'M RE-RELEASING MY SECOND ALBUM AND WE PUT THROUGH NEW SONGS. ONE IS CALLED "GOOD COP, BAD COP," CAN HAD IS PRETTY MUCH A PLEA TO THE GOOD COPS OUT THERE TO TURN IN THE BAD COPS AND GET THE BAD APPLES OUT OF BUNCH. I THINK THAT'S THE NEXT STEP IS REALLY GET --
Stephen: THAT'S A POSITIVE APPROACH.

NOBODY ASKED ME TO PLAY, THOUGH.
WAIT A MINUTE, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
Stephen: I TALKED TO BARKLEY ABOUT THAT. ME AND BARKLEY AND JON BATISTE DOWN THERE. JON WAS ON A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP HIGH SCHOOL TEAM. DID YOU KNOW THAT?
THAT RIGHT?
Jon: YEAH.
OKAY. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT THE SKILLS.
Stephen: HE'S STILL GOT IT, YEAH, YEAH. SO THESE PLAYERS WHY HALF COURT? THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE KNEES FOR FULL COURT ANYMORE?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THESE GUYS GOT OUT OF THE LEAGUE BECAUSE OF THE N.B.A. SCHEDULE, YOU KNOW. IT'S BACK-TO-BACKS. IT'S OVER 100 GAMES. YOU KNOW, THREE GAMES IN FOUR NIGHTS. SO YEAH, HALF COURT, WE FEEL LIKE THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW, CAN BE ALL-STARS AGAIN FOR SURE.
Stephen: COULD HELP ME OUT WITH SOMETHING? I WANT TO WORK ON MY-- MY SCOWL.
OKAY.
Stephen: AS I SAID BEFORE YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THE BEST SCOWLZ IN THE BUSINESS.
IF YOU'RE TAKING YOURS OFF, I'M TAKING MINE OFF, TOO.
Stephen: OKAY. IF I'M GOING TO BE PIMP DADDY COLBERT, OKAY, I NEED-- I NEED TO GET THE LOOK DOWN. YOU CAN GIVE ME-- WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO GET THIS?

WOW, I SHOULD HAVE-- I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY SUNGLASSES.
Stephen: YEAH, PRETTY NICE OUT HERE, ISN'T IT? BRIGHT. WE WERE JUST TALKING BACKSTAGE THAT WE GO WAY BACK, BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU IN YEARS.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, YEAH.
Stephen: FOR REASONS THAT NOBODY HERE WOULD POSSIBLY KNOW, WE KNOW EACH OTHER FROM 19-- DAMN-- 90... WHEN WAS IT? '93.
OOFS LIKE '94, I WAS HOSTING A SHOW ON COMEDY CENTRAL. I WAS HOSTING A CLIP SHOW CALLED "SHORT ATTENTION STAND THEATER."
Stephen: S.A.S.T. IT WAS ON 23rd SHOW, MY FIRST TV SHOW CALLED "EXIT 57."
AND THERE WERE A LURC BUNCH O YOU. YOU WERE ALL IN AN OFFICE HAVING A GREAT TIME. AND I WAS JUST IN THE NEXT OFFICE OVER BY MYSELF BROODING. LIKE, I'D HEAR YOU GUYS LIKE, "YAY! WE'RE GOING TO DO A SKETCH." AND I'D BE LIKE, "OH, GOD, MY LIFE SUCKS!"
Stephen: THAT WAS THE SOUND OF PANIC YOU WERE HEARING FROM OUR OFFICES. WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING.
IT SOUNDED SO FUN, THOUGH, STEPHEN. YOU WERE SO YOUNG AND FULL OF LIFE.
Stephen: WEREN'T WE ALL, THOUGH, WEREN'T WE ALL?
NO I WAS FILLED WITH HOSTILITY AND ANXIETY. YOU SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME AND I WANTED TO BE PART OF IT BUT YOU NEVER LET ME YOU.
Stephen:  NEVER ASKED.
I THINK I DID ASK. I SAID, "HEY, COME ON I WANT TO BE IN ON THE FUN THING." AND THEY WERE LIKE, "NO, TALK SHOW."
Stephen: BILL MAHR WAS THERE-- "POLITICALLY CORRECT" HIS OFFICE WAS NEXT TO MINE.
DID YOU EVER SEE HIM?
Stephen: HE WOULDN'T TALK TO ME.
I NEVER SAW HIM. I SAW PICTURES OF HIM. I THOUGHT HE WAS A GHOST. I KNEW THE SHOW TAPED THERE.
Stephen: I SAW HIM WALK DOWN THE HALL SOMETIMES. REMEMBER AIR AMERICA RADIO?
YES.
Stephen: YOUR OLD GIG. WHAT WAS THE NAME OF YOUR SHOW.
MORNING EDITION, FROM 6:00 IN THE MORNING TO 9:00 IN THE MORNING. I GOT UP AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING --
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND.
DID YOUR SHOW. I CAME ON A 6:00 A.M. SHOW.
IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM.
Stephen: THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME AT ALL.
YOU WERE BARELY YOURSELF.
Stephen: I HAD A GOOD TIME.
WE HAD FUN.
Stephen: DO YOU MISS TALKING ABOUT POLITICS? I STILL TALK ABOUT IT A BIT. BUT I'M AS SCARED AND ANGRY AS THE NEXT GUY. I'VE BECOME FRIGHTENED OF MY PHONE.
Stephen: WHY, WHY?
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NEWS BROWSER. YOU A NEWS BROWSER ON YOUR PHONE. AND YOU WAKE UP AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH WHAT DID HE DO WHILE I WAS SLEEPING!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THAT-- YOU HAVE THAT MOMENT LIKE, "I DO CHECK IT NOW? SHOULD I HAVE COFFEE FIRST? HOW IS THIS GOING TO GO?" YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD. THERE WON'T BE ANY POINT IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WHERE WE OPEN OUR NEWS BROWSER AND G, OH, EVERYTHING WORKED OUT!" IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! FOR A WHILE AT THE BEGINNING I COULD NOT IDENTIFY WHAT THAT FEELING WAS, THAT TERROR OF LOOKING AT THE NEWS ON MY PHONE. IT WAS VISCERAL. I COULD FEEL IT. AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY AKIN TO LIKE AN ABUSIVE STEPFATHER KICKING YOUR BEDROOM DOOR IN TO GO, " I'M BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN!" AND HE JUST LEAVES AND SHUTS THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE GOING, " I SHOULD LEAVE, RIGHT? SHOULD I LEAVE?"
Stephen: AND THE ONLY THING THAT CALMS YOU DOWN AT ALL IS, "I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS HOW TO WORK A MATCH." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE THING-- THE THING THAT'S TERRIFYING, THOUGH, IS ALL THE NEWS IS PRETTY HORRIBLE IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN MIND.
Stephen: SURE.
AND-- BECAUSE, I'M-- I'M LITERALLY, SOMETIMES I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- LIKE, I LITERALLY EVERY DAY GO, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NEXT. AND I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM KNOW EITHER BUT I THINK THEIR TONE IS DIFFERENT. I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NEXT." BUT I THINK THEY'RE LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NEXT, MAN! THIS IS CRAZY." YOU'RE LIKE, "WHY THE HELL DID YOU VOTE HIM HIM?" AND THEY'RE LIKE, "SHOULD THE HELL UP." AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S WHAT HE RAN ON, THAT'S WHAT HE RAN ON."
Stephen: I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR PODCAST "WTF." YOU STARTED THIS IN YOUR GARAGE, RIGHT?
YES, SIR. IT'S STILL IN MY GARAGE.
Stephen: REALLY.
YEAH, YEAH. LOOK WHERE YOU ENDED UP IN A NICE, BEAUTIFUL THEATER. I WORK OUT OF MY GARAGE. I HAVE A VERY SHORT COMMUTE TO WORK. LAW LAUG( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHEN HUOBAMA ON--
YES.
Stephen: IT WAS IN YOUR GARAGE?
YEAH HERE, CAME OVER.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT CAME INTO YOUR GARAGE?
IT WAS RIDICULOUS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED. I COULDN'T BELIEVE-- WHEN I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT, I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND MY PRODUCER BRENDON WAS LIKE, "NO, HE WANTS TO COME OVER." AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S CRAZY. I LIVE IN A TWO-BEDROOM HOUSE, ONE BATHROOM AIR, GARAGE. AND NOW THE PRESIDENT IS COMING OVER. IT'S NOT A CASUAL DROP-IN. I HAD TO ASK MY NEIGHBOR IF IT WAS OKAY IF WE PUT SNIPERS ON HIS ROOF. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THAT'S NICE.
HE'S RETIRED. HE WAS THRILLED. HE SAID, "THAT SOUNDS GREAT! SOMETHING'S HAPPENING."
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT A NEW NETFLIX SHOW CALLED GL SECOND SEASON.
THE GORGEOUS LADIES OF WRESTLING.
Stephen: WHEN I REMEMBER. THAT WAS A REAL THING. EXPLAIN WHO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO THE GLOW WERE.
IN THE 80s, THERE WAS A SHORT-LIVED TV SHOW RIDING ON THE COATTAILS ON THE WAVE OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING AND IT WAS ALL WOMEN AND IT WAS RAW AND INSANE.
Stephen: THEY WERE LADIES.
YEAH, OKAY FINE. AND THIS SHOW, THIS SHOW IS BASED ON THAT. IT'S A FICTIONALIZATION OF THAT SO IT'S NOT BASED ON THEIR ACTUAL LIVES. IT'S IN THE MID-80ss, ME AND 14 WOMEN ON A WRESTLING SHOW. I PLAY A DOWN-AND-OUT CRANKY, COCAINE-ADDLED, MANAGER-DIRECTOR-- WHICH WAS A STRETCH FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WELL, WHEN DOES IT TAKE PLACE, WHAT YEAR?
IN THE MID80.
WE'RE ABOUT THE SAME AGE. I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE IN '86. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR MEMORIES OF THE 80s TO THE SHOW?
SURE, I DO. I WENT TO COLLEGE AND THEN I WENT TO HOLLYWOOD BEFORE I ENDED UP BACK IN NEW YORK TO BE A COMEDIAN. AND I DID MY GRADUATE WORK IN COCAINE IN HOLLYWOOD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OH, WOW, WOW.
YEAH, IT WAS INTENSE. IT WAS AN INTENSE COURSE. IT WAS A YEAR.
Stephen: MASTER'S? Ph.D.?
IT ALL HAPPENS AT ONCE. WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING COCAINE, IT ALL COMES AND THEN-- AND THEN EVENTUALLY YOU'RE SICOT AND I CAN YOU HAVE TO LEAVE AND STOP. SO-- SO IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE DIANY DRUGS, ALMOST 20 YEARS CLEAN AND SOBER.  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE FUNNY THING WAS-- THANK YOU. ARE BUT HERE'S-- HERE'S WHERE IT PAID OFF. I GET CAST AS THIS GUY, AND HE-- YOU KNOW, HE'S A COCAINE GUY. AND I KNOW ABOUT COCAINE. SO THE WOMEN THAT CREATED THIS SHOW, LIKE, I HAD A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT THIS GUY BUT I WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT ONE THING. I WALKED UP TO THE WOMEN WHO WERE CREATORS, WHO WERE KIND OF NERDY WOMENS, THAT'S NOT AN INSULT. I WALKED UP TO THEM. I SAID THIS GUY IS EYE USE PERP HE DOESN'T SHARE HIS COKE. NO VIAL. HE KEEPS IT IN A SPINDLE FROM A CUT-OUT EXPHAGZ DOES IT WITH A PEN TOP AND A KEY AND THAT'S IT. AND THE TWO WOMEN LOOK AT ME AND CARROLL SAYS, "WE'RE SO GRAD YOU'RE HERE."
