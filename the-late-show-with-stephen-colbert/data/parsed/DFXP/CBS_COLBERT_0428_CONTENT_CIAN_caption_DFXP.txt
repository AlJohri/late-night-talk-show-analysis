TONIGHT, DAFTER AT THE DAY CARE, PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES JAKE TAPPER SHEMAR MOORE, AND MUSICAL GUEST KHALID. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON! WELCOME. WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU'RE VERY NICE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION, BUT INTERNAL STRIFE IS TEARING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY APART AT THE SEAMS. IT'S LIKE A NEW CIVIL WAR, ONLY NEITHER SIDE IS TRYING TO HELP BLACK PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE LATEST SHOTS FROM FORT TRUMPTER ARE AGAINST TENNESSEE SENATOR AND MAN SEEING HIS DAUGHTER'S NECK TATTOO FOR THE FIRST TIME, BOB CORKER. CORKER AND TRUMP HAVE BEEN FIGHTING, HEAD TO HEAD LIKE TWO RAMS, FOR A WHILE NOW. YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT CORKER CALLED THE WHITE HOUSE "AN ADULT DAY CARE CENTER." OKAY, CLEVER. NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE. WITH TRUMP, YOU ALSO NEED A NIGHT SHIFT. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ) GETS INTO THINGS. HE'S LIKE A RACCOON! HE'S LIKE A RACCOON! I DON'T KNOW IF RACCOONS DO THAT, BUT I'M GOING TO DO THAT. SO, I FIGURED IT WAS TIME TO GIVE THEM THEIR OWN SEGMENT, ON THIS SHOW, WHEN I WANTED TO CALL, "CORK A SOCK IN IT." BUT I HAVE A TEAM OF TALENTED COMEDY WRITERS, AND I KNEW WE COULD DO BETTER THAN THAT. SO WE ALL GATHERED IN A ROOM, PUT ON A POT OF COFFEE, AND BRAINSTORMED FOR HOURS. AND NOW, "LATE SHOW" VIEWERS, I PRESENT TO YOU OUR NEWEST SEGMENT... "CORK A SOCK IN IT!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TURNS OUT I GET TO DO WHATEVER I WANT. IT'S MY SHOW. THE LATEST FEUD BETWEEN THESE TWO STARTED BRIGHT AND EARLY TODAY WHEN CORKER WENT ON ALL THE MORNING SHOWS TO CRITICIZE DONALD TRUMP, AND TRUMP WAS WATCHING, BECAUSE HE IMMEDIATELY TWEETED: "BOB CORKER, WHO HELPED PRESIDENT O GIVE US THE BAD IRAN DEAL & COULDN'T GET ELECTED DOG CATCHER IN TENNESSEE, IS NOW FIGHTING TAX CUTS, DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT." "DOT, DOT, DOT, CORKER DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE IN TENNESS WHEN I REFUSED TO ENDORSE HIM, AND NOW IS ONLY NEGATIVE ON ANYTHING TRUMP. LOOK AT HIS RECORD!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) REALLY? REALLY? "TENNESS?" ( LAUGHTER ) QUICK TIP: WHEN YOU'RE RIPPING A POLITICIAN IT HELPS TO SPELL THE NAME OF THEIR STATE RIGHT. "I DON'T LIKE JOE 'HAUNTED' MANCHIN. HE WILL NEVER GET RE-ELECTED BY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF WEST VAGINA." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME RING. IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO SPELL IT RIGHT!
Stephen: ♪ ALMOST HEAVEN WEST VAGINA ♪ THAT'S REALLY HARD TO SING. 2 WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT THOUGH. I BET THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT. WE MISS YOU. NOW, SOME OF WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT CORKER WAS NOT TRUE. SPECIFICALLY, ALL OF IT. AND CORKER POINTED THAT OUT: "SAME UNTRUTHS FROM AN UTTERLY UNTRUTHFUL PRESIDENT. #ALERTTHEDAYCARESTAFF." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: YEAH. THEN TRUMP IMMEDIATELY TWEETED BACK, "ISN'T IT SAD THAT LIGHTWEIGHT SENATOR BOB CORKER, WHO COULDN'T GET RE-ELECTED IN THE GREAT STATE OF TENNESSEE, WILL NOW FIGHT TAX CUTS PLUS." WHAT IS "TAX CUTS PLUS?" THAT SOUNDS LIKE TAX CUTS FOR HUSKY BOYS. HE'LL GROW INTO IT. TRUMP TWEET-TINUED, "SENATOR CORKER IS THE INCOMPETENT HEAD OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, AND LOOK HOW POORLY THE U.S. HAS DONE. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE AS DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT," "DOT, DOT, DOT, THE ENTIRE WORLD WAS LAUGHING AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US. PEOPLE LIKE LIDDLE' BOB CORKER HAVE SET THE U.S. WAY BACK. NOW WE MOVE FORWARD!" YES, NOW AMERICA IS MOVING FORWARD, JUST LIKE THELMA AND LOUISE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH! JUST HOLDING HANDS, JUST HOLDING HANDS. AND, JIM, CAN I SEE PART OF THAT TWEET AGAIN. L-I-D-D-L-E AND THEN AN APOSTROPHE? THAT'S NOT HOW APOSTROPHES WORK. SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE MISSING, OTHER THAN BRAIN CELLS. IN FACT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU CAN'T USE APOST FEES LIKE-- HERE'S MY GUESS-- MY GUESS IS THE PRESIDENT THINKS APOST FEES IS A GREAT LAKES PHILOSOPHER. I LOVE THE WORKS OF APOST FEES. HE'S BETTER THAN PARENTHESIS. I LOVE PLAY-DOH. AND A SIDE OF TZATZIKI. ABSOLUTELY." NOW, TRUMP CAME OVER FOR A LUNCH TODAY-- HE WENT OVER THE SENATE TODAY. HE WENT OVER TO THE SENATE TODAY. BUT CORKER DIDN'T THINK MUCH WOULD GET DONE.
I DO LOOK AT THESE THINGS AS MORE OF A, YOU KNOW, PHOTO OP. THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABOUT SUBSTANCE. BUT, YOU KNOW, MORE POWER TO HIM.
Stephen: NO, LESS POWER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU ALREADY MADE HIM THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD BECAUSE YOU HELPED GET HIM ELECTED! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, CORKER, EVEN THOUGH HE CAMPAIGNED FOR TRUMP. HE MIGHT-- HE MIGHT REGRET SUPPORTING TRUMP. LET'S FIND OUT.
DO YOU REGRET SUPPORTING HIM IN THE ELECTION?
LET'S JUST PUT IT THIS WAY: I WOULD NOT DO THAT AGAIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HE WOULD NOT DO IT AGAIN. "LET'S JUST PUT IT THIS WAY--" TOO LATE, SENATOR. AND CORKER'S NOT ALONE. THIS AFTERNOON WE GOT SOME HUGE NEWS FROM ONE-TERM ARIZONA SENATOR AND UPRIGHT GOLDEN RETRIEVER, JEFF FLAKE.
I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT MY SERVICE IN THE SENATE WILL CONCLUDE AT THE END OF MY TERM IN EARLY JANUARY 2019. MR. PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY TO SAY ENOUGH. I MUST SAY THAT WE HAVE FOOLED OURSELVES FOR LONG ENOUGH THAT A PIVOT TO GOVERNING IT RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. A RETURN TO CIVILITY AND STABILITY RIGHT BEHIND IT. WE KNOW BETTER THAN THAT. MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL NOT BE COMPLICIT OR SILENT.
Stephen: NO, I WILL BE COMPLICIT AND ABSENT. NOW, FLAKE HAS BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE PRESIDENT FOR A WHILE, BUT TODAY HE REALLY UNLOADED.
DESPOTISM LOVES A VACUUM, AND OUR ALLIES ARE NOW LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR LEADERSHIP. ANGER AND RESENTMENT ARE NOT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY. ALLIANCES ARE ROUTINELY THREATENED BY THE LEVEL OF THOUGHT THAT GOES INTO 140 CHARACTERS.
Stephen: NOW, HOLD ON. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE ALL DONALD TRUMP DOES IS GO ON TWITTER TO THREATEN GLOBAL STABILITY. HE ALSO THREATENS FOOTBALL PLAYERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES, I WILL STAND UP FOR THIS. FLAKE SAID THAT WE DON'T JUST OWE IT TO OURSELVES TO OPPOSE TRUMP. WE ALSO OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN.
IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. WELL, THEY ARE. AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT? WHEN THE NEXT GENERATION ASKS US, "WHY DIDN'T YOU DO SOMETHING? WHY DIDN'T YOU SPEAK UP?" WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY?
Stephen: WELL, I THINK IN THE FUTURE, JEFF FLAKE WILL SAY, "I WAITED UNTIL I WAS QUITTING MY JOB TO POINT OUT THE BOSS WAS A LUNATIC. NOW, SIT DOWN AND EAT YOUR RADIOACTIVE DOG MEAT." THEY'RE LISTENING. THEY'RE LISTENING! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT SENATOR FLAKE SEES A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL, NOT JUST FOR HIM, BUT FOR ALL OF US.
THIS SPELL WILL EVENTUALLY BREAK. THAT IS MY BELIEF. WE WILL RETURN TO OURSELVES ONCE MORE, AND I SAY, THE SOONER THE BETTER.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. WE'RE ALL UNDER A SPELL. IT'S ALL DETAILED IN THE NEW BOOK, "HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-WIT PREZ." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT-- ERKS PEL-O TRUMP-UM. FIRST McCAIN, THEN CORKER, NOW FLAKE. WHY IS IT THAT REPUBLICANS ONLY SPEAK UP AGAINST DONALD TRUMP WHEN THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION? THEY FINALLY GROW A SET, AND THEN THEY SAY, "I'M TAKING MY BALLS AND GOING HOME!" AND... ( BOOM ) BETTER. SPEAKING OF OVER-GROWN CHILDREN: BILL O'REILLY. IT CAME OUT THAT O'REILLY SETTLED A SIXTH SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM, PAYING $32 MILLION TO A LONGTIME FOX NEWS ANALYST FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALLEGEDLY SENDING HER GAY PORNOGRAPHY. BUT BECAUSE IT WAS FROM BILL O'REILLY, ALL OF THOSE GAY PORN STARS SAID "MERRY CHRISTMAS" BEFORE COMING DOWN YOUR CHIMNEY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS-- BECAUSE THEY'RE SANTA! THEY'RE SANTA! ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT SANTA DOES. NOW, THIS REVELATION LIKELY MEANS THE END OF BILL O'REILLY'S TV CAREER. AND YESTERDAY, BILL TOLD US EXACTLY WHO HE BLAMES FOR ALL HIS BAD DECISIONS.
YOU KNOW, AM I MAD AT GOD? YEAH, I'M MAD AT HIM. I WISH I HAD MORE PROTECTION. I WISH THIS STUFF DIDN'T HAPPEN. I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. YEAH, I'M MAD AT HIM. IF I DIE TOMORROW AND I GET AN OPPORTUNITY, I'LL SAY, "WHY'D YOU GUYS WORK ME OVER LIKE THAT?"
Stephen: COINCIDENTALLY, "WHY'D YOU GUYS WORK ME OVER LIKE THAT?" IS TESTIMONY FROM MANY OF THE LAWSUITS AGAINST FOX NEWS. BUT COULD THIS BE TRUE? IS GOD REALLY TO BLAME FOR THIS WHOLE SCANDAL?
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, STEPHEN. COME ON! DON'T DRAG ME INTO THIS. COME ON!
Stephen: GOD, IS THAT YOU?
NO, IT'S SANTA IN A HOSPITAL GOWN. YES, OF COURSE IT'S GOD! AND I DON'T WANT MY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL O'REILLY BUSINESS.
Stephen: WHY NOT?
WELL, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT I DON'T EXACTLY HAVE THE BEST HISTORY WITH WOMEN.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LORD?
WELL, THERE WAS THAT INCIDENT WITH LOT'S WIFE. I HAD TO PAY, LIKE, $12 MILLION TO MAKE THAT WHOLE "PILLAR OF SALT" THING TO GO AWAY.
Stephen: YEAH, I GUESS YOUR TRACK RECORD'S A LITTLE SPOTTY. GOT SOMEBODY PREGNANT, AND THEN TOTALLY BAILED. KID SHOWS UP ON MY DOORSTEP 33 YEARS LATER. TURNS OUT, NICE GUY!
Stephen: SO, YOU'RE WORRIED THAT ALL THE ATTENTION ON HOW POWERFUL MEN TREAT WOMEN MIGHT COME BACK TO BITE YOU?
EXACTLY. BUT, LOOK, I'M GONNA CHANGE. I'M GOING TO PULL A WEINSTEIN AND SPEND ONE WEEK IN REHAB TO DEAL WITH ALL MY PROBLEMS. STEP ONE IS BELIEVING IN A HIGHER POWER, SO I GOT THAT COVERED. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT WHAT ABOUT BILL O'REILLY? WHERE YOU THE ONE WHO, YOU KNOW, CAME DOWN ON HIM?
OH, HE'S A REAL SICK PUPPY. DID YOU KNOW HE SENT ME GAY PORN? AND NOT EVEN GOOD STUFF. YOU NEED A LITTLE STORY TO GET THE MOTOR RUNNING, YOU KNOW?
Stephen: OKAY, BUT JUST BETWEEN US, WAS THE WHOLE O'REILLY HARASSMENT THING YOUR FAULT?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT!? REALLY!?
YEAH, I GAVE HIM THAT FREE WILL, AND LOOK WHAT HE DID WITH IT. IT'S LIKE LETTING A TODDLER DRIVE A CAR. WHICH I'VE ALSO DONE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS MY NEPHEW.
Stephen: WELL, DO YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE?
ALL RIGHT. BILL, I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR YOU, AND I'M SORRY. YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS IN YOUR LIFE, WHAT WITH LOOKING LIKE A PILE OF PANCAKE BATTER POURED OVER LAST YEAR'S SCARECROW. I MEAN, I KNOW I MADE MAN IN MY IMAGE, BUT WOOF. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: LORD, WAIT A SECOND. LORD, ARE YOU JUST ROASTING BILL O'REILLY?
OH, I WON'T BE THE ONE ROASTING HIM, STEPHEN.
Stephen: GOD, EVERYONE! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JAKE TAPPER IS HERE! BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, CNN DEFINES WHAT IS TRUTH. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, UP TO THE STICK AROUND FOR ROAST OF THE SHOW. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS JAKE TAPPER. HE'LL BE OUT HERE IN JUST A MINUTE, ONE OF THE YOUNG, UP-AND-COMING ANCHORS OVER AT CNN. A GREAT GUY. HE'LL HAVE A FEW THINGS TO SAY ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT. SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP-- AND I DO-- HE REMAINS LASER FOCUSED ON DEFEATING AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE ENEMY, THE PRESS. OVER THE WEEKEND, HE TWEETED, "IT IS FINALLY SINKING THROUGH. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, EVEN WORSE! LOST CRED." FIRST OF ALL, MR. PRESIDENT, THE EXPRESSION IS "SINKING IN," NOT "SINKING THROUGH." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SINK "THROUGH" THINGS LIKE QUAGMIRES OR STORMY SEAS OR PILES OF POOP, OR OTHER METAPHORS FOR YOUR PRESIDENCY. TRUMP HAS BEEN ATTACKING THE PRESS NONSTOP SINCE THE CAMPAIGN, AND CNN'S NOT TAKING IT ANYMORE. THIS WEEK, CNN DECIDED TO STICK IT TO THE MAN WITH A NEW AD. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
THIS IS AN APPLE. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT TRY TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S A BANANA. THEY MIGHT SCREAM BANANA, BANANA, BANANA OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THEY MIGHT PUT BANANA IN ALL CAPS. YOU MIGHT EVEN START TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A BANANA. BUT IT'S NOT. THIS IS AN APPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOT BAD. NOT BAD.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT! I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: NOT BAD, CNN. BUT WHERE WAS THAT APPLE DURING BENGHAZI? I PERSONALLY THINK THAT AD IS A LITTLE SUBTLE, SO WE MADE A SLIGHTLY MORE HONEST VERSION. SEE IF YOU CAN PICK UP ON OUR MESSAGE.
THIS IS AN APPLE. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT TRY TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S A BANANA. THEY MIGHT YELL BANANA, BANANA, BANANA. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS MIGHT GET ON TV AND SAY "BANANA FANNA FO FANNA, FEE FI MO MANNA, BANANA!" EVEN THOUGH YOUR QUESTION WAS ABOUT TAX RETURNS. THEY'LL SAY THE BANANA DID A GREAT JOB HELPING PUERTO RICO. YOU'LL SAY ACTUALLY, MOST OF THE ISLAND IS STILL LACKING POW, AND "STAND FOR THE NATIONAL BANANTHEM!" THEY'LL TELL YOU TO IGNORE THE EMAILS THAT SHOW THE BANANA'S SON TOOK A MEETING WITH A PUTIN-CONNECTED RUSSIAN LAWYER AFTER BANANA JR. WAS EXPLICITLY PROMISED DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON, BECAUSE THE MEETING WAS ACTUALLY ALL ABOUT ADOPTIONS. ADOPTIONS? THAT'S BANANAS. BUT THIS ISN'T A BANANA. IT'S AN APPLE. A REALLY STUPID APPLE. NOW, ORANGE YOU READY TO IMPEACH ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JAKE TAPPER.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HOSTS "THE LEAD" AND "STATE OF THE UNION" ON CNN. PLEASE WELCOME JAKE TAPPER! ♪ ♪ ♪
WOW.
Stephen: JAKE. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THAT'S NICE. YOU GET THAT EVERY NIGHT, HUH.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ONLY WHEN YOU'RE HERE.
IT'S VERY QUIET ON MY SET.
Stephen: YOU NEED AN AUDIENCE.
I WILL GET AN AUDIENCE, JUST A HISS.
Stephen: JAIRK I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
WHAT'S THAT? OH, MAN. THAT'S AN APPLE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S AN APPLE!
Stephen: CORKER SAID TRUMP WAS DEBASING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. FLAKE TODAY SAID, "I'M OUT OF HERE!" YOU KNOW, "THIS IS HEAVEN HELP US, WHERE OUR COUNTRY IS GOING." McCAIN IS TAKE SHOTS AT TRUMP. BUT ALL OF THESE GUYS ARE LEAVING. IS THIS AN ACT OF DEFIANCE OR IS THIS AN ACT OF SURRENDER, IN YOUR OPINION?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD, TO BE FAIR, FLAKE AND McCAIN I DON'T THINK VOTED FOR TRUMP, AND THEY MADE THEIR OPPOSITION TO TRUMP FAIRLY CLEAR LAST YEAR. I MEAN NOT AS VOCIFEROUSLY AS THEY'RE MAKING IT TODAY. BUT I THINK McCAIN SAILED AFTER THE "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" VIDEO CAME OUT HE WASN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM, AND I THINK FLAKE DID THE SAME. I DON'T THINK IT'S AN ACT OF SURRENDER. I THINK THE STEVE BANNONS AND BREITBARTS OF THE WORLD SEE THAT AND SAY TRUMP BROKE FLAKE, AND TRUMP IS BREAKING THESE PEOPLE. IN A WAY FOR TRUMP, IT'S GOOD THAT THEY'RE LEAVING. BUT I THINK WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD RIGHT NOW. I HAVE BEEN READING A LOT ABOUT THE 50s LATELY, AND THERE WAS A PERIOD-- YOU KNOW, JOE McCARTHY STARTED IN THE LATE 40s. HIS CRUSADE OF INDECENCY AND SMEARS ANDALIZE. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE McCARTHY ARE VERY DIFFERENT HISTORICAL FIGURES BUT THEY ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. THEY SAY HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT RHYMES. WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THAT ERA, JOE McCARTHY WAS DOING INDECENT THINGS AND LYING WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS NOT SAYING ANYTHING. AND THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR MARGARET CHASE SMITH OF MAINE OTHER ANDS WHO STOOD ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND CONDEMNED IT, BUT MOSTLY PEOPLE WERE QUIET. AND HISTORY LOOKS BACK AT THAT TIME AND SAYS, "BOY, WHAT A BUNCH OF WUSSES. THEY WERE WRONG." AND I THINK WHEN SENATOR JEFF FLAKE TODAY SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOING TO BE A RECKONING. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT THIS ERA AND SAY WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH ALL-- IT'S NOT McCARTHYISM, BUT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE-- ALL THIS INDECENCY AND ALL THESE LIES? WHAT DID DO YOU DURING THAT TIME? IT'S SOMETHING I THINK ABOUT ALL TIME AS AN INTERVIEWER AND AS A BROADCASTER. IT'S IMPORTANT-- YOU KNOW, THERE AREN'T TWO SIDES WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRUTH. THERE'S ONE SIDE, THE TRUTH. AND THEN THERE'S-- ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO-- SO YOU HAD FLAKE ON TODAY, RIGHT?
YUP.
Stephen: DID HE TELL YOU WHY HE'S LEAVING, WHY HE'S NOT STAYING TO FIGHT?
I ASKED HIM THAT VERY QUESTION, AND HE SAID THAT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THIS FEVER THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN IS GOING TO BE-- ISN'T GOING TO BE OVER NEXT YEAR. IN OTHER WORDS, HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO WIN UNLESS HE RAN THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN HE WOULDN'T BE PROUD OF, AN UGLY, DIRTY, NASTY CAMPAIGN, A CAMPAIGN THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO COZY UP TO PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A WAY THAT WOULDN'T MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE BUT THAT IS A MESSAGE OF DESPAIR. THAT'S SAYING THAT TRUTH CAN'T WEN.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THE TRUTH CAN'T WIN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN ARIZONA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IS WHAT HE'S SAYING.
Stephen: OH, OKAY. OKAY. STILL, NOT THAT-- STILL NOT THAT HOPEFUL. SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT HE'S PUG OUT SO HE CAN PREPARE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OR SOMETHING, TO CHALLENGE-- DID YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?
YEAH, I DID ASK HIM ABOUT THAT, AND HE SAID-- HE GAVE MY FAVORITE ANSWER, "THAT'S A LONG WAY OFF. THAT'S A LONG WAY OFFMENT. NO IT'S NOT, NOT REALLY.
Stephen: DONALD TRUMP IS RAISING MONEY.
I MEAN, I CAN TELL YOU I'M NOT GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 BUT HE WOULDN'T SAY NO.
Stephen: BUT THE DOOR IS OPEN.
THE DOOR IS CLOSED.
Stephen: NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT YOU RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT UNTIL YOU BROUGHT IT UP RIGHT NOW, AND NOW IT'S OUT THERE, JAKE. YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S OUT THERE NOW ON A NATIONAL PROGRAM THAT TALKS ABOUT POLITICS A LOT. THAT CAME OUT. I I DIDN'T HAVE TO PRY THAT OUT OF YOU, JAKE.
STEPHEN --
Stephen: JAKE, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? THAT'S AN APPLE, JAKE. DON'T BANANA, ME, NAIK. DON'T YOU BANANA ME.
I HAVE NO PLANS TO EAT THAT APGLEL OKAY, OKAY.
CURRENTLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( SIGHS ) SO DOES YOUR McCARTHY METAPHOR HAVE ANY HOPE TO IT?
WELL, ULTIMATELY, McCARTHY IMPLODED. ULTIMATELY --
Stephen: WELL, ULTIMATELY SOMEBODY STOOD UP TO HIM AT LAST AND SAID, "AT LOLONG LAST, SENAT HAVE YOU NO SHAME?" TRUMP HAS NO SHAME. WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. YOU CAN'T SHAME HIM TO SOME BAD POSITION. HE WILL CONTINUE WITHOUT THOUGHT, TO LIE TO MAINTAIN HIS POWER AND POSITION. HOW DO YOU THINK HE GETS TAKEN OUT?
I HAVEN'T FLIPPED AHEAD. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT ENDS.
Stephen: REALLY? I WANT TO GET THE TEACHER'S EDITION THAT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS IN THE BACK.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT ALL ENDS. AND, ALSO, ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS IS WHEN YOU HAVE McCAIN AND FLAKE AND CORKER, ALSO, THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICAL-- SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE, BEN SASS OF NEBRASKA HAS BEEN CRITICAL. DOES THAT MEAN THERE WILL BE A BIG RUSH OF REPUBLICANS TO COME OUT AND SAY WHAT THEY REALLY THINK AND CONDEMENT FACT THAT WE ARE GET AGO WE ARE BEING TREATED AS A NATION TO MORE LIES AND INDECENCY ON A DAILY BASIS FROM THIS WHITE HOUSE THAN WE ARE USED TO? I MEAN, AND I ALWAYS SAY I NEVER BET ON COURAGE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND I NEVER BET ON POLITICIANS BEING CANDID AND SAYING WHAT THEY REALLY THINK.
Stephen: ON CAMERA.
RIGHT. BUT, BUT-- BUT WHO KNOWS? I MEAN --
Stephen: DO YOU EVER HEAR THINGS BACKSTAGE? DO YOU HEAR THINGS OFF CAMERA THAT ARE-- ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ABE TO TELL US THAT SENATOR OR CONGRESSMEN OR MEMBERRING OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE SAID TO YOU THAT ARE OFF THE RECORD AND YOU SAY, "OH, LORD. I WISH THEY WOULD SAY THAT OUT LOUD?"
YES, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS-- AND THIS WON'T COME TO ANY SURPRISE TO YOU OR YOUR VIEWERS OR YOUR AUDIENCE, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE, REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO FEEL AS THOUGH THIS SITUATION IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANY TIME SOON, SO THE BEST THEY CAN DO IS TRY TO STEER IT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION LIKE JAMES MATTIS AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, OR H.R. McMASTER, THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, ET CETERA. BOB CORKER BASICALLY SAID HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS PRO TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN, BUT HE'S FINALLY JUST GIVING UP. HE CAN'T BE THE BALLAST IN THE SHIP ANYMORE. THAT IT'S, YOU KNOW, ROCKING TOO MUCH AND WHO KNOWS WHERE IT'S HEADED? BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO FEEL LIKE-- I MEAN, EVERYBODY SEES WHAT'S GOING ON. I MEAN, BUT, SOME PEOPLE FEEL, OKAY, BUT THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND HE'S THE PRESIDENT, AND WE NEED TO STEER THE SHIP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
Stephen: BILL O'REILLY TOOK A POKE AT YOU A COUPLE OFIDIZE AGO. AND YOU RESPONDED WITH LIGHTNING SPEED. YOU TWEETED-- HE TWEETED THIS AT AT YOU: WITHIN 10--
WHICH, BY THE WAY, FACT CHECK, OUR RATINGS ARE FINE. HE JUST WANTED TO TAKE A SHOT AT ME BECAUSE I HAD BEEN MENTIONING HIM AS A SEXUAL PREDATOR ON AIR WHEN WE WERE COVERING THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN SCANDAL-- ( APPLAUSE ) ALSO POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS-- THIS-- WEINSTEIN IS NOT THE ONLY ONE, THAT O'REILLY AND AILES WERE HORRIFIC SEXUAL PREDATORS AT FOX.
Stephen: WITHIN 10 MINUTES YOU TWEETED BACK: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ARE.
WELL--
Stephen: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO ASK ABOUT THIS. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH EVERYBODY THAT YOU ARE A VERY MEAN PERSON, JAKE TAPPER.
YOU KNOW, I'M A JOURNALIST, SO I LIKE TO EXPLAIN THINGS, AND I FELT HE WAS USING THE WORD "LOW" INCORRECTLY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S TRUE.
YOU KNOW, RATINGS GO UP AND RATINGS GO DOWN, BUT THAT'S LOW. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, JAKE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S ALWAYS-- USUALLY A IT'S A MORE HOPEFUL CONVERSATION THE TWO OF US HAVE. I REALLY ENJOYED HAVING YOU HERE.
DO YOU FEEL WORSE, THOUGH?
Stephen: A LITTLE WORSE, A LITTLE WORSE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY MY JOB. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON.
I HAD SOMEONE IN THE SAME SEAT SAYING I CAN'T GIVE YOU HOPE. A.O.L. A JOURNALIST. THAT'S NOT MY JOB.
I CAN'T SUGAR COAT IT. IT'S AN APPLE.
Stephen: I WANT A CARMEL APPLE! YOU CAN SEE JAKE WEEKDAYS ON "THE LEAD" AND SUNDAY MORNINGS ON "STATE OF THE UNION," BOTH ON CNN. JAKE TAPPER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SHEMAR MOORE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, TO "THE LATE SHOW." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM CBS'S "THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS," CBS'S "CRIMINAL MINDS," AND NOW, "S.W.A.T." ON CBS. PLEASE WELCOME, SHEMAR MOORE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ HEY! HOW ARE YOU?
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: COME ON UP. THERE YOU GO.
WOW.
Stephen: NICE TO MEET-- NICE TO MEET A VETERAN OF THE CBS FAMILY. I'M FAIRLY NEW TO CBS.
CAN I-- I KNOW THIS IS YOUR SHOW, BUT I CAN JUST SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS?
Stephen, OF COURSE, YOU CAN.
A COUPLE THINGS.
Stephen: YOU'RE MY GUEST.
JAKE TAPPER, YOU, CNN, I JUST-- I TIP MY CAP BECAUSE YOU GUYS TELL THE TRUTH. YOU TELL IT YOUR WAY. YOU SAY WHAT YOU THINK.  ( APPLAUSE ) OUTSIDE OF-- OUTSIDE OF ARSENIO HALL, WHO IS A BUDDY OF MINE, THAT'S THE ONLY LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY 24-YEAR CAREER. ME BEING ON THIS SHE-- MY MOTHER HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.  ( APPLAUSE ) DAYTIME TALK SHOWS, I GUESS THEY WANT TO KEEP YOU SOBER AND ALL THAT STUFF. YOU'VE GOT WINE AND CHEESE. YOU'VE GOT BEER. YOU'VE GOT COOL GIFT S.
Stephen:  VERY NICE OF YOU.
I JUST WANT TO SAY TO MY MOM AND YOU. MOM, YOUR BABY MADE IT! I'M HERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SAY HI TO MOM. WELL, LISTEN, 21 OF YOUR 23 YEARS AS AN ACTOR.
YEAH.
Stephen: ON CBS.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU HAVE YOUR CBS EYE TATTOO. IT MUST BE SOME PLACE PRIVATE, BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN MOST OF YOUR NAKED BODO CBS.
OH, NO. OH, NO.
Stephen: YOU ARE A MAN--
OH, NO!
Stephen: YOU ARE A MAN WHO DOES NOT MIND TAKING HIS SHIRT OFF FREQUENTLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT ONLY THAT, YOU'RE ON-- YOU'RE ON THE COVER OF "WATCH." DO YOU-- DO YOU-- WHEREVER IT IS YOU LIVE, DO THEY NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING THERE? WHY ARE YOUR SHIRTS FLAMATH? WHY DO YOUR SHIRTS JUST FLY OFF YOUR BODY SO EASILY?
MY-- YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I WAS RAISED OVERSEAS. I WAS RAISED-- THIS IS TRUE. OKAY, LET ME --
Stephen: WHERE OVERSEAS?
LET ME JUST BE HONEST-- I GET HALF BUCKEY NAKED FOR MY BABY GIRLS. THAT'S WHAT I DO. I GET HALF-BUCKEY--
OKAY.
LET ME TELL YOU A TRUE STORY. I WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. I WAS BORN IN OAKLAND. I I LIVED IN DENMARK FOR THREE YEARS. I LIVED IN BAHRAIN. TRAVELED TO GHANA, LONDONA, PAKISTAN, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS, GREECE. I HAVE PICTURES OF ME ON CAMELS. I ONLY REMEMBER ONE WORD OF DANISH. MY MOTHER SPEAK SPEAKS IT FLUENT BECAUSE IT WAS EUROPE, WE USED TO GO TO THE BEACHES, NUDITY-- UP TOP, LADIES, WHATEVER-- IT WAS A LITTLE FREER. SO I WAS THIS LITTLE BABY RUNNING AROUND BUCKEY NAIKY ALL THE TIME. FREE AT LAST. FREE AT LAST. HERE I COME, PEOPLE. SO THEN I CAME TO --
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT A BABY ANYMORE.
THEY INTRODUCED ME TO A BATHE SUIT AND, I DON'T KNOW, I WAS SIX YEARS OLD AND MY MOTHER PUT IT ON. AND I WAS LIKE, "GET THIS OFF ME. GET THIS OFF ME." AND NOW I'M 47 AND I GUESS IT'S STUCK. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YOU ARE KNOWN-- THIS IS ACTUALLY-- THIS IS ACTUALLY-- I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY PURCHASED THIS. THIS IS-- CAN WE GET A REALLY CLOSE SHOT OF THIS? THIS IS AN iPHONE CASE. HOW MANY-- HOW MANY CRUNCHES DO YOU DO A DAY, SHEMAR MOORE?
I DO ABOUT 500 SIT-UPS A DAY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK.
Stephen: OKAY, YOU'RE 47, MAN.
I'M 47.
Stephen: WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO PULL IT BACK FROM AN EIGHT-PACK TO A SIX-PACK.
HERE'S THE DEAL. I'M 47 YEARS OLD, BUT THE CHARACTER I PLAY ON "S.W.A.T.," IS 35. I HAVE TO PAINT SOME GRAYS AND HOLD MY BREATH A LOT MORE THAN I USE TOLD HOLD MY BREATH. I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN GET TO 60 WITH SOMEWHAT OF A THREE, FOUR-PACK, WHATEVER. BUT FINALLY, ONCE "S.W.A.T." IS A HUGE HIT AND YOU GET TIRED OF "S.W.A.T.," I'M GOING TO EXILE EXAIL AND LET ME MINI-KEG HAPPEN. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. THERE YOU GO. NOW, HOLD ON. THIS IS 47. WHEN THEY SAY ACTION AT WORK-- SAY ACTION.
Audience: ACTION!
THERE IT IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, MY PUBLICIST IS GOING TO KILL ME FOR DOING THAT.
Stephen: READY, READY? HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS 53. THIS IS 53. THIS IS 53. SAY ACTION.
Audience: ACTION! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT? FAR FEWER CRUNCHES. MINE IS MUCH EASIER TO GET. YOU SAID "BABY GIRL NATION."
BABY GIRL NATION.
Stephen: WHAT IS BABY GIRL NATION?
I TALK TO MY FANS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND CALL THEM HOMEYS, FANS, AND BABY GIRLS. AND THE BABY GIRLSES ARE NO JOKE. IT'S A LEGION OF WOMEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF MY CAREER FOR YEARS.
Stephen: AND THEY'RE AGO WITH YOU CALLING THEM BABY GIRLS.
AND WOMEN, "DON'T CALL ME WHAT YOU CALLED YOUR LAST GIRLFRIEND. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT." ALL THAT STUFF. AND WHEN I GOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA I WAS LIKE, "HEY, BABY GIRL." AND I WAS AFRAID TO SAY IT. AND THEY SAID, "CALL ME BABY GIRL." WHAT'S UP, BABY GIRL. IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. AND IT BECAME A THING. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, HE CALLED ME 'BABY GIRL'." I DIDN'T COIN THE TERM BABY GIRL NATION. THE FANS TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES.
Stephen: HAVE YOU TRIED THE BABY GIRL ON OTHER FAMOUS PEOPLE? BABY GIRL IS LIKE WHAT YOU SAY TO A FAN, DOES BABY GIRL WORK AGAINST-- WHEN--
MY MOMMA ALWAYS SAY ON YOUR DIGGITY. SHE KNOWS I'M HAVING FUN WITH MY FANS. IF THIS IS REAL LIFE-- IF I DON'T KNOW YOU, OR A WOMAN I'M INTERESTED IN --
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN TURNED DOWN BRUTALLY?
OH, MY GOD! YES, I HAVE. YES, I HAVE. AND I'M ACTUALLY-- I'M ACTUALLY REALLY PROUD OF IT BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET TURNED DOWN. I SWEAR TO GOD, THIS HAPPENED TO ME. ONCE UPON A TIME MANY YEARS AGO I WAS HOSTING A DANCE SHOW CALLED "SOUL TRAIN." I MET THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ON STAGE. SHE WAS DOING HER THING. HER NAME IS ALICIA KEYS. HOLD ON. THIS IS BEFORE SWISS BEATS. THIS IS A LONG TIME AGO, LIKE 20-SOMETHING YEARS AGO. SO SHE'S ON STAGE DOING HER THING. THE BEAUTIFUL EYES, THE CORNROWS, SHE'S PLAYING THAT PIANO AND I'M IN MY DRESSING ROOM LIKE, "WOW, SHE'S BAD." I INTERVIEWED HER THAT DAY. FAST FORWARD THREE MONTHS. SHE'S HAVING A LISTING PARTY. I GO TO IT. AND MY BOY IS LIKE GO TALK TO HER. YOU'RE SHEMAR MOORE. GO TALK TO HER. I GO TALK TO HER AND SAY, "HEY, ALEASH AIT'S REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MAN SITUATION IS LIKE, BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN L.A. IF YOU WANT TO GET A DRINK AND GO TO DINNER." AND SHE LOOKS AT ME, AND I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING I'M MADE IS A TRUISTIC SHE LOOKS DEAD IN MY FACE AND GOES, "LOOK HERE, SON--" HOLD ON, HOLD ON. "I RESPECT YOUR FLIRT GAME, BUT MY MAN SITUATION IS HANDLED" AND SHE WALKED AWAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
