Stephen: LET'S SEE, COLD OPEN, CAESAR FLICKERMAN ON HOUSE. WELCOME TO THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." WELL, THIS FALL WAS A LONG TIME COME, BUT LAST NIGHT TRIBUTE BERNIE SANDERS FINALLY DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE! HA-HA"H" HE FELT THE-- ARE YOU ( BLEEP ) KIDDING ME?
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES LAURA LINNEY. JOHN LEGUIZANO. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY GARY CLARK JR. IS FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! NICE TO SEE YOU. HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! HEY, UP THERE. EVERYBODY DOWN HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." VERY NICELY DONE. THANKS, EVERYBODY. NICE TO SEE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. IS THIS ON? IS THIS ON RIGHT NOW? I CAN'T TELL. IS THIS ON? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THE SOUND GUYS LOVE IT WHEN YOU DO THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. IS EVERYBODY REFERRED FROM THE RAINSTORM THAT JUST HAPPENED OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW? IS EVERYBODY OKAY? EVERYBODY? NOBODY NEEDS A SNORKEL OR ANYTHING? FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME, MY AUDIENCE HAS TO LINE UP OUTSIDE BEFORE COMING INTO THE SHOW, AND TODAY IN NEW YORK IT WAS JUST POURING DOWN IN SHEET OF RAIN. IT LOOKED LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD OUT THERE. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TILL NOVEMBER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT RAFT NIGHT'S VOTING RESULTS ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT." THERE WAS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE BY AN 82-YEAR OLD MAN NAMED JOHN HETLINGER, WHO BLEW EVERYONE AWAY!
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR. LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR. LET THE BODY HIT THE FLOOR!
OH, MY GOSH! ♪ CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE NOTHING WRONG WITH ME ♪
Stephen: WOOOO! WOOO! WOW! WHAT CLIPs WAS LONGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. WOW. I WAS BANGING MY HEAD OUT HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE. THAT GUY IS METAL! NOT EVEN COUNTING HIS TITANIUM HIP. THE SONG HE WAS DOING JUST THEN THAT HE WAS JUST SCREECHING OUT IS DROWNING POOL'S 2001 SINGLE REQUESTED BODIES." I THINK HETLINGER IS GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE A DROWNING POOL COVER BAND. ALTHOUGH, AT HIS AGE, I WOULD PROBABLY CALL IT WALK-IN BATHTUB. I AM-- I AM HONESTLY EXHAUSTED FROM HEAD BANGING. THAT CAN'T BE A GOOD SIGN.
Jon: DIZZY?
Stephen: THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY HISTORY MADE IN AMERICA LAST NIGHT. BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE CANDIDATE OF A MAJOR PARTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT 240 YEARS IN THE MAKING, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN THE ELECTION BEGAN. TRULY A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES IN EQUALITY. AND HILLARY CLINTON TOOK THE STAGE IN BROOKLYN TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, WOMEN'S VOICES WILL BE HEARD. ( NO AUDIO )
Stephen: AAAAND, THEY FORGOT TO TURN ON HER MIC. HEY, THEY ONLY HAD EIGHT YEARS TO PLAN IT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY CAN GET UP THERE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH OF HER NIGHT AND THE MIC ISN'T ON. IS THERE A SHOT OF THE AUDIO GUY? THERE GU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH BERNIE LOOKED LIKE GARGOMYLE. BUT ONCE THEY GOT THE SOUND UP, IT WAS A GREAT AND HISTORIC SPEECH THAT YOU ALL TOTALLY WATCHED, SO I DON'T HAVE TO SHOW ANY OF IT. THEN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN CELEBRATED HER HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT IN A MANNER BEFITTING ITS GRAVITY WITH THIS TWEET, "THANKS TO YOU, WE MADE HISTORY TONIGHT. CELEBRATE WITH A FREE MAGNET!" YES, A BIG, ROUND MAGNET, PERFECT TO DECORATE YOUR CAR BUMPER, OR MAYBE EVEN ERASE YOUR E-MAILS. BUT-- THAT'S PROBABLY HOW IT HAPPENED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S PROBABLY-- THAT'S PROBABLY HOW IT HAPPENED. IT'S TOTALLY INNOCENT. BUT JUST BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WON DOES NOT MEAN BERNIE LOST, NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT. JUST LISTEN TO THIS IMPARTIAL OBSERVER.
I AM PRETTY GOOD IN ARITHMETIC, AND I KNOW THE FIGHT IN FRONT OF US IS A VERY, VERY STEEP FIGHT.
Stephen: YES, BERNIE'S PRETTY GOOD AT ARITHMETIC, ESPECIALLY DIVISION. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, BERNIE'S-- IT'S A THINKER. IT'S A CHIN STROKER. IT'S A SCHIN STROKER. SO BERNIE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD, BUT BERNIE STILL STANDS. IT REMINDS ME OF THAT MOVIE. WHAT WAS IT CALLED? IT WAS ABOUT AN OLDER MAN WHO'S DEAD BUT NO ONE CAN TELL BECAUSE HE'S PROPPED UP BY ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S "WEEKEND AT..."
Jon: I SAW THAT ONE!
Stephen: I FORGET. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT'S CALLED. I THINK IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING. AND TO FIRE UP ALL OF HIS YOUNG SUPPORTERS FOR THE FIGHT AHEAD, BERNIE ENDED THE NIGHT WITH THIS ENTHUSIASTIC CALL TO ACTION.
Stephen: OF COURSE, LIKE ALL NIGHTS, LAST NIGHT WAS ALSO A BIG ONE FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO DESTROYED HIS COMPETITION IN EVERY STATE WHERE HE HAD NO COMPETITION. AND LAST NIGHT HE SHOCKED THE WORLD WHEN HE GAVE HIS VICTORY SPEECH USING A TELEPROMPTER. A TELEPROMPTER. THIS FROM A GUY WHO GOT THIS FAR BY SHOUTING WHATEVER COMES INTO HIS MIND. TRUMP USING A TELEPROMPTER IS LIKE THE FLASH CALLING AN UBER, AQUAMAN TAKING A FERRY, OR BERNIE SANDERS USING A COMB. I ACTUALLY, HONESTLY, DON'T THINK THIS IS NEWS. TRUMP'S BEEN USING HIS OWN TELEPROMPTER ALL ALONG. IT'S CALLED THE YELL-A-PROMPTER. AND WE HAVE OBTAINED FOOTAGE OF TRUMP SPEECHES WITH REVERSE SHOTS OF HIS YELL-A-PROMPTER SO WE CAN SEE WHAT HE'S READING. TAKE A LOOK.
WHEN I LOOK AT THESE THINGS HERE, I SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S SO MUCH EASIER. IT WOULD BE SO NICE, JUST BAH, PA, BAH, PA, BAH, BING, BING, BING. YOU MIGHT SEE SOMEONE WITH A TOMATO. SO IF YOU SEE SOMEBODY GETTING READY TO THROW A TWO MATEO, KNOCK THE CRAP OUT OF THEM, WILL YOU. SERIOUSLY. OKAY? WHEN MEXICO SENDS ITS PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS. THEY'RE BRINGING CRIME. THEY'RE RAPISTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY! I WAS GOING TO DO THIS IN JUST A MINUTE, BUT I HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH JON RIGHT NOW. JON, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST WITH THE BAND TONIGHT. WHO DO YOU HAVE OVER THERE.
Jon: WE HAVE PAULA ROBESON ON THE FLUTES.
Stephen: SAY HI TO PAULA ROBSON, EVERYBODY. PAULA, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. PAULA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PAULA ROBBED SON, BESIDES BEING ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVING FLUTISTS IS A DEAR, OLD FRIEND OF MINE, AND ALSO PLAYED AT MY WEDDING. PAULA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
OH, YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THERE IS BIG NEWS FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER. ANYONE HERE FROM CANADA?  ( CHEERS ) ALL RIGHT. ANYONE HERE THINKING OF MOVING TO CANADA? ( APPLAUSE ) 1 WELL, IF YOU ARE THINKING OF MOVING UP THERE, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. CANADA IS CHANGING THE LYRICS TO ITS NATIONAL ANTHEM. APPARENTLY, CANADIANS FELT THE ORIGINAL ANTHEM DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH APOLOGIES IN IT. THIS IS TRUE. A BILL TO MAKE THE CHANGE PASSED IN CANADA'S CONGRESS, OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT UP THERE-- PARLIAMENT OR "LAW IGLOO." I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE. SO CANADA IS GOING TO HAVE A NEW VERSION OF THE ANTHEM, WHICH IS CALLED "O CANADA." WHICH IS SHOCKING TO ME. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE CANADIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM WAS "CHICKITY-CHINA THE CHINESE CHICKEN, YOU HAVE A DRUMSTIC ♪ IT'S BEEN-- ♪ SO HERE'S THE CHANGE: THERE'S A LINE THAT GOES "IN ALL THY SONS COMMAND" BUT THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT TO "IN ALL OF US COMMAND" TO MAKE IT GENDER NEUTRAL. NEXT UP, SASKATCHEWAN IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CITY OF REGINA. WHILE THEY'RE AT IT, MIGHT I SUGGEST ALSO CHANGING THE NAME OF THE SONG? IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED EVERY TIME YOU FIND OUT WHAT ANTHEM YOU'RE ABOUT TO SING: "OH... CANADA." SO I SUPPORT THE CHANGE BUT, CANADA, YOU ARE MISSING A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE TO CHANGE MORE LYRICS TO SHOW HOW GREAT YOUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY IS. AND I HAVE PREPARED A SMALL REWRITE OF YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. PLEASE RISE. PLEASE RISE. AND PLACE YOUR HAND OVER YOUR BEAVER. ♪ O CANADA THE COUNTRY WE HOLD DEAR ♪ ALL THE SEXY RYANS ALSO COME FROM HERE ♪ COME AND VISIT OUR SPRAWLING WILDERNESS ♪ YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE A MOOSE ♪ BRING A PARKA, THOUGH CAUSE IT'S REALLY COLD AND THAT WE'RE SORRY ABOOT ♪ TRY OUR MAPLE SYRUP YOU'LL LIKE IT A LOT ♪ O CANADA, I'M SURE THERE'S OTHER STUFF WE GOT ♪ OH THAT REMINDS ME OUR PRIME MINISTER IS HOT ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH, CANADA! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LAURA LINNEY. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, PAULA! MWA! FOLKS, YOU ARE IN LUCK. YOU KNOW HOW THERE ARE SOME ACTORS THAT IF THEY ARE IN A MOVIE, YOU KNOW THAT MOVIE IS GOOD? TONIGHT'S FIRST GUEST IS ONE OF THOSE. PLEASE WELCOME THE BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED LAURA LINNEY. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

Stephen: OH, WOW. NOW, I WANT TO GET TO THE MOVIE IN JUST A MINUTE, "GENIUS," WE HAD JUDE LAW ON LAST NIGHT WHO IS PLAYING THOMAS WOLFE. WE HAD A LOVELY TIME. HE HAS A SOUTHERN ACCENT.
HE HAS APLATCHIAN ACCENT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF SOUTHERN ACCENT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST BECAUSE OF YOUR FAMILY.
WHEN I GET TIRED I DO. MY MOTHER CERTAINLY HAS A SOUTHERN ACCENT, AND MY FATHER DID. WHEN I GET TIRED, IT SORT OF GOES A LITTLE BIT. AND IT DOES. MY VOWELS ELONGATE. UHH-HUUH.
Stephen: FOR ME IT'S. IF I'VE HAD A LITTLE IT TO DRINK OR I GET ANGRY.
OH, ANGRY SOUTHERN. "HOW DARE YOU!" DO YOU SAY THAT.
Stephen: I SAY TO YOU, SIR! I CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL.
"NO, SIR!" GLO THE WAR OF NORTHERN AGGRESSION. THAT'S SERIOUS. PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE ME--
NO, I HAD COUSINS WHO TIED ME TO A TREE BECAUSE I WAS BORN ABOVE THE MASON-DIXON LINE. I'M NOT KIDDING.
Stephen:  WOW.
YEAH, THAT WAS NOT FUN.
Stephen: THAT WAS NOT RECENTLY, I HOPE.
NO, NO, NO.
Stephen: ANOTHER BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE GUESTS ON WHO WERE BORN IN NEW YORK CITY, THEY DECRY THAT NEW YORK HAS CHANGED.
IT HAS CHANGED. A LOT.
Stephen: FOR THE BETTER?
IN SOME WAYS. IT'S SAFE. I MEAN, YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE STREETS. PEOPLE AREN'T MUGGED --
Stephen: AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE ALIVE. THAT'S A PLUS. WERE YOU ALLOWED TO FREE RANGE AS A KID?
I WAS. BUT THE CULTURE OF DIFFERENT THEN. YOU WOULD WALK TO SCHOOL. YOU WALKED BACK FROM SCHOOL. BUT THE NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY WEREN'T-- STORES WERE PRIVATELY OWNED. SO WHEN I WOULD WALK TO SCHOOL --
Stephen: SO PEOPLE DON'T WALK TO SCHOOL ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE CHAIN STORES? NEW YORK, IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
DWAYNE REED GOT RID OF ALL OF IT.
THERE WAS A BUTTON STORE I REMEMBER ON 1st AVENUE, AND THERE WERE THE TWO OLD ITALIAN SISTERS WHO WOULD MAKE SURE THAT I WAS OKAY. THEY WOULD WAIT FOR ME IN THE MORNING. I WOULD ALWAYS SAY HELLO. AND WHEN I WALKED HOME, THEY WOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THEY WAS, YOU KNOW, THERE. YEAH.
Stephen: WOW.
YEAH. I KNOW, SWEET. SWEET. THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT WAS BEFORE NEW YORK HAD POLICE. IT WAS JUST-- ( LAUGHTER ) OLD ITALIAN WOMEN RULED THE NEIGHBORHOODS.
THERE WAS A PIZZA PARLOR. I KNEW THE GUY IN THE PITA PARLOR. THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS CLOSE.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A SON. WOULD YOU LET HIM WALK AROUND NEW YORKS BY HIMSELF.
NEVER, NEVER.
Stephen: REALLY? HOW OLD IS HE?
TWO AND A HALF.
Stephen: THERE'S A GOOD REASON. YOU'RE A GOOD MOTHER.

IS THAT SO?
MAX DIDN'T TELL YOU. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A PLAY FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. IT'S ABOUT PAULINE, NAPOLEON'S SISTER.

IT'S ATTEMPTING TO BE MORE MODERN.
WROTE A PLAY ONCE. IT WAS NOT A HAPPY EXPERIENCE. I CAN TELL THAT YOU. I FOUND IT ANEMIC FORM. LACKING THE MULTICOLORED CLOAK OF PROEZ. DUMPED THE FORM AND RETURNED TO MY NOVELS.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, CLEARLY, SHE'S FRUSTRATED. >>IAS.
Stephen: AS A VERY-- CAN YOU RELATE TO THAT IN ANY WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY SUCCESSFUL, WELL-RESPECTED ARTIST YOURSELF. HOW DO YOU SORT OF-- HOW DO YOU HOOK INTO A WOMAN WHO IS NOT BEING RESPECTED FOR HER ART.
MY MOTHER'S MOTHER, MY GRANDMOTHER, I WAS MATE LIN CLAYBALL FROM THE SOUTH. SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR RESPECTABLE WOMEN TO GO INTO THAT PROO FEGZ.
Stephen: NO, IT WAS LIKE PROSTITUTION.
IT WAS. SO SHE WAS AN ELOCUTION MAJOR. HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO ELOCUTION. WHEN I GOT INTO JUILLIARD, WHEN I GOT INTO SCHOOL, WE WOULD COMPARE NOTES ABOUT SPEECH. AND SHE LEARNED CERTAIN WORDS HAD HAND MOTIONS THAT WENT WITH THEM WHEN YOU WOULD RECITE A POEM AND ALL OF THAT. AND SHE WON A STATE COMPETITION, AND THERE WAS A GOLD MEDAL, AND SHE GAVE ME THE GOLD MEDAL. SO I HAVE THAT, WHICH I LOVE.
Stephen: THAT'S LOVELY, THAT'S LOVELY. IS THAT YOUR FAVORITE AWARD?
PROBABLY, IT PROBABLY SACTUALLY, YEAH, YEAH. I THINK THAT'S WHY-- YOU KNOW, MASQUERADE PARTIES AND HALLOWEEN PARTIES BECAME VERY, VERY POPULAR BECAUSE ALL THOSE WOMEN WERE JUST DYING TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN. ( LAUGHTER ).
