ACCORDING TO REPORTS, SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON, TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN AND DEFENSE SECRETARY JAMES MATTIS HAVE FORMED A "SUICIDE PACT" WHERE IF ONE RESIGNS, THEY ALL DO. ( ELEVATOR MUSIC )
THAT MORON IS OUT OF CONTROL BUT HE CAN'T TOUCH US NOW THAT WE'VE FORMED A SUICIDE PAFNLGT WITH ME MATTIS?
HOOAH! W ABOUT YOU MNUCHIN. YEAH. HOORAH. HOW FAR DOES IT GO?
SUICIDE PACT. TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE? WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? IT'S A SUICIDE PACT.
IT'S VERY SEVERE. HOW ABOUT WE CALL IT BETTSYS FOR LIFE?
IT'S A SUICIDE PACT AND TO SHOW OUR COMMITMENT LET'S BRICK OUR FINGERS ON ONE OF MATTIS' MEDALS AND MIX OUR BLOOD. HOORAH! GRAB 'EM, MAD DOG!
I'M FEELING FAINT! STOP STRUGGLING!
ANNOUNCER: IT'S THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT REX TILLERSON AND THE SUICIDE PACT. PLUS -- TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES: MORGAN FREEMAN AND, GRACE GUMMER FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT. HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW ARE YA? GOOD TO SEE YA! HEY JON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN )
Jon: HEYAAAAH! WHOO!
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE THURSDAY CROWD RIGHT THERE. THAT'S THE KIND OF CROWD I WANT ON FRIDAY. MIGHT AS WELL STICK AROUND FOR THE SECOND SHOW ON FRIDAY, I'D LIKE THAT. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE FEELING CHEERFUL TONIGHT BECAUSE, GUYS, I AM WORRIED. I AM SO WORRIED ABOUT SECRETARY OF STATE AND FOOTBALL COACH BEING FORCED TO TEACH SEX ED, REX TILLERSON. ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, NBC REPORTED TILLERSON WAS ON THE VERGE OF RESIGNING HIS POSITION THIS SUMMER AND HAD OPENLY DISPARAGED PRESIDENT TRUMP, REFERRING TO HIM AS A "MORON." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S USUALLY SOMETHING YOU SAY RIGHT BEFORE YOU QUIT. ( LAUGHTER ) "HEY, CAN I HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME? YOU MORON." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TILLERSON'S SPOKESPERSON VEHEMENTLY DENIED HE EVER SAID IT.
HE DOESN'T USE THAT LANGUAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT ANYONE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T USE THAT LANGUAGE?
BECAUSE I TAKE THE SECRETARY AT HIS WORD.
STEPHEN: SHE TAKES HIM AT HIS WORD. AND WHAT WAS HIS WORD AGAIN?
CAN YOU ADDRESS THE MAIN HEADLINE OF THIS STORY, THAT YOU CALLED THE PRESIDENT A MORON? AND IF NOT, WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE REPORTS ARE--
I'M NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH PETTY STUFF LIKE THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, HIS WORD WAS MORON. ( LAUGHTER ) HE VEHEMENTLY WOULD RATHER NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT, AT THAT SAME PRESS CONFERENCE, HE CATEGORICALLY DENIED HE EVER CONSIDERED RESIGNING AND TALKED ABOUT HIS COMMITMENT TO HIS JOB.
WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, MY FIRST THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS AT HOME AND ABROAD.
STEPHEN: "THEN, I WALK TO THE BATHROOM, LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY, 'HEY, THERE'S THE GUY WHO WORKS FOR A MORON'." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I SHOULD SHAVE HIM. HE'S LOOK AGO LITTLE -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY, NOW!
Stephen: APPARENTLY THIS STORY STUCK IN TRUMP'S CRAW BECAUSE, THIS MORNING, HE TWEETED, "REX TILLERSON NEVER THREATENED TO RESIGN. THIS IS FAKE NEWS PUT OUT BY @NBCNEWS. LOW NEWS AND REPORTING STANDARDS. NO VERIFICATION FROM ME." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHOA!
Stephen: "AND AS YOU KNOW NOTHING'S TRUE WITHOUT VERIFICATION FROM ME. OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE? TOTALLY FAKE TILL I SAID IT WASN'T. LAST YEAR'S ELECTION? TOTALLY RIGGED TILL I WON. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M A VERIFIED MORON." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONFIDENT THAT TILLERSON WILL STAY BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, THERE'S AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEFENSE SECRETARY JAMES MATTIS, TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN AND TILLERSON, WHEREBY ALL THREE CABINET SECRETARIES VOW TO LEAVE IN THE EVENT THAT THE PRESIDENT MAKES MOVES AGAINST ONE OF THEM. AND TRUMP IS KNOWN FOR MAKING MOVES. REX, IF THE PRESIDENT OFFERS TO TAKE YOU FURNITURE SHOPPING, GET OUT OF THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST GET OUT OF THERE! AND TAKE YOUR CAT WITH YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE HE'S GRABIN' IT! ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) MEDIA REPORTS HAVE REFERRED TO THE AGREEMENT AS A "SUICIDE PACT." THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THINGS ARE GOING GREAT IN A WORKPLACE, WHEN PEOPLE STARTING FORMING SUICIDE PACTS. THEY'VE ALSO AGREED THAT IF NONE OF THEM ARE WITH SOMEONE BY THE TIME THEY'RE 70, THEY'LL MARRY EACH OTHER. ( LAUGHTER ) SUICIDE PACTS! MEANWHILE, ON CAPITAL HILL, IT LOOKS LIKE CONGRESS MIGHT FINALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL. YESTERDAY, CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS SIGNALED THAT THEY WOULD BE OPEN TO BANNING GUN CONVERSION KITS CALLED "BUMP STOCKS," WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN'S NATURAL RECOIL, ALLOWING IT TO BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH OFF A SHOOTER'S TRIGGER FINGER AND UNLEASH UP TO 100 ROUNDS IN SEVEN SECONDS. IT'S GREAT FOR HUNTING-- IF YOU'VE GOT SEVEN SECONDS TO KILL EVERY ANIMAL IN THE FOREST. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A DIFFERENT BAMBI. RIGHT NOW, THESE DEVICES ARE TOTALLY LEGAL BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS, A BUMP STOCK "IS A FIREARM PART AND, THEREFORE, IS NOT REGULATED AS A FIREARM." YES, IT'S NOT A GUN, IT'S JUST A PART OF A GUN. LIKE WHEN YOUR PARENTS FIND YOUR BONG AND YOU TELL THEM, "HEY, THERE'S NO WEED IN THERE NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHOA! WHOA! ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: SO, TECHNICALLY, THAT IS A VASE. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE SOME PINK FLOYD TO LISTEN TO. MAY I PLEASE HAVE MY VASE BACK?" ( LAUGHTER ) BASED ON A TRUE STORY, ACTUALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW. SHE DIDN'T KNOW. RIGHT NOW, BANNING BUMP STOCKS SEEMS TO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, THE N.R.A. EVEN SAYS THEY SHOULD BE REGULATED. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNWILLING TO EVEN DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL. LIKE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA, WHO SAID, "REALISTICALLY, THEY ARE ALREADY ON THE MARKET, SO PASSING A LAW BANNING THEM ISN'T GOING TO STOP BAD GUYS." SAME REASON CRYSTAL METH SHOULD BE LEGAL-- IT'S ALREADY ON THE MARKET, AND PASSING A LAW ISN'T GOING TO STOP ME FROM FIGHTING YOU WITH A SHARPENED TOOTHBRUSH. SPIDERS! SPIDERS! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( SCREAMING ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( JON LAUGHING )
Stephen: ALSO BASED ON A TRUE STORY. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, IT'S FOOTBALL SEASON! THAT'S NOT A POLITICAL STORY. A TIME TO COZY UP IN FRONT OF THE TUBE WITH A STEAMING MUG OF QUESO! MMM, REFRESHING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AND IT'S SHAPING UP TO BE A DRAMATIC SEASON FOR THE OL' PIGSKIN KICK AND TOSS. BUT THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY. THE LATEST COMES FROM THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WITH CAROLINA QUARTERBACK CAM NEWTON.
DEVIN FUNCHESS HAS SEEMED TO REALLY EMBRACE THE PHYSICALITY OF HIS ROUTES AND MAKING--GETTING THOSE EXTRA YARDS. DOES THAT GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF ENJOYMENT TO SEE HIM KIND OF TRUCK STICKING PEOPLE OUT THERE?
IT'S FUNNY TO HEAR A FEMALE TALK ABOUT ROUTES. LIKE -- IT'S FUNNY.
STEPHEN: WOW. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) WOW. IT'S FUNNY TO HEAR A FEMALE TALK ABOUT ROUTES? COULD HE BE MORE PATRONIZING AND INSULTING? THAT A WOMAN WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT ROUTES AND TRUCK STICKING. AND QUICK FOLLOW-UP -- WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL LIKE I SHOULD KNOW THAT NOW. COULD YOU HAVE HER CALL ME AND TELL ME? AND THIS HAS HURT NEWTON. TODAY, WE LEARNED THAT HIS SPONSOR, DANNON, HAS DROPPED HIM AS A SPOKESMAN. TOO BAD. IT WAS FUNNY TO SEE A MALE TALK ABOUT YOGURT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MORGAN FREEMAN IS HERE! BUT WHEN WE RETURN, THE FINALE OF OUR PUBERME CHALLENGE! YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT TO MISS IT! STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! TRYING TO THERE IS THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, JON, HAPPY THURSDAY!
Jon: HAPPY THURSDAY!
Stephen: ONLY ONE MORE DAY TO THE FRIDAY. HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.
Jon: YEAH, MM-HMM.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, GUYS, PUERTO RICO IS GOING TO BE REBUILDING FROM HURRICANE MARIA FOR MONTHS, IF NOT YEARS. AND WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP. LUCKILY, I'M BEST KNOWN AS A BEN -- AS AN ICE CREAM MODEL. I GOT THIS HERE THE BEN & JERRY'S AMERICONE DREAM. THERE YOU GO. I PUT ALL THE MONEY I MAKE FROM MY ICE CREAM IN THE AMERICONE DREAM FUND, AND EVERY YEAR, WE GIVE IT TO CHARITY. SO WITH THE HELP OF MY FRIEND NICK KROLL, WE LAUNCHED A TWITTER CAMPAIGN ENCOURAGING CELEBRITIES TO POST PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES DURING THEIR AWKWARD TEEN YEARS, WITH THE HASHTAGS "PUBERME" AND "PUERTO RICO RELIEF." THE AMERICONE DREAM FUND IS GIVING $1,000 FOR EVERY CELEBRITY -- I DECIDE WHAT A CELEBRITY IS -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- TO THE ONE AMERICA APPEAL. AND FOR THE LAST WEEK, WE'VE BEEN SHOWING YOU SOME OF THE BEST SUBMISSIONS. I LIKE TO START WITH MY CONFESSION OF A 13-YEAR-OLD PHOTO THERE. THE HORMONES HAVE KICKED IN BUT SO FAR THE ONLY THING THAT'S GROWN IS THE KNOT ON MY TIE RIGHT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO ELSE HAVE WE GOT HERE? WE'VE GOTTEN SOME GOOD ONES RECENTLY. HERE IS -- SEE IF YOU CAN SEE WHO THIS PERSON IS. THAT IS SETH ROGEN RIGHT THERE PROVING THAT MARIJUANA APPARENTLY MAKES YOU STOP AGING AT 15. OH, THIS IS A LOVELY ONE. I LIKE TO GET THE BLACK AND WHITE ONES HERE. THIS ONE RIGHT HERE -- I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHO THIS GUY IS. THAT IS YOUNG HENRY WINKLER, FONZIE FROM HAPPY DAYS, APPARENTLY HE WENT TO HIS DANCE WITH HIS DATE A RAILING. THIS IS JIM. THIS IS A PICTURE OF YOUNG MARTIN SHORT. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PHOTO SAYS "I'M PREPARING MYSELF FOR A CAREER IN COMEDY." ( LAUGHTER ) THIS ONE IS -- I LOVE THIS. CAN YOU FIGURE OUT WHO THAT IS? THAT'S KRISTEN BELL RIGHT THERE. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? SHE'S CAUGHT PLAYING AS A SPINSTER AUNT AT THE COMPANY CHRISTMAS PARTY THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS OUR FRIEND FROM OVER AT CNN. THIS IS JAKE TAPPER RIGHT THERE, CNN ANCHOR JAKE TAPPER. BREAKING NEWS -- I KNOW A GIRL. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WE HAVE RECEIVED SO MANY OF THESE AND, AS I PROMISED, WE'RE GIVING A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY CELEBRITY PHOTO. I AM PLEASED TO SAY THE COUNT IS IN AND WE HAVE A GRAND TOTAL OF $233,000 FOR PUERTO RICO RELIEF! BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! PLEASE WELCOME, LIVE VIA TELEPHONE FROM ARGENTINA, THE STAR OF NETFLIX'S "BIG MOUTH," NICK KROLL! NICK, ARE YOU THERE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES!
Stephen: I HEAR YOU'VE GOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE, NICK.
THAT'S RIGHT, STEPHEN. I WANTED TO GET IN ON THE ACTION, SO I PULLED SOME STRINGS, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT I WILL BE ADDING ANOTHER $100,000 FOR PUERTO RICO RELIEF.
Stephen: $100,000? THAT IS FANTASTIC! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT BRINGS OUR NEW TOTAL TO $333,000! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NICK, THAT'S WONDERFUL. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, NICK. WHERE DID YOU GET $100,000?
WELL, DID YOU KNOW THAT, ON THE DARK WEB, PEOPLE WILL PAY $150,000 FOR A HEALTHY LIVER?
STEPHEN: SO... ?
SO, MINE WASN'T THAT HEALTHY. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, INSTEAD, THIS MONEY IS COMING FROM ME AND EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON MY SHOW "BIG MOUTH" ON NETFLIX.
STEPHEN: IT'S INCREDIBLY GENEROUS, NICK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO YOU AND EVERYBODY WHO IS WORKING ON THAT SHOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING, NICK -- AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS FEELING GENEROUS? THE GOOD PEOPLE HERE AT CBS! WE TOLD LESLIE MOONVES THAT WE WERE DOING THIS, AND HE WANTED TO HELP. SO THEY DUG AROUND IN THE "BIG BANG THEORY'S" COUCH CUSHIONS A LITTLE, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MATCH WHAT WE'VE RAISED, DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR! SO OUR NEW GRAND TOTAL FOR PUERTO RICO RELIEF IS $666,000! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE DEVIL'S DONATION!
Stephen: I'M SORRY, THEY WERE CLAPPING, NICK. WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I SAID THAT'S THE DEVIL'S DONATION.
Stephen: YES. IF THE DEVIL WERE NICE, THAT'S HOW MUCH HE WOULD GIVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? TURNS OUT THAT CELEBRITIES AREN'T THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AWKWARD PUBERTY PHOTOS. AND, OVER THE PAST WEEK, SOCIAL MEDIA WAS FLOODED WITH GANGLY PRE-TEEN PHOTOS FROM PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS FOR PUERTO RICO RELIEF. THERE WERE OVER 75,000 TWEETS WITH THE HASHTAG #PUBERME. AND I THINK THAT DESERVES SOMETHING, TOO. SO, ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY WHO PARTICIPATED, THE AMERICONE DREAM FUND IS GOING TO MAKE A SECOND DONATION. ANOTHER $266,000. YEP. DID YOU HEAR THAT, NICK? DID YOU HEAR ME, NICK? ANOTHER $266,000.
I DID. YOU'RE DOUBLE-DONATING?
Stephen: YES. ALL RIGHT, THEN SO ARE WE. WE'RE DONATING ANOTHER $67,000, OKAY?
Stephen: ANOTHER $67,000? HOW DID YOU GET ANOTHER $67,000?
I SOLD A KIDNEY, STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. THAT BRINGS OUR GRAND TOTAL TO $999,000! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
FANTASTIC! STILL, IT'S A SHAME THAT WE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO A MILLION.
STEPHEN: I KNOW, NICK, BUT WHAT CAN WE DO? IF ONLY WE HAD ONE MORE AWKWARD CELEBRITY PUBERTY PHOTO. BUT WE JUST DON'T. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WAIT A MINUTE, STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, CREATOR AND STAR OF THE SMASH BROADWAY MUSICAL "HAMILTON?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLEASE, PLEASE!
I HEARD YOU NEEDED AN AWKWARD PICTURE AND I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.
Stephen: LIN-MANUEL, I KNOW YOU ARE HERE TO HELP. ARE YOU ALSO HERE TO PROMOTE SOMETHING?
OF COURSE! ( LAUGHTER ) I'M HERE TO PROMOTE MY NEW SONG. IT'S CALLED "ALMOST LIKE PRAYING," AND IT'S GOT JENNIFER LOPEZ, MARC ANTHONY, GLORIA ESTEFAN, FAT JOE, AND A BUNCH OF OTHER AMAZING MUSICIANS. ANY LATINO PERSON YOU LIKE IS ON THIS SONG. ( LAUGHTER ) IT DROPPED AT MIDNIGHT, AND IT ALL GOES TOWARDS HELPING PUERTO RICO REBUILD.
Stephen: INCREDIBLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S AVAILABLE ON iTunes, SPOTIFY AND TITLE. I'M GLAD YOU'RE PROMOTING THE SONG, EVERYBODY SHOULD GET IT TO HELP THE PEOPLE FOR PUERTO RICO. YOU KNOW, NICK AND I WERE ACTUALLY JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF RAISING MONEY FOR PUERTO RICO AS WELL. WE'RE JUST $1,000 SHY OF A MILLION DOLLARS. YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE AN AWKWARD PUBERTY PHOTO, DO YOU?
I'M AFRAID NOT. I'M AFRAID I LOOKED REALLY GOOD. IS THAT AWWWW --
BUT I DO HAVE AN AWKWARD PUBERTY VIDEO. ROLL IT, JIM! ♪ I CAME BACK FROM PUERTO RICO YESTERDAY ♪ AND I'M BORED ♪ OH, I HATE IT HERE IN NEW YORK ♪ DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NICE TO LIVE WITH ALL THESE NICE FOLKS ♪ BUT I DON'T LIKE IT ♪ IT REALLY SUUUUU....♪
STEPHEN: WOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNBELIEVABLE! I WISH WE HAD A MIC FOR YOU TO DROP! THAT'S INCREDIBLE! THAT'S WHAT THIS MAN GIVES! HE GIVES AND HE GIVES! A REAL VIDEO, AND YOU'RE REALLY 13 IN THAT VIDEO.
AND I'M REALLY MAKING UP A SONG ABOUT PUERTO RICO THEN. AND MY FACE IS STRUGGLING TO CATCH UP WITH MY NOSE. THAT WAS A DARK YEAR.
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE. NOT JUST A PHOTO BUT AN ACTUAL VIDEO AND A VIDEO ABOUT PRE-K O. WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT, NICK?
THAT SONG WAS SO CATCHY IT'S GOING TO BE STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR DAYS.
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD CHECK OUT "ALMOST LIKE PRAYING," WHICH IS ON SALE NOW.
Stephen: LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, THAT WAS WORTH $1,000! WHICH MEANS OUR GRAND TOTAL IS A WHOPPING $1 MILLION! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL THAT MONEY WILL BE GOING TO HELP THE PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO REBUILD AFTER HURRICANE MARIA! I WANT TO THANK CBS, NICK KROLL, LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SHARED THEIR AWKWARD PHOTOS! ALL OF YOU OUT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TO CELEBRATE ALL THE AWKWARDNESS AND ALL THE GENEROSITY WE MADE A VIDEO OF ALL THE CELEBRITIES WHO JUMPED IN TO HELP. YOU CAN CHICK IT OUT AND FIND MORE WAYS TO GIVE TO HURRICANE MARIA AT ColbertLateShow.com. AS WE GO TO COMMERCIAL, HERE'S A LITTLE TASTE. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORGAN FREEMAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR, WHO EXECUTIVE PRODUCES, DIRECTS, AND SOMETIMES STARS IN "MADAM SECRETARY."
AH, MADAM SECRETARY! CHIEF JUSTICE. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN YOU IN HERE BEFORE.
NO, I'M NOT MUCH OF A POWER BREAKFAST TYPE. NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT. I'M MORE OF A MUFFIN ON THE FLY TYPE.
GOT IT. THERE'S JUST SOMEBODY I NEED TO BUMP INTO.
YES, THERE IS, AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE SENATOR RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME MORGAN FREEMAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT THEM IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. SQUEALS OF DELIGHT WHEN YOU CAME OUT HERE LIKE THEY WERE GOOSED BY AN ICE PICK.
THEY WERE GOOSED BY THE GUY THAT COMES OUT HERE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO COACH ANYBODY TO LIKE MORGAN FREEMAN! EVERYBODY LOVES MORGAN FREEMAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE IF MORGAN FREEMAN WAS A POWERFUL PERSON IN WASHINGTON, D.C.? YOU'RE A MOUNTAIN OF DIGNITY WE NEED THAT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. RIGHT NOW, SOMEONE TO LOOK UP TO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU EVER CONSIDER POLITICS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO, STEPHEN, I NEVER DID CONSIDER POLITICS. I'M AN ACTOR, THAT WILL DO IT.
Stephen: IT'S A FINE LINE. IT'S A FINE LINE.
YOU THINK?
Stephen: YEAH, YOU BOTH MAKE THINGS UP BUT YOU GET PAID BETTER.
SO TRUE.
Stephen: NOW, THE SHOW, "MADAM SECRETARY," WE ALL KNOW WHAT WASHINGTON IS LIKE, AS I WAS SAYING, I THINK PEOPLE WATCH THAT SHOW SOMETIMES --
JUST TO GET RELIEF.
Stephen: YEAH. YEAH.
Stephen: TO SEE A WASHINGTON THAT MAKES A LILT BIT MORE SENSE TO THEM. HOW DO YOU THINK THE SHOW COMPARES TO THE REAL WASHINGTON IN YOUR MIND?
TODAY I DON'T THINK IT COMPARES AT ALL. IT'S JUST -- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFUSION ON THE SHOW BECAUSE --
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHO'S IN CONTROL, THE DIRECTOR.
WE KNOW WHO'S IN CONTROL. YEAH.
Stephen: WHICH IS YOU FOR SOME OF THE EPISODES.
ONE OF THE EPISODES. I DO THE FIRST EPISODE EVERY SEASON.
Stephen: HOW MANY SEASONS HAVE YOU DIRECTED?
THREE.
Stephen: OKAY. DOES IT GET EASIER OR DO YOU FIND THE PROCESS EASIER IN DO YOU CRACK THE WHIP OR DO YOU DRIVE THE PEOPLE REALLY HARD?
I DRIVE THE CREW. ACTORS, I DON'T FOOL AROUND WITH BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. BUT CREWS TEND TO GET A BIT COMPLACENT, YOU KNOW, THE SHOW -- I SAY, WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING, YOU ALL, AND I REMIND THEM THAT A NASCAR PIT CREW CAN CHANGE FOUR TIRES AND GIVE YOU A TANK OF GAS IN UNDER 14 SECONDS. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: I'M THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I WANT YOU TO KNOW, MY CREW IS THE BEST CREW. I NEVER HAVE TO REMIND THEM TO BE FAST AT ALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO HOW DO YOU --
BEST WAY TO GET THEM TO SPEED UP.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU REMIND THEM, NASCAR DOES IT, YOU CAN, TOO?
IF I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TAKING TOO LONG TO CHANGE A LIGHT OR SOMETHING, I GO, ZING, ZING, ZING! THAT'S THE GUY WITH THE --
Stephen: WOW, I LIKE THAT. THAT'S KIND OF GENTLE AND YET HOSTILE AT THE SAME TIME.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S MERELY A REMINDER, NOT LIKE A WHIP IS THAT THAT WE CAN DO IT BETTER.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, I LOVED YOUR SHOW "THROUGH THE WORMHOLE." ( APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW CALLED "THE STORY OF US." IS THAT ANYTHING LIKE "THIS IS US?" AM I GOING TO CRY THROUGH THE ENTIRE SHOW?
NOT THE ENTIRE SHOW. SOME EPISODES WILL BE QUITE UPLIFTING.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE MISSION?
TO SHOW US WHO WE ARE.
Stephen: HUMANITY TO HUMANITY?
HUMANITY TO HUMANITY. WHAT IT IS THAT REALLY KEEPS US TOGETHER, AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS MIGHT NOT BE A BAD TIME TO BE AIRING SUCH A SHOW BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE SPLITTING APART. WE'RE NOT.
Stephen: HOW SO? THE DIVISIVENESS IS AN ILLUSION NOW?
WE TALK ABOUT THE DIVISIVENESS, YOU KNOW, AND THE US AND THEM QUALITY OF LIFE RIGHT NOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, LIFE MOVES IN WAVES. IT'S ALMOST PREDICTABLE WHAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW WITH US.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'VE PLAYED GOD SO MANY TIMES. ( LAUGHTER ) I CAN'T SEE A THOUSAND YEARS IN THE FUTURE. IS THERE SOMEPLACE YOU WENT? HOW MANY COUNTRIES DID YOU GO TO?
WE WENT TO TEN COUNTRIES ON THIS TRIP.
Stephen: IS THERE ONE PLACE WHERE YOU LEARNED MORE ABOUT US THAN OTHER COUNTRIES?
CAN I SAY THAT -- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT, BUT I WENT TO SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA, AND I VISITED A TRIBE OF PEOPLE CALLED THE HAMMER.
Stephen: HAMMER. LIKE THE HAMMER.
Stephen: YEAH. AND THEY LIVE THERE IN THE VALLEY JUST AS THEY DID HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO. WE WERE THERE FOR THE BOW JUMPING CEREMONY WHICH IS WHAT A YOUNG MAN DOES -- THAT'S HIS RIGHT OF PASSAGE.
Stephen: HE JUMPS OVER A BULL?
HE JUMPS OVER A BUNCH OF BULLS. HE DOESN'T REALLY JUMP OVER THEM, HE UH RUNS ALONG THEM.
Stephen: STILL SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
IT IS DANGEROUS. BUT ALL OF THE FEMALES IN HIS FAMILY, AND THEY MAY NUMBER IN THE TEENS, COME OUT TO SUPPORT HIM AND TO SHOW HIM THEIR LOVE, HOW MUCH THEY LOVE HIM. THEY HAVE NINE MEN SELECTED -- I FORGET WHAT THEY CALL THEM --
Stephen: A BASEBALL TEAM. ( LAUGHTER )
-- AND THEY WHIP THESE WOMEN.
Stephen: THE BOY VONNING ON THE BACKS OF THESE BULLS?
THIS IS ALL BUILT UP TO THE MOMENT HE'LL DO THAT.
Stephen: AND THE NINE MEN ARE WHIPPING THE WOMEN?
DOESN'T JUST GO QUITE LIKE THIS.
Stephen: YOU JUST SAID THEY'RE WHIPPING THE WOMEN.
THERE ARE NINE MEN AND THEY'RE OVER THERE AND THESE LADIES ARE WEARING BELLS ON THEIR LEGS AND THEY'RE JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND HAVING FUN. THEY COLLECT THE WHIPS THEMSELVES AND THEY WILL GO OVER AND CAJOLE OR INSULT A MAN TO TAKE THIS WHIP AND GIVE ME A GOOD LICK. SO THE MAN WILL TAKE THE WHIP AND GO OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THIS CIRCLE AND GO, POW! RIGHT ACROSS THERE. AND THE WOMEN DON'T EVEN FLINCH.
Stephen: THEY GO STRAIGHT TO H.R. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY SHOULD. DON'T DO THAT. DON'T DO THAT. ( APPLAUSE ) DON'T LISTEN TO THIS PLAN.
IT GOES ON. I MEAN, I WAS -- I WANT TO SAY ENTHRALLED BUT IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.
Stephen: SOUNDS CLOSE TO RIGHT.
WELL --
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM IT, I GUESS?
DON'T DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH. THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. HOPE YOU CAN STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE MORGAN FREEMAN. DON'T GO ANYWHERE, AND DON'T WHIP ANYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WE'RE BACK WITH MORGAN FREEMAN. I LOVE HAVING YOU ON. WE DON'T HAVE YOU ON ENOUGH. WE HAVE A WONDERFUL BAND, BUT I DON'T HAVE --
YOU DO.
Stephen: -- BUT I DON'T HAVE A CO-HOST, I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY SITTING WITH ME TO JAW WITH ALL THE TIME AND I WAS WONDERING WHETHER I COULD ASK YOU TO SAY A FEW LINES WE COULD ROLL INTO THE SHOW ON NIGHTS I WISH I HAD SOMEBODY ELSE UP HERE WITH ME AND I DON'T. WOULD YOU MIND RECORDING A FEW THINGS WE COULD BANK AND HAVE ROLLED IN LATER?
I'LL DO IT, STEPHEN, BUT I'M REALLY NOT THE SIDEKICK TYPE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MIND SITTING OVER THERE FOR IT?
OKAY.
Stephen: CAN WE BRING THAT OVER HERE? ALL RIGHT. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO GO OVER THESE. SO LET'S JUST DO YOUR BEST. WHAT YOU IMAGINE IS I'M EITHER DOING MY MONOLOGUE OVER THERE OR TALKING TO A CAMERA OR A GUEST AND YOU'RE JUST THERE ALL THE TIME AND THIS IS FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT SHOWS AFTER THIS, OKAY?
LAUGH AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AND ALL THAT.
Stephen: ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. YOU CAN READ IT OFF OF HERE OR THERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: THE FIRST ONE. THIS ONE IS, ALL RIGHT, MORGAN, THIS IS IF I'M DOING THE MONOLOGUE AND I MAKE A REALLY GOOD JOKE AND THE AUDIENCE ENJOYS IT AND THE CAMERA CUTS TO YOU AND YOU SAY --
HAH. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN, STEPHEN! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. I LIKE IT. THIS IS FEELING GOOD. THIS IS FEELING GOOD. THE NEXT ONE IS, THIS WOULD HELP US WITH FUTURE EDITS IF WE HAVE TO EDIT SOMETHING AND THE CAMERA WOULD CUT TO YOU AND YOU SAY --
WOW! I DON'T THINK WE CAN SHOW THAT ON CBS. ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD THING YOU CUT TO ME. MORGAN FREEMAN.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW, WE NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE SO LET'S TO THIS AS A SAFETY HERE, MORGAN.
LOVE THAT NEW MUSTACHE, STEPHEN! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND THIS ONE IS JUST TO COVER OUR BASES.
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, STEPHEN, I WISH YOU HADN'T SHAVED BECAUSE YOU LOOKED WAY BETTER WITH THAT MUSTACHE! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NICE. ( APPLAUSE ) YOUR JOB IS ALSO TO BACK ME UP IN CELEBRITY INTERVIEWS IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO LET'S TRY THIS ONE.
COME ON, STEPHEN, ARE YOU JUST GOING TO SIT THERE AND TAKE THAT FROM ANDREW GARFIELD? ( LAUGHTER ) THROW A PUNCH!
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD. WE'VE GOT TO GET ANDREW GARFIELD ON NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF RANDOM LINES THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL EVER USE THEM BUT GOOD TO HAVE. OKAY?
I LOVE GRAVY! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY.
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: FINALLY, THE LAST LINE FROM "NOT MY SIDEKICK MORGAN FREEMAN."
SOUNDS LIKE YOU LEARNED THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS!
Stephen: MORGAN FREEMAN, EVERYBODY! "MADAM SECRETARY" RETURNS THIS SUNDAY AT 10:00 ON CBS, AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE HIM EVERY NIGHT HERE ON THE "LATE SHOW." MORGAN FREEMAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GRACE GUMMER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! YOU'VE SEEN MY NEXT GUEST ON "THE NEWSROOM," "AMERICAN HORROR STORY" AND NOW "MR. ROBOT."
ALEXA, ARE WE FRIENDS? YES. WE LIVE TOGETHER, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. ALEXA, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?
INFRARED IS SUPER PRETTY. ALEXA, DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
I'M NOT THE DATING KIND. YEAH, ME, TOO, HON.
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME GRACE GUMMER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HELLO. COME ON UP! ( BAND PLAYING ) ISN'T IT LOVELY?
YEAH.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: I'M EXCITED FOR THE THIRD SEASON OF MR. ROBOT.
ME, TOO. IT STARTS THIS WEEK.
OCTOBER 11.
Stephen: WHEN YOU DO A SHOW WHERE EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR ONLY YOUR PART OF THE SCRIPT?
NO, I TO KNOW EVERYTHING.
Stephen: CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING?
NOTHING. DOES THE WORLD LOOK MORE OR LESS LIKE OUR WORLD BECAUSE IT'S HARROWING HOW MUCH THE WORLD LOOKS LIKE OUR WORLD.
YEAH, BUT WE'RE STILL IN OBAMA DAYS ON THE SHOW, SO EVERYTHING'S BETTER.
Stephen: EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING'S TERRIBLE, EVERYTHING'S BETTER.
YEAH. ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: YOU AND REMI MALEK KNOW EACH OTHER BEFORE THE ROBOT.
YES.
Stephen: YOU AND LARRY CROWNE. EVERYBODY STARTS CHANTING WHEN I SAY THAT NAME. WERE YOU EXCITED TO GET TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN?
YES, I TEXTED HIM AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND WE HAVE YET TO HAVE A SCENE TOGETHER, SO THAT'S NOT EXCITING AS I THOUGHT.
Stephen: YOU'RE DOING SCENES WITH ALEXA.
I AM, WHO -- I HAVE AN ALEXEI BY THE WAY.
Stephen: OKAY. ARE YOU OKAY WITH SOMETHING LISTENING TO YOU ALL THE TIME?
NO, I DON'T TRUST HER.
Stephen: REALLY? HE'S ON MY (BLEEP) LIST.
Stephen: WHY? WHAT TID SHE DO TO YOU? DID SHE ORDER SOMETHING FROM AMAZON YOU DIDN'T WANT?
NO, SHE'S JUST ALWAYS THERE AND LISTENING. SHE'S LIKE MY GIRLFRIEND THAT WON'T GO AWAY. I DON'T KNOW, SHE'S WEIRD.
Stephen: UNLIKE A GIRLFRIEND, YOU CAN UNPLUG HER.
YES, BUT I STILL DON'T TRUST HER, I THINK SHE'S STILL LISTENING TO EVERYTHING. SHE'S HOOKED UP TO MY WI-FI. SHE PROBABLY HAS EYES, SHE CAN SEE AROUND MY APARTMENT. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: THAT STUFF DOESN'T BOTHER ME. THEY SAY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU THROUGH THE CAMERA ON YOUR COMPUTER, I'M, LIKE, AH, I'M GLAD SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE ME.
YOU DON'T PUT THE TAPE OVER YOUR --
NO, I'M JUST NEEDY ENOUGH. I ALWAYS LOVE TO BE ON CAMERA. I DIDN'T GET INTO THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE I WANTED NOT TO BE STARED AT.
FAIR ENOUGH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE ONE. WHAT'S THE UP SIDE OF HAVING THIS?
I DON'T USE IT. I DON'T TRUST IT SO I DON'T USE IT.
Stephen: DID YOU BUY IT? NO, I WAS GIVEN IT AS A GIFT FOR THE SHOW.
Stephen: WOW. I USED IT TO TEST IT OUT BEFORE I DID ALL THE SCENES AND SHE SAID EXACTLY WHAT SHE IS SCRIPTED TO SAY IN THE SHOW SO I TESTED HER OUT.
Stephen: SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ALEXEI'S RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS?
YES, THOSE ARE ACCURATE, REAL LIFE.
Stephen: I COULD SEE BECOMING FRIENDS WITH AN INANIMATE OBJECT.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH. DIDN'T YOU HAVE A TEDDY BEAR WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD?
YEAH, BUT IT DIDN'T TALK TO YOU AND BUY STUFF FOR YOU.
Stephen: EVEN BETTER. IT CAN TURN ON YOUR AIR CONDITIONING AND BUY YOUR FLIGHTS.
Stephen: IT CAN DO THAT? YEAH.
Stephen: MY FRIENDS DON'T DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT THIS IS A PICTURE OF YOUR MOTHER MERYL STREEP WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE AND YOU LOOK STARTLINGLY ALIKE. I ONLY SHOW THIS TO SAY YOU GREW UP WITH A FAMOUS MOTHER, YOU'VE WORKED WITH VERY FAMOUS PEOPLE. AT THIS POINT IN YOUR CAREER, DO YOU GET STAR STRUCK AT ALL WITH PEOPLE?
ALL THE TIME. I ACTUALLY, IN FACT, MET ANTHONY BOURDAIN TODAY AND I ALMOST THREW MYSELF ON HIM AND PEED IN MY PANTS AT THE SAME TIME.
Stephen: HE DOES IT FOR YOU, HU?
YES, HE'S SO COOL.
Stephen: ANTHONY BOURDAIN? YES!
Stephen: YOU'VE WORKED WITH TOM HANKS. ANTHONY'S LOVELY, DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT, YOU KNOW, HE GOES AND EATS BUGS!
I KNOW! BUT HE HAS THE BEST JOB EVER AND HE'S SO GOOD AT IT AND HE HAS THAT, YOU KNOW, VOICE.
Stephen: I BET YOU COULD GET THAT JOB.
REALLY?
Stephen: I'D PAY TO SEE YOU EAT BUGS.
REALLY?
Stephen: I THINK SO. I DON'T WANT TO EAT BUGS.
Stephen: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MOTHER THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW IS I WAS ON "FACES OF AMERICA" AS YOUR MOTHER AND WE HAD OUR DNA SEQUENCED, AND WE FOUND OUT THAT YOUR FAMILY AND MY FAMILY, WE ARE COUSINS.
YES.
Stephen: SOMEWHERE IN THE LAST TEN GENERATIONS. SO IN THE PAST 200 YEARS THERE IS A COMMON ANCESTOR BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. SO WHEN I SEE YOUR MOM I SAY, HEY, CUZ, WHAT'S UP? AND SHE SAYS, HEY, WHO ARE YOU? THE THING, IS IF WE'RE COUSINS, WE SHOULD HAVE A FAMILY REUNION SOME TIME.
WE SHOULD.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT THANKSGIVING DINNER? THAT'S WHEN YOU GET TOGETHER WITH RELATIVES YOU DON'T KNOW.
OR LIKE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TRADITIONAL?
I LOVE THE CANNED CRANBERRY SAUCE.
Stephen: SLIDES OUT, YOU SLICE IT.
LOVE IT.
Stephen: TURKEY, STUFFING? PEACE, MATCHED POTATOES, GRAVY.
Stephen: WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER, DO THAT, HAVE THE MASHED POTATOES, EVERYTHING. COULD I INVITE SOMEBODY?
YES, PLEASE.
Stephen: MORGAN FREEMAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME?
I LOVE GRAVY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FANTASTIC. THE THREE OF US. GRACE GUMMER, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: SEASON THREE OF "MR. ROBOT" PREMIERES WEDNESDAY ON USA. GRACE GUMMER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
