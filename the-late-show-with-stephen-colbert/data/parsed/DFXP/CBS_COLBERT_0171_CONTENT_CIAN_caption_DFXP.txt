Stephen: HEY, PAUL, DID YOU HEAR CHEETOS IS OFFERING $60,000 TO ANYBODY WHO FINDS A CHEETO THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY FAMOUS?
WOW. MAN! CHECK THIS OUT! IT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU!
Stephen: NO, I WEAR GLASSES.
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, PAUL... WE'RE RICH! WE'VE GOT AN ENTIRE BOWL OF DONALD TRUMP!
Announcer: TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ELLIE KEMPER! PATRICK FUGIT! AND A BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE BY WE ARE SCIENTISTS! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: HEY! HEY! WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! I'M DOWN HERE, EVERYBODY! ♪ WELCOME! WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! HERE, THERE, EVERYWHERE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." VERY EXCITED. WHAT A LOVELY CROWD. WHAT A LOVELY CROWD THIS EVENING. I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT FOR "THE LATE SHOW" TONIGHT. QUICK QUESTION BEFORE WE GET ON WITH THE REST OF THE SHOW, IS ANYBODY ON Facebook? ANYBODY HERE ON Facebook? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, THERE'S BIG NEWS FROM FACEBOOK TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE CHANGING THE ALGORITHM BEHIND YOUR NEWS FEED, AND IT'S GOING TO "LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT FROM... BRANDS, CELEBRITIES AND MEDIA" IN FAVOR OF "MORE POSTS FROM FRIENDS." AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ON FACEBOOK WHEN I SAY: "WELL, THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY FRIENDS." (APPLAUSE) JUST -- JUST PEOPLE. THE COMPANY SAYS THE TWEAK IS GOING TO BE GOOD NEWS FOR USERS WHO WANT MORE CUTE BABY PHOTOS. (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN? THERE COULD BE MORE BABY PHOTOS ON FACEBOOK? I KNOW THEY'RE YOUR BUNDLES OF JOY, BUT UNTIL THEY'RE A YEAR OLD THEY JUST LOOK LIKE LITTLE DWIGHT EISENHOWERS! (LAUGHTER) LITTLE TINY -- EACH ONE OF THEM DEFEATED HITLER. (LAUGHTER) NOW, PERSONALLY, I WANT MORE POSTS FROM BRANDS. I LOVE CHEEZ-ITS. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONE OF MY FACEBOOK FRIENDS I ACTUALLY SPEND TIME WITH. BEEN TO BED WITH THEM A FEW TIMES, TOO. OF COURSE, SOMEONE IS CHEERING THE IDEA OF ME HAVING SEX WITH A SNACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (CHEERING) OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IS STILL AT LARGE. CAN'T SEEM TO STOP IT. EVERY DAY I CHECK THE NEWS. BUT EVERY DAY, OUR TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE STILL HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FINDING IT HARD TO GET EXCITED FOR THESE TWO CANDIDATES, AND NOTHING PROVES THAT MORE THAN THIS ACTUAL NEW POLL FROM PUBLIC POLICY POLLING. HILLARY CLINTON GOT 43%, DONALD TRUMP GOT 38%, AND, THIS WAS AN ACTUAL CHOICE, A GIANT METEOR HITTING THE EARTH GOT 13%. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ 38% FOR TRUMP, 13% FOR A METEOR, THAT ADDS UP TO 51% OF THE PEOPLE ARE OKAY WITH THE WORLD COMING TO AN END. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TWO GIANT DESTRUCTIVE ORANGE BALLS. (LAUGHTER) THE GIANT METEOR HITTING THE EARTH POLLED PARTICULARLY WELL AMONG INDEPENDENT VOTERS, AND UNSPRISINGLY, POORLY AMONGST DINOSAURS. NOW TRUMP MIGHT BE GETTING A BOOST IN THE POLLS BECAUSE SOURCES SAY TRUMP IS VETTING CHRIS CHRISTIE AS A POTENTIAL RUNNING MATE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) CHRISTIE WOULD DEFINITELY HELP TRUMP WIN VOTERS IN NEW JERSEY, WHO ARE ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF CHRIS CHRISTIE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) ♪ # THE SOURCE CLAIMS CHRISTIE HAS BEGUN THE OFFICIAL VETTING PROCESS, WHICH I BELIEVE MEANS TRYING TO SELL MORE LEMONADE IN TIMES SQUARE THAN GARY BUSEY. (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, YESTERDAY, OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN CANADA. LIKE MANY AMERICANS, I ASSUME HE -- (APPLAUSE) -- I ASSUME HE WAS APPLYING FOR CITIZENSHIP UP THERE. (LAUGHTER) BUT HE WAS ALSO THERE FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN LEADERS' SUMMIT WITH MEXICAN PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PENA NIETO AND CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER AND DISNEY PRINCESS JUSTIN TRUDEAU. (LAUGHTER) VERY PRETTY. HE'S VERY, VERY PRETTY. THIS WAS OBAMA'S LAST TIME AT THE SUMMIT, AND THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENT BEGGED FOR AN ENCORE. (SHOUTING... )
FOUR MORE YEARS! FOUR MORE YEARS!
STEPHEN: WOW, MAYBE HE CAN GET THEM TO CONFIRM HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. BUT THE BIG MOMENT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IS THIS AWKWARD HANDSHAKE. TRUDEAU HAS OBAMA'S HAND, GOES FOR NIETO'S AND-- NOOOO! FORGET IT. JUST FORGET IT. TYPICAL THREESOME. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA, BUT IT'S JUST AWKWARD. THERE'S ALWAYS ONE GUY WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT HIS HANDS. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. STALIN, CHURCHILL, AND F.D.R. HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AT YALTA.
LEAVE HIM ALONE!
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN! (BAND PLAYING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (HUMMING) (CHEERING) THAT'S NICE. OH. OOH... YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SO EXCITED. IT'S SUMMER. I WANT TO GET A TAN. I'M GOING TO SWIM. I'M GOING TO DRINK IT ALL IN. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SUMMER I ACTUALLY ENJOY. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING ON VACATION THIS SUMMER, YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT GOING TO CHINA BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT DISNEYLAND THERE NOW. THE NEW $5.5 BILLION DISNEYLAND PARK. THIS A HUGE CROSS-CULTURAL MOMENT. NOW THAT DISNEYLAND IS IN CHINA, CHILDREN THERE WILL HAVE CONTEXT FOR THE TOYS THEY'VE BEEN MAKING. THE PARK IS ALREADY A HUGE SUCCESS, BUT, APPARENTLY, A LOT OF NAMES OF DISNEY PROPERTIES DON'T TRANSLATE WELL INTO CHINESE, SO THEY HAD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES, LIKE RENAMING DUMBO "LITTLE FLYING ELEPHANT," RENAMING FROZEN, "ENCHANTED DESTINY OF SNOW," AND THE "BIBBITI BOBBITI BOUTIQUE" WAS RENAMED "COLORFUL MAGICAL FANCIFUL TRANSFORMATION. AND MICKEY MOUSE IS NOW CHAIRMAN MOUSE. AND IT'S NOT JUST CHINA THAT -- MM-HMM. THAT'S GOOD. AND IT'S NOT JUST CHINA THAT RENAMES THINGS TO SOMETHING MORE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. I IDENTIFY WITH THIS PROBLEM. BECAUSE THE "LATE SHOW" IS BROADCAST EVERYWHERE FROM PRUSSIA TO SIAM. BOY, WE REALLY NEED TO UPDATE THE MAPS IN THE WRITER'S ROOM. SO I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU ON A TRIP AROUND THE GLOBE, AND SHARE SOME OF THE CHANGES WE HAVE TO MAKE FOR INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES. THIS IS "LATE SHOW CULTURAL TRANSLATIONS." ♪
Stephen: WELCOME TO "LATE SHOW CULTURAL TRANSLATIONS." FIRST UP, WE AIR IN ENGLAND, WHICH MEANS IF WE DO ANY PRODUCT PLACEMENT OF THE CANDY REESE'S PIECES, WE HAVE TO USE ITS BRITISH NAME RUNSON'S TIDBITS. MMMM! A STOUT FIST OF RUNSON'S WILL REALLY CHUFF YOUR GOB. (LAUGHTER) ALSO, THIS SHOW AIRS IN CAMEROON, WHERE WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR NAME, "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" TO TWILIGHT SHENANIGANS WITH CAUCASIAN SUIT BUFFOON... "THE ONE WITH GLASSES." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) IT'S HARD TO TELL US APART. I'M THE ONE WITH THE GLASSES. I'D WATCH THAT SHOW. ALL RIGHT. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT POLITICS ON THIS SHOW, BUT FOREIGNERS OFTEN HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF REFERRING TO OUR CANDIDATES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS, TO PEOPLE IN GHANA, I'M COVERING THE RACE BETWEEN -- WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG WITH A STACK OF CARDS THIS HIGH?! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ WHO KNOWS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR OUR LAST SHOW. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT POLITICS ON THIS SHOW. WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS, TO PEOPLE IN GHANA, I'M COVERING THE RACE  BETWEEN TENSE-MERRIMENT CORPORATION WOMAN AND RUMPLED GIVEAWAY GRANDPA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE YOU GO RIGHT THERE! YOU CAN HAVE THAT RIGHT THERE! ALL RIGHT. NOW, LET'S SEE. OKAY -- OH. AND IN THAILAND REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER DONALD TRUMP IS MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS "IMPOSSIBLE PROMISE TUXEDO GOBLIN." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HERE'S AN INTERESTING FACT. WHENEVER THE SHOW IS BROADCAST IN RUSSIA, IF I EVER REFER THE POPULAR KIDS' PIZZA ARCADE CHUCK E. CHEESE'S, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT TO "COMMANDANT VERMIN'S MUSICAL PIZZA HELL." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE. EVEN IN CANADA THERE ARE CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE TO CHANGE THE TITLE OF THE UPCOMING COMIC BOOK MOVIE "SUICIDE SQUAD" TO "MOPEY AVENGERS GO TO HOT TOPIC." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) MM-HMM. IN MEXICO, TACO BELL'S QUESALUPA IS CALLED "DRUNK GRINGO MEAT SLURRY CREPE." (APPLAUSE) I COULD GO FOR ONE OF THOSE. I COULD GO FOR A GRINGO MEAT SLURRY CREPE NOW. IN ROMANIA, OUR FELLOW CBS SHOW "TWO BROKE GIRLS" TRANSLATES TO "IMPOVERISHED FEMALE SEX CLOWNS." WELL, THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR CULTURAL TRANSLATION -- OR AS IT'S KNOWN IN ECUADOR: BORDERLINE RACIST, BROKEN LANGUAGE DESK BIT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ELLIE KEMPER!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE STAR OF THE HIT SERIES "UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT."
I MET A REALLY CUTE GUY AT A RESTAURANT WHERE I PEED.
GROSS. TELL ME MORE.
A HANDSOME SOLDIER LIKE LIEUTENANT DAN, COL. SANDERS. AND HE THOUGHT I WAS A SOLDIER, TOO, BECAUSE I'M TOUGH LIKE A SOLDIER! HYAY! SOMETIMES I FELT LIKE I WAS MOVING BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND ANY WAY BUT FORWARD.
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FLEET WEEK.
THIS IS A GUY WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT I WENT THROUGH.
WHEN ARE YOU SEEING HIM AGAIN?
I DIDN'T DO THAT PART. WHAT I DO SAY? DON'T TOUCH MY DOLLS, THEY'RE STRICTLY LOOK UPONS.
NO, THE DIGITS! THE DIGITS!
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME ELLIE KEMPER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
YEA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU. LOVELY TO SEE YOU. I CAN COVER EVERYTHING. THIS IS A TENT.
Stephen: A VERY JEFFERSON DRESS. WHAT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE AT HOME IS YOU'RE QUITE --
PREGNANT.
Stephen: EXACTLY HOW PREGNANT ARE WE TALKING?
WE'RE TALKING FINAL WEEKS.
Stephen: THE HOME STRETCH. YES, EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL.
Stephen: EVERYTHING GOING AS PLANNED?
YES.
Stephen: FIRST CHILD. YOU HAVE NO PLAN.
EXACTLY, LIFE IN GENERAL. I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE BEFORE GETTING PREGNANT I RESOLVED TO DO ALL THESE THINGS DURING MY PREGNANCY TO NURSE A HEALTHY PREGNANCY. I'M FINDING I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THEM -- PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC AND READING WAR AND PEACE TO MY KID. (LAUGHTER) A YEAR AGO I BOUGHT ALL THESE SARDINES.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE OMEGA 3s. THE FISHY OILS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: I'M A WIFE OF THREE SO I WATCHED MY WIFE GO THROUGH THE SAME THING. WANTING TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND KNOWING YOU CAN'T.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T, BY THE WAY.
OKAY, GOOD.
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVEN'T BEEN A FAILURE SO FAR AS A MOTHER. YOU HAVE. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
Stephen: I'M JUST SAYING EVERYONE MAKES MORE PLANS THAN THEY CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH.
THAT IS COMFORTING. EVEN THOUGH I FAILED.
Stephen: WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE SARDINES FOR YOU HERE.
SEE, THE THING IS -- THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU. THE REASON I DIDN'T EAT ANY SARDINES IS I HATE SARDINES. BUT I AM A SELFLESS MOTHER, SO --
Stephen: TAKE A WHIFF OF THAT.
OH, GOSH. I'M MY MOTHER'S DAUGHTER. I DON'T LIKE FISH. OH!
Stephen: THAT IS TRULY, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO EAT THIS WHILE PREGNANT, THAT'S A FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL (LAUGHTER) YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT THIS, DO YOU?
YES, FOR BABY.
Stephen: MMM... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T LIKE IT!
Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT SAVE THE REST OF THAT FOR LATER!
I THINK YOU SHOULD!
Stephen: FANTASTIC! ON THE OTHER HAND, I CAN FEEL BABY GETTING SMARTER.
Stephen: WHO NEEDS BEETHOVEN?! (APPLAUSE)
WHO NEEDS BEETHOVEN.
Stephen: IS YOUR OWN MOTHER EXCITED ABOUT YOUR PREGNANCY?
SHE'S VERY EXCITED.
Stephen: FULL OF ADVICE? YES, SHE HAS GOOD ADVICE. SHE HAS FOUR CHILDREN, AND I'M ONE OF THEM, AND MY BROTHER HAS THREE KIDS, BUT THIS WILL BE HER, I DON'T KNOW, FIRST GRANDCHILD FROM ME, SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED.
Stephen: FIRST GRANDCHILD THAT COUNTS IS WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY. (LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT.
Stephen: YOU GUYS CAN BOND. EXACTLY.
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY A PRACTICING CATHOLIC.
LIKE YOU.
Stephen: YEAH. YES, I AM. I AM A PRACTICING CATHOLIC.
Stephen: I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SHOWBIZ WHO SAY THEY'RE A RECOVERING CATHOLIC. BUT YOU'RE STILL STICKING IN THERE?
I'M IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL. IF YOU DROP OUT, I WILL. BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN IT, I'LL STAY WITH YOU.
Stephen: I WAS ONLY IN IT BECAUSE YOU ARE.
SO WE'RE TIED. YES, I AM CATHOLIC. MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY IS COMING UP IN A WEEK AND MY HUSBAND -- (CHEERING) THANKS, GUYS. IT'S VERY MEANINGFUL TO ME FOR MANY REASONS BUT MY HUSBAND WHO'S NOT CATHOLIC, HE'S JEWISH, AND THAT'S FINE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I HOPE HE'S WATCHING AND FOUND OUT THAT'S FINE. I KNOW YOUR HUSBAND, HE'S A GREAT GUY, A HILARIOUS WRITER.
YES, HE IS.
Stephen: PASS THAT ON TO HIM.
I L. HE'S ALSO JEWISH. HE GAMELY AGREED TO GET MARRIED IN A CATHOLIC CHURCH BECAUSE IT MEANT A LOT TO ME. WE DID A LOT OF THINGS YOU DID GROUP.  MARRIED IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, RIGHT?
Stephen: I DIDN'T. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW...
Stephen: IS THE BABY OKAY? (LAUGHTER) I GOT MARRIED BY A CATHOLIC PRIEST AND EPISCOPAL MINISTER IN A PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. WE HAD EVERYTHING EXCEPT JEWS. WE SHOVELED EVERYTHING INTO THE PILE HOPING ONE WOULD LISTEN.
EXACTLY. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. SO YOU MAYBE DIDN'T DO PRECANA.
Stephen: WE DID THAT. IT'S THE THING WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO ONE RETREAT WEEKEND OR MULTIPLE WEEKENDS AND BE TAUGHT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE MARRIED.
IT WAS A LOT OF GOOD PRE-MARITAL ADVICE. MICHAEL AND I HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW WILL WE RAISE THE FUTURE CHILDREN BECAUSE WE'RE TWO DIFFERENT FAITHS AND HADN'T REACHED A RESOLUTION. IN THE CEREMONY, WHICH WASN'T A CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE PRIEST FATHER O'CONNOR, A SOFT-SPOKEN, WISE, GROUNDED CATHOLIC PRIEST, THERE WAS ONE QUESTION, HE WAS SAYING, WILL YOU HONOR EACH OTHER ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE? YES, I WILL. YOU COME HERE FREELY TO JOIN YOURSELVES IN HOLY MATRIMONY? YES, WE DO. AND THEN IT WAS WILL YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, I WAS SO WORRIED, MICHAEL WHO CAN'T LIE, I WAS WORRIED HE WAS GOING TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW OR SOMETHING. I LOUDLY SAID, I WILL! AND I SAW MICHAEL GO SOFTLY OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH... OKAY...
Stephen: YOU'VE WORKED IT OUT.
WE HAVE.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON KIMMY SCHMIDT, WHICH IS SO HILARIOUS. (APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE A BIG STAR AND DOING A LOT OF COMMERCIALS, I UNDERSTAND.
I'M GOING A LOT OF COMMERCIALS THESE DAYS.
Stephen: IS IT FUN? IS IT LIKE ACTING?
IT IS LIKE ACTING. I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS YOUR CHARACTER MOTIVATION IS SEND YOUR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL.
Stephen: YEAH, OKAY. WELL, I'VE DONE A LILT BIT OF IT HERE. I'VE DONE A LOT OF ACTING. I'VE DONE COMMERCIALS OVERSEAS. I ACTUALLY REPRESENT -- THERE IS A KOREAN MAN SPANX THAT I REPRESENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH!
Stephen: YEAH. OOH LA-LA!
Stephen: THE NAME IS UNTRANSLATABLE IN ENGLISH. (LAUGHTER) I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE DONE FOREIGN ADS AS WELL.
WE DID A FOREIGN AD FOR A NEW RUSSIAN GUM.
Stephen: OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF THIS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HER COMMERCIAL. (LAUGHTER) OH! PURE GUM! (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (BOOMS) ♪ (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WOW. THAT'S GOOD. YOU CAN REALLY TASTE THE STURGEON.
AND THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
Stephen: YEAH. WELL, THE SECOND SEASON OF "UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT" IS NOW STREAMING ON NETFLIX. THE GREAT ELLIE KEMPER, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! LOVELY PEOPLE. WONDERFUL CROWD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM MOVIES LIKE "GONE GIRL" AND "ALMOST FAMOUS." HIS NEW SHOW IS "OUTCAST."
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP. YOU CAN'T EVEN SIT IN THAT PANTRY NOW.
WHAT? PADLOCK ON THE DOOR. YOU USED TO DRAW PICTURES. DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE. I KNOW YOU KYLE BARNES. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME PATRICK FUGIT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."
THANK YOU, SIR.
Stephen: AND WELCOME TO LATE NIGHT. I UNDERSTAND WE'VE ALL KNOWN YOU FOR 16 YEARS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE BEEN ON A LATE NIGHT SHOW, I UNDERSTAND.
THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen: WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH. SO WHY NOT? YOU WERE ALMOST FAMOUS AND AFTER THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BECOME ALL THE WAY FAMOUS? YOU JUST DIDN'T TO THE LATE NIGHT SHOWS? YOU DID FILMS.
WELL, KATE HUDSON IS WAY BETTER LOOKING THAN ME.
Stephen: SHE. I DON'T TAKE OFFENSE. I KNEW AT THE TIME I KNOW WHERE I STAND.
Stephen: YEAH, MM-HMM. AFTER THAT, THERE WAS A NICE WAVE OF MOMENTUM FOR ME BUT A LOT OF OFFERS TO PLAY THE SAME KIND OF ROLE. YOU KNOW, KID FALLS IN LOVE, DOESN'T GET THE GIRL BUT ENDS UP LEARNING A LIFE LESSON, THAT KIND OF THING. SO I OPTED TO PLAY A METH HEAD FOR THE NEXT ROLE INSTEAD.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. YEAH, A METH HEAD.
Stephen: DOES THE METH HEAD GET THE GIRL, THOUGH?
NO, HE GETS SHOT IN THE NUTS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. BY THE WAY, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE FROM UTAH. ARE YOU FROM SALT LAKE CITY ITSELF?
I GREW UP THERE.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO GROW UP THERE? I LOVE UTAH. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
IT IS.
Stephen: BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT A MORMON.
NO.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE GROWING UP IN SALT LAKE CITY? LIKE AN ATHEIST GROWING UP AT THE VATICAN? IS IT A WHOLE CULTURE OUT THERE?
THERE'S NOT AS MANY L.D.S. PEOPLE IN SALT LAKE CITY AS PEOPLE THINK, BUT I WENT TO A PREDOMINANTLY L.D.S. SCHOOL SYSTEM, SO I GREW UP WITH A LOT OF MORMON KIDS, AND I'M NOT MORMON, SO WHEN THEY ALL FIND OUT YOU'RE NOT BEING BAPTIZED, WHICH IS THIRD GRADE, WHICH IS AN AWESOME TIME FOR PEOPLE TO FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE SUPER WEIRD, I DID NOT BELONG TO A WARD AND THOSE ARE AWKWARD QUESTIONS TO ANSWER. I ALSO DID BALLET.
Stephen: YOU DID BALLET? I DID. I DON'T ANYMORE, REGRETFULLY. I DID NOT PLAY FOOT BALL, SOCCER OR GO TO A WARD, SO I WAS WEIRD.
Stephen: WERE YOU A BAD CHILD?
NO, I WAS A CUT-UP. I WAS, LIKE, THE CLASS CLOWN WHEN I NEEDED TO BE.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT BALLET CLASS. WERE YOU A CUT-UP IN BALLET CLASS? CAN YOU BE A CUT-UP IN BALLET CLASS?
YOU CAN, YEAH. IT'S NOT A GOOD MOVE. (LAUGHTER) MY MOTHER WAS MY BALLET TEACHER.
Stephen: WOW... NO PRESSURE.
NO PRESSURE AT ALL. AND SHE'S A DELIGHTFUL WOMAN. SHE'S THE BEST MOTHER I COULD ASK FOR. SHE HAS THOSE FELT COLORING BOOKS. I'LL WALK INTO THE KITCHEN AND SHE'LL SAY, YOU WANT TO COLOR WITH ME, PATT PATTY?
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD?
LIKE THREE WEEKS AGO.
Stephen: THAT'S A VERY SWEET STORY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. WHEN SHE TEACHES, SHE'S NOT TO BE TOYED WITH. SHE CALL HER MISS JAN.
Stephen: YOU GOT NO SPECIAL TREATMENT.
SHE WAS EXTRA HARD ON ME. BUT I DESERVED IT.
Stephen: WERE YOU A BAD DANCER?
YEAH, I WAS IN A ROOM IN TIGHTS WITH A BUNCH OF PRETTY GIRLS WHO WERE ALSO IN TIGHTS. AND I WAS, LIKE, THIS IS THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR ME. YOU MAKE GIRLS LAUGH. I THOUGHT THAT'S HOW YOU DID IT.
Stephen: SURE. IT NEVER WORKED AT THAT AGE, BUT I TRIED. AND MOM, MAN, SHE COULD MAKE ANYBODY CRY IN CLASS ON THE SPOT.
Stephen: REALLY? EVEN NOW, YEAH.
Stephen: HOW? HE'LL JUST PUT YOU ON THE SPOT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY. SHE CALLS OUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BALLET IS SERIOUS. THEY GET SUPER SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR BALLET.
Stephen: AND THEY PROBABLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU GO "SUPER SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR BALLET," PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL (LAUGHTER)
DON'T LIKE THAT, YEAH.
Stephen: THE SHOW IS CALLED "OUTCAST," AND YOU CAST OUT DEMONS IN THIS SHOW. DO YOU BELIEVE IN DEMONIC POSSESSION, THINGS LIKE THAT?
YOU KNOW, I DON'T, BUT I'M NOT CLOSING THE DOOR ON IT. I HAVEN'T SEEN, YOU KNOW, SOME THINGS. SO, YOU KNOW, I'VE LED A FAIRLY UNEVENTFUL -- (COUGHING) -- EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND -- NORMAL LIFE.
Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN POSSESSED.
IT'S MY FAULT. I CURSED YOU.
Stephen: AS A CATHOLIC, I CAN'T HELP IT. I KNOW IT'S NOT REAL, BUT IT'S TOTALLY REAL TO ME. I CAN'T WATCH THE EXORCIST. THAT WOULD FREAK ME OUT. THE LITTLE CLIP WE HAD, VERY FREAKY AND SCARY. SO IT DOESN'T SCARE YOU AT ALL. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUPERSTITIONS?
I DON'T LIKE SHARKS, BUT THAT'S JUST A SENSIBLE --
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A SUPERSTITION. THERE IS EVIDENCE THEY EXIST. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH. SO I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT. BUT EMPTY CHAIRS WILL FREAK ME OUT. IN THE HOTEL I'M STAYING AT, THEY HAD A WHOLE COUCH, AND THE COUCH WAS EMPTY AND I WOKE UP AT 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING AND IT WAS EMPTY AND I COULD JUST SEE SOMETHING SITTING THERE STARING AT ME. (LAUGHTER) THERE WAS CLEARLY NOTHING THERE.
Stephen: YOU SENSED SOMETHING THERE.
I GOT UP AND I PUT MY CLOTHING ON THE COUCH JUST SO IF SOMETHING WERE TO SIT THERE, THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE IT AND I WOULD KNOW.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO FREAK YOU OUT. (LAUGHTER) RIGHT OVER THERE. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. HOLD ON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. FEELING BETTER?
YES, THANK YOU.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON "OUTCAST" WHICH AIRS FRIDAYS ON CINEMAX. PATRICK FUGIT, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK SCHMPLET.
Stephen: OH, HEY! HEY, FOLKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. HAS ANYBODY HERE EVER BEEN TO THE WAFFLE HOUSE? THEY'RE PREDOMINANTLY A SOUTHERN THING. STARTED IN THE SOUTH. I GREW UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA (CHEERING) WHEN I WAS A KID, REALLY STARTING IN HIGH SCHOOL, AFTER ME AND MY FRIENDS, LIKE ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS, CHIP HILL, THIS GUY RIGHT HERE, THAT'S ME IN THE BACKGROUND, THERE IS CHIP BEING POSSESSED BY, LET'S SAY, A NEED TO GO TO WAFFLE HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT. WE WOULD ALWAYS GO TO THIS ONE WAFFLE HOUSE IN CHARLESTON AND ORDER THE LEFT SIDE TO HAVE THE MENU. WE WROTE A SONG CALLED NO SHIRT, NO SHOES, NO KNUCKLE HEADS. WE DID IT ON THE SHOW, SHOWED IT TO WAFFLE HOUSE AND THEY PUT IT ON THE DAMN JUKEBOX! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM. SO WE WENT DOWN TO THE EXACT WATCHING HOUSE THAT I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD AT TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAD REALLY DONE IT AND TO GET A TASTE OF THE WAFFLE HOUSE LIFESTYLE. JIM?
HI, I'M HERE WITH STURNLGLE SIMPSON. WE'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO THE WAFFLE HOUSE I SPENT MY YOUNG DRUNKENNESS IN AND WE'LL PLAY OUR SONG OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE JUKEBOX. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

OW! WHOO! IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
WELL, STURGLE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO HAVE YOUR SONG ON THE WAFFLE HOUSE JUKEBOX?
I COULD NEVER IMAGINE THIS COULD BE A REALITY.
Stephen: I KNOW THE FEELING. I CAN HONESTLY SAY, AS LONG AS MY FAMILY ISN'T WATCHING, THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME. BEFORE THE WORLD HOUSE PREMIERE, WE WANTED TO MEET WAFFLE WAFFLE HOUSEMATES. ARE YOU READY TO PARTY?

WHERE YOU GUYS BEEN ALL NIGHT?
Stephen: YOU GUYS NOT GETTING MUCH SLEEP LATELY OR SOMETHING? WHAT'S UP?
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE COOL. WE'RE TOTALLY COOL.
Stephen: YOU GUYS COOL? OBVIOUSLY.
Stephen: AND EVERYTHING WAS COOL, UNTIL STURGLE THOUGHT HE SPOTTED A KNUCKLEHEAD.
DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH HIM. DO NOT. FIGHT IT. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. YOU DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS. I'VE SEEN IT 50 TIMES. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU LOOK AT HIM. DO NOT LOOK AT HIM. DO NOT -- DO NOT --
Stephen: CRISIS AVERTED. IT WAS FINALLY TIME FOR OUR JUKEBOX PREMIERE. FIRST, THE HASH BROWN MAIDEN SCATTERED AND SMOTHERED THE RED CARPET. THEN WE CHECKED OUT THE COMPETITION.
HUH! LOOK AT THAT! I DON'T SEE ANY SONGS BY KANYE OR BEYONCE ABOUT THE WAFFLE HOUSE.
