AND PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLING A WORKING VACATION IN NEW JERSEY TODAY. THE PRESIDENT IS AT HIS GOLF COURSE IN BEDMINISTER, NEW JERSEY.
I TOLD TRUMP HE NEEDED TO PRESS 9 FOR AN OUTSIDE LINE, BUT HE TOLD ME HE ONLY PUTS HIS FINGERS ON 10s.
HE ASKED ME TO FIX THE TV BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT HIM ON IT.
I WALKED IN ON STEVE BANNON DOING A VERY STRANGE SIT-UP.
AT THIS MORNING'S BUFFET, HE TRIED TO DEPORT THE BREAKFAST BURRITO.
HE ASKED FOR HELP WITH THE MINI SHAMPOO BOTTLES, BECAUSE EVEN THOSE ARE TOO BIG FOR HIS HANDS.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT STEVE 18 TAKE ON WHAT'S INSIDE DONALD TRUMP'S EGO BRUISING. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MY MAN? HEY! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'VE EARNED IT! OH, MY GOSH. WELCOME "THE LATE SHOW"." WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. THAT RESPONSE IS LIKE AN OASIS IN THE DESERT AT THE END OF A TOUGH WEEK. IT'S FRIDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT, THAT'S IT. IT HAS BEEN A HUM DINGER OF A WEEK. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT MY DINGER IS STILL HUMMING. ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY GIVE IT A WHACK THERE. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS, IT MEANS YOU HAVE GOOD RECEPTION IN YOUR FALLOUT SHELTER. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT TONIGHT'S SHOW IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY MY NEW SPONSOR, SHEEP AND ROCKS. EVERYTHING YOU'LL NEED IN THE AFTERSCAPE. ROCKS CAN BE FLAKED INTO SIMPLE TOOLS, AND USED TO SHEER THE SHEEP, GET MEAT FROM THEIR BONES, WHICH THEN CAN BE TURNED INTO EVEN MORE COMPLEX TOOLS TO BE TRADED FOR POTABLE WATER, AND WOMEN. HERE'S THE THING-- I'M A LITTLE DOWN. I'M A LITTLE DOWN ABOUT THE STATE OF THE WORLD. IF YOU'RE DOWN ABOUT THE STATE OF WORLD, YOU'RE NOT ALONE. BECAUSE WE JUST LEARNED THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT-- HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME DOWN ON THE FROWNY FARM-- BUT HE RECEIVES A A FOLDER FULL OF POSITIVE NEWS ABOUT HIMSELF TWICE A DAY. POSITIVE NEWS TWICE A DAY? MAN, HE SHOULD REALLY SHARE IT WITH THE REST OF US. THE FOLDER IS A 20- TO 25-PAGE PACKET OF PRAISE-FILLED NEWS STORIES, DELIVERED AROUND 9:30 A.M., ALONG WITH A FOLLOW-UP AROUND 4:30 P.M. SO, ONCE AT BREAKFAST, ONCE AGAIN AFTER LUNCH, AND IF HE'S STILL CRANKY AT BEDTIME, THEY PUT UP HIS MOBILE OF BREITBART STORIES. IT'S JUST BLACK AND WHITE BECAUSE RODS AND CONES. OF COURSE, TRUMP IS A HARD MAN TO PLEASE, WHICH IS WHY THE ONLY FEEDBACK HIS STAFF HAS GOTTEN ON THESE FOLDERS IS, "IT NEEDS TO BE MORE (BLEEP) POSITIVE." ( LAUGHTER ) MORE POSITIVE? IF HE LOVES HIMSELF ANY MORE, HE'LL GO BLIND. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT EVEN FOLKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE KNOW THIS IS WEIRD. THIS IS STRANGE. BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, SOME OF THEM CALL THE FOLDER "THE PROPAGANDA DOCUMENT." NOW, HOLD THE PHONE, CHUCK. PROPAGANDA IS SUPPOSED TO BRAINWASH THE CITIZENS INTO LOVING THE LEADER, NOT BRAINWASH THE LEADER INTO LOVING HIMSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) OTHERWISE, THOSE CHINESE POSTERS WOULD HAVE SAID, "CHAIRMAN, YOU'RE DOING A-MAO-ZING!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. TRANSLATE-- DIFFERENT TRANSLATIONS. THE PRESIDENT APPARENTLY LIKES TO SEE ADMIRING TWEETS, SCREENSHOTS OF POSITIVE CABLE NEWS CHYRONS-- THOSE LOWER-THIRD HEADLINES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN-- AND SOMETIMES JUST PICTURES OF TRUMP ON TV LOOKING POWERFUL. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THAT OUT THERE. SO OUR IN-HOUSE NEWS TEAM, "REAL NEWS TONIGHT," IS READY TO HELP.
WELCOME TO REAL NEWS TONIGHT. I'M JILL NEWS LADY.
AND I'M JIM ANCHORTON.
TONIGHT WE DEBUT OUR NEWEST SEGMENT, THE DONALD TRUMP SMILE FILE.
THAT SOUNDS FUN, JILL. WHAT'S IN THE FILE TODAY.
FOR STARTERS THESE TOTALLY TRUE LOWER THIRD GRAPHICS WHICH WOULD LOOK BEAUTIFUL FRAMED ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK.
NEXT UP IN THE SMILE FILE, THE PRESIDENT LOOKS POWERFUL ON TV. HERE HE IS LIFTING A CAR TO SAVE A BABY. TRUMP LOOKS STRONG.
TRUMP IS STRONG. AND HERE HE IS PUNCHING A HOLE IN THE MOON.
NEVER SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKING ON THE MOON.
THE MOON KNEW OF HIS WEAKNESS.
FINALLY IN THE SMILE FILE, IT'S ZIPPY, THE MONKEY FRIEND YOUNG DONALD TRUMP USED TO HOLD AS HE FELL ASLEEP.
REMEMBER, DONALD. YOU THOUGHT YOU LOST ZIPPY FOREVER BUT ZIPPY IS BACK AND HE HAS A MESSAGE FOR YOU.
I LOVE YOU, DONALD. YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB AS PROPERTY PLUS, NO ONE ELSE EXISTS, AND YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO TRY.
TRUE, THAT SCRIPSTER. NEXT, THE PRESIDENT'S UPCOMING BIOPICK. STAY TUNED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU. REAL NEWS MEN. REAL NEWS MEN. ONE THING THAT DOES NOT MAKE TRUMP HAPPY IS THAT THERE EVER WAS A MAN NAMED BARACK OBAMA. IN FACT, IN A RECENT INTERVIEW, A GROUP OF EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS SAID, "TRUMP IS OBSESSED WITH OBAMA AND CARES ONLY ABOUT UNDOING HIS POLICIES." THAT'S NOT FAIR. HE ALSO CARES ABOUT CHOCOLATE CAKE, ICE CREAM, AND TWO OF HIS CHILDREN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AS WOON-- AS ONE-- THE NICE ONES. AS ONE DIPLOMAT PUT IT, "IT'S HIS ONLY REAL POSITION. HE WILL ASK, 'DID OBAMA APPROVE THIS?' AND IF THE ANSWER IS AFFIRMATIVE, HE WILL SAY, 'WE DON'T.' 'WHAT DID OBAMA ORDER FOR DINNER AT THE G20, THE CHICKEN? I'M GOING WITH THE FISH, AND I'M TAKING AWAY THE CHICKEN'S HEALTHCARE.'" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL FIX THAT. WE'LL FIX THAT. WE'LL FIX THAT. THAT'S FIXABLE. INTERNATIONALLY, TRUMP HAS BECOME SUCH AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE THAT ONE GROUP OF DIPLOMATS PLAYS A VERSION OF WORD BINGO WHEN TRUMP SPEAKS, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEY VIEW AS HIS LIMITED VOCABULARY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S FUN. I'D PLAY THAT. A DRINKY GAME. MAYBE A DRINKING GAME. AND HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WIN TRUMP BINGO.
BING! BING! BING! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BING, BING, BING, BING! AND TRUMP TOOK THIS OBAMA OBSESSION A STEP FURTHER YESTERDAY WHEN THE PRESIDENT RETWEETED A TWITTER POLL, WHICH HAS NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS, FROM A PRO-TRUMP CONSPIRACY TWITTER PAGE THAT ASKED, "WHO IS A BETTER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?" SURPRISE! TRUMP WON 61% TO 39%. WELL, HEY, LOOK-- NO WE CAN DO A POLL JUST AS SCIENTIFIC AS THAT RIGHT NOW. LET'S DO OUR POLL USING THE ELBOW-TRON 5700. WHO THINKS I WOULD BE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN DONALD TRUMP ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOLD ON. OH, LOOK AT THIS. SEE THIS? ARE YOU SEEING THIS? ARE WE ROLLING ON THIS? I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS.
Stephen: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, MY GOD, THE ELBOW-TRON HAS NEVER GONE THAT FAR BEFORE. WELL, THAT'S SCIENCE RIGHT THERE. WE CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT. SPEAKING OF POPULAR RULERS, YOU GUYS WATCH "GAME OF THRONES?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I NEVER MISS IT. I NEVER MISS IT. IT HAS THE KIND OF SEX AND DECAPITATION THAT YOU JUST DON'T GET ON "KEVIN CAN WAIT." ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE THING-- THERE ARE THREE MORE EPISODES LEFT IN THE "GAME OF THRONES" SEASON, BUT YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A BIG "GAME OF THRONES" LEAK AFTER HBO WAS HACKED. NOW, IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE NETWORK GOT HACKED-- POSSIBLY BECAUSE 300 MILLION OF US ALL SHARE THE SAME HBO-GO PASSWORD. ( LAUGHTER ) SO-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO FAR THE HACKERS HAVE POSTED STOLEN "GAME OF THRONES" SCRIPTS ONLINE AND ARE DEMANDING A BITCOIN RANSOM OF $6 MILLION. AND IF THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY, THEY SAY THEY MIGHT RELEASE NAKED PICTURES OF THE CAST. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE ALWAYS NAKED. NOW, THE HACKERS EVEN SENT A TAUNTING STATEMENT TO REPORTERS, SAYING, "HI TO ALL MANKIND. THE GREATEST LEAK OF CYBER SPACE ERA IS HAPPENING. WHAT'S ITS NAME? OH, I FORGET TO TELL. ITS HBO AND 'GAME OF THRONES.' YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE THE FIRST PIONEERS TO WITNESS AND DOWNLOAD THE LEAK. HBO IS FALLING." NOW, I'M NOT SURE WHO IT IS, BUT I'D LOOK FOR SOMEONE WHO DOUBLE-MAJORED IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TERRIBLE POETRY. NOW, DON'T ASK ME HOW. PLEASE DON'T ASK ME, JON.
Jon: I ANTICIPATE GOING THERE.
Stephen: DON'T ASK ME HOW. ARE YOU TEMPTED TO ASK ME HOW?
Jon: I'M TEMPT GLD FIGHT IT! DON'T ASK ME HOW, BUT "THE LATE SHOW" HAS OBTAINED THESE LEAKS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE, AND SINCE IT WILL ALL BECOME PUBLIC ANYWAY, WE'RE GOING TO SPOIL THE SPOILERS TONIGHT. THIS IS "A SONG OF LEAKS AND SPOILERS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HARK! A RAVEN! WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT? YOU HAVE A NOTE ON YOUR LEG AND YOU CAN'T TALK? HERE WE GO. FLY! ( LAUGHTER ) THESE ARE THE LEAKS. AS FAR AS YOU KNOW. LEAK NUMBER ONE: THE WHITE WALKERS FINALLY BREAK THROUGH THE WALL, THEN TURN TO CAMERA AND SAY, "WE ARE A HAM-FISTED ALLEGORY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LEAK NUMBER TWO: ED SHEERAN DOESN'T SHOW UP AGAIN, BUT THERE'S A SCENE WHERE ALL OF MUMFORD AND SONS GETS EATEN BY A BEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ACTUALLY LEAK. ACTUAL LEAK.
Jon: OH, WOW. >DO YOU WANT TOKNOW HOW I GOT TH
Jon: I WANT TO KNOW.
Stephen: I SAID DON'T ASK ME, JON.
Jon: I'M NOT ASKING HOW. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU GOT IT FROM.
Stephen: I GOT IT FROM THE RAVEN. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU WHO AND WHERE I GOT IT FROM.
Jon: I CAN FIGURE OUT THE THING. IF YOU GET THE RAVEN, SEE --
Stephen: NO, JON, NICE TRY. LEAK NUMBER THREE-- IS THIS THREE? IS THIS THREE SO FAR? IT FEELS LIKE MUCH MORE THAN THAT SO FAR. LEAK NUMBER THREE: DAENERYS FLIES HER DRAGON 88 MILES AN HOUR AND TRAVELS BACK IN TIME WITH MICHAEL J. FOX TO STOP HER FATHER FROM BEING MURDERED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LEAK NUMBER FOUR: ALL OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS DIE BEFORE THE LAST EPISODE, AND THE FINALE IS JUST AN HOUR OF PEOPLE FARMING. ( LAUGHTER ) I'D WATCH THAT. I WOULD WATCH THAT. I WOULD WATCH THAT IN A MINUTE. THE LAST LINE OF THE SERIES IS, LEAK NUMBER FIVE. THE LAST LINE OF THE SERIES IS: "WE CALL IT A GAME OF THRONES. YOU CALL IT MUSICAL CHAIRS. IT'S A REGIONAL THING, LIKE SODA AND POP." ( APPLAUSE ) AND FINALLY, THE LAST LEAK, LAST LEAK. NEXT SEASON, THE SERIES CHANGES ITS NAME TO ITS MORE HONEST TITLE, "LORD OF THE RINGS WITH BUTT STUFF." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. IT'S FRIDAY-- THAT MEANS "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." STICK AROUND!
Stephen: HEY! JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. RIGHT THERE. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND. JON, YOU KNOW IT'S FRIDAY. HAVE YOU GOT PLANS FOR THE WEEKEND?
Jon: OH, MAN, I'M JUST CHILLING OUT THIS WEEKEND, STAYING IN NEW YORK. WALKING AROUND CENTRAL PARK. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HAPPENING?
Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT DO THE SAME THING. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE. I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET BACK ON MONDAY. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO GET IN  THE WAY OF THE FACT I'M TALKING TO ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI ON MONDAY. THERE'S THE MOOCH. I WONDER IF HE GETS THAT EVERYWHERE HE GOES NOW? I'M GOING TO ASK HIM ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS LIKE, "HOW DID YOU GET ALL YOUR WORK DONE SO FAST THAT YOU LEFT IN 10 DAYS?" THAT'S SO EFFICIENT. ANYWAY, COME ON OVER, STAB EDDIE-STAB EDDIE. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. I AM A CATHOLIC. BUT I'M SO BUSY, I HARDLY MAKE IT TO CHURCH ANY MORE. IT'S WHAT WE CATHOLICS CALL, "HOLY GHOSTING." ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHAT I MISS MOST ABOUT MY CHURCH IS CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience: OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, RILE BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ FORGIVE ME AUDIENCE. AFTER EVERYTHING HE'S SEEN ME DO, IF MY DOG COULD TALK, I DON'T THINK WE'D BE ON SPEAKING TERMS. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, AUDIENCE, IF I LIKE A PHOTO OF YOUR BABY ON FACEBOOK, IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S CUTE. IT'S BECAUSE I'M IMAGINING HOW YOU MADE THAT BABY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) GOOD JOB, BY THE WAY. GOOD JOB. I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD MACK A BABY THAT WAY. AUDIENCE, I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TALK IN MOVIES, BUT I STILL THINK I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HUM THE "JEOPARDY" THEME DURING THE BORE PARTS. SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, I PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT SPORTS MORE THAN I ACTUALLY DO. GO, SPORTS. ( LAUGHTER ) GO, SPORTS. PUT THE THING-- PUT THE THING, OR THE BALL, OR WHATEVER, WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE AND DON'T LET THE OTHER GUYS PREVENT YOU FROM DOING IT. ( LAUGHTER ) I ALWAYS ADD GUACAMOLE, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT I'M IN. SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS? TOSS SOME GAWK MOLLY ON THERE. AUDIENCE, I DON'T HAVE DRAWERS FOR MY CLOTHES. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE DRYER IS FOR. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, THE MOST EXERCISE I EVER GOT FROM MY TREADMILL WAS DRAGGING IT OUT TO THE GARBAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES I TURN OFF MY MY CAR'S G.P.S. A FEW BLOCKS FROM HOME SO I CAN FEEL LIKE AN EXPLORER. ( LAUGHTER ) I STILL HAVE NO IDEA IF ALUMINUM FOIL IS RECYCLABLE. BUT IF IT IS... COULD SOMEONE PICK THIS UP? ( APPLAUSE ) ( HUMMING "JEOPARDY" THEME ) WHENEVER SOMEONE SAYS "GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT," I WAIT A LITTLE, THEN I SLAP THEM. ( APPLAUSE ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE.
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M PRETTY EXCITED. AND YOU KNOW WHY.
Jon: OH, YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY ENTERTAINER YOU KNOW FROM HIS STAND-UP AND, OF COURSE, FROM THAT SHOW OF HIS. HE'S NOW APPEARING THROUGHOUT THIS MONTH AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL. PLEASE WELCOME MR. DAVE CHAPPELLE. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
THANKS, YOU GUYS.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. I DON'T KNOW WHY-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I GOT, LIKE, NERVOUS WHEN YOU DID THAT.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE DOING A RESIDENCY AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL FOR 14 DAYS IN AUGUST, RIGHT? YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE YOUR FIRST SHOW.
ACTUALLY
I GOT LIKE- , I THINK AS OF A DAY OR SO, IT WILL BE 16.
Stephen: SO YOU ADDED TWO MORE SHOWS.
WE ADDED TWO MORE SHOWS, SOLANGE IS JOINING US. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT LINEUP. USHER IS JOINING US. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THIS IS WHAT THE SOUND IS LIKE AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL BUT TIMES TEN BECAUSE THERE ARE 4,000 PEOPLE IN THERE.
NOW I'M NERVOUS AGAIN.
Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THESE SHOWS. YOU KNOW, THE REASON I'M DOING THIS RESIDENCY IS IT'S A PERSONAL THING. IT'S, LIKE, MY 30th ANNIVERSARY IN COMEDY. (APPLAUSE) AND AS YOU WILL KNOW, THIS IS A HECK OF A BUSINESS TO SURVIVE THAT LONG. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK I WOULD MAKE IT THAT FAR.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN?
ACTUALLY, TO BE HONEST, I UPON UPON THOUGHT I WOULD DO MUCH BETTER THAN I DID.
Stephen: WE THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE FOR A WHILE.
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS FUNNY-- THE WHOLE TIME NOBODY SAW ME, I IT WASN'T LIKE I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING. WASN'T UNDER THE HOT LIGHTS.
Stephen: YOU WERE WORKING OUT. THIS IS WHAT YOU-- THIS IS YOU NOW IN CASE THIS DIDN'T GIVE IT AWAY. MAY I TOUCH YOU?
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT, STEPHEN.
Stephen: ARE YOU SO FAMOUS YOU NEED TO BE YOUR OWN SECURITY DETAIL? WHAT LED YOU TO THE PUMPED, RIPPED, FULLY SHREDDED AND EXPLODED DAVE CHAPPELLE OVER HERE? BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE BEEF.
NO, NO. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. IT WASAVE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
NO, NO, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. STEP ONE I GOT MARRIED. AND, YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE COMES WITH SNACKS AND NAPS.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE LUCKY YEAH.
I'M A LUCKY GUY. AND THEN AFTER THAT, IT WAS, LIKE, WHEN I QUIT THE SHOW, I WAS JUST, LIKE, STRESSED ALL THE TIME. SO I JUST STARTED--
Stephen: STRESSED FROM HAVING QUIT THE SHOW? I THOUGHT THE SHOW WAS THE STRESS.
NO, NO, THE FEAR OF POVERTY IS A TREADMILL.
SO I JUST STARTED WORKING OUT TO ALLEVIATE THE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OF STRESS. AND THEN IT JUST TOOK A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SOMEONE SAID, "DAVE, YOU LOOK GOOD." "DO I?" AND AFTER THAT, I WAS OFF TO THE RACES.
Stephen: WELL, SO, 30th ANNIVERSARY OF DOING COMEDY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE STATE OF COMEDY NOW? I MEAN, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN CHANGE FROM AGE-- HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN IT STARTED?
I WAS 14.
Stephen: 14. YOUR MOM LET YOU DO A GIG AT 14?
OH, MY GOD, SHE WOULD TAPE ME, IN THE BEGINNING.
Stephen: TO THE CLUBS.
YEAH. OH, MY GOD, YEAH. AND THEN, AFTER THE SHOW-- I CAN'T REALLY SAY IT ON TELEVISION-- SHE WOULD CRITIQUE MY ACT ON THE DRIVE HOME, WHICH IS A VERY LONG RIDE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR MOM SAY THOSE (BLEEP) JOKES NEED TO BE CUT.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, BUT LET'S BE FAIR. WAS SHE RIGHT? DID THOSE (BLEEP) JOKES NEED TO BE CUT?
SHE WAS WRONG. SHE WAS RIGHT IN THE SENSE IT'S GROSS-- IT'S GROSS TO HEAR A TEENAGER TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT. I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT, BECAUSE I HADN'T DONE ANYTHING YET. BUT FROM HER PERSPECTIVE, I IMAGINED, YOU KNOW, THIS IS LIKE '87 D.C., CRACK EPIDEMIC, SO MANY BAD THINGS THAT I COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO, THAT SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, IF HE IS DOING THIS, AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE HE IS. AT LEAST I KNOW WHO HE IS AROUND."
Stephen: WAS THERE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL IN THE CLUBS? WERE PEOPLE THERE TEMPTING YOU?
IT WASN'T TEMPTING. IT WAS LIKE DUDES HAVING COCAINE NOSEBLEEDS, AND ALL KINDS OF CRAZY STUFF LIKE THAT. SO, I NEVER REALLY GOT INTO THE DRUG STUFF. THE WORSE HABIT I PICKED UP WAS PROBABLY SMOKING CIGARETTES.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL SMOKE?
JUST MOMENTS BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU SAID-- YOU HOSTED "S.N.L." I THINK THE WEEKEND AFTER TRUMP WAS ELECTED.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IS THAT TRUE? IS THE TIME RIGHT THERE, ABOUT THAT?
YEAH, THE SATURDAY AFTER THAT TUESDAY.
AND YOU SAID SORT OF FAISMSLY AT THE TIME, WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS GUY A CHANCE.
Stephen: NOW WE'RE SEVEN, EIGHT MONTHS, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CHANCES? DO YOU STILL WANT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE?
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANTED TO GIVE HIM A
Stephen: AND YOU SAID, SORT OF UNUSUALLY AT THE TIME, YOU SAID, "WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS CHANCE THAT NIGHT.
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A BAD THING. I'M NOT CRITICIZING THAT YOU SAID THAT. I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IMPULSE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT-- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE GUY NOW?
YOU KNOW, LISTEN, MAN. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, I THINK WE'RE ALL GETTING AN EDUCATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER HEARD IN POPULAR DISCOURSE PEOPLE DISCUSSING ETHICS THIS MUCH. AND I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HOW ETHICS WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK AT THAT LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, AND HE'S PUTTING ALL THIS STUFF IN THE FOREFRONT.
Stephen: WELL, NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT OXYGEN UNTIL SOMEBODY HAS THEIR HANDS AROUND YOUR THROAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
VERY TRUE. BUT, BUT, IF YOU REMEMBER, IN THAT MONOLOGUE, IN THAT EMMY-NOMINATED MONOLOGUE-- ( LAUGHTER ) THE EPISODE WAS EMMY NOMINATED. IT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE UGLY EMMY. THEY SEND IT TO YOU IN THE MAIL IF YOU WIN.
Stephen: THE SCHEMMYS.
THE SCHEMMYS. THE BEGINNING OF THE MONOLOGUE I CONTEXTUALIZED BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF WHITE AMERICANS HAVE FINALLY GOTTEN TO SEE WHAT AN ELECTION NIGHT LOOKS LIKE FOR MANY BLACK AMERICANS EVERY CYCLE.
Stephen: OH, THE SHOCK.
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
YEAH, THE SHOCK OF IT WAS, LIKE, MAN, COME ON. I THINK IT SPEAKS TO HOW EFFECTIVE OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY WAS IT SPEAKS TO TRACK. GOOD FOOT, BAD FOOT. I THINK HE'LL MAKE A MORE INFORMED AND BETTER VOTER. PEOPLE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. WE'LL WORK IT OUT. HE'S A POLARIZING DUDE. HE'S LIKE A BAD D.J. AT A GOOD PARTY.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: 30 YEARS IN, 30 YEARS IN, SO 30-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DOING COMEDY, DOING THESE NOW 16 DAYS. THERE ARE A LOT OF MUSICIANS --
AND COMEDIANS. FOR INSTANCE, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT ME AND CHRIS ROCK HAVE EVER OFFICIALLY HEADLINED TOGETHER.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU GOT CHANCE, THE ROOTS, ERICA BADOU, SOLE ANG AS SAID WILL BE JOINING YOU. GOOD LUCK WITH THE RUN. I'M SURE IT WILL BE GREAT. I HOPE I GET A CHANCE TO SEE ONE OF THE SHOWS. BEFORE WE GO--
YOU SHOULD. YOU SHOULD JUST POP BY AND DO, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WOULD BE GREAT.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I THINK I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE-- I THINK I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE-- AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN BACK FOR A WHILE-- BUT TO SAY I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. BUT I NEED TO ASK YOU, HOW BACK ARE YOU? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FALL IN LOVE AND LOSE YOU AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, I MIGHT SAY, "I LOVE DAVE CHAPPELLE. I LOVE WATCHING HIS COMEDY." AND THE NTHING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT OUT FOR A PACK OF SMOKES AND YOU'RE GONE FOR 15 YEARS. HOW BACK ARE YOU?
I'M AROUND. I NEVER REALLY GO AWAY. I POP UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I FEEL GRATEFUL, BECAUSE WHEN I DO POP UP, PEOPLE STILL COME OUT AND WE HAVE A GREAT TIME. I HAVE TO TAIL, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU MAN, FOR YEARS, AND I REALLY DO THINK YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICES COMEDY HAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO SAY. THANKS SO MUCH. DAVE CHAPPELLE IS AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL THROUGH AUGUST 24. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS A TONY TONY-NOMINEE YOU KNOW FROM "BRIDESMAIDS" "GIRLS" AND THE I.T. CROWD-- THEY LIKE THAT SHOW. AND HE NOW STARS IN THE SERIES "GET SHORTIE." PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS O'DOWD. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I GOTTA TELL YOU, NOT EVERY GUEST GETS THAT KIND OF REACTION FROM JUST ONE OF THE THINGS ON THEIR C.V.
IT'S A GOOD ONE, THOUGH. THANK YOU. THAT WAS VERY KIND.
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU. I NEVER MET YOU BEFORE.
YEAH, I KNOW, IT'S NICE.
Stephen: YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR ACCENTS BETRAYS THAT YOU'RE A "FERNER." YOU'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE, STRANGER. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE FROM ROSCOMMON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: MY FAMILY, TOO?
STOP IT.
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. MY BROTHER IS SITTING OUT THERE, ROSCOMMON, RIGHT.
THE COLBERTCANS.
HAVE YOU BEEN.
Stephen: YES?
IT'S NICE.
Stephen: OH, IT'S LOVELY.
A LOT OF BOG.
Stephen: A LOT OF PEAT.
A LOT OF PEAT. IF YOU'RE INTO SOIL IT'S REALLY THE PLACE FOR YOU. YOU PROBABLY DON'T UPON THIS, WE HAVE THE BEST FOOTBALL TEAM IN IRELAND.
Stephen: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. YOU MEAN SOC RIGHT?
NO, I MEAN GAELIC FOOTBALL.
Stephen: OH, GAELIC FOOTBALL, SURE.
WHICH IS A SPORT FOR STRONG MEN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DID YOU PLAY? DID YOU PLAY?
I PLAYED A BIT.
Stephen: YEAH?
I PLAYED A BIT BECAUSE I WAS TALL.
Stephen: DOES THAT HELP?
BIG ADVANTAGE.
Stephen: YOU ATTENDED DRAMA SCHOOL IN LONDON.
RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. AND WAS THAT FUN? HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WENT THERE?
LIKE, 20.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD TIME.
YEAH, IT WAS NICE. I WENT TO COLLEGE IN DUB LEN FIRST, AND I WANTED TO BE A POLITICAL SPEECHWRITER.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU TO THAT?
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED ORATOR ORAT WELL-USED WORDS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WORN DOWN, ALL WORN-DOWN WORDS, WELL USED?
THAT'S RIGHT. OVERLY USED PHRASES AND LEXICON. BUT ANYWAY, I STARTED DOING PLAYS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE DOING THAT. GAVE UP ON THE POLITICS NONSENSE. AND THEN WENT TO DRAMA SCHOOL AND STRUGGLED FOR 10 YEARS.
Stephen: 10 YEARS? THAT'S A LONG TIME TO STRUGGLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, THOUGH, DON'T YOU THINK. SUFFERING IS GOOD?
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IT'S COMMON. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD, BUT IT'S A COMMON THING.
IT'S A HARD THING TO SAY AROUND IRISH PEOPLE. "HEY, THIS STRUG CELL GREAT FOR YOU." IT'S CHARACTER BUILDING YOU DON'T NEED THAT FOOD NONSENSE.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAD-- YOU HAD A JOB WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNG ACTOR TRYING TO MAKE IT FOR-- IS IT THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND?
OH, RIGHT, YES. I WAS, LIKE-- I WAS, LIKE, A CALL CENTER OPERATIVE.
Stephen: YOU CALL PEOPLE AND SAY, "GIVE MONEY SO WE CAN SAVE THE ANIMALS?
THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES BEAT.
Stephen: OH, "GIVE US MONEY NOW BECAUSE THESE THINGS COULD BE DONE."
"THESE GUYS ARE IN TROUBLE. LET'S DO IT TODAY." LET PROBLEM IS, ENDANGERED SPECIES, THERE'S A KIND OF REALLY COOL ONES, LIKE THE ELEPHANTS, OR WHATEVER. BUT, LIKE, ANOTHER GUY HAD THOSE. AND MOST OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE, LIKE, A NEWT FROM LOOFNG OR A BAT FROM NEW ZEALAND OR WHATEVER. YEAH, NEW ZEALAND BATS! ( APPLAUSE ) SADLY, THEY ARE NO LONGER. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHEN YOU-- WHEN YOU CALL SOMEONE AND YOU'RE LIKE, "YOU KNOW, I NEED MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE THESE BATS IN NEW ZEALAND." THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT. HOW DO WE GET RID OF THESE BATS?" NOBODY LIKES BATS!
Stephen: JUST LIE AND SAY IT'S FOR THE PANDAS.
OR MAKE UP ANIMALS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU JUST MADE UP ANIMALS?
WELL, BECAUSE THEY-- I WAS GETTING SO LITTLE MONEY, AND IT WAS, LIKE, COMMISSION. AND WE WERE GENUINELY TRYING TO SAVE ANIMALS. SO I WOULD-- I CREATED A COUPLE OF CREATURES.
Stephen: LIKE WHAT? LIKE WHAT?
LIKE FOR A WHOLE YEAR, I WAS SAVING THE SPECIES, THE TIGER SWAN. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH --
Stephen: THE TIGER SWAN JAIT'S ESSENTIALLY A SWAN WITH THE PLUMAGE OF A BENGAL.
Stephen: AND THEY'RE ENDANGERED.
THEY'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE, STEPHEN! ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN ONE OF THEM?
THIS IS THE THING-- AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS ALL THE TIME-- "I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT." AND, OF COURSE, THE RESPONSE S, THEY'RE REALLY RARE." OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE CALLING. WE WOULD JUST LET THEM GET ON WITH THEIR BUSINESS.
Stephen: IT IT WORK?
NOT SO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT IT WAS A GOOD YEAR.
Stephen: NOW YOU'VE GOT THE SERIES ON EPIX, "GET SHORTIE."
YES.
Stephen: THIS IS A BOOK. IT'S BEEN A MOVIE. WHAT DO WE SEE IN THE SERIES THAT IS DIFFERENT? WHAT'S THE VALUE ADDED HERE?
WELL, I FEEL LIKE IT'S --
Stephen: FEEL FREE TO LIE BECAUSE I'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY TO ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
IT'S, OBVIOUSLY, WE WORK FROM THE SAME KIND OF-- BOOK, THE GREAT ELMORE LEONARD NOVEL. BUT TOTALLY IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE VISITING A BAR AT A DIFFERENT TIME OF THE WEEK. THE MOVIE IS KIND OF SLICK AND COOL. IT'S LIKE VISITING A BAR, LIKE, 9:00 P.M. ON A SATURDAY WHERE EVERYBODY IS DRESSED REALLY WELL, AND THEY'RE USING THEIR PICK-UP LINES. ON OUR SHOW IT'S, LIKE, 3:00 A.M. ON A TUESDAY. YOU'RE KIND OF FIGHTING WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND. THE FLOOR IS STICKY. THE BAR BILL IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE, AND YOU CAN'T PAY IT. AND IT'S, LIKE, ENTER SCENE. BUT IT'S GREAT. IT'S KIND OF GRITTY AND UGLY, LIKE THE BOOK IS, I THINK. AND  --
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE? WE DO NOT HAVE A CLIP.
OH, GOOD, I'LL DO IT-- NO.
Stephen: IMAGINE THIS. IMAGINE THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ON-- ON SOMEWHERE ELSE, ON A DIFFERENT SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: "GET SHORTIE" PREMIERES SUNDAYS ON EPIX. CHRIS O'DOWD, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHAT A NEWSY WEEK WE'VE HAD HERE AT "THE LATE SHOW"." THERE WAS THAT DOGS ON SURFBOARDS VIDEO, TRUMP PLAYING GOLF AND WHAT WAS THAT OTHER THING? OH, RIGHT, IMPENDING NURMO NUCLEAR WAR. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BEFORE THE PRESIDENT TWEETS US INTO THE APOCKLISM, LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE BEST OF THIS WEEK'S "LATE SHOW"."
THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO THEM LIKE THEY NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. OKAY? NORTH KOREA, BETTER GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER, OR THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE LIKE FEW NATIONS EVER HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE IN THIS WORLD. OKAY?
Stephen: OH, MY GOD. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK HE JUST THREATENED TO BE THEIR PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NORTH KOREA NOW CLAIMS TO BE ABLE TO REACH GUAM WITH THEIR MISSILES AND DESTROY IT WITH "ENVELOPING FIRE." ENVELOPING FIRE? IS KIM JONG-UN LAUNCHING A MISSILE OR A SERIES OF EROTIC NOVELS? ( LAUGHTER ) LOOKS GOOD.
ACCORDING TO "USA TODAY," PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SENT PRIVATE MESSAGES TO RUSSIA'S SPECIAL COUNSEL CARUSSIA'S SPECIALCOUNSE
TRUMP-INSPIRED GREETING CARDS. EACH CARD LETS THE CERTAIN SOMEONE INVESTIGATING YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THEM. LIKE "I'M GUILTY, OF THINKING YOU'RE GREAT."
Stephen: DONALD TRUMP IS ON A 17-DAY VACATION AT HIS GOLF CLUB IN BEDMINISTER, NEW JERSEY. HE'S THERE TO RELAX-- NO, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM. HE'S THERE TO RELAX AFTER MONTHS OF GRUELING GOLF AT MAR-A-LARGO. DISPL THAT'S ALSO WHAT TRUMP SAYS WHENEVER HE VISITS EASTERN EUROPE. "WHERE'S THE BRIDE? COME ON. COUGH HER UP." CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE THE BIG 1-3. YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A TEENAGER FIRST SEASON'S CHARACTER IS NAMED 11. IS IT NAMED 13? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S-- I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEN A BLACK WOMAN GETS A WEAVE?
Stephen: YEAH, I HAVE A GENERAL IDEA. I HAVE A GENERAL IDEA.
OKAY, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU HOW YOU KNOW OFF CAMERA. BUT HERE'S THE THING-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BRACE YOURSELF FOR THIS. THE C.E.O. OF HERSHEY'S DISCOVERED MILLENNIALS ARE INTERESTED IN FLAVOR FLAVORS AND WHICH IS WHY HERSHEY'S HAS HALTED PRODUCTION ON LIL' BLANDIES.
Stephen: FROM NOW ON, ANY GUY WHO MAN-SPREADS OR MANSPLAINS, MAY BE WOODEN SLAUGHTERED. WOW, THIS IS WHAT KIM JONG-UN IS ARMING HIS MISSILES WITH, ACTUALLY.
RIGHT, WE'RE ALL DOOMED. THIS IS 135,000 SKOVALS, SO HERE'S WHERE WE CRANK IT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT FOOLING AROUND.
VERY SMOKY.
Stephen: YEAH. THIS FEELING I HAVE IN MY MOUTH RIGHT NOW IS WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) (BLEEP) DAMN IT.  ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WE'VE BEEN SO DISTRACTED BY TRUMP'S SHOWDOWNS WITH KIM JONG-UN THIS WEEK, THAT WE HAVE MISSED SOME OTHER REALLY BIG STORIES HERE ON THE SHOW, LIKE TRUMP'S SHOWDOWN WITH SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND MAN BEING TOLD THEY STOPPED SERVING BREAKFAST AT 11 A.M., MITCH McCONNELL.  ( APPLAUSE )
ALL I HEAR IS REPEAL AND REPLACE. AND THEN I GET THERE, AND I SAID, "WHERE'S THE BILL? I WANT TO SIGN IT." FIRST DAY. AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT. I SAY, VERY SIMPLY, "WHERE IS REPEAL AND REPLACE?"
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE CHECK BEHIND THAT WALL YOU DIDN'T BUILD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S IF FOR "THE LATE SHOW"" EVERYBODY. JOIN ME NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE JOINED BY ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, DANIEL CRAIG, AND TIFFANY HADDISH. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
