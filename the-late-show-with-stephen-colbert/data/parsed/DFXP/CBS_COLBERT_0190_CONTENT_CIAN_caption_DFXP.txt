HI THERE. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. FOR THOSE OF US IN COMEDY TRUMP'S LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES. MUCH LIKE THE MAN HIMSELF. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE NEWS. SHE MAY BE LIVING BY THE OLD ADAGE NEVER INTERFERE WITH AN ENEMY WHILE THEY'RE DESTROYING THEMSELVES. HERE IS CARTOON HILLARY CLINTON. THANK YOU STEPHEN. I'M APPROPRIATELY ENTHUSIASTIC TO BE HERE. HEY! HI!  HELLO UP THERE! ARE YOU AVOIDING PUBLIC APPEARANCES? GREAT QUESTION. IN MY HEART, I TRULY FEEL.. SMOKE BOMB!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S A PACKED HOUSE. SUPER ENERGETIC CROWD TONIGHT. SUPER PACKED HOUSE. PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE ELECTION, RIGHT? ME TOO, ME TOO. HOW ARE YOU DOING JON, FEELING GOOD.
Jon: FEELING GOOD. WE'RE DOING IT.
Stephen: I LOVE THAT JACKET. YOU LOOK LIKE BARNEY FROM THE WAIST UP. UP.
Jon: I USED TO WATCH BARNEY WHEN I WAS A KID. YOU KNOW, I USED TO CHECK HIM OUT. ♪ I LOVE YOU YOU LOVE ME ♪
Stephen: I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. ONE OF US IS SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN THE OTHER, AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOT DWELL ON IT IF YOU DON'T MIND. WELL, I'VE GOT TO START TONIGHT WITH SOME SHOCKING NEWS. THERE'S A HUGE SCANDAL OUT THERE THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE DONALD TRUMP. I KNOW. I KNOW. I HAD THE SAME REACTION. INSTEAD, IT INVOLVES FUTURE FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN HE GOT IRAN TO RELEASE FOUR AMERICAN PRISONERS? WELL, IT TURNS OUT, HE FORGOT TO TELL US ABOUT A SMALL SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEE. BECAUSE AS THE PRISONERS WERE FREED, TURNS OUT $400 MILLION WAS FLOWN TO IRAN ON A PLANE LOADED WITH CASH. DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN YOU'RE ON AN AIRPLANE AND YOU GET STUCK SITTING NEXT TO $400 MILLION? YOU DON'T KNOW WHO GETS THE ARMREST. IT'S INCREDIBLE. AND NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT SOUNDS LIKE RANSOM, BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THE WORD "RANSOM" MEANS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DENYING ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MONEY AND THE PRISONER RELEASE, CLAIMING THAT THE TIMING IS COINCIDENTAL. "OH, I'D LOVE TO GO PICK UP MY PRISONERS, BUT MY PLANE IS ALREADY FULL OF CASH. HEY!" WHY DON'T WE DO THE THE... ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT'S GREAT THE PRISONERS CAME HOME, BUT THIS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND I AM GOING TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS STORY, OR MY NAME'S NOT STEPHEN COLBERT, AND MY SWISS BANK ACCOUNT'S NUMBER ISN'T 160 PLUS 257. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY. OKAY. WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWS? HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS DONALD TRUMP GUY? VERY INTERESTING GUY. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HIM A LOT. TODAY ON COFFEE JOE MORNING, AND THE FUNKY BUNCH, COFFEE JOE REVEALED THIS:
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, A FOREIGN POLICY EXPERT ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WENT TO ADVISE DONALD TRUMP, AND THREE TIMES HE ASKED ABOUT THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THREE TIMES HE ASKED, AT ONE POINT, "IF WE HAVE THEM, WHY CAN'T WE USE THEM?"
Stephen: OOH, I KNOW THAT ONE! ( APPLAUSE ) CHING-CHING. AARRGGHH! TIME PASSES. YES, I FOLLOWED HIS ORDERS AND DROPPED THE BOMB. "OKAY, RIGHT UP THERE, THE THING WITH THE ROPE AND THE NOOSE? OKAY, I'LL GO." ( LAUGHTER ) STORY HAD A SAD ENDING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I CAN REALLY PICTURE DONALD TRUMP AT THAT NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING: "I KNOW THERE ARE PROBABLY REASONS NOT TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I CAN'T THINK OF ONE, BUT I'M OPEN TO HEARING THEM. MEATLOAF, YOUR THOUGHTS?" ARSENIO HALL, SHOULD I BOMB GARY BUSEY? NOW, THIS CAPS OFF A WEEK IN WHICH TRUMP ATTACKED A GOLD STAR FAMILY, SEEMED HAPPY ABOUT GETTING A PURPLE HEART AS A GIFT BECAUSE IT "WAS MUCH EASIER THAN EARNING ONE," AND APPEARED TO FEUD WITH A CRYING BABY AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY. AND I'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR FIVE MINUTES, SO I'M GOING TO SAY FIVE-GALLON CAN OF VAN KAMP'S PORK AND BEANS. HE MAKES MORE GAFFES THAN I CAN KEEP UP WITH. IT'S LIKE "I LOVE LUCY" IN THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, EXCEPT THAT WITH TRUMP, THE BROWN STUFF AIN'T CHOCOLATE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PEABODY, PLEASE. NOW, THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD THAT TRUMP'S ALLIES ARE PLOTTING AN INTERVENTION. AN INTERVENTION. "THEY LOVE YOU, DONALD. AND THE FIRST STEP TO RECOVERY IS ADMITTING THAT YOU'RE THE PROBLEM." I'M GUESSING-- AND THIS IS JUST WISHFUL THINKING-- BUT SENIOR G.O.P. OFFICIALS ARE EXPLORING OPTIONS IF TRUMP DROPS OUT. IN FACT, TOP REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SEEN STANDING OUTSIDE MITT ROMNEY'S HOUSE HOLDING BOOM BOXES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT IF ROMNEY WON'T RUN, PAUL RYAN MIGHT HAVE A REPLACEMENT. BECAUSE ON MONDAY, PAUL RYAN RE-TWEETED A POLL THAT SAID, HARAMBE THE GORILLA IS POLLING NATIONALLY AT 5%, ADDING THE COMMENT, "ONE IN 20 WANT TO SEE HARAMBE IN THE OVAL OFFICE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S A BOLD CHOICE. ONLY OBSTACLE I CAN FORESEE IS THAT HE'S A GORILLA, AND HE'S DEAD. ON THE PLUS SIDE, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S HARAMBE'S REAL HAIR. NOW PLEASE SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ DO-DO-DA-DA ♪ NOW JUST OVER THERE A SECOND AGO I WAS SAYING THAT DESPERATE REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING TO REPLACE DONALD TRUMP AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET. BUT REALISTICALLY, WHO COULD THEY TURN TO? WHOEVER THEY PICK WOULD HAVE TO BE HAWKISH ON NATIONAL DEFENSE, FRIENDLY TO WALL STREET, AND IS DESPISED BY LIBERALS. YEAH, OKAY. YEAH, OKAY. ( APPLAUSE ) ADMITTEDLY-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE FITS THE BILL, BUT SHE'S SPOKEN FOR. SPEAKING OF WHICH, TRUMP'S GOT A NEW NICKNAME FOR THIS WOMAN.
WHY DID HILLARY GET RID OF HER MIDDLE NAME? HUH? HILLARY? NO, BUT WHY DID SHE GET RID OF IT, HILLARY "ROTTEN" CLINTON. "ROTTEN" CLINTON. HILLARY "ROTTEN" CLINTON. MAYBE THAT'S WHY. IT'S TOO CLOSE.
Stephen: HA-HA-HA. HOW DOES HE DO IT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) Y WHICH I MEAN, SLEEP AT NIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS ) ♪ ♪ ♪ HILLARY ROTTEN CLINTON. AND SEVERAL TOP REPUBLICANS, LIKE CONGRESSMAN RICHARD HANNA AND G.O.P. FUNDRAISER MEG WHITMAN HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SO IT'S CLEAR THE G.O.P. ESTABLISHMENT IS NOT PLEASED DONALD TRUMP, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, HE CAN'T STAND THEM EITHER. FOR INSTANCE, SENATOR McCAIN HAS PROMISED THAT HE WILL SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, DESPITE TRUMP SAYING THIS:
HE'S NOT A WAR HERO. HE WAS A WAR HERO BECAUSE HE WAS CAPTURED. I LIKE PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T CAPTURED. ( BOOING ).
Stephen: I KNOW, BUT IT REALLY BRINGS YOU BACK TO A SIMPLER TIME... WHEN THAT STATEMENT WAS SHOCKING. ( APPLAUSE ) DESPITE THAT, McCAIN ENDORSED TRUMP. BUT DESPITE THAT, YESTERDAY, TRUMP SAID THIS:
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE WITH JOHN McCAIN BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB FOR THE VETS. HE HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB FOR THE VETS."
Stephen: OH, MY LORD, THAT IS BELOW THE BELT. WHICH ISN'T HARD, BECAUSE AT 79, McCAIN'S BELT SUPAROUND HIS ARMPITS. I'M GOING TO GET YOU. COME HERE, COME HERE, MISTER! COME HERE! NOW-- HIS BELT IS UP AROUND WHERE A PROM DRESS SITS. NOW, PAUL RYAN WAS SLOWER TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP THAN MOST. BACK IN MAY, HE SAID"
I'M JUST NOT READY TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT. I'M NOT THERE RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: YES, HE WASN'T THERE HE WAS IN HIS HAPPY PLACE, FANTASIZING ABOUT PRESIDENT HARAMBE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, EVENTUALLY, RYAN DID THROW HIS SUPPORT BEHIND TRUMP AND THEN THREW UP A LITTLE IN HIS MOUTH. BUT, YESTERDAY TRUMP REWARDED THAT ENDORSEMENT WITH A RINGING NUT PUNCH SAYING, "I LIKE PAUL, BUT I'M JUST NOT QUITE THERE YET. I'M NOT QUITE THERE YET." OUCH! OH! WORKING THE BOYS LIKE A SPEED BAG DOWN THERE. USING PAUL RYAN'S OWN WORDS AGAINST HIM. THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO TAKE DOWN YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT, WHICH FOR TRUMP, IS NOW EVERYONE. HERE FOR SOME IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS ON TRUMP'S CHILDISH LAUGHING OUT AT HIS OWN PARTY, PLEASE WELCOME TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR JUNIOR STRATEGIST, TIMMY JENKINS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TIMMY. TIMMY. AS ALWAYS, TIMMY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
YOUR PLEASURE, STEPHEN COLD-SORE.
Stephen: OK, GOING TO LET ONE PASS. NOW, YOU ARE THE MASTERMIND BEHIND DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN STRATEGY, CORRECT?
THAT'S RIGHT. DURING THE PRIMARIES, I WAS THE BRAINS BEHIND THOSE POWERFUL NICKNAMES: "LYIN' TED," "LITTLE MARCO," "BOOBY JINDAL."
Stephen: "BOOBY JINDAL?" I NEVER HEARD THAT ONE.
YEAH, HE DROPPED OUT BEFORE WE COULD USE IT. BIGGEST REGRET OF THE CAMPAIGN. BUT I'M EXCITED NOW FOR LATEST INVENTION: SWITCHING FROM "CROOKED HILLARY" TO HILLARY "ROTTEN" CLINTON.
Stephen: THAT WAS YOU?
YEAH. IT WORKS ON SO MANY LEVELS.
Stephen: IT ACTUALLY ONLY WORKS ON ONE LEVEL, TIMMY. CALLING YOUR OPPONENTS NAMES IS ONE THING, BUT THROWING PAUL RYAN'S OWN WORDS BACK IN HIS FACE? DOESN'T A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAVE TO BE MORE MATURE THAN THAT?
DOESN'T A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAVE TO BE MORE MATURE THAN THAT? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: TIMMY, PLEASE. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION.
I'M TRYING TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION.
Stephen: STOP IT!
STOP IT!
Stephen: I MEAN IT!
I MEAN IT!
Stephen: I'M A BIG DORK!
NOW, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ( LAUGHTER ) HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT, STEPHEN COLD-BALLS.
Stephen: TIMMY, SERIOUSLY. OKAY, THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE DAYS HAVE BEEN THE ROUGHEST I CAN RECALL FOR ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. TRUMP IS DOWN IN THE POLLS, PARTY LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING REPLACEMENTS, REPORTS ARE THAT MORALE WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN IS PLUMMETING. DOESN'T ANY OF THAT MAKE YOU QUESTION WHETHER YOUR BULLYING STRATEGY IS WORKING?
DOESN'T YOUR FACE MAKE YOU QUESTION WHETHER YOUR BUTT IS WORKING, STEPHEN COLD-BALLS?
Stephen: YOU ALREADY USED THAT ONE.
OKAY, LISTEN, I KNOW. WE NODE TO TALK FOR A SECOND, MAN-TO-FARTKNOCKER?
Stephen: GO AHEAD, SURE.
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD, MAN. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE FUN, YOU KNOW, SHARE SOME LAUGHS, DESTROY THE G.O.P., MAYBE BAN AN ENTIRE RELIGION FROM THE COUNTRY. BUT TRUMP'S OUT OF CONTROL.
Stephen: WAIT, TIMMY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THAT GUY IS TOO CHILDISH TO BE PRESIDENT. I'M VOTING FOR HILLARY! COOTIES BE DAMNED! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TIMMY JENKINS, EVERYBODY. WOW!

THAT WAS.
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR ENTRANCE MUSIC?
YOU'RE HIRED. YOU GUYS DID IT BETTER THAN--
Jon: WE'RE ALREADY--
THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING? THAT'S COOL.
Stephen: MAYBE ON THE WEEKENDS. I LOVE THAT SUIT, MAN.
OH, THANK YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S, LIKE--
THERE IS A REASON BEHIND THIS.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE REASON?
WELL, THIS IS THE COLOR OF OUR BRAND NEW W.W.E. PROGRAM ON THE U.S.A.  NETWORK, "SMACK DOWN LIVE."
Stephen: IT'S BLUE, THAT IS THE COLOR, THAT BLUE?
IT IS THIS BLUE BUT IT SERVES A GUY MY AGE 39 YEARS OLD, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE CAN STILL BLUE HIMSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I HAVE NOT-- I HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH YOGA, UNFORTUNATELY. THAT'S A NICE SUIT BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE I LIKE. YOU HAVE A REALLY NICE SUIT ON HERE. THIS IS "TEEN CHOICE AWARDS." THIS IS YOU AS HILLARY CLINTON AT THE "TEEN CHOICE AWARDS" RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD-- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD LOOK. YEAH, YEAH. SHE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT, YEAH. I SHOULD STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, OBVIOUSLY, YOU PROBABLY DON'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS A LOT, BUT I HAVE TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION-- DONALD TRUMP SEEMS LIKE A LARGER HELP THAN-LIFE FIGGER. DO YOU THINK HE WOULD DO WELL IN THE WORLD OF WRESTLING?
STEPHEN, DO I! DONALD TRUMP IS A W.W.E. HALL OF FAMER.
Stephen: WHAT?
W.W.E. IS MADE FOR A GUY LIKE DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TO WRESTLEMANIA AND SHAVED MY BOSS' HEAD.
Stephen: REALLY.
SO, GUYS, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS SCRIMENTED AND YOU KNOW HOW IT ENDS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NO.
Stephen: NO?
NO.
Stephen: OKAY, SUMMERSLAM 2016, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?
YOU CAN EXPECT EVERYTHING. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORRY W.W.E.-- AND THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO OF YOU OUT THERE, I THANK THE REST OF YOU. THE REST OF YOU ARE IN FOR A HELL OF A SHOW. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, IT'S THE BEST LIVE PRODUCTION YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. WE TAKE THE DRAMA AND EXCITEMENT OF SPORTS, THE GRANDEUR OF A ROCK CONCERT, AND WE KIND OF ROLL IT INTO THIS ONE BIG BALL AND SEND IT OUT TO THE W.W.E. UNIVERSE LIVE AT W.W.E. NETWORK. AT SUMMERSLAM IT'S BASICALLY OUR SEASON FINALE. IF YOU WATCH "GAME OF THRONES" YOU ALWAYS WATCH THE WHOLE THING TO GEAR UP FOR THE FINALE.
Stephen: YOU GOT ANY DRAGONS? DO YOU GO BUCK NAKED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
SO I TRIED BOTH OF THOSE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE DRAGONS AND BEING NAKED AT THE SAME TIME...
Stephen: BAD COMBINATION?
MAN, THAT WAS NOT-- THAT WAS A POOR MANAGEMENT DECISION, MY FRIEND.
Stephen: WHO ARE YOU FIGHTING?
A GUY NAMED A.J. STYLES.
Stephen: A.J. STYLES YOU'LL TAKE HIM WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND YOUR BACK.
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.
Stephen: NO, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM-- IS HE GOOD? I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM. ( APPLAUSE ) IS HE GOOD?
HE'S VERY GOOD.
Stephen: HE'S VERY GOOD.
HE'S VERY GOOD.
Stephen: HAVE YOU FOUGHT HIM BEFORE?
I HAVE.
Stephen: AND-- >>-- I-- FINISHED SECOND.
Stephen: OH, WOW, OH, WOW. COULD I ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR-- ABOUT YOUR-- SOME OF YOUR SIGNATURE MOVES?
YEAH, SURE.
Stephen: I LOVE THE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT.
YES.
Stephen: AND WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS CALLED THAT DO YOU?
THAT'S CALLED THE "YOU CAN'T SEE ME," CAN WHICH SETS UP A MANEUVER CALLED THE "FIVE-KNUCKLE SHUFFLE." MAN, MY LIFE IS WEIRD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS. YOU DO THIS RIGHT BEFORE THE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT, RIGHT?
YES, THAT WAS A DARE FROM MY LITTLE BROTHER AND HE DARED ME I WOULDN'T GET IT ON TELEVISION.
Stephen: BECAUSE IT'S SO DUMB? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT LITTLE BROTHERS-- NOT ME! THAT'S WHAT LITTLE BROTHERS FORCE THEIR OLDER BROTHERING TO DO.
I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TONIGHT.
Stephen: STILL BE. STILL BE EXCITED.
QUITE FRANKLY, YOU'RE BEING VERY HURTFUL RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE, I APOLOGIZE.
THAT'S COOL. I CAN'T SEE YOU, SO IT'S GOOD. HE GETS IT. DUMB MY EYE.
Stephen: WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP OF YOU DOING IT. JIMMY, SHOW THE PEOPLE THE GOOD STUFF.
THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT. AND WAIT FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT. I'M ABOUT TO BECOME INVISIBLE. HOLD ON. THERE'S A BIG BUILD-UP BECAUSE THERE'S A MAGIC POTIENT. AND I'M INVISIBLE RIGHT THERE. I DISAPPEAR. I DISAPPEARED.
Stephen: OKAY, I TAKE IT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I TAKE IT ALL BACK.
IT ACTUALLY WORKS, BUT ONLY IN A W.W. WRING. I ACTUALLY BECOME INVISIBLE FOR A FEW SECONDS.
Stephen: WOW, AMAZING. A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS?
WHAT DO YOU BENCH?
ENOUGH TO LET ME BEAT A.J. STYLES LIVE AT SUMMERSLAM ON THE W.W.E. NETWORK.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S MORE THAN I CAN. I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH. DO YOU HAVE LIKE-- I'VE HEARD, LIKE, THE ROCK HAS A CRAZY AMOUNT OF FOOD HE HAS TO INGEST ON A DAILY BASIS TO STAY ALL JACKED. LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO? IS IT ALL JUST LIVE CHICKENS?
IF IT BREATHES OR IT'S GREEN YOU EAT IT.
Stephen: IF IT BREATHING OR IT'S GREEN YOU EAT IT. ephen: IF IT BREATH BREATHES AND IT'S GREEN IT'S GONE BAD.
YES, IF IT BREATHE AND IT'S GREEN IT'S GONE BAD.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE ANY BIG WRESTLING HEROES WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? AS A KID I LOVED MACHO MAN. I LOVED THE HULKSTER?
I CAN SAY WHO MY HEROES WERE AS A KID. YOU BROUGHT UP DWAYNE JOHNSON. I THINK HE'S A HERO AND INSPIRATION TO MYSELF AND ANYBODY IN THE W.W.E. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, A COUPLE OF ROCK FANS HERE TONIGHT. HE CERTAINLY HAS BLAZED THE TRAIL FOR ALL OF US. HE ALWAYS COMES BACK AND CONTINUES TO PERFORM YEAR AFTER YEAR IN THE W.W.E.

Stephen: DID HE START YOU ACTING? IS HE THE REASON YOU STARTED ACTING?
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF MY STUFF? ( LAUGHTER ) THIS HAS ALL BEEN KIND OF A SOFT OPEN TO MY START IN ACTING. I'M GOING TO START A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. IT'S NOT EXACTLY ACTING WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. I'M TRYING MY BEST. I'M SWIMMING WITH THE FLOATIES ON.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK WILL YOU STICK AROUND?

I'M NOT DOING ANY NO-HANDED PUSH-UPS ANY TIME SOON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M SO GLAD THAT IN THE W.W.E. WE WRESTLE WITHOUT OUR SHIRT AND NOT WITHOUT OUR PANTS.
Stephen: THAT IS-- THAT IS--
ARE WE COOL?
Stephen: YEAH, WE'RE ABSOLUTELY COOL. NOW, THIS IS HOW I WOULD ANSWER THAT. ASK ME.
SO, STEPHEN, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU IN MOVIES AND, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE ASKED ME TO ASK-- THIS ISN'T FROM ME-- BUT SOMEONE-- LET'S JUST SAY SHE-- ASKED ME YOUR MUSCLES ARE SO ENORMOUS, ARE-- ARE ALL YOUR MUSCLES BIG?
