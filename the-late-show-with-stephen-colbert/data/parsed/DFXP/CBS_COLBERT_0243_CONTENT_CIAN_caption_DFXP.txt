Stephen: HEY, NEIL! HE, MAN, I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, I NEEDED SOME PEACE AND QUIET.
Stephen: YES, THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO GET IT.
I JUST WANT TO COMMUNE WITH THE COSMOS. THAT'S HOW I ROLL.
Stephen: YEAH, I GET THAT. LISTEN, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO MUCH FUN TO HAVE THE SHOW, BUT I GOTTA SAY, THE WAY PEOPLE ARE FEELING, IT MIGHT BE HARD TO DO A COMEDY SHOW TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS IN MY FIELD?
Stephen: WHAT?
WE INVOKE THE COSMIC PERSPECTIVE.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S WHAT EARTH LOOK LIKES FROM HIGH ABOVE, NOT JUST, LIKE, FROM THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT FROM SPACE ITSELF, FROM THE UNIVERSE. AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, ALL EARTH'S PROBLEMS DISSOLVE AWAY INTO THE INFINITUDE OF THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM.
Stephen: YEAH... ( LAUGHTER ).
DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER?
NO... ( LAUGHTER )
WHY DON'T WE JUST CHUCK THE TELESCOPE?
Stephen: LET'S DO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES!

Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I THINK. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE. LET ME ASK YOU-- HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING RIGHT NOW? HOW YOU FEELING? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'M GLAD. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GLAD. THAT'S BETTER THAN I THOUGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I-- I AM SO GLAD TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW. AND IF YOU'LL BE THERE, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S IT, FOUR YEARS? FOUR YEARS? WE'VE GOT FOUR VERY INTERESTING YEARS IN FRONT OF US. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU ALL, I DID NOT GET A LOT OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT. DID YOU SLEEP AT ALL, JON.
Jon: ABOUT THREE AND A HALF HOURS.
Stephen: THREE AND A HALF HOURS, AND THOSE ARE JAZZ HOURS. WALKING AROUND THE STREETS OF NEW YORK TODAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE A LITTLE. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD SEE IT IN THEIR EYES. THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT-- THI THIS... THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN AMERICA'S MADE GREAT AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I WAS WONDERING. AND I WAS REALLY HOPING IT WOULD FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THIS SUCKS! SUCKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY TROUBLE GETTING IN HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, TONIGHT, THOUSAND OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS IN PROTESTS IN CITIES ALL OVER AMERICA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS A MATTER OF FACT, IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ACTUALLY, TIMES SQUARE AND COLUMBUS CIRCLE, ONE GROUP WENT RIGHT BY THE THEATER. JIM, DO WE HAVE-- YEAH, WE SHOT IT OUTSIDE, RIGHT OUTSIDE OF OUR OFFICE WINDOW. THERE'S THE-- THERE'S THE COLBERT SIGN RIGHT THERE. SO I'M JUST SAYING, THE UNITY THING MIGHT TAKE A SCHOOCH LONGER THAN TRUMP WAS HOPING FOR. I JUST WANT TO SAY, FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FIRST AMENDMENT IT'S MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO TOGETHER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND DON'T STOP SPEAKING UP. DON'T STOP SPEAKING YOUR MIND. DON'T EVER BE COWED BY WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. BUT DO KEEP IN MIND THAT FOR EIGHT YEARS A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T ACCEPT BARACK OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. FOR INSTANCE, DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, LIKE IT OR NOT, FOR THE RECORD, NOT. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ( BOOING ) NO, NO. LISTEN, I GET THAT FEELING COMPLETELY. I JUST HAD TO SAY IT ONE MORE TIME. I WANT TO JUST KEEP SAYING IT SO I CAN SAY IT WITHOUT THROWING UP IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT. OR FEELING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE'S ACTUALLY-- THERE'S ACTUALLY-- I DON'T EVEN YOU FEEL LIKE-- IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A DREAM STATE. ALL DAY LOANG I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF, "OH, YEAH, THIS IS NOT A DREAM. I AM NOT ON A BAD PEYOTE TRIP ON THE HUNT OF THE GREAT DEER. THIS IS REAL." WHATEVER THE G.O.P. IS SAYING PUBLICLY TODAY, I HAVE A FEELING THEY MIGHT BE FEELING THE SAME WAY. BECAUSE, REMEMBER, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SPENT ALMOST THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ELECTION IN PANIC TRYING TO STOP DONALD TRUMP FROM BEING THEIR NOMINEE, AND WHEN THEY COULD NOT, SURPRISE! THEY WON THE PRESIDENCY, BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS, AND SOON, A NEW SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT. IT'S LIKE THE G.O.P. GOT CAUGHT IN A PLUNGING ELEVATOR, AND THEY ALL FELL SCREAMING TEN STORIES DOWN AND LANDED GENTLY AND HAVE THE DOORS OPEN ON A CANDY STORE WHERE EVERYTHING IS FREE. I FOR ME! I CAN GOBBLE UP ALL YOUR RIGHTS. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. PLEASE, NO MORE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. I'M FULL, THANKS SO MUCH. IN THIS METAPHOR, DONALD TRUMP IS WILLY WONKA WHO HAS BEEN GENETICALLY CROSS-BRED WITH AN OOMPA-LOOMPA. NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS, I HAD IT THIS A LITTLE BIT-- BUT I DIDN'T SPEND HE MUCH TIME AT HOME-- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING THIS MORNING WITH, BESIDES DOING LAUNDRY OF JUST THEIR PANT FOR SOME REASON-- HOW TO EXPLAIN TRUMP'S VICTORY TO THEIR KIDS, YOU KNOW? HOW DO WE TELL THEM? WELL, I THINK THIS IS ONE RARE INSTANCE WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT'S EXAMPLE LAST NIGHT.
HILLARY HAS WORKED VERY LONG AND VERY HARD OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND WE OWE HER A MAJOR DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR HER SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. I MEAN THAT VERY SINCERELY.
Stephen: SO JUST FOLLOW HIS LEAD, AND LIE. JUST TELL YOUR KIDS IN A REASSURING VOICE THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO BE GOOD, MAYBE, YOU KNOW. MAYBE HE'LL BE DIFFERENT FROM HOW HE WAS AND ALWAYS IS. ( LAUGHTER ) OR-- CAN WE TELL THE STORY? YOU OKAY WITH IT? DO WHAT MY SHOW RUNNER CHRIS DID. THIS IS MY SHOW RUNNER CHRIS, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHRIS, YOU TOLD THIS STORY THIS MORNING. DO YOU MIND TELLING THE STORY?
SURE.
Stephen: OKAY, SO THIS MORNING YOU CAME IN AND YOU SAID THAT ONE OF YOUR SONS WOKE YOU UP THIS MORNING AND WHAT HE DID HE SAY?
HE SAID, MY OLDER BROTHER SAID DONALD TRUMP WON LAST NIGHT." AND I SAID, "THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED." AND HE BURST INTO TEARS. DIFFICULT-- CHANGE IS DIFFICULT.
Stephen: THIS IS THE MAGIC PART.
I SAID, "DON'T WORRY, SON. BEING PRESIDENT IS NOT THAT BIG OF A JOB."
Stephen: OKAY? FATHER OF THE YEAR, RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO BETTER THAN THAT. JUST TELL THEM ANYTHING. TELL THEM THE NEW PRESIDENT IS ELSA FROM "FROZEN." IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET THEM TO ♪ LET IT GO." I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD TELL THEM. TELL THEM WHAT YOU ALWAYS TELL KIDS, BE KIND, DON'T BE SELFISH, DON'T GRAB THEM WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE GRABBED, AND THEY'LL MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE THAN DONALD TRUMP CAN. YOU KNOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T THINK KIDS REALLY SHOULD HAVE TO CARE ABOUT WHO THE PRESIDENT IS. THEY SHOULD CARE ABOUT COLORING BOOKS AND LEGOS, AND WHETHER EATING POP ROCKS AND COKE WILL MAKE YOUR STOMACH EXPLODE. (WHISPERING) IT TOTALLY WILL, BY THE WAY. AND IF YOUR CHILD ASKS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION, "WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE?" YOU FINALLY HAVE THE ANSWER-- THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS, I SAW SOME FOOTAGE LAST NIGHT OF THIS KID, WHO WAS CAPTURED ON CAMERA AT A CONGRESSIONAL VICTORY PARTY. HERE HE IS, GRANDMA IS DANCING IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE HE EYES THAT GLASS OF WINE. AND WELCOME TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION! YES, YES! THERE'S A MESSAGE OF HOPE. CLINTON LOST LAST NIGHT, BUT, BY GOD, SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA, A LITTLE BOY LEARNED TO POUND MERLOT LIKE KATHIE LEE GIFFORD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO WE HAVE ANY? WE DON'T HAVE ANY. I HAD A COUPLE OF COCKTAILS LAST NIGHT, AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, REALLY HELPED, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WHO'S TAKING THIS STRANGELY WELL? HILLARY CLINTON. EVEN THOUGH THE POSSIBLE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT LOST TO A CROTCH-GRABBING BEAUTY PAGEANT OWNER, LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID THIS MORNING.
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. WE OWE HIM AN OPEN MIND AND THE CHANCE TO LEAD.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU ALREADY ACCEPTING THIS? DID YOU PAY EXTRA FOR THE FAST PASS THROUGH THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW ACCEPTANCE IS LAST, RIGHT? ACCEPTANCE IS THE LAST ONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GOT THE CARD. I THINK SHE'S GOT THE CARD UPSIDE DOWN. THEY'RE SHUFFLED UP. YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH EVERY STAGE. THE FIRST THREE ARE EASY TO REMEMBER: DENIAL, ANGER AND BARGAINING-- BECAUSE THAT WAS TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN STRATEGY. THEN YOU'VE GOT DEPRESSION, THEN ACCEPTANCE. THEN DRAMATIC HAIRCUT AND REBOUND BOYFRIEND. BUT I CAN'T BLAME HER. EVERYBODY PROCESSES GRIEF DIFFERENTLY. I HEARD ELIZABETH WARREN GOT A NECK TATTOO. PERSONALLY-- GO GET 'EM, LIZ. PERSONALLY, I'VE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO DEPRESSION. OR, AS A GREAT PRESIDENT ONCE TWEETED: "SAD." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT HURT. THAT HURT TO SAY. MY HEART-- MY HEART ACTUALLY HURT TO SAY THAT. NOW, A LOT OF FOLKS ARE VERY CASUALLY THROWING AROUND THE IDEA OF MOVING TO CANADA, YOU BE. PLAWZ PLAWZ. I KNOW, CANADA, THE LANGUAGE OF FRANCE WITH THE CULTURE OF MINNESOTA. BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, YOU'RE WELCOME. BUT DON'T REACH FOR YOUR PASSPORT YET, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, AS THE ELECTION RETURNS WERE COMING IN, THE CANADIAN IMMIGRATION WEBSITE CRASHED. DON'T KNOW WHY! A LOT OF WEBSITES WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT. Apocalypsebunkers.net, Stresseatersanonymous.org, AND Klanklothing.biz YES, WE KLAN! THEY'RE DOING A BRISK BUSINESS. NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY CANADA IS SO ATTRACTIVE. THEY'VE GOT FREE HEALTHCARE AND A PRIME MINISTER WHO LOOKS LIKE THE PRINCE FROM "TANGLED." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT LISTEN UP. EVERYBODY UP THERE, EVERY AMERICAN WHO IS THINKING I'M GOING TO CANADA. YOU DON'T GET TO FLEE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WHEN THINGS GET ROUGH HERE. BEING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IS LIKE FAMILY:  YOU'RE IN IT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, FOR PETE'S SAKE, AT THANKSGIVING, WHEN UNCLE ERNIE HITS THE HIGHBALLS AND STARTS SAYING RACIST THINGS ABOUT THE HELP, YOU DON'T STORM OFF FROM THE TABLE AND MOVE IN WITH YOUR NEXTDOOR NEIGHBOR. YOU STAY AND ELECT HIM COMMANDER IN CHIEF! THAT'S AMERICA! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHEN I'M FEELING SHAKY SOMETIMES-- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS ALL DAY. I DID IT LAST NIGHT WHEN THE RETURNS WERE COMING IN. THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO, WHEN I'M FEELING A LITTLE SHAKY-- AND I THINK YOU GUYS MIGHT BE A LITTLE SHAKY. I LIKE TO PUT THESE ON. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BEFORE, SECONDS AGO I WAS SAD. NOW, I'M A SEXY KITTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? I KNOW THIS TRUTH, I KNOW THIS TRUTH-- TRUMP MAY BE PRESIDENT, BUT I'M STILL A SEXY KITTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ DON'T-- DON'T GO FAR WITH THOSE, MARK. I MIGHT NEED THEM LATER. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING THINGS ABOUT TRUMP'S ELECTION IS THAT IT IS SHOCKING. EVERY POLLSTER JUST SHANKED THIS ONE RIGHT INTO THE WOODS. I MEAN, WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST ASK A MAGIC GOAT WHO'S GOING TO WIN. OH, WAIT. THAT WON'T HELP, EITHER, BECAUSE THEY TRIED THAT IN SCOTLAND, AND IT PICKED HILLARY CLINTON. THANKS FOR NOTHING, MAGIC GOAT! THAT'S WHY YOU GUYS ARE THE DONKEYS OF SHEEP. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT-- BUT THERE ARE SOME POLLING TRADITIONS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THE SO-CALLED SCIENTIFIC POLLS THIS YEAR. LIKE THIS FISH IN INDIA WHO CHOSE TO EAT FOOD OFF A PICTURE OF TRUMP OVER A PICTURE OF CLINTON. IT MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE EVIDENTLY, LIKE A GOLD FISH, TRUMP VOTERS' MEMORIES DON'T GO BACK MORE THAN SEVEN SECONDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S NOT AS SEXY WITHOUT-- BUT MOST ACCURATE OF ALL IS THE THE WAYS TO PROGNOSTICATE IS THE "HALLOWEEN MASK" RULE. WELL, GUESS WHAT? THIS YEAR'S TRUMP MASK OUTSOLD CLINTON'S. AND I BELIEVE HALLOWEEN MASKS CAN PREDICT TRUMP'S CABINET, TOO. GET READY FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL GUY FROM "SCREAM." I GOTTA SAY-- I GOTTA SAY-- GUILIANI'S LOOKING GOOD THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S HAPPY. THAT'S THE HAPPIEST-- THAT'S THE HAPPIEST I'VE EVER SEEN HIM. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M A MAN OF SOME FAITH, AND WHEN BAD THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN-- AND THIS DOES FEEL BAD-- I HAVE TO ASK, HOW COULD GOD LET THIS HAPPEN?
LET WHAT HAPPEN, STEPHEN? ( ANGELIC CHOIR )
Stephen: GOD?
THAT'S MY NAME. DON'T WEAR IT OUT. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?
Stephen: GOD, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE ELECTION LAST NIGHT.
OH, YEAH, THE ELECTION. YOU MUST ALL BE EXCITED ABOUT THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT. YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA.
Stephen: GOD, GOD, WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WEREN'T YOU WATCHING THE ELECTION?
NO, I WAS BINGE-WATCHING "NARCOS" ON NETFLIX. HOW MUCH DID HILLARY WIN BY?
Stephen: LORD, I'M SORRY, BUT CLINTON LOST.
WHAT THE HELL?! THAT SCOTTISH GOAT SAID SHE HAD IT IN THE BAG! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I KNOW! I KNOW! THE FISH WAS RIGHT! ALL THE POLLSTERS WERE WRONG!
HOLD ON. LET ME GOOGLE IT. SAYS HERE HILLARY GOT MORE VOTES THAN TRUMP.
Stephen: YEAH, WELL, THAT'S THE POPULAR VOTE. SHE LOST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
THAT AGAIN? I'M OMNISCIENT, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THE HELL THAT WORKS.
Stephen: NOBODY DOES. ANYWAY, LORD, TRUMP WON.
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT WHITE MEN CAME OUT ON TOP AGAIN, CONSIDERING HOW EVERYONE ASSUMES I LOOK.
Stephen: GOOD POINT.
STEPHEN, I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING. LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU. HOW ABOUT A NEW ANIMAL THAT'S REALLY CUDDLY AND ALSO TASTES GOOD?
Stephen: NO, THANKS. THAT'S VERY KIND, BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL GOOD. CAN YOU AT LEAST TELL US WHAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO?
STEPHEN, IF YOU'RE REALLY UNHAPPY, I COULD JUST HIT THE RESET BUTTON ON HUMANITY. YOU KNOW, MAYBE SEND A FLOOD OR A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS. OH, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A NEW ONE WHERE YOUR HEADS MELT LIKE THAT NAZI IN "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK."
Stephen: THANK YOU, NO. WHAT, WHAT?
YOU DRIP LIKE A CANDLE. IT'S REALLY COOL. NO, AT THIS POINT, WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT YOU CHOSE DONALD TRUMP TO BE OUR PRESIDENT.
HEY! DON'T PIN THIS ON ME! MY WIFE WILL KILL ME!

A BILLION YEARS AGO AGO TWO BLACK HOLES COLLIDED. THEY RELEASED AS MUCH ENERGY IN A TENTH OF A SECOND AS 10 TIMES ALL THE ENERGY RADIATED BY ALL THE STARS IN THE UNIVERSE AT THAT TIME. THAT CREATED A RIPPLE THROUGH THE FABRIC OF SPACE AND TIME, MOVING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE. THERE IT WAS, A BILLION YEARS AGO ON EARTH, OUR LIFE ANCESTORS WERE SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS, TRYING TO EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING MORE AMBITIOUS THAN MICROORGANISMS. A HALF A BILLION YEARS AGO, THE CAM BRIAN EXPLOSION OF LIFE, LIFE GOT INTERESTING. IT DEVELOPED LIMB LIMBS, EYES, LOCO MOTION. AFTER THAT, FAST FORWARD, WE HAVE THE DINOSAURS. BY THE WAY, THIS RIPPLE THROUGH THE FABRIC OF SPACE AND TIME IS STILL MOVING THROUGH SPACE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT. 65 MILLION YEARS ANOTHER THE GIANT LIZARDS WE CALL DINOSAURS WENT AND I THINK WHEN THE ASTEROID HIT, AND THE MAMALIAN ANCESTORS, CAN CAN NOW RISE UP AND OCCUPY THIS NICHE, FRESHLY PRIED OPEN BY THIS ASTEROID. SO THIS MAMMAL BRANCH WOULD CREATE A SUBSET OF ITSELF KNOWN AS PRIMATES. AND AMONG THOSE PRIMATES BECAME-- SOME OF THEM BECAME HUMAN. AND IN THE COMMUNITY OF HUMANS, WE DEVELOPED BIG BRAINS, CAPACITY TO COMMUNICATE, CIVILIZATION, AND WE BIRTHED SOMEONE CALLED ALBERT EINSTEIN. AND IN 1916, HE ADVANCED THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY, PREDICTING THE EXISTENCE OF THESE GRAVITY WAVES. AT THAT POINT, THAT GRAVITY WAVE WAS 100 LIGHT-YEARS FROM EARTH AND STILL HEADED OUR WAY. 100 YEARS LATER, LAST YEAR, AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, THAT WAVE WASHED OVER THE EARTH, JUST WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO TURN ON DETECTORS TO NOTICE THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WE USED LASERS TO DO SO, THAT WERE FIRST PREDICTED BY EINSTEIN BACK IN-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: 19... 16.
EINSTEIN LAID DOWN THE EQUATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LASER, AND 100 YEARS LATER, WE DISCOVER GRAVITATIONAL WAVES USING LASERS. AND SO --

AND IT'S SOAKING, WET, TRIUMPH.
DON'T MIND THE PEE-PEE. THAT'S NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS TRUMP. I JUST WANTED TO PEE ON THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BEFORE TRUMP KNOCKS IT OUT OF BUSINESS.
Stephen: ANOTHER NOW YOU'VE--
VERY ABSORBENT.
Stephen: COVERING ELECTIONS FOR YEARS.
YES.
Stephen: WHY DID THE PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA NOT SEE THIS ONE COMING?
LIKE YOURSELF, THE ELITISTS.

OH, MY GOD, LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITHINATE SILVER. I DON'T WANT TO SAY FIVE 38 IS FLAWED BUT THEY HAVE HILLARY'S CHANCES AT 34% PUT BUT DON'T WORRY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR MODEL NEXT TIME?
YES, THEY'VE COME UP WITH A PLAN TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM. THEY'RE UPPING THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR TO 100%. ( RIM SHOT ).
Stephen: OKAY, SO, WHY-- SO WHY DID CLINTON LOSE, SPECIFICALLY? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY SHE LOST?
BECAUSE HILLARY, IT'S-- PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HER-- THE SOUND OF HER VOICE. IT'S NOT THAT. HILLARY DIDN'T HAVE AN ISSUE. SHE RAN ON NOTHING. BUT, MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP HAD A CLEAR MESSAGE. "I HAVE A HAT. WON'T YOU YOU JOIN ME AND MY HAT?" ( LAUGHTER ).

YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL BAD FOR.
Stephen: WHO?
I FEEL BAD FOR POOR TIM KAINE. YOU KNOW, ALL SUMMER HE'S BEEN FORCED TO TALK IN SPANISH. SO MUCH DURING THE CAMPAIGN, YOU KNOW, IT'S A FACT. HE CAN NO LONGER SPEAK UNTIL SOMEONE PRESSES THE NUMBER 2 ON THEIR PHONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( RIM SHOT SHOT )JUDGE.
FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP?
I WANT TO BE OPTIMISTIC. DON'T YOU THINK HE CAN DO WHAT HE PROMISED AND RETURN US TO A BETTER TIME, LIKE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( RIM SHOT ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO, IT'S GOING TO BE EXCITING? REALLY, IN WHAT WAY? HOW IS IT GOING TO BE EXCITING?

Stephen: WHAT ABOUT CABINET RUMORS? PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WILL FILL HIS CABINET.
BIG CABINET RUMORS. NO WORD YET ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE IF HE WILL HAVE A JOB. BUT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF A NEW CABINET CALLED "SECRETARY, ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT?" I THINK CHRISTIE IS GOING TO BE A HIGH-RANKING CABINET MEMBER, OR HE'LL BE THE WALL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRIUMPH'S ELECTION WATCH 2016 IS ON HULU. TRIUMPH, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
