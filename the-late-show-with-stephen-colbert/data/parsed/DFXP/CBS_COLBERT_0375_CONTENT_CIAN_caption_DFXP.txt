ITS LONG TIME VOICE OF KER MIT THE FROG IS MOVE BLANK BLANK.
Stephen: LET'S SEE, WHO DO WE HAVE NEXT HERE? OKAY, SEAN, REMEMBER, KER MIT HAS TO BE RELATABLE TO CHILDREN SO LET'S TRY TO KEEP IT LIGHT AND FUN, OKAY. ACTION.
YOU HAD A, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE AS DISPICIBLE AS HITLER WHO DIDN'T EVEN SINK TO USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
NEXT! ACTION. (LAUGHTER)
SOMEONE SENT ME AN EMAIL. I CAN'T HELP WHAT SOMEONE SENDS ME.
Stephen.
HE'S A FROG BUT HE'S NOT DUMB, CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS STUPID?
NO WAY THAT YOU HAVE ALL THESE INSTANCES THAT ARE LINKED IN THIS AND THIS AND THAT WHERE THERE IS NOT AN ACTUAL CONNECTION, WHERE THERE IS SMOKE, THERE IS FIRE, AND THERE'S SO MUCH SMOKE.
OKAY, THAT'S LESS DUMB BUT IT NOT WHAT A FROG WOULD SAY, NEXT? ACTION.
AS A TEENAGER I WOULD GO UP TO PEOPLE AT ROCKS AND HAMMERS AND BASEBALL BATS AND HAMMERS AND PEOPLE KNOW THE STORY WHEN I WAS 14 AND I HAD TRIED TO STAB SOMEONE.
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE, SECURITY. ACTION.
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD.
OKAY, REMEMBER, KER MIT IS A BELOVED CHARACTER. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WILL LOVE?
WE NEED A NEW PRESIDENT FAST.
PERFECT, YOU'RE HIRED.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, WE WELCOME JOHN OLIVER. MIKE BER BIG LEAH, AND MICHAEL SHOWALTER FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN IN NEW YORK CITY IT IS STEPHEN COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HI, HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON, CHRIS, PLEASE V A SEAT, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: OH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. LET ME ASK YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION. EVERYBODY FEELING GOOD? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELL, CLEARLY, CLEARLY YOU DO NOT WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE. BECAUSE IT IS WEDNESDAY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THAT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WE ARE SO HUMPED DAY. LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY. LET ME REMIND YOU, RECAP THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE OR ELECTION AND THE DIDN'T HAPPEN, DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WELL, TURNS OUT IT DID, AND THEY DO. BECAUSE YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP, JR. RELEASED EMAILS EXPLICITLY DETAILING AN INVITATION BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO COLLUDE, AND HIS ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE, QUOTE, I LOVE IT! OH, OH DON, NOT AS MUCH AS I DO. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH, YEAH. NOW LISTEN, JUST TO GIVE YOU, OKAY, SO THAT WAS YESTERDAY, THAT WAS YESTERDAY, WE HAVE HAD A FULL NEWS CYCLE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE FALLOUT LET ME PRESENT YOU WITH A BOUQUET OF EARLY BLOOMING HEADLINES. THE WHITE HOUSE IS PARALYZED. AND I'M PRETTY SURE TRUMPCARE DOES NOT COVER THAT. I SEE ANOTHER ONE, READY? HERE WE GO. HERE'S ANOTHER HEADLINE. THE WHITE HOUSE IS FACING A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE. AND REMEMBER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE A SPOTTY TRACK RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH HURRICANES. BUT, OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S NOT FAIR. THOSE WERE "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND CNN. HOW ABOUT HEARING FROM SOMEONE ON THEIR SIDE, TRY "THE NEW YORK POST." DONALD TRUMP, JR. IS AN IDIOT, YES. YES. (APPLAUSE)E YES, KEEP IN MIND, KEEP THIS IN MIND, AND I MEAN THIS, THEY ARE DEFENDING HIM. BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO IDIOT IS INMEAT AND IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT POINT. DONALD TRUMP, JR. IS QUICKLY RISING TO THE RANKS OF AMERICA'S MOST EMBARRASSING DONALD TRUMPS. THINGS ARE SO BAD, THINGS ARE SO BAD, CHECK OUT THIS TWEET OF STAFFERS AND WHITE HOUSE VISITORS PLACING THEIR HANDS ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRAYING FOR HIM TODAY. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: OKAY, EITHER THAT, EITHER THAT OR THEY ARE PLAYING HANDS ON A SOFT BODY. WHOEVER KEEPS THEIR HAND THE LONGEST GETS TO FIRE ROBERT MUELLER. SO WITH HIS AGENDA IN TATTERSES, WITH HIS WHITE HOUSE PARALYZED, IN TURMOIL, WITH HIS FAMILY IN DISGRACE, THE PRESIDENT DID THE RIGHT THING AND HEADED TO FRANCE TONIGHT. FRANCE, AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE, THAT IT'S SAYS SAFE SPACE, TRUMP IS LIKE JERRY LEWIS OVER THERE IN THAT HE SEEMS LIKE AN IDIOT, BECAUSE THIS PROOF OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S COLLUSION MAY HAVE COST THE PRESIDENT SOMETHING HE LOVES EVEN MORE THAN HIS SON. IT WILL COST HIM HIS FAVORITE CATCH PHRASE BECAUSE LAST NIGHT ONE WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR ADMITTED THE RUSSIA STORY WILL GET WORSE AND WORSE AND YOU CAN'T JUST REALLY SAY ANY MORE "FAKE NEWS." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T SAY IT ANY MORE. CAN'T SAY IT. I KNOW HOW DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO FEAL ABOUT THAT. SAD. SO TONIGHT WE BID A FOND FAIRWELL.
WE ARE FIGHTING THE FAKE NEWS. IT'S FAKE, PHONEY, FAKE.
YOU NOTICE NOW THEY'RE USING, EVERYBODY IS USING THE WORD FAKE NEWS. WHERE DID YOU HEAR IT FIRST, FOLKS.
IT'S ALL FAKE NEWS, IT'S PHONEY STUFF T DIDN'T HAPPEN.
FAKE NEWS, CNN. FAKE. WHAT, THE CAMERA JUST WENT OFF. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I'M CRYING FAKE TEARS. (LAUGHTER) SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AGREES, TRUMP, JR. WAS DUMB TO TWEET THIS STUFF. AND THE SMART THING TO DO WOULD BE JUST TO SHUT UP. SO LAST NIGHT HE WENT ON FOX NEWS. (LAUGHTER) AND EXPLAINED WHY HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THIS.
SOMEONE SENT ME AN EMAIL. I CAN'T HELP WHAT SOMEONE SENDS ME.
Stephen: YES, HE CAN'T HELP. HE HAS TO DO WHATEVER IT SAYS IN AN EMAIL THAT IS WHY HIS APARTMENT IS FULL OF NIGERIAN PRINCES AND BONER PILLS. YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP THEM APART. YOU ARE TBING TO WANT TO KEEP THOSE TWO, KEEP THOSE TWO APART. PLUS THIS WAS WAY LAST SUMMER. IT WAS A TOTAL LEIGH DIFFERENT TIME.
THIS IS PREYOU WERE RUSSIA REFER, PRERUSSIA MANIA, 13 MONTHS AGO BEFORE THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, HE COLLUDED WITH THE RUSSIA BEFORE PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIAN COLLUSION. OKAY. THAT'S LIKE SAYING YEAH, I FIRED A GUN AT THAT GUY BUT THAT WAS BEFORE EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE MURDER TRIAL, ALL RIGHT. HOW DID I KNOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO-- BESIDES, I MEAN, THE MEETING WAS A DUED.
IT WAS LITERALLY JUST A WASTED 20 MINUTES WHICH WAS A SHAME.
Stephen: YEAH, IT WAS ALL ON HIS YELP REVIEW, ONE STAR, DID NOT DELIVER TREASON TO TABLE, WOULD NOT COLLUDE AGAIN. AND, IT'S GOING TO BE HARSH FOR HER BUSINESS. SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE SHAKING THAT ONE OFF. I'VE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU, DON, JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR SECRET RUSSIAN  A INTEL DOESN'T MEAN ARE YOU THE GOOD GUY HERE, YOU NEVER HEARD THE PERVS SAY WAIT, WHAT IS WITH THE COPS, I BROUGHT WINE COOLERS, WHAT A WASTED 20 MINUTES.
WAIT, WHAT, WHY, WHERE AM I GOING, WHAT'S HAPPENING? (APPLAUSE) BUT DON, JR. DID LEARN AN IMPORTANT LESSON FROM ALL THIS.
IN RETROSPECT, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. I KNOW MORE NOW BUT HINDSIGHT IS ALWAYS 2020.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT, HINDSIGHT IS 20-20. AND I THINK A LOT OF VOTERS WILL BE USING HINDSIGHT IN 2020. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: AND MEANWHILE, OF COURSE, OF COURSE THE WHITE HOUSE IS DEFENDING DON, JR., ONE OFFICIAL SAID HE JUST WANTS TO HUNT, FISH AND RUN HIS FAMILY'S REAL ESTATE BUSINESS. YES, WHY DID WE FORCE HIM TO GET INTO POLITICS. YOU KNOW HE WOULD RATHER BE IN A FOREST PURSUING HIS FIRST LOVE, BRAWNY MAN COSPLAY. ANOTHER, ANOTHER-- (LAUGHTER) ANOTHER ANONYMOUS SOURCE SAID, THE KID IS AN HONEST KID. OKAY. PUMP THE BRAKES A LITTLE BIT HERE. THIS KID IS A 39 YEAR OLD MAN. AND I GOT TO SAY, IT'S NEVER A GOOD SIGN WHEN THE PERSON STICKING UP FOR YOU WANTS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. DON, JR. IS A GOOD PERSON, WAIT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE MY NAME, RIGHT? EVEN BILL O REILLY ROSE FROM THE NONSPIN CRYPT, TWEETING IT WAS TABLOID GUY SET HIM UP WITH A RUSSIA LAWYER WHO PROMISED HILLARY DIRT, SHE DIDN'T DELIVER. LEAVE IT TO BILL O REILLY TO FIND A WAY TO BLAME THE ONLY WOMAN IN THIS STORY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. CLEARLY SHE'S A COLLUDE TEASE. NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN NOTICEABLY QUIET THROUGH ALL OF THIS, IN PART BECAUSE HIS SCHEDULE IS UNUSUALLY LIGHT. AND HE'S BEEN WATCHING TV AND VENTING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION. LIGHT? TRUMP HAS SPENT HALF HIS PRESIDENCY GOLFING. HOW MUCH LIGHTER CAN HIS SCHEDULE GET. SIR, YOU HAVE TO GET UP, IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED. BUT, BUT, THE PRESIDENT DENIES THERE IS ANY TROUBLE. TWEETING THIS MORNING, THE WHITE HOUSE IS FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY. FOCUSED ON HEALTH CARE, TAX CUTS SLASH REFORMS AND MANY OTHER THINGS. I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME FOR WATCHING TV. I GT TO SAY IT'S NOT EXACTLY COMFORTING WHEN THE PERSON IN CHARGE STARTS RANDOMLY ASSURING YOU THAT EVERYTHING'S JUST FINE.
THERE IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING, THE PLANE IS FUNKING PERFECTLY. WE ARE FOCUSED ON FLYING, LANDING AND MANY OTHER THINGS.
I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME FOR WATCHING TV. MEANWHILE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF IS GOING THROUGH A NEWS SCANDAL AM I HAD TO CHANGE MY EMOTIONAL STATE, GOING THROUGH A NEWS SCANDAL OF HIS OWN. YESTERDAY THERE WERE SOME SHOCKING REVELATIONS FROM FORMER CELEBRITY APPRENTICE AND SPARE TILDA SWINTON CLAY AIKEN. ACCORDING, ACCORDING TO CLAY AIKEN, TRUMP DIDN'T MAKE THE DECISIONS TO FIRE PEOPLE ON CELEBRITY APPRENTICE, THE SHOW'S PRODUCERS FROM NBC MADE THOSE CALLS GIVING TRUMP INSTRUCTIONS THROUGH A TELEPROMPTER ON HIS DESK THAT LOOKED LIKE A PHONE. DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T EVEN CALL THE SHOTS ON HIS OWN TV SHOW. HE'S NOT THE, YOU ARE FIRED, GUY. THAT IS THE SECOND CATCH PHRASE HE LOST IN ONE DAY. THE IMPLICATIONS, OBVIOUSLY-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I KNOW, THE IMPLICATIONS HERE ARE ENORMOUS. MAYBE, MAYBE HE WASN'T THE ONE WHO DECIDED TO FIRE GARY BUSEY AFTER HIS MECHANICAL DOG IDEA. MAYBE IT WASN'T DONALD TRUMP'S IDEA TO HAVE LaTOYA JACKSON AND LIL JOHN WORK IN A PIZZA PARLOR FOR CHARITY. OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD. DONALD TRUMP MAY NOT BE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JOHN OLIVER. STICK AROUND. â™ª
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. JON, LISTEN MAN, I'M SUPER ERCK SIGHTED, I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY WATCHING OUT THERE THAT NEXT WEEK IS OUR RUSSIA SHOW, ALL WEEK LONG PIECES WE SHOT IN RUSSIA. HERE IS THE THING, I DON'T KNOW IF I TOLD THIS TO YOU BUT I WAS TALKING TO CHRIS ABOUT THIS ABOUT WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR RUSSIA WEEK, WE HAVE SO MUCH MATERIAL, WE SHOT SO MUCH OVER THERE, FIVE PIECES WE SHOT OVER THERE. AND WE WANT TO HAVE THEM PRETTY OF ALL DONE BEFORE THEY WE ANNOUNCE THE WEEK. I SAID IF WE WAIT UNTIL THE 17th OF JULY IS ANYBODY GOING TO STILL BE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA. I WAS ACTUALLY AFRAID, REALLY, ARE PEOPLE GOING TO CARE BY THE 17th OF JULY. AND YOU SAID PROBABLY. SO I WAS WRONG. I WAS WRONG. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M TERRIBLY EXCITED BECAUSE MY FIRST GUEST TOBT IS THE EMMY AND PEABODY-WINNING HOST OF "LAST WEEK TONIGHT," PLEASE WELCOME OUR FRIEND MR. JOHN OLIVER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) .
Stephen: AS YOU WERE.
GOOD EVENING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NICE SEEING YOU.
AND YOU.
Stephen: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE HERE.
THAT'S LIT REALLILY TOO MANY O-WS!
Stephen: WE'LL EDIT SOME OUT.
NO, THAT IS A PROBLEM, I ACKNOWLEDGE, BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO IT IS LIKE GIVING A CHILD A TAMBOURINE, YOU CANNOT BE TRUSTED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE POWER YOU HAVE.
Stephen: YOU ARE ON HIATUS RIGHT NOW.
YES.
Stephen: BETWEEN SEASONS.
BETWEEN SEASONS. HAVE I BEEN CANCELED, WHAT?
Stephen: BETWEEN SEASONS.
JUST BETWEEN WEEKS. WE'RE WORKING, BUT WE'RE-- .
Stephen: YOU HAVE A SHOW SUNDAYS.
NO, WE'RE WORKING WITHOUT DOING A SHOW. IT IS THE DREAM. SO WE'RE IN THE OFFICE AND WORKING, RESEARCHING BUT HE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AT THE END OF IT. SO EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.
Stephen: WOW, AND YOU CAN GET PAID FOR THAT? CUZ I ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME OUT HERE AND TALK EVERY NIGHT.
I THINK THAT'S THE MISTAKE. I THINK, IT IS THE ULTIMATE BANK HEIST, ISN'T IT, NOT HAVING TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE ANYTHING AT THE END OF IT.
Stephen: THOSE DRAGONS ARE PAYING FOR EVERYTHING.
AS LONG AS THE DRAGONS ARE OKAY, EVERYTHING IS OKAY AT HBO. HAVE THEY GOT DEFIBRILLATORS FOR THOSE DRAGONS, IT IS A DRAGON BASED ECONOMY.
Stephen: I IMAGINE YOU TAKE THESE TWO WEEKS OFF BECAUSE THIS IS THE PART OF THE SUMMER WHERE YOU GO NOTHING, NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
IT'S ALWAYS HAPPEN, IT IS SAFE. YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN OFFSPRING WHO IS SO STUPID, THAT IS THE ONLY-- AND WHAT IS THE CHANCE OF THAT, NOTHING. NOTHING. WE HAD-- WE CALLED THIS WHOLE LOOMING SCANDAL WAY BACK IN MARCH, WE CAME UP WITH THIS DEVICE FOR STUPID WATERGATE, THAT IDEA THAT SOMETHING WITH ALL OF THE GRAVITAS FOR WATERGATE WHERE EVERYBODY INVOLVED IS STUPID AND BAD AT EVERYTHING. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SELF-CONTAINED JOINT BUT CURRENT EVENTS ARE MAKING IT MORE AND MORE RELEVANT WHICH IS NOT NORMALLY HOW JOKES WORK.
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHEN TRUMP, JR. TWEETED EMAILS YESTERDAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: WITHOUT A GUN TO HIS HEAD, I MIGHT ADD.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE FIRST ONE SAID, FIRST ONE, SAID THIS IS PART OF RUSSIA, AND IT'S GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP. WHAT WAS YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT IS PROBABLY WOW. AND THEN IT IS PROBABLY FOLLOWED BY THE IDEA WELL, THIS IS SOMETHING, AS LONG AS WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE SOMETHING MEANS ANYTHING. AND I'M NOT SURE WE DO ANY MORE.
Stephen: I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, YEAH.
IT SEEMS SERIOUS BUT DO WE LIVE IN A WORLD DEVOID OF CONSEQUENCES NOW, I FORGET WHERE WE ARE IN HUMAN HISTORY.
Stephen: RIGHT.
THAT IS THE MIND BLOWING PART, THIS SEEMS LIKE A SEISMIC EVENT BUT IT MIGHT BE NOTHING.
Stephen: RIGHT T MIGHT BE, I WAS TALKING WITH MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, TOM, EARLIER TODAY AND WE WERE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, I AM USED TO A WORLD WHERE WE'RE DIVIDED ON THINGS LIKE ABORTION OR TAXES, OR GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF HEALTH CARE.
POLARIZING ISSUES.
Stephen: POLARIZING ISSUES. HAVE WE COME TO A NATION WHERE COLLUDING WITH A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER TO MANIPULATE OUR ELECTION IS A LEFT RIGHT THING?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: IS THAT IT? IS THAT WHERE WE ARE?
BUT THE VERY FACT YOU JUST SAID THAT SENTENCE OUTLOUD SHOWED THAT WE ARE TURBO [BLEEP]. JUST THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SAY IT! THAT'S-- WHAT I FOUND AMAZING WAS HIS CONFIDENCE IN SAYING THIS IS NOTHING. AND I DONE KNOW WHAT IS HE REFERRING TO THERE, THE CONTENTS OF THE EMAIL, THE CONTENT OF HIS HEAD IT IS THE SECOND ONE, I AGREE, IF IT IS THE FIRST, I FIERCELY DISAGREE. YOU ABOUT I CONDITION EVEN FATHOM HOW HIS LAWYER FELT, I TWEETED IT OUT, IT IS NOTHING. OH, BUT THAT'S A LOT. IT IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF NOTHING. AND IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT, IT'S EVEN BIGGER. I CAN'T-- I THINK I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR LAWYER ANY MORE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: I THINK HIS LAWYER, YOU KNOW WHAT HIS LAWYER NEEDS, A LAWYER. DO YOU THINK THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND? BECAUSE IT SEEMS SELF-EVIDENT. IT SEEMS SELF-EVIDENT, PEOPLE LIKE TRAY GOWDY OR "THE NEW YORK POST" SAYING THIS IS, YEAH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.
BUT AGAIN, THE FACT WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE ARE GOING, DO YOU THINK THEY UNDERSTAND. IS IT POSSIBLE THERE'S NOT A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF THOUGHT IN THEIR MINDS THAT HAVE MADE THEM UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN. THE FACT THAT WE ARE WONDERING THAT, AND YOU WONDER IT NOT JUST WITH THIS ISSUE BUT WITH A LOT. ARE THEY JUST TOO DUMB TO REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THE ANSWER IS NOT DEFINITELY NO.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: THAT IS THE MOST CHILLING THING ABOUT THIS, YOU ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW.
THAT IS WHAT IS MAKING THIS A ROLLER COASTER TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Stephen: YEAH. WELL, SPEAKING OF AMERICAN HISTORY, RUSSIA, BECAUSE.
YEAH, YES, WELCOME HOME.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
WELL DONE.
Stephen: YOU HEARD ME SAYING EARLIER WHEN I WAS INTRODUCING YOU HERE, THAT WE DELAYED PUTTING OUR RUSSIA STUFF BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH STUFF TO GO THROUGH AND SOME OF IT LITERALLY HAD TO BE TRANSLATED. AND I SO I WAS WORRIED IT WOULDN'T BE RELEVANT THREE WEEKS ON. YOU WENT TO RUSSIA. YOU INTERVIEWED EDWARD SNOWDEN.
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
Stephen: HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE.
FOR THE LEAST AMOUNT TIME WE COULD POSSIBLY BE THERE BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS WERE ANGRY WE WERE THERE. AND THE AMERICANS WERE ANGRY THAT WE HAD GONE. AND IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING AROUND 36 HOURS I'VE SPENT.
Stephen: DID YOU GO TO MOSCOW, ST. PETERSBURG.
JUST MOSCOW. SO WE LANDED AND IT'S JUST A GROUP OF TERRIFYING-LOOKING PEOPLE IN YOUR HOTEL. AT THE BEST OF TIMES, LARGE RUSSIAN MEN HAVE ARRESTING FACE OF INTERNATIONAL HITMAN. AT THE BEST OF TIMES.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. I CALLED THEM LIKE EXTRAS FROM JOHN WITT, THAT IS WHAT-- WIT THAT IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE IN THE LOBBY.
LITERAL LeIN THE WILL BEE. YOU CHECKING IN, I THINK THIS MAN COULD BREAK ME WITH HIS EYES.
Stephen: RIGHT.
SNAP ME.
Stephen: AND THERE IS ONE OUTSIDE YOUR HALL.
YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: FOLLOWED BY THE FSB, THE NEW KGB IS THE FSB.
ALL THE TIME, YOU THINK I'M JUST BEING PAR MOID,-- PARANOID, IT'S WORSE, I'M NOT BEING PARANOID, I'M SEEING THINGS I THINK I'M SEEING.
Stephen: WERE YOU FOLLOWED BY THE AMERICANS OVER THERE.
WE FOUND RUSSIANS, THEY WENT INTO MY ROOM, MESSED WITH MY STUVMENT THERE WAS A GUY DRILLING IN MY CEILING AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING, OBVIOUSLY JUST SITTING THERE, THIS WILL FRIGHTENING HIM, AND I'M LYING THERE THINKING YOU'RE RIGHT, I AM, I'M FRIGHTENED. YOU HAVE ACHIEVED YOUR GOAL. MY PRODUCER FOUND SOMEONE IN HIS HOTEL ROOM, AND HE WAS NEAR THE WINDOW AND HE SAID YOU CALLED DOWNSTAIRS TO HAVE YOUR WINDOW OPENED. IT'S FEBRUARY, WE'RE IN MOSCOW, YOU HAVE TO TRY HARDER THAN THAT.
Stephen: HOLD ON ONE SECRETARY. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WE'LL BE RATE BACK WITH MORE JOHN OLIVER, STICK AROUND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE BACK, EVERYBODY. MR. JOHN OLIVER, JOINING US HERE ON OUR PROGRAM ALREADY IN PROGRESS. I UNDERSTAND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THIS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO ASK ABOUT HERE, BECAUSE YOU ALREADY DECIDED NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: YOU ARE BEING SUED-- RIGHT NOW.
YES.
Stephen: BY A COAL COMPANY.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS IS YOU'RE TORTURING ME.
Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME.
I LITERALLY PROMISED MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER BEFORE I CAME HERE I WON'T TALK ABOUT IT AM AND NOW WE'RE HERE.
Stephen: SURE.
WELL, THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I WANT TO SAY, I'M BURSTING, LOOK INTO MY EYES, THERE IS SO MUCH, SO MUCH.
Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW.
SO MUCH I WANT TO SAY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: SO LET ME JUST SAY A FEW THINGS AND YOU SIT THERE.
OKAY, SURE, I WILL DO MY POKER FACE.
Stephen: IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY BEING SUED BY COAL MAGAZINE NATE ROBERT MURRAY-- MAGNATE ROBERT MURRAY. YOU TOLD A STORY THAT HE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS.
OH NO, I'M IN SO MUCH TROUBLE, NOT WITH THE LAWSUITS-- .
Stephen: HE THAT HE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS ON STARTING HIS COAL COMPANY FROM A SQUIRREL S THAT TRUE? AM I IN THE BALL PARK OF GETTING YOU SUED AGAIN? AM I GOING TO BE SUED FOR ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS.
THIS IS HELL. I AM IN HELL RIGHT NOW. ALL I HAVE IS A SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD, OH, THIS WOULD BE FUNNY TO SAY, THIS WOULD BE FUNNY, THIS WOULD BE INTERESTING AND THEN ANOTHER THING GOING YOU'RE DEAD IF IT HAPPENS.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A LAWYER.
OH YEAH.
Stephen: IT IS-- IT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP, JR.'S LAWYER, I HOPE.
NO.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A BETTER LAWYER.
YOU'VE BEEN SUED, RIGHT.
Stephen: I WAS THE FIRST PERSON EVER SUED AT THE DAILY SHOW.
OH MAAZEL TOV.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THAT IS WHAT MY LAWYER SAID. I WAS SUED FOR CASUALLY NFERRING THAT A RETIRED LAWYER IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT HAVE BEEN AKIN TO HITLER AND AS A RETIRED LAWYER HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO SUE ME. NOT A GOOD PERSON TO SAY THAT ABOUT.
DID YOU SETTLE?
Stephen: WE WON, WE WON.
I'M GOING TO DO THAT AS WELL, OH GOD, THAT WAS TOO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) S YOU'RE GOING TO WIN. SURE. JUST IN CASE.
YEAH.
Stephen: JUST IN CASE YOU DON'T WIN, DID YOU SAVE THE ADDRESS OF WHERE ED SNOWDEN IS LIVING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I'M SURE RUSSIA WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU BACK.
THEY WOULD LOVE THAT, THEY HAVE THE DRILL WARMED UP AND READY.
Stephen: THE STRANGEST THING ABOUT RUSSIA TO ME IS IT SEEMS SO MUCH LIKE THE WEST.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT IS LIKE THE UNCANNY VALLEY OF THE WEST. YOU THINK IT'S WESTERN AND THEN YOU GO WAIT, THAT'S NOT A LEAF, THAT'S A SPIDER PRETENDING TO BE A LEAF, YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME WEIRD EVOLUTIONARY MONKEY-- BRAIN THAT MAKES YOU SCOOT AWAYNESS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT I A RATIONAL PERSON THINKS I KNOW WHAT I DO WILL, GET IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS COUNTRY, OR ALLY, HYPOTHETICALLY BUT THAT WOULD EVER IN HAPPEN, NO ONE WOULD EVER SUGGEST THAT, SOMETHING THAT INEXRENSABLY STUPID. -- INCOME PREHENCABLY STU WID. WE CAN'T LIVE IN THAT WORLD, PLEASE TELL ME THAT WE DON'T.
Stephen: I DONE LIVE IN THAT WORLD. LAST WEEK TONIGHT AIRS SUNDAYS ON HBO. NOT THIS SUNDAY BUT AFTER THAT. JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MIKE BIRBIGLIA. WNL HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST IS A STAND UP COMEDIAN YOU HAVE SEEN IN MOVIES LIKE SLEEP WALK WITH ME, DON'T THINK TWICE AND TRAINWRECK, PLEASE WELCOME MIKE BIRBIGLIA. (APPLAUSE).

I JUST FOUND THAT OUT.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

Stephen: WAS' THAT, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?
I MEAN IT'S NICE, OBVIOUSLY. I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE MORE ATTENTION PUT ON AN AWARD I WON A FEW YEARS AGO. I DON'T WANT TO STEAL FOCUS BUT I BROUGHT THE PHOTO TONIGHT.
Stephen: THEY ACTUALLY HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.
IT IS AN AWARD THAT I RECEIVED IN THIRD GRADE THAT I FEEL LIKE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH ATTENTION. WHERE I WAS THE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIRD GRADE. ST. MARY'S SCHOOL.
Stephen: ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.
YEAH, AUTHOR OF THE MONTH.
Stephen: AUTHOR OF THE MONTH.
LOOK AT T AUTHOR OF THE MONTH. I WAS ONE OF THE MORE SUNBURNED AUTHORS IN HISTORY.
Stephen: JOHN YUP DIKE NEVER HAD A TAN THAT GOOD. HOW DOES A THIRD GRADER BECOME THE AUTHOR OF THE MONTH, WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THIS.
THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. I REALLY DIDN'T, I DIDN'T DO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER KIDS BUT THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT AGAIN. THEY DIDN'T AWARD IT AGAIN.
Stephen: WAIT, THIS WAS THE FIRST.
THE FIRST AND LAST, YEAH, YEAH. BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE, IT STAYED ON THE WALL FOR FOUR YEARS. AND SO I WAS THE AUTHOR OF FOUR YEARS.
Stephen: WOW.
SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING ATTENTION TO THAT.
Stephen: WELL, YOU ARE HEADLINING STANDUP COMEDIAN RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE MADE IT AT THIS POINT. ONCE YOU, YOU HAVE GOT THE MOVIES. ONCE YOU GET STANDUP OF THE YEAR AT THE FESTIVAL, BUT STARTING OFF IT CAN BE A GRIND. I DIDN'T DO STANDUP BUT I TOURED.
SECOND CITY.
Stephen: IN YOUR EARLY DAYS, WHAT WAS SOME OF THE TOUGHER-- GIGS.
I FEEL LIKE THIS, I'M GOING TO MONTREAL IN TWO WEEKS AND I FEEL LUCKY BECAUSE I'M DOING MY OWN SHOW, IT'S CALLED THE NEW ONE. BUT I REMEMBER YEARS AGO, I WAS ASKED TO BE IN MONTREAL AND IT WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE IT WAS, WHERE THEME NIGHTS IN COMEDY WERE A BIG WAY TO SELL TICKETS, IT WOULD BE LIKE IT'S GAY COMEDY NIGHT, IT'S URBAN COMEDY NIGHT, IT'S GUYS WITH SILLY SHOES COMEDY NIGHT. AND I DIDN'T FIT ANY OF THOSE. THERE WASN'T LIKE GUY WHO JUST TALKS COMEDY. AND, AND SO THEY STUCK ME IN THE ITALIAN SHOW. AND I-- .
Stephen: BIRBIGLIA.
YEAH, BUT I'M LIKE OLIVE GARDEN ITALIAN. I'M NOT REAL ITALIAN. I'M LIKE OLIVE GARDEN ITALIAN. AND SOMETIME PEOPLE PIGEON HOLE YOU INCOMER ITALY IT'S CALL PROPOUNCED BIR-BILIA. AND I'M LAKE IN AMERICA, YOU YOU'RE ANNOYING, BUT I REALLY WAS A LETDOWN TO THESE PEOPLE IN MONTREAL BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER ACTS WERE LIKE MY UNCLE ENZO WAS LIKE WHERE IS THE CANOLI, AND WE'RE LIKE I ALREADY TOLD YOU WHERE THE CANOLLI. AND THAT WAS THE PUNCH LINE OR WHATEVER. AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT. I WOULDST JUST DO THESE LONG ELABORATE STORIES, LIKE I WAS SLEEP WALKING AND THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT IS ITALIAN LIKE THAT. AND I WAS LIKE MAMA MIA, I WAS JUST A LETDOWN. IT WAS-- BUT IT'S NICE IT GO BACK WITH MY OWN SHOW WHERE IT'S MY OWN THING.
Stephen: SO DID YOU, LIKE ONE OF THE THINGS, WHEN I WAS STARTING OFF IS, SOME OF THE GUYS USED TO WORK WITH ME DID IT WITH ME. WE WOULD DRIVE AROUND THE COUNTRY, YOU DROVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE, YOU ARE NOT JET SETTING WHEN ARE YOU STARTING OFF. ARE YOU IN A VAN MOST OF THE TIME, LIKE A SMELLY VAN.
WELL, I DID HAVE A VAN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AT FIRST I DROVE MY MOM'S STATION WAGON AND THEN SHE TOOK IT BACK. (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS A LONER, AND I DECIDED TO BUY, I BOUGHT A GMC CONVERSION VAN BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR. I WANTED TO BE LIKE, I WANTED TO BE A POPULAR HIGH SCHOOL SEN YR. AND SO I GOT THIS THIS AND IT HAPPENED TO, NOT BY DESIGN BUT HAPPENED TO LOOK A LITTLE LIKE THE A TEAM VAN IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ACTION ADVENTURE SEARS FROM THE '80S WHERE IT'S ABOUT THIS GROUP OF MEN WHO ARE ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW. NOW THIS IS CRUCIAL, FOR CRIMES THEY DID NOT COMMIT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT RELATABLE.
Stephen: SURE.
IF YOU ARE WATCHING, THEY ARE LIKE US. DID YOU EVER SEE THE SHOW.
Stephen: YES.
I GREW UP ON THE SHOW AND IN RETROSPECT I REALIZE THAT WAS LIKE AT THE HEAD OF THE SHOW, THESE MEN ARE ON THE RUN FROM CRIME FOR CRIMES THEY DID NOT COMMIT. SURELY THEY TESTED IT AT SOME POINT. LIKE WHY WOULD WE ROOT FOR THE CRIMINALS.
AND THEN THEY ARE LIKE I GOT AN IDEA, LUT'S SAY IT'S CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. AND THEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE YEAH, I LIKE THESE GUYS.
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT SO I GET THIS VAN, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT VAN A LITTLE BIT SO I DECIDE TO GO FULL A TEAM. GI TO MAACO AND I SAY CAN YOU MAKE THIS BLACK WITH A RED STRIPE ON THE SIDE.
Stephen: AND DID THIS ACTUAL VAN.
BEFORE I COULD FINISH THE SENTENCE THE GUY AT MAACO GOES A TEAM VAN? AND THEN HE PUT HIS HAND UP TO HIGH FIVE ME. (APPLAUSE) YES! AND MY BROTHER JOE WHO IS HERE BACKSTAGE, HE AND I WERIVE DROOING TO CANADA FOR THIS FESTIVAL PROBABLY TEN YEARS AGO. AND WE DROVE THROUGH CUSTOMS AND IT LOOKS, THE A TEAM VAN LOOKS LIKE IT HAS WEAPONS IN IT. LIKE IT-- LIKE IF THE CUSTOMS OFFICER SAW IT FROM LIKE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, WE ARE JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, JUST LIKE JACKPOT, WE GOT THE BIG FISH, IT'S OVER.
Stephen: YEAH.
IT WAS A FANTASY FOR THEM. AND SO THEY RIP IT APART AND WE WERE THERE FOR TWO HOURS, PULLING OUT THE SEATS AND THE SIDE COMPARTMENT. BUT WHAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT WE WERE CONVICTED OF CRIMES THAT WE DIDN'T COMMIT.
Stephen: FULL CIRCLE.
NOTHING, THEY HAD NOTHING ON ME. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: MIKE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: MIKE, THE NEW ONE COMEDY TOUR HAS TICKETS ON SALE NOW, MIKE BIRBIGLIA, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MICHAEL SHOWALTER, ALL THE MICHAELS ARE HERE TONIGHT.
