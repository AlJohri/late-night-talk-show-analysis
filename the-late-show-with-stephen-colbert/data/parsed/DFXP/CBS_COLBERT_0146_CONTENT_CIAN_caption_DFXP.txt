Stephen: HEY, WEIRD AL. I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY BEFORE THE SHOW AND SAY, UH -- ARE YOU LISTENING TO CLASSICAL MUSIC AND READING POETRY?
ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN. ARE YOU SURPRISED?
Stephen: IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE -- WEIRD AN.
OH, I SEE. BECAUSE MY NAME BEGINS WITH THE WORD "WEIRD," YOU PRESUME ME TO BE AN UNCOUTH GUTTER FLY.
Stephen: NO, YOU'RE JUST KNOWN FOR DOING PARODIES OF POP SONGS.
I DO ALSO PARODIES OF GREAT POETRY. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ROBERT FROST STOPPING BY SNOWY YODS?
Stephen: HE WILL NOT STOP ME TO SEE HIS WOODS FILL UP WITH SNOW.
LISTEN TO THIS, WHOSE PIZZA THIS IS, I THINK I KNOW. THIS MAN IS IN THE BATHROOM, THOUGH. HE WILL NOT SEE ME EATING HERE TO WATCH MY MOUTH FILL UP WITH DOUGH.
Stephen: OH, THAT IS SO MOVING. I'M SORRY I STEREOTYPED YOU.
YOU'RE FORGIVEN  MY GOOD MAN. GIVE ME LEAVE SO I CAN BE ALONE WITH MY POETRY.
Stephen: OF COURSE. THOUGH, AL, PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW.

Stephen: HEY, WELCOME! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT'S GOING ON! GOOD TO SEE YA! HEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOO! THAT'S GOOD ENERGY! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WOW! I GOTTA TELL YA, I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL. I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL THAT ENERGY. YOU CAN FEEL IT. THIS ROOM IS ELECTRIC RIGHT NOW. I FEEL LIKE I COULD TAKE THIS AUDIENCE, I COULD GRIND THEM UP AND SNORT THEM, THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC -- AND TOTALLY LEGAL, TOO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I NEED THAT ENERGY. I CAME OUT HERE A LITTLE BIT QUIETER TONIGHT BECAUSE I WAS UP A LITTLE LATER LAST NIGHT THAN I NORMALLY AM. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING CALLED UP-FRONTS IN THE TV BIZ RIGHT NOW WHERE EVERYBODY FROM TELEVISION IS IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHOWS ARE GOING TO BE ON THE DIFFERENT NETWORKS NEXT YEAR, AND WE'RE ONE OF THEM, SO -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- SO I WENT AND DID THE THING YESTERDAY, AND THERE ARE PARTIES YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO. YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE PARTIES FOR THE TV PEOPLE TO BE ON TV WITH EACH OTHER. LAST NIGHT I WENT TO ONE AND HAD WAY MORE FUN THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE AT THE PARTY AND I SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF THE NIGHT -- ACTUALLY ALL OF THE NIGHT NEXT TO THE BAR. WITH MY FRIEND CHRIS, MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND MY FRIEND JOHN DICKERSON, WHO IS THE HOST OF "FACE THE NATION." LET'S SAY, LAST NIGHT, WE GOT -- NATION-FACED AT THAT BAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DID. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT NOW?
Stephen: NATION-FACED. WE HAD BURGERS AROUND 1:00 A.M. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ENERGY YOU GOT FROM ME TONIGHT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SUCK ON YOU LIKE A LAMP. CAN I SAY THAT? I'M NOT SURE. BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, WE HAVE BREAKING VICE PRESIDENTIAL NEWS FROM OHIO. JIM?
MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN, AND I LOVE ICE CREAM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: MY NAME IS STEPHEN COLBERT, AND I LOVE JOE BIDEN. (LAUGHTER) TO BE FAIR, I PLAYED THAT CLIP OUT OF CONTEXT. THE FULL CONTEXT IS... THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. I GOT TO THINK AT THIS POINT HE'S JUST KIND OF PHONING IN HIS JOB FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. FIRST HE WAS TASKED WITH BRINGING DEMOCRACY TO IRAQ AND THEN THE PRESIDENT PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF CURING CANCER. I WAS, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT? SCREW IT! I'M OPENING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH HAAGEN DAZS!" AND IF YOU THINK JOE BIDEN IS KIDDING, HE'S NOT.
YOU ALL THINK I'M KIDDING. I'M NOT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HE MEANS IT, FROM THE HEART! THAT IS FROM THE HEART, FROM HIS ICE CREAM-CLOGGED HEART. I'M SORRY, YOU WERE SAYING, SIR?
YOU ALL THINK I'M KIDDING. I'M NOT. I EAT MORE ICE CREAM THAN THREE OTHER PEOPLE YOU'D LIKE TO BE WITH, ALL AT ONCE. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? YOU GOT A BRAIN FREEZE? YOU'VE GOT TO SLOW DOWN, BUDDY. GOD, I WISH HE WAS RUNNING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHO IS RUNNING, HILLARY CLINTON. THE ROAD'S A LITTLE ROUGH FOR HER RIGHT NOW. SHE NEEDS ALL THE HELP SHE CAN GET. JUST NOT THE KIND OF HELP SHE'S GETTING FROM FORMER PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ED RENDELL, WHO TRIED TO HELP BY ATTACKING HER OPPONENT, SAYING, "TRUMP'S COMMENTS LIKE, 'YOU CAN'T BE A 10 IF YOU'RE FLAT-CHESTED, WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT HIM.'" AND THEN RENDELL HELPFULLY ADDED, "THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE UGLY WOMEN IN AMERICA THAN ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. PEOPLE TAKE THAT STUFF PERSONALLY." YEP, I HAVE A FEELING A LOT OF WOMEN ARE ABOUT  TO TAKE THAT REALLY PERSONALLY. RENDELL IS WAY OUT OF LINE. AMERICA IS FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ESPECIALLY AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP LAUNCHES "OPERATION UGGOS TO GITMO". SEAL TEAM SIX, UGH, GIVE ME SEAL TEAM TEN. SUMMER VACATION IS STARTING. ANYONE PLANNING ON GOING TO A NATIONAL PARK THIS SUMMER?
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
Stephen: ANYBODY GOING TO A NATIONAL PARK THIS SUMMER? ANYBODY? JUST A COUPLE? I'M SORRY YOUR KIDS HAD TO FIND OUT THIS WAY. I PROMISE: LOOKING AT ROCKS IS JUST AS FUN AS ROLLERCOASTERS. BUT THERE COULD BE CHANGES COMING TO THE PARKS. BECAUSE THE NATIONAL PARKS SERVICE IS SO DESPERATE FOR CASH THAT THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY ARE GOING TO SOLICIT CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP. PRETTY SOON, WE COULD BE SEE THOSE SEQUOIAS COULD BE BROUGHT TO YOU BY VIAGRA. (LAUGHTER) REMEMBER, IF YOUR REDWOOD LASTS MORE THAN 2,000 YEARS, CALL YOUR LUMBERJACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE)  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS MOTION MEANS IN THIS METAPHOR. IN THIS METAPHOR, THIS DOESN'T LOOK THAT PLEASANT. NOW, THE PARKS SERVICE PROMISES THAT CORPORATE NAMING RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED, BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY. WE'VE UNCOVERED THIS P.S.A. FROM OUR GOOD FRIEND SMOLDERY THE BEAR. ♪ ♪

MMM! EAT FRESH! MMM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, SMOLDERY! NOW SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! (PLAYING THEME) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS ELECTION HAS NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITING. TERROR IS A KIND OF EXCITEMENT, RIGHT? AND THIS SUMMER COULD SEE THE MOST EXCITING REPUBLICAN CONVENTION EVER.
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT DONALD TRUMP KNOWS, IT IS ENTERTAINMENT. HE HAS SOME DETAILS TO PUT SERIOUS SHOW BIZ INTO THE G.O.P. CONVENTION.
THEY ARE ALREADY COMPILING A LIST OF CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP IN THE PAST IN HOPES MAYBE THOSE FOLKS WILL WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN CLEVELAND COME JULY.
HE LOVES GLITZ AND GLAMOUR. HE KNOWS HOW TO CREATE DRAMA.
STEPHEN: YES, TRUMP KNOWS HOW TO CREATE DRAMA, MAYBE EVEN TRAGEDY. BUT AS TRUMP'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR EXPLAINS, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE TREATING THIS LIKE SOME SILLY REALITY SHOW.
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE REALITY SHOW.
STEPHEN: RIGHT ULTIMATE REALITY SHOW. GO ON.
IT'S THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'LL PUT IT IN WAYS WE HOPE WILL BE ENTERTAINING AND MORE IMPORTANT, INFORMATIVE.
STEPHEN: YES, REALITY SHOWS ARE ENTERTAINING AND INFORMATIVE. JUST LOOK HOW "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" INFORMED US ABOUT HOW MUCH MEATLOAF HATES IT WHEN YOU STEAL HIS ART SUPPLIES.
WHAT'S WRONG? I BOUGHT THOSE (BLEEP) SPONGES. PART OF THAT PAINT IS MINE. I'M (BLEEP) SICK AND TIRED OF THIS.
MEAT, DON'T DO IT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO (BLEEP) WITH ME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN:  I APOLOGIZE. THAT WAS ENTERTAINING BUT CBS MADE US BLEEP MOST OF THAT INFORMATION. (LAUGHTER) AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT TRUMP IS TREATING THE CONVENTION LIKE A REALITY SHOW IS HOLDING OFF ANNOUNCING HIS RUNNING MATE. AS ONE TRUMPLING SAID: "ANNOUNCING THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE BEFORE THE CONVENTION IS LIKE ANNOUNCING THE WINNER OF "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE" BEFORE THE FINAL SHOW IS ON THE AIR." IT'S AN APT METAPHOR, BECAUSE THIS YEAR'S REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WILL BE THE SERIES FINALE OF AMERICA. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE INMEMORIAM REEL FOR LIBERTY. THEN AGAIN, THE CONVENTION IS BEING HELD IN CLEVELAND'S QUICKEN LOANS ARENA -- THE Q! I HAVE BEEN TOLD IT'S CALLED THE Q! WHICH HAS ALSO HOSTED THE WWE MONSTER JAM, AND FREESTYLE MOTOCROSS MADNESS, SO THIS CONVENTION MIGHT BE REALLY FUN.
MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, JULY, A FOUR-DAY TELEVISION EVENT THAT'S GOING TO ROCK WHAT'S LEFT OF AMERICA! IT'S THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION! THERE IS GOING TO BE YELLING, ANGRY WHITE MEN, HATS WITH WORDS ON THEM! WATCH DONALD TRUMP ROPE AND BRAND A NAKED TED CRUZ! BUT THAT'S NOT ALL... TOUCH REAL BRAINS AT DR. BEN CARSON'S FREAK-A-TORIUM. THE MARITAL CAGE IMAGINE, THREE WIVES ENTER, ONE LEAVES. AND DONALD TRUMP WILL ANNOUNCE HIS RUNNING MATE. COME ONE COME ALL. UNLESS YOU'RE A MEXICAN, MUSLIM OR A WOMAN WHO'S NOT A 10!

ROCCO.
Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC! YOUR FIRST CHILD?
YES.
Stephen: HE'S EXTRAORDINARILY TIRED. IT WAS FOUR DAYS AFTER THE BABY WAS BORN AND HE HAD NOT SLEPT IN FOUR DAYS.
I WAS TIRED AS WELL.
Stephen: YOU DID THE BULK OF THE WORK HERE, BUT IT'S BEEN COUPLE OF MONTHS, HAVE EA EITHER OF YOU SLEPT ANY?
NOT MUCH.
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHILD.
WHO NEEDS SLEEP? JUST ROLL ON COFFEE AND LOVE.
Stephen: THERE IS QUITE AN EDUCATION TO HAVE YOUR FIRST BABY. ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU ABOUT IT?
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. MAYBE AN HOUR, HOUR AND 45 MINUTES JUST TO GET OUT THE DOOR. YOU HAVE TO BRING SO MANY THINGS WITH YOU, THE BOTTLE AND THIS AND THAT, AND WHEN YOU GET OUT, IT STIRS UP EVERYWHERE. THEN YOU HAVE TO GET INSIDE AGAIN.
Stephen: THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE BABIES CLEANER. I THINK YOU WILL FIND WHEN THEY'RE REALLY SMALL, THEY'RE EASIER TO GET AROUND WITH BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE HANDLE LIKE THEY'RE IN A CHAIR ALL THE TIME, THEY HAVE A HANDLE AND ONCE THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT, YOU'RE SCREWED. YOU'RE --
I SHOULD COUNT MY BLESSINGS ALL I CAN, YES. I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF TRAVELING, TOO, SO I HAVE BEEN TAKING MY BREAST MILK EVERYWHERE WITH ME.

YES.
Stephen: I THINK YOUR BREAST MILLUM IS BEING CONFISCATED BY T.S.A. IN THIS PHOTO.
YES.
Stephen: THE 3.5-OUNCES APPLY TO BREAST MILK AS WELL?
YES, THEY WAVE THIS THING OVER IT AND THERE IS A PRODUCTION GOING ON. THEY TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO PROVE?
I STAND THERE AND SMILE AND TELL THEM IT'S REALLY BREAST MILK.
Stephen: DO YOU POINT AT THE BABY AND SAYS, HE'S REAL, NEWT DOLL.
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET HIM OUT?
Stephen: DON'T OFFER, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
COULD BE DANGER.
Stephen: I HOPE NOT. I HATE TO STATE THE OBVIOUS, YOU DO SUCH A GREAT AMERICAN ACCENT, I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE AUSTRALIAN.
I'M FROM SYDNEY, YES --
Stephen: YOU SOUND LIKE I CAUGHT YOU IN A LIE! (LAUGHTER)
I REALLY AM. I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS ACTING LIKE I WAS LYING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY TRUE. I AM. THIS IS A REAL ACCENT.
Stephen: AMERICANS ARE FASCINATED WITH AUSTRALIANS AND AUSTRALIA. DO YOU NOTICE THAT?
YEAH, THEY ARE.
Stephen: PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN. BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN:
WHY IS THAT?
Stephen: IT'S LIKE AMERICA BUT MORE DANGEROUS.
IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. BUT I GREW UP IN THE CITY, SO FOR ME, I'M AS MUCH OF A CITY GIRL AS A NEW YORK PERSON. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO LIKE THE DANGER OF IT, I DON'T REALLY RELATE TO.
Stephen: BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS IMAGE THAT EVERYONE IN AUSTRALIA GROWS UP SOMEPLACE WHERE EVERY OTHER ANIMAL IS TRYING TO KILL YOU.
AND IT'S LIKE YOU RIDE TO WORK ON A KANGAROO AND THAT'S ALSO BULL (BLEEP).
Stephen: THAT'S JUST FOR ONE. THAT'S FOR KANGAROO POLO. THAT WOULD BE FUN, THOUGH, WOULDN'T IT?
THAT WOULD BE. COULD WE GET THAT STARTED?
Stephen: TRY TO BET GET THE THE BALL IN THE OTHER PERSON'S POUCH.
BIG RED KANGAROOS ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO ANY POLO WITH THEM.
Stephen: WERE THERE KANGAROOS AROUND WHERE YOU GREW UP? PARDON ME FOR ACTING LIKE ALL OF AUSTRALIA IS A BIG KANGAROO PATCH.
NO, AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE IS A FUNNEL WEB SPIDER.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT? IT'S A DEADLY SPIDER THAT WILL KILL YOU.
StepheYOU. THEY'RE IN THE SINK.
Stephen: REALLY? OCCASIONALLY.
Stephen: OCCASIONALLY THERE IS A CREATURE IN YOUR SINK THAT CAN VISIT DEATH UPON YOU.
IT'S KEEPING YOU ON EDGE, MAKING SURE YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU.

THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A MUTANT POWER IN THE MOVIE.
I KNOW. I USED TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET UP AT 2:00 A.M. TO BECOME BLUE OR RED OR GREEN. BUT NOW I'M A BIT SAD BECAUSE IT'S A BIT BORING NOT BEING A MUTANT IN THOSE MOVIES.
Stephen: I KIND OF WISH I WAS A MUTANT NOT IN THOSE MOVIES.
ME, TOO.
Stephen: IF YOU HAD A MUTANT POWER, WHAT WOULD YOU WANT IT TO BE?
I WOULD LIKE TO BE THE GUY WHO'S LIKE THE FIRE GUY -- POW! LIKE THAT! PYRO? YEAH, POW! LIKE THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, PYRO. THAT'S A PRETTY RADICAL THING TO BE ABLE TO DO.
Stephen: I'DENT MIND BEING THE FREEZE GUY.
THAT'S COOL.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU COULD COOL DOWN A SIX-PACK ANYTIME YOU WANTED. THAT'S ANOTHER STEREOTYPE AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT AUSTRALIANS. YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS DRINKING BEER AND WAVING AROUND BIG KNIVES. ANY OF THAT TRUE?
IT IS A DRINKING CULTURE. BUT I'M NOT A BIG DRINKER, SO IT'S ALWAYS A STEREOTYPE I HAVE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE, LIKE, OH -- PEOPLE ARE, LIKE, YOU'RE AUSTRALIAN! COME ON, HAVE ANOTHER ONE! I'M, LIKE, OH, PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE.

YES.

MY PARENTS MADE THE LIFE-ALTERING DECISION. THEY KNEW I WOULD HAVE TO FIND MY OWN PATH IN LIFE AND GO A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY. IF I PLAYED THE GUITAR, I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD BE DOING FUNNY MUSIC BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.

I'M PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: WEIRD AL YANKOVIC, HOW DO YOU KEEP IT FRESH?
HARD TO SAY. I KIND OF STAY ABOVE ALL THE YOUTUBE PEOPLE BECAUSE I KIND OF HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. I HAVE, LIKE, 25 YEARS OF HISTORY BEFORE YOUTUBE EXISTED. SO I BECAME KIND OF A BRAND NAME.
Stephen: YOU'VE HAD TO LEARN TO PARODY CHANGES IN MUSIC OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE IN '79 WHEN YOU FIRST HIT H THE SCENE, DISCO WAS STILL KING BACK THEN.
RIGHT.
Stephen: HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES BEEN HARDER FOR YOU TO PARODY OVER THE YEARS?
POP MUSIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN RIDICULOUS. THERE IS ALWAYS SOURCE MATERIAL. THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO MAKE FUN OF. I HAVE A GOOD TIME DOING RAP MUSIC BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF WORDS TO PLAY WITH. A LOT OF POP SONGS ARE REPETITIVE AND SYLLABLES AND RAP MUSIC THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF WORDS. THAT'S FUN.
Stephen: WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO MAKE A PARTICULAR PARODY OF A SONG? LET'S GO TO THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU DID MY BOLOGNA ON MY SHARONA, WHAT WAS THE EUREKA MOMENT FOR THAT?
I STUDIED POP CULTURE, THAT'S PART OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION, AND I REALIZED THERE HADN'T BEEN A LOT OF SONGS DONE ON THE SUBJECT OF LUNCH MEAT. SO I WANTED TO FILL THAT VOID. IT'S A VACUUM.
Stephen: YOU'RE A CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGIST ON A CERTAIN LEVEL.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD GET MORE RESPECT FOR THE RESEARCH YOU PUT IN EVERYTHING. THE SONG YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO, I UNDERSTAND THIS IS ALSO FROM THE ALBUM "MANDATORY FUN," AND YOU WILL BE DOING IT ON THE "MANDATORY FUN" WORLD TOUR, IS "WORD CRIMES"?
YES (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHICH IS BASED ON THE SONG "BLURRED LINES."
YES.
Stephen: AND ARE THERE ANY NAKED WOMEN IN THE VIDEO FOR "WORD CRIMES"?
NO, YOU HAVE TO GREEN SCREEN YOUR OWN NAKED WOMEN OVER THE VIDEO.

BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE TO SAY GOODBYE TO A FANTASTIC BROADCASTER I HAD THE HONOR TO MEET A FEW TIMES MORLEY SAFER WHO WORKED AT "60 MINUTES" SINCE 1970, AN AMAZING BROADCASTER AND SADLY DIED THIS MORNING. I GOT TO MEET HIM A FEW TIMES. THE FIRST TIME WAS WHEN HE WAS THE CORRESPONDENT THAT PROFILED ME ON 60 MINUTES IN THE OLD SHOW COLBERT SHOW. HE WAS STANDING ON 10t 10th AVENUE, LEANING AGAINST THE WALL, SMOKING CIGARETTE, WEARING A CHECKED SPORTS JACKET LIKE IN 1972, STOMPED OUT HIS CIGARETTE LIKE HE WAS JAMES DEAN AND GOES, "MORLEY SAFER." SUCH AN HONOR TO MEAT HIM. THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO WAS IN THE ELEVATORS IN CBS. HE'S GOING DOWN THE ELEVATOR.  HE HAS ANOTHER CIGARETTE AND HE'S ABOUT TO SPARK UP A CIGARETTE AND IT WAS A VAPING PEN. I SAID, MOELLERY, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD A VAPING PEN. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FROM THE FUTURE. AND HE SAID, STEPHEN, I AM THE FUTURE, AND GOT OFF THE ELEVATOR. (APPLAUSE) THE MIDDLE TIME I MET MORLEY SAFER WAS AT THE LAST SHOW OF OUR FIRST YEAR IN 2006 ON THE OLD SHOW AND WE DID SOMETHING CALLED GUITARMAGEDDON WHICH WAS A GUITAR SHRED-OFF BETWEEN ME AND THE DECEMBERISTS. WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE GRAVIDAS THE SHOW DESERVED SO MORLEY SAFER DID THE OPENING AS ONLY MORLEY SAFER COULD.
I'M MORLEY SAFER. IF THERE'S ONE PASSION IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS MUSIC. THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE. IF THERE'S ONE MAN WHO INSPIRES PASSION, IT IS STEPHEN COLBERT, A SUN BURST OF EMOTION IN A TIME DARKENED BY REASON. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THESE FORCES COLLIDED, SENDING SHOCK WAVES THROUGH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND DIVIDING A NATION. IT BEGAN AS A GREEN-SCREEN CHALLENGE, IT EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT -- A GUITAR SOLO CHALLENGE, A BATTLE OF TITANS. TONIGHT, AMERICA'S LAST HERO, STEPHEN COLBERT, FACES OFF AGAINST RISING INDY MUSIC OUTFIT THE DECEMBERISTS. WHO WILL ROCK THE NATION, AND WHO WILL KNEEL BEFORE THE RASPUTIN OF RIFTS? TWO MEN, TWO Xs, TWO CHANCES TO SHOW THE WORLD WHO IS THE SOCRATES OF SHRED. THAT STORY AND ANDY ROONEY COMING UP.
Stephen: THE GREAT MORLEY SAFER, EVERYBODY! GOOD NIGHT!
