( LAUGHTER ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. I HOPE EVERYBODY IS FEELING GOOD, READY FOR THE WEEKEND. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP IS... OUT THERE ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S GETTING READY TO BREAK YET ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL TRADITION, BECAUSE THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT HE COULD BECOME THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN 150 YEARS WHO DOES NOT HAVE A PET. OTHER THAN, OF COURSE, THE RARE GOLDEN MARMOT THAT NESTS ON HIS HEAD. BUT A LONGED TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ BUT A LONGTIME ACQUAINTANCE OF TRUMP'S SAYS SHE WANTS TO GIVE HIM A NINE-WEEK-OLD GOLDEN DOODLE. SPEAKING OF TRUMP'S LAPDOGS, THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND WHEN TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT, THEY'VE GOT SOME BIG PLANS, BECAUSE MITCH McCONNELL, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND SODA SHOP OWNER WITH A DARK SECRET SAYS, "REPEALING OBAMACARE WOULD BE THE FIRST ITEM UP IN THE NEW YEAR." OBVIOUSLY, FIRST IS GET A GYM MEMBERSHIP, MAYBE AT SOUL CYCLE THOUGH I'M NOT SURE THAT MITCH McCONNELL HAS A SOUL. NOW, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PROMISING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE FOR YEARS. AND WHILE THE REPEAL APPEARS TO BE JUST AROUND THE CORNER, THE G.O.P. PLANS TO DELAY AN OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT FOR AS LONG AS THREE YEARS. WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ( LAUGHTER ) AM I HEARING THAT RIGHT? YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE HEALTHCARE AWAY FROM 20 MILLION AMERICANS THEN JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX IT LATER? THAT'S LIKE JUMPING OUT OF A , PLANE AND KNITTING YOUR PARACHUTE ON THE WAY DOWN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
Stephen: THIS WAS AN EXHAUSTING ELECTION. BUT THANKFULLY, IT'S FINALLY OVER. IS A THING I WOULD LOVE TO SAY. UNFORTUNATELY, FOR THE GOOD FOLKS IN LOUISIANA, THEY'RE HOLDING A FINAL RUNOFF ELECTION FOR THE U.S. SENATE TOMORROW. THAT'S RIGHT. A RUNOFF, NAMED BECAUSE AT THIS POINT, ONE MORE ELECTION MAKES YOU WANT TO RUN OFF A CLIFF. NOW RUNOFFS ARE TYPICALLY VERY LOW TURNOUT. IN ORDER TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THIS IMPORTANT ELECTION OUR RESIDENT LOUISIANIAN, JON BATISTE, WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO HIS HOME STATE. JON?
Jon: THANK YOU, STEPHEN. OKAY, LISTEN UP, FELLOW LOUISIANIANS. I'M GOING TO SAY THIS IN WORDS WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND. IT'S TIME FOR YA MOMA AND DEM TO MAKE A PASS TO THE VOTING BOOTH, YA DIG?

GO, VOTE, YOU HEARD ME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. THAT'S TRUE. NOW, I ONLY CAUGHT A LITTLE PART OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID, BUT I ASSUME IT WAS GREAT. IT ALSO GAVE ME A WEIRD CRAVING FOR CRAWFISH. SPEAKING OF FOOD, THE PHILLIES HAVE A STADIUM NUT VENDOR CALLED THE "PISTACHIO GIRL," WHO'S BELOVED FOR ANTICS LIKE THIS:
EMILY YOUCIS IS THE PISTACHIO GIRL, THEY CALL YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY! PISTACHIOS! I'M THE PISTACHIO GIRL, THAT'S RIGHT. EVERYBODY LOVES THE PISTACHIO GIRL. PISTACHIOS!
Stephen: THAT IS MY FAVORITE BOB SEGER SONG OF ALL TIME. WELL, FUN STORY: THIS WEEK, THE PISTACHIO GIRL WAS FIRED FOR BEING AN AVOWED WHITE NATIONALIST. THEN WHY IS SHE SELLING PISTACHIOS? CRACKER JACKS HAS "CRACKER" RIGHT IN THE NAME! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THAT'S THE NATURAL FIT. THAT'S THE FIT. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS UPSETTING. THIS IS SHOCKING. NO ONE EVER EXPECTS A BELOVED NUT VERND TO BE THE TYPE OF PERSON--
WALNUTS! OH, YEAH! IT'S WALNUT O'CLOCK, AND I'M BUYIN'! YEAH!

OH, YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH! YEAH! STEPHEN, YOU KNOW IT. WALNUTS, THEY'RE THE MASTER NUT!
Stephen: WHAT? WAIT, WAIT, WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY? DID YOU SAY "MASTER NUT?" THAT SOUNDS RACIST.
NO, NO, NO, STEPHEN. I BELIEVE ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL, REGARDLESS OF RACE. BUT I DO BELIEVE WALL NUTS ARE ORDAINED BY GOD AS THE SUPERIOR NUT. YEAH!
Stephen: WAIT, WAIT, PLEASE STOP THROWING THOSE. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE AN ALLERGY. YOU'RE SAYING THERE ARE INFERIOR NUTS OUT THERE?
THAT'S RIGHT, STEPHEN. ALMONDS LACK THE OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID OF WALNUTS. ALSO, ALMONDS PLAY LOUD MUSIC AND STEAL. GO BACK TO ALMOND LAND, ALMONDS! GET OUT OF TOWN!
Stephen: STOP IT. I THINK ALMONDS AND WALNUTS ARE EACH EQUALLY FINE NUTS.
WHAT? DID YOU KNOW THAT THE "DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE" WAS SIGNED ON A WALNUT DESK? MEANWHILE, YOU CAN'T FIND A WALNUT PIE ANYWHERE. PECANS ARE STEALING ALL THE NUT-JOBS! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WALNUT BOY. I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR NUT-RAGEOUS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET YOU GO.
YOU CAN'T SILENCE ME! UNMIX THE NUTS! UNMIX THE NUTS! EVERYBODY! UNMIX THE NUTS!

MARK WAHLBERG, MIRANDA LAMBERT, LIAM NEESON, JOHN GOODMAN, JAMES FRANCO, NEIL PATRICK HARRIS, AND AND A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE FROM THE ONE AND ONLY JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD SUCH GREAT GUESTS NEXT WEEK. WHAT KIND OF HOST ARE YOU IF YOU THROW A PARTY AND YOU DON'T SHOW THE UP FOR YOUR OWN PARTY.
Jon: YOU GOT TO BE THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S CRAZY BILLIONAIRE BEHAVIOR AND I'M NOT THERE YET. ALSO NEXT WEEKS, WE MIGHT TELL SOME JOKES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. BUT WE'LL SEE. WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HERE'S THE BEST THING, WE'RE LEARNING THINGS FROM CRUMP DONALD TRUMP. HE'S TEACHING US. FOR INSTANCE, HE'S TEACHING US THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS PRESIDENTS DO THAT WE ALL ASSUMED ARE LAWS BUT ARE ACTUALLY JUST NORMS WE GOT USED TO FROM PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS, LIKE THE ONE WHERE YOU WIN BY GETTING THE MOST VOTES. NOT A LAW. I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORM AND A LAW IN OUR NEW SEGMENT, "NORM OR LAW?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. IT'S NOTOO COMPLICATED.  IF I DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT'S A NORM, LIKE HOLDING THE DOOR FOR SOMEONE AT STARBUCKS, YOU'LL HEAR THIS:
"NORM!"
Stephen: IF INSTEAD I DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT IS A LAW, LIKE NOT HOLDING SOMEONE HOSTAGE IN STARBUCKS, YOU'LL HEAR THIS: ( "LAW&ORDER" THEME )
Stephen: FIRST UP, UNLIKE EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS, DONALD TRUMP REFUSED TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS, AND WE NEED TO SEE A PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS TO KNOW IF HE'S A CROOK. FUN FACT, THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO RELEASE HIS TAXES SAID THIS:
I AM NOT A CROOK.
Stephen: FUN FACT: CROOK. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IS A CANDIDATE RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNAISE NORM OR A LAW?
NORM!
Stephen: YES, IT'S JUST A NORM. AND HERE'S THE CRAZY PART: WHILE THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS, CABINET AND SUBCABINET-LEVEL POSITIONS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THEIR TAX RETURNS TO THE SENATE. SO, LOWER LEVEL POSITIONS ARE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN THE PRESIDENT. THAT'S LIKE WALKING INTO A RESTAURANT BATHROOM, AND THE SIGN SAYS, "ALL EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS, EXCEPT THE CHEF." ( LAUGHTER ) DISTURBING. DISTURBING.  ( APPLAUSE ) NEXT UP ON "NORM OR LAW?," TRUMP IS THE RICHEST MAN EVER TO BE PRESIDENT, WHICH IS QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERING SEVERAL OF THE FIRST ONES HAD "UNPAID FARMING INTERNS." THAT'S TRUE. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP. SO WILL TRUMP USE THE PRESIDENCY TO HELP HIS BUSINESS? PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS SOLD OFF THEIR INVESTMENTS OR PUT THEM IN SOMETHING CALLED A BLIND TRUST, WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO THE SLOGAN ON TRUMP'S NEW HAT. SO, TRUMP'S GOING TO DO THE SAME BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAW, RIGHT?
NORM!
Stephen: NOPE, IT'S JUST A NORM. TURNS OUT, "THE STRICT FEDERAL RULES ABOUT FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DO NOT APPLY TO THE PRESIDENT, WHOSE INCENTIVE TO AVOID SELF-ENRICHMENT IS SIMPLY ASSUMED." YES, IT'S ASSUMED. AND WHEN YOU ASSUME ABOUT TRUMP, IT MAKES AN ASS OUT OF YOU AND ME ( APPLAUSE ) AND, AND, I THINK WE KNOW WHO'S GRABBING THAT ASS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TRUMP'S COMPANIES ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD. IS THERE ANY LAW STOPPING FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FROM THROWING BUSINESS HIS WAY TO GET SPECIAL TREATMENT, OR IS IT JUST A NORM? ( "LAW&ORDER "THEME.
Stephen: OH, THANK GOD. AND THIS ONE'S IN THE CONSTITUTION. THEM'S THE BIG LAWS. IT'S CALLED THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE, WHICH IS A FANCY WORD FOR "BRIBE." THE FOUNDERS KNEW THAT EVEN HONEST PEOPLE MIGHT BETRAY THEIR VALUES FOR CASH. IT'S HUMAN NATURE. JUST LIKE IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO ENJOY THE GREAT TASTE OF ACTIVIA YOGURT. MMM-MMM-MMM. ACTIVIA. BE RIGHT BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO WHAT ABOUT DAILY INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS? IT'S CRUCIAL FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO BE CONSTANTLY UPDATED ON THREATS AROUND THE WORLD, BUT SO FAR, TRUMP HAS BEEN OPTING OUT OF THEM. THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S JUST "OPTING OUT." DONALD TRUMP IS TREATING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY LIKE I TREAT EMAILS FROM POTTERY BARN. "STOP NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION? UNSUBSCRIBE!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT YOGURT IS REALLY GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IS REFUSING TO BE INFORMED VIOLATING A NORM OR LAW?
NORM!
Stephen: YEP. BUT DON'T WORRY. ACCORDING TO TRUMP ADVISOR KELLYANNE CONWAY, INSTEAD OF BRIEFINGS FROM THE C.I.A., TRUMP GETS HIS INFORMATION FROM "A NUMBER OF SOURCES" INCLUDING "HIS PERSONAL AND ON-THE-PHONE MEETINGS WITH OVER WHAT'S NOW 41 WORLD LEADERS." FIRST OF ALL, KELLYANNE, NO ONE SAYS "OVER FRUN." YOU CAN SAY "OVER 40" OR "ALMOST 50," BUT WHEN YOU SAY "OVER 41," WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE 42 SOUND BIGGER. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THERE'S A REASON PRESIDENTS DON'T GET NEWS ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES FROM THOSE COUNTRIES' LEADERS. FOREIGN LEADERS LIE. LIKE FIDEL CASTRO, WHO, UNTIL LAST WEEK, WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT HE WAS DEAD. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF "NORM OR LAW," BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE'LL LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT'S TECHNICALLY LEGAL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS-- FOR INSTANCE, WHETHER WE KEEP THE NORM THAT AMERICA HAS LAWS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OLIVIA MUNN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM NEWSROOM," AND "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE." HER NEW MOVIE IS "OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY." PLEASE WELCOME THE LOVELY OLIVIA MUNN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO!
Stephen: OLIVIA MUNN.
HELLO.
Stephen: IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO. WE HAD AN AWKWARD THE TWO KISS --
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO DO THE ONE KISS OR TWO KISS.
I DON'T LIKE THE TWO-KISS. YOU SEE PEOPLE, "I'M EUROPEAN." I'M AMERICAN.
Stephen: IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION. ONLY KISS PEOPLE ON THE CHEEK ONCE.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE I HAD SOME FUN WITH YOUR MOM.
DID YOU.
Stephen: REMEMBER I TEXTED YOUR MOM USING YOUR PHONE.
YOU DID.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE. AND I SENT HER THIS TEXT THAT SAID-- YOUR MOM'S NAME IS KIM.
AND THEN LATER --
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN FACT NOT ENGAGED.
I WAS NOT ENGAGED, AND-- AND YOU MADE THAT CONFUSING FOR MY MOTHER.
Stephen: YES. THAT'S WHAT I DO.
BUT NOW, SHE'S VERY EXCITED BECAUSE ONCE SHE SAW IT ON TV, SHE'S CONVINCED THAT SHE'S VERY, VERY FAMOUS. AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH,, YOU KNOW, EVERY COME UP TO ME IN OKLAHOMA AND SAY, "OH, I SEE YOU--" HEY, MOM. SHE THINKS-- "EVERYBODY COME UP TO ME. SOMETIMES IT'S HARD. YOU KNOW. EVERYBODY COME UP. IT'S VERY HARD. EVERYBODY SAY HI." YEAH, SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME. IT'S HARD TO BE A CELEBRITY. SHE WILL TELL YOU.
Stephen: SHE HAS TO LOOK HER BEST WHEN SHE GOES OUTSIDE.
SHE LOVES GETTING TEXTS FROM YOU HERE'S MY PHONE.
Stephen: LET'S DO IT.
I LIKE HOW YOU THOUGHT YOUR FINGERPRINT WOULD WORK.
Stephen: WELL, I NEVER KNOW, I NEVER KNOW.
THERE IT IS, "MOM."
Stephen: WHAT UP, KIM? QUESTION MARK. COLBERT HERE. BOY, TOO SOON POORLY SPELLED!
IT'S COAL-BEAR.
Stephen: IT'S JUST TRANSCRIBING EVERYTHING WE'RE SAYING TO EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M GOING TO SEND THIS TO YOUR MOTHER. BOY, WHAT I JUST SENT YOUR MOTHER. WHAT UP, KIM, COLBERT HERE, IT'S POORLY SPELLED, COAL. AND IT'S TRANSCRIBING EVERYTHING WE ARE SAYING RIGHT NOW. PLEASE APOLOGIZE YOUR MOTHER FOR ME.
IT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH IN A SECOND. I WILL IT HERE.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU DOING? I UNDERSTAND YOU TOOK YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO A PSYCHIC RECENTLY?
MY FAMILY-- A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE IS THERESA CRAPUTO. SHE'S THE LONG ISLAND MEDIUM. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN HER SHOW. SHE ASKED ME IT BRING MY FAMILY ON TO HER SHOW. I SAID NO. MY FAMILY IS GREAT, BUT THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON TV, I DON'T THINK. BUT ESPECIALLY PSYCHIC TV SHOWS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, ON THOSE SHOWS THEY'RE REALLY WANTING BIG REACTIONS --
YEAR, THEY WANT EMOTIONAL MOMENTS WHEN THEY REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT, LIKE, A DECEASED LOVED ONE.
THEY ARE SPEAKING TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE PASSED ON. THAT IS AMAZING! LIKE, THEY'RE TALKING TO YOUR DEAD LOVED ONES AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE REACTIONS THAT ARE FITTING. "OH, MY GOSH! THIS IS AMAZING." MY FAMILY, THEY'RE A BUNCH OF INTELLECTS AND THEY'RE VERY SUBSUED DOOUD, AND EVEN THOUGH I TOLD HER THEY WOULDN'T BE AGREED GREAT. SHE INSISTED. WE'RE DOING THING AND SHE GOES TO MY BROTHER FIRST. MY BROTHER IS JOHNNY SPP SHE SAID, "JOHNNY, DO THEY CALL YOU JOHN-YAWN? DOES EVERYBODY CALL YOU JOHN-JOHN? WE CALL HIM MR. JOHN-JOHN. AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW THAT. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH. WE DO." AND HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH." ( LAUGHTER ) SHE'S LIKE, "OKAY." SHE MOVES ON MY 2 MY MOM. AND SHE SAID, "I'M FEELING LIKE, DO YOU HAVE A NECKLACE? ARE YOU WEARING A NECKLACE OR IS THERE SOMETHING FROM A GRANDMOTHER." I HAVE TO SAY I MADE THE MISTAKE BEFORE DOING THE READING, AND I TOLD MY MOM, DON'T GIVE ANY NOAKS INFORMATION. JUST SAY YES OR NO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LET THEM TELL YOU EVERYTHING. SO MY MOM IS SITTING THERE AS IF SHE'S BEING INTERROGATED BY THE EXPLIS SHE'S JUST SO RESERVED. AND SHE SAID, "DO YOU HAVE A NECKLACE, A THING FROM A GRANDMOTHER, A NECKLACE FROM A GRANDMOTHER?" AND MY MOTHER IS SITTING THERE. "I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW." AND SHE SAID, "I FEEL LIKE YOU-- YOU DON'T HAVE A NECKLACE WITH YOU?" AND MY MOM IS LIKE, "MAYBE." SO AT THIS POINT I'M LIKE, OKAY, I HAVE TO, LIKE, MEDIATE OF MEDIUM NOW. AND I SAID, "MOM, IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN JUST SAY YES OR NO. DO YOU HAVE A NECKLACE OR NOT?" AND SHE SAID, "YEAH." AND I SAID, "WHERE IS IT?" "OVER THERE IN MY PURSE." "WHO IS IT FROM?" "YOUR GRANDMA." "SO WHEN SHE WAS ASKING IF YOU HAD A NECKLACE FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?" AND SHE SAID, "BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE IT ON ME. IT WAS WITH ME IN MY PURSE." AND I SAID OH, THAT WAS THE DISTINCTION.
Stephen: YOUR MOM IS A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.
SHE IS. I WANTED EVERYBODY TO HAVE A GREAT REACTION. SHOOTING IT. I WANTED HER TO HAVE A GOOD TV SHOW, SHE'S LEGIT, I THINK. I SAID, "MOM, ISN'T THAT AMAZING. JOHNNY, SHE DIDN'T KNOW YOUR NAME WAS JOHN-JOHN. MOM, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW YOU HAD ON A NECKLACE FROM YOUR GRANDMA." AND SHE SAID, "I BELIEVE. I FEEL IT." I SAID I TOLD YOU, DON'T PUT MY FAMILY ON TV. HERE IS MY MOM. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ARE YOU MAD AT ME?" ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: JUST SAY, "IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT'S FAULT."
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE SAYS BACK.
Stephen: ASK HER IF SHE'S WEARING A WATCH. ( LAUGHTER ) FROM YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER. I'M FEELING PSYCHIC CONNECTION. WHEN I GO TO PSYCHICS-- AND I'VE ONLY BEEN A COUPLE TIMES BECAUSE I'M AN ADULT ( LAUGHTER ).
BUT YOU BELIEVE.
Stephen: I DO NOT.
THEN WHY DID YOU GO.
Stephen: WHAT? I WAS DESPERATE! A GIRL BROKE UP WITH ME! THIS WAS A LONG TIME OKAY AGO.
OKAY.
Stephen: I WENT TO A PSYCHIC AND SHE GOT THE FIRST THREE THINGS SHE ASKED ABOUT ME WRONG. AND I SAID, "YOU'RE RIGHT."
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO NICE.
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET THE JU-JU. I THOUGHT IF SHE GOT THE FIRST THREE THINGS RIGHT SHE'D FEEL MORE CONFIDENT. I'M WILLING TO BELIEVE ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M AN ADULT AND I'M A CATHOLIC. NOW, "OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY." I HAVE THIS GREAT-- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS PHOTO TO ME? SHOOTING "OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY." AT THE END OF THE DAY. DID YOU TWEET THIS?
I INSTAGRAMMED THAT. THIS WAS MY HAND AFTER I STABBED IT WITH A BALLPOINT PEN, BECAUSE KATE McKINON TOLD ME TO DO WHATEVER I WANTED.
Stephen: THIS WAS TO KEEP YOU FROM LAUGHING YOU STABBED YOURSELF IN THE HAND.
SHE WAS JUST DOING FART JOKES BUT IT WAS REALLY, REALLY FUNNY. AND I WAS RUINING THE TAKES. AND AT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S NOT FUNNY-- AT FIRST EVERYONE LAUGHS WHEN YOU LAUGH AND AFTER A WHILE THEY THINK IT'S ANNOYING. SO I HAD TO TAKE A PEN AND STAB MY HAND UNDERNEATH TO STOP FROM LAUGHING.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK. BUT I-- I-- HAVE SOME IFNG POISONING NOW.
Stephen: WE HAVE AN OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY ACTUALLY COMING UP A WEEK FROM THURSDAY, RIGHT? A WEEK FROM THURSDAY. AND WE HAD JASON BATEMAN ON.

THERE'S NO OTHER REASON FOR YOU TO SAY IT.
Stephen: NO. WE DON'T SAY MERRY ANYTHING BUT MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY MEADE. LIKE GIVE ME A GLASS OF MERRY MEADE. IT JUST SOUNDS MEDIEVAL.

THANK YOU. ME, TOO. I THINK IT'S POTENTIALLY, IF WE HAVEN'T MEASED IT UP, THESE THREE EPISODES OF "SHERLOCK" I THINK WILL BE THE BEST ONES. THEY'RE FANTASTIC.
Stephen: THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN FANTASTIC SO FAR.
REALLY. I'M NOT SAYING THAT TO GET A PAVLOVIAN RESPONSE FROM YOUR ACLIGHTS. I'M SAYING THAT FOR REAL, LIKE THIS WILL BE-- I THINK THEY'RE THE STRONGEST --
ARE YOU SAYING BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE THE LAST SEASON GIDON'T KNOW. WE NEVER KNOW, REALLY.

YES, OF COURSE,.
Stephen:  THE SUPER SMART GUY. DO YOU WERE THINK WHY CAN'T I BE THE SUPER SMART GUY? I HAVE BEEN CAST IS NOT IMBECILES. YOU KNOW.
Stephen: UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
I THINK IT WOULD BE A BIT MUCH IF I INSISTED THAT JOHN WATTON WAS CLEVERER THAN SHERLOCK HOLMES.
Stephen: JUST ONCE. HE GET DRUNK AND YOU TAKE IAWASKA TEA AND YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
I THINK WHAT YOU SEE IN THE SHOW IS THE BALANCE OF HIS AMAZING BRAIN AND INTELLECT, WHICH IS WAY BEYOND ANYBODY ELSE'S. WHAT DISWRAWN BRINGS IS HE HUMANIZES IT AND HE'S ABLE TO SORT OF HOLD SHERLOCK'S HAND THROUGH LIFE AND GO, "THIS IS HOW REAL PEOPLE THINK AND THIS IS HOW STUFF WORKS," WHILE SHERLOCK IS GOING OFF ON THESE AMAZING FIREWORKS OF INTELLECT, JOHN IS GOING, "YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT TO PAY THE RENT. YOU REALIZE YOU JUST HURT SOMEONE'S FEELINGS THERE, "BECAUSE SHERLOCK DOESN'T SEE THAT.
Stephen: AND HE HAS A STIFLED EMOTIONAL LIFE, TOO.
YEAH, HE DOES.
Stephen: BUT YOUR FANS-- YOUR FANS DO NOT HAVE A STIFLED EMOTIONAL LIFE--
WHAT'S A STIFLED EMOTIONAL LIFE.
Stephen: A WILD E, ROTIC IMAGINATION. THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF FAN ART OF WATTON AND HOLMES, AND AMBERS AND ACE. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THAT STUFF?
I HAVE DONE SOME OF THEM.
Stephen: THAT COULD BE IN THE SEQUEL OF "LOVE ACTUALLY" ACTUALLY. IAN McCLELLAN HAS SENT YOU STUFF. "I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE."
WHEN WE WERE IN NEW ZEALAND DOING "THE HOBBIT" --
WHAT, WHAT?
WHY DIBRING IT UP.
Stephen: OH, LORD.
WE WERE DOING "THE HOBBIT." HE SENT ME AN EMAIL OF ONE OF THESE PICTURES -- IT WAS--  ( CHEERS ) IT WAS CERTAINLY --

ME, TOO, YEAH. BUT NO, HE WAS JUST SAYING, "DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS ALL GOING ON?" AND I DID. I DID KNOW THAT WAS GOING ON.
Stephen: THERE WAS A LITTLE CRITICISM FOR ONE OF THE SEASON BECAUSE IT IMPLIED THAT THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS BEING BLACKMAILED BY A DOMINATRIX, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: "YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT THE ROYAL FAMILY." DO YOU CARE ABOUT THAT? OR "THEY'RE JUST FOLKS DOWN THE ROAD?"

( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE YOU'RE YOUR OWN PET. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THEIR PET VERY WELL. THEY'RE WALKING AROUND. THEIR HAIR'S MESSED UP. THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY EAT RIGHT. JUST THE CHECKLIST OF STUFF YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE TO LOOK SOMEWHAT DECENT. I SAW A GUY WALKING DOWN 6th AVENUE THISSING SUMMER, I'M WALKING THE OTHER WAY, BUSINESSMAN, PERFECT-- SUIT, TIE, LEATHER SHOES, BRIEFCASE, PERFECT GLASSES, PERFECT HAIR, FLY OPEN, ONE TESTICLE OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST DIDN'T CHECK THAT ONE BOX. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST ON HIS WAY TO A MEETING. PROBABLY ON HIS WAY BACK FROM A MEETING. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. THAT'S THE OTHER THING-- AS AN ADULT, NO ONE TELLS YOU. THEY PROBABLY LOOKED HIM RIGHT IN THE EYE IN THAT MEETING. "LOOK AT THIS GUY. HE HAS NO IDEA. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL HIM. I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS. I DON'T KNOW IF I PUT ON DEODORANT TODAY." NO ONE TELLS YOU. YOU'RE COMPLETELY ALONE. WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE THEY TELL YOU,"HEY, ZIP UP YOUR FLY. PUT ON CODE RANT. BRUSH YOUR TEETH." NO, YOU'RE TOTALLY ON YOUR OWN. EVEN YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND WON'T TELL YOU. YOU HAVE TO TALK TO YOURSELF ALL DAY LONG, GIVE YOURSELF LITTLE PEP TALKS LUKE A CRAZY PERSON. "I GOT MY WALLET, GOT MY CELL PHONE. OKAY, I GOT MY KEYS. OKAY, GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY, GOING TO BE A GOOD DAY." THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND A CRAZY PERSON IS THEY SAY IT OUT LOUD ON THE STREET. "I GOT MY WALLET! GOT MY CELL PHONE! IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY!" ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE LOOKING AT THEM, "THIS GUY'S NUTS. WE DON'T YELL LIKE THAT. NO, WE DON'T. WE'VE GOT OUR ACT TOGETHER. WE SHOULD GET SOME ICE CREAM." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S HARD. IT'S HARD BEING A PERSON. EVEN MY iPHONE TURNED ON ME. MY iPHONE, MY ONLY TRUE FRIEND IN THE WORLD IS NOW CAT GEORGIZING PHOTOS ON ITS OWN. IT CONSIDERS MY NORMAL FACE AND MY FAT FACE TO BE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY JUST TO COUNT HOW MANY CHINS I HAVE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A MESS. MY FAMILY A MESS. I HAVE A MEAN GIRL. I HAVE A MEAN GIRL. YEAR, I MADE A MEAN GIRL. YEAH. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY EXISTED. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE. I FEEL GUILTY, YOU KNOW. I'M FEEDING IT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M KEEPING IT ALIVE. I GIVE IT MONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHAT DO I DO, JUST CUT HER OFF LIKE SHE'S A TERRORIST? I CAN'T DO THAT. SHE'S MY KID. HOW DO I EVEN KNOW HOW BAD SHE REALLY IS. SHE'S MY KID. I'M SURE AT SOME POINT HITLER'S PARENTS MUST HAVE TURNED TO EACH OTHER LIKE, "HE'S A LITTLE WEIRD, RIGHT?" "YEAH, HE'S WEIRD. HE'S SIX. WHO HAS THAT MUSTACHE AT SIX." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S HARD. AND, LOOK, YOU'RE DOING FINE. DON'T THINK BECAUSE YOUR LIFE IS HARD THAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING AND IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER. NO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER. NO. I HAVEN'T EVEN MET YOU, AND I KNOW YOU'RE DOING FINE. THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. BE CONTENT. RIGHT, YOU SEE PEOPLE ON TV, FAME AND MONEY AND THINK, "OH, IF I COULD GET LIKE THAT, THEN MY LIFE WOULD BE BETTER." NO, YOU'LL BE WORSE. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT. THEY'RE NOT HAPPY. BRAD PITT AND ANGELINA BREAKING UP. THEY'RE BREAKING UP. GOOD, THEY DESERVE IT. THAT WAS ARROGANCE. YOU DON'T PUT TWO PERFECT PEOPLE IN ONE MARRIAGE AND THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK. THAT IS ARROGANCE! TOO MANY OPTIONS. YOU COULD BE WITH ANYONE ON THE PLANET. YOU WANT YOUR MARRIAGE TO LAST, YOU NEED A LITTLE FUNNY LOOKING IN IT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU NEED TO LOOK ACROSS THE TABLE AND THINK, "WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO GO?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SERIOUSLY. WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND STUPID YOU THINK YOU WANT A SUPER MODEL. NO, YOU MORON. YOU DON'T WANT SOME BEAUTIFUL GIRL ASKING TO BE TAKEN TO EUROPE. YOU WANT A GIRL WITH A CROOKED EYE ASKING IF YOU'VE GOT JUMPER CABLES. YEAH, THAT'S A KEEPER. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
