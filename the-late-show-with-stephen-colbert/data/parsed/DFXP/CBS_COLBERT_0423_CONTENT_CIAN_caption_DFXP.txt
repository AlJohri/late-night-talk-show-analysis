IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TRUMP BRAGS ABOUT HIS BIGLY I.Q. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES: TRACEE ELLIS ROSS. LUKE EVANS. AND MUSICAL GUEST JADE BIRD. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOVELY! LOVELY GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT HERE TONIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( APPLAUSE ) UPON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SO FAR, IT HAS BEEN A ROUGH START TO THE SCHOOL YEAR FOR DONALD TRUMP. HIS REPORT CARD IS DEFINITELY GOING TO SAY "HAS PROBLEMS WORKING AND PLAYING WELL WITH OTHERS." AND THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO. WHAT CAN WE DO? BECAUSE THE OVAL OFFICE DOESN'T HAVE ANY CORNERS. YOU CAN'T PUT HIM IN A TIME-OUT. BECAUSE IT'S OPEN WARFARE BETWEEN TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS. IT ALL STARTED IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID OPEN WARFARE WITH NORTH KOREA. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SEE, SECRETARY OF STATE AND DISAPPOINTED FATHER TRIBUTE HEAD, REX TILLERSON, WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TENSE NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM, WHEN TRUMP TWEETED THAT TILLERSON WAS "WASTING HIS TIME TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH LITTLE ROCKET MAN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, WE ALL KNOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO DEFUSE A TENSE NUCLEAR STANDOFF THAN WITH INSULT HUMOR. WHO CAN FORGET DURING THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS WHEN KENNEDY TWEETED, "CUEBALL @KHRUSHCHEV AND LI'L BEARDY DON'T HAVE THE BALLS. I DOUBLE-DOG DARE YOU TO PUSH THE BUTTON." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOT, I DOUBLE-DOG DARE YOU. I DOUBLE-DOG-- WELL, TODAY, IN A INTERVIEW WITH "FORBES," TRUMP DEFENDED HIS ACTIONS TOWARDS TILLERSON, SAYING, "HE WAS WASTING HIS TIME. I'M NOT UNDERMINING. I THINK I'M ACTUALLY STRENGTHENING AUTHORITY." "YES, I'M NOT BURNING YOUR HOUSE DOWN. I'M LOWERING YOUR HEATING BILLS." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TO THANK HIM, TO THANK HIM FOR ALL THAT STRENGTHENING OF AUTHORITY, TILLERSON CALLED HIM A "(BLEEP) MORON." ALLEGEDLY. ALLEGEDLY.
Jon: MY GOODNESS!
Stephen: BUT TODAY-- WAS THIS TODAY-- THIS MORNING, DONALD TRUMP HAD AN ANSWER FOR THAT, TOO: "I THINK IT'S FAKE NEWS, BUT IF HE DID THAT, I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO COMPARE I.Q. TESTS. AND I CAN TELL YOU WHO IS GOING TO WIN." ( LAUGHTER ) ME, TOO, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RESULTS OF THEIR I.Q. TESTS RIGHT HERE. TILLERSON SCORED A 120. IT'S ABOVE AVERAGE, NOT GENIUS, BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD. AND WE'VE GOT TRUMP'S. IT'S A DRAWING OF A BIG TRUCK THAT SAYS "MAGA." AND THERE'S TRUMP RIGHT THERE SAYING, "HORVEG-HONK." AND HERE'S REX TILLERSON, BUT TRUMP CALLS HIM REX SMELLERSON. SO IT'S A TOSS-UP. WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE. INTO THIS IMBROGUELIO, ENTER CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND MAN REHEARSING "HAMLET," BOB CORKER. SENATOR CORKER-- AGAIN, THIS IS A REPUBLICAN, MEMBER OF THE SAME PARTY AS THE PRESIDENT, SAID THAT TILLERSON, MATTIS, AND JOHN KELLY ARE ALL THAT SEPARATES AMERICA FROM CHAOS. THAT'S RIGHT. HOOBLS WE ARE IN THE "BEFORE" TIMES. AS HEAD OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, KEEP IN MIND, CORKER KNOWS EVERYTHING. HE HAS ACCESS TO ALL THE SECRET FOREIGN-- I'M GOING TO SAY STUFF. AND HE HAS SOME BOWEL- LOOSENING OPINIONS ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT. IN A RECORDED INTERVIEW WITH "THE NEW YORK TIMES," CORKER SAID THAT BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S CARELESS TWITTER ERUPTIONS, "WE COULD BE HEADING TOWARD WORLD WAR III." ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN WORRIED THE NEXT WAR WOULD BE CAUSED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. TURNS OUT THE REAL DANGER IS NATURAL STUPIDITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL MISS US. I'LL MISS US. WE HAD A GOOD RUN. WE HAD A GOOD RUN. NOW, CORKER THINKS THE PRESIDENT IS SO IMPULSIVE, HE HAS TO BE MANAGED LIKE A TODDLER. BUT THAT IS RIDICULOUS. OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF PROVED HE CAN BE TRUSTED WITH THE NUCLEAR TRIAD WITH THIS MATURE RESPONSE: "THE FAILING @NYTIMES SET LIDDLE BOB CORKER UP BY RECORDING HIS CONVERSATION. WAS MADE TO SOUND A FOOL, AND THAT'S WHAT I AM DEALING WITH!" WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IS A CRIPPLING CASE OF NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S-- TWO THINGS, THAT AND THIS. ALLEGEDLY. I'M NOT A DOCTOR. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT TRUMP HAS CRITICIZED CORKER'S HEIGHT WITH THE LIDDLE. LAST YEAR, CORKER WAS IN THE RUNNING TO BE IN TRUMP'S CABINET, BUT TRUMP THOUGHT CORKER WAS TOO SHORT TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. HE EVEN MADE HIM STAND NEXT TO THE SIGN, "YOU MUST BE THIS TALL TO CALL THE PRESIDENT A MORON."
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: AND TODAY, AND TODAY, WE LEARNED THAT CORKER MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING BECAUSE ACCORDING TO POLITICO, WHITE HOUSE AIDES USE DELAYS AND DISTRACTION TO MANAGE TRUMP. CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY "HAS TRIED TO LIMIT BAD DECISIONS BY BLOCKING INFORMATION FROM THE PRESIDENT'S DESK." AND SOMETIMES, STAFFERS WOULD EVEN DISTRACT HIM WITH A VISUAL AID "LIKE CHARTS ON HOW FARMERS MIGHT FEEL ABOUT ENDING THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT." AND AN EXECUTIVE WITH THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION EXPLAINS THAT "YOU EITHER HAD TO JUST CONVINCE HIM SOMETHING BETTER WAS HIS IDEA, OR IGNORE WHAT HE SAID TO DO AND HOPED HE'D FORGOT ABOUT IT THE NEXT DAY." BECAUSE, LIKE A TODDLER, TRUMP LACKS OBJECT PERMANENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) "WHAT NAFTA DEAL, DONALD? THERE'S NO NAFTA DEAL. IT ROLLED BEHIND THE COUCH. IT'S GONE FOREVER." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ WELL, THE NEXT TIME WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS NEED TO DISTRACT DONALD TRUMP, THEY CAN ALWAYS SHOW HIM THIS REPORT FROM OUR IN-HOUSE NEWS TEAM, "REAL NEWS TONIGHT." JIM?
WELCOME TO "REAL NEWS TONIGHT."
I'M JIM ANCHORTON.
AND I'M JILL NEWSLADY.
AND I'M RECEIVING A BREAKING NEWS STORY RIGHT HERE. PUERTO RICO IS STILL REELING FROM HURRICANE MARIA WITH 85% OF THE ISLAND STILL WITHOUT POWER AND 40% WITHOUT POTABLE WATER. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY TOMORROW, OR MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
MAYBE AFTER CHRISTMAS.
BUT FOR NOW, LOOK AT THIS CHART!
OOOH, SO MANY BRIGHT COLORS.
THE NUMBER OF SMILING FARMERS ON CHARTS IS SKYROCKETING.
AND THERE'S BIG NEWS FROM NORTH KOREA, WHERE-- YOU KNOW WHAT? READING AHEAD, I'M NOT GOING TO SHARE THIS ONE WITH THE PRESIDENT. LET'S MOVE ON.
THE LATEST APPROVAL NUMBERS ARE IN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND IT'S LOOKING VERY POSITIVE. BECAUSE HE'S STILL IN THE POSITIVE NUMBERS.
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT EVENTUALLY. BUT FOR NOW, LET'S INTRODUCE THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE "REAL NEWS" TEAM, PEPPER THE PUPPY PUNDIT. WHAT'S THAT, PEPPER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE PRESIDENT IS KILLING ANY CHANCE OF PASSING LEGISLATION BY ALIENATING MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY IN CONGRESS.
OH, PEP ELET'S NOT BORE THE PRESIDENT WITH THAT SORT OF INFORMATION.
GOOD LUCK, PEPPER ON YOUR NEW ASSIGNMENT-- CHIEF CORRESPONDENT TO THE FARM UPSTATE.
COMING UP, WEBSTER ANNOUNCES THE WORD OF THE YEAR AS THE PRESIDENT'S VERY OWN LIDDLE SPELLED WITH DOUBLE "D"s.
EVEN HIS HILARIOUS NICKNAMES HAVE LARGE BREASTS.
I WISH I HAD LARGE BREASTS SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD LOVE ME.
Stephen: THANK YOU, GUYS. THEY DO SUCH A GOOD JOB, SO GOOD. BEST IN THE BUSINESS. PERSONALLY, I HOPE TRUMP DOESN'T START WORLD WAR III BETWEEN NOW AND DECEMBER 15, BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU GUYS SEE THE NEW TRAILER LAST NIGHT? DID YOU SEE IT? IT DEBUTED DURING HALFTIME OF "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL." I'M NOT SURE IF THEY WERE ADVERTISING "STAR WARS" TO FOOTBALL FANS OR FOOTBALL TO "STAR WARS" FANS BUT IT WORKED OUT. BEFORE PLAYING THE NEW TRAILER, A LEGION OF STORMTROOPERS MARCHED ONTO THE FIELD, SEEN HERE IN THE AMOUNT OF ARMOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOULD BE WEARING. LISTEN UP. TAKE A KNEE-- YOU TAKE A KNEE DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM? NO! THAT'S DISREPECTFUL TO THE SNOW-WHITE PRETEND NAZIS WHO ARE COMING OUT IN A MINUTE. THIS IS WHY FINN JOINED THE RESISTANCE. THAT'S THAT. YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT. HOWEVER I CAN GET IT.
Jon: THEY GOT GUNS, TOO.
Stephen: THE TRAILER WAS FANTASTIC. AND I BEING THE ORIGINAL "STAR WARS" FAN HAVE DECODED THE ENTIRE PLOT OF THE NEW MOVIE. IF YOU PAUSE RIGHT HERE, YOU CAN SEE REY, WHICH MEANS SHE DIDN'T DIE IN BETWEEN THE TWO MOVIES. A GREAT CREATIVE CHOICE. WE KNOW THAT SHE GOES TO SEE LUKE, WHO HAS A NEW ROBOTIC HAND-- OR HAS BEEN C3PO DRESSED UP IN A MAN SUIT THIS WHOLE TIME. REY IS TRAINING TO BEAT THE NEW VILLAIN: A LARGE ROCK THAT SHE IS CONFLICTED ABOUT KILLING. PROBABLY ENDS UP BEING HER DAD OR SOMETHING. KYLO REN IS ALSO BACK AND BADDER THEN EVER. AND THE GASH THAT REY GAVE HIM IN THE LAST MOVIE IS NOW HEALING, COURTESY OF HIS SPACE BAND-AID. OR HE CUT HIMSELF SHAVING WITH LIGHT SABER. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE THE BLADES COMING OUT OF THE SIDES, KYLO. AND LOOK WHO'S COMING TO THE RESCUE! IT'S CHEWBACCA, AND HIS NEW FRIEND, PORG! CHOPPER CHEAPER FINALLY, FINALLY-- ( APPLAUSE ) PEOPLE LOVE PORG. THEY LOVE THE PORG. FINALLY, A SECOND CHARACTER THAT SPEAKS ONLY THROUGH SCREAMING. AAARRGGHH! RAAAH. YAAAA! HALF THE MOVIE! OVERALL, A REALLY GREAT TRAILER. NOT J.J. ABRAMS 48, BUT STILL, PRETTY GOOD. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEW "STAR WARS" THIS CHRISTMAS. AND NEXT CHRISTMAS. AND EVERY CHRISTMAS AFTER THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. TRACEE ELLIS ROSS IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, ROBOTS! ROBERTS! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE. GIVE IT UP FOR THE MAN OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I FOLLOW ALL THE NEWS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. A.I. DOES THINGS HUMANS CAN'T EVEN FATHOM, LIKE LAUNCH ROCKETS, PREDICT WEATHER PATTERNS, AUTOCORRECT "GENTLE" TO "GENITAL." REALLY, SIRI. YOU THOUGHT I WANTED THE MOVERS TO BE "GENITAL" WITH THE DISHES? I HAD TO THROW THEM ALL AWAY. THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE DIRE WARNINGS FROM TESLA FOUNDER AND VITAMIN-DEFICIENT TONY STARK, ELON MUSK. MUSK IS SO WORRIED ABOUT A.I. THAT HE RECENTLY TWEETED THAT KIM JONG-UN "SHOULD BE LOW ON OUR LIST OF CONCERNS FOR CIVILIZATIONAL EXISTENTIAL RISK. COMPETITION FOR A.I. SUPERIORITY AT NATIONAL LEVEL MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF WW3, IMO." YES, ELON MUSK THINKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL CAUSE WORLD WAR III. MY MONEY'S STILL ON DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, CORER. I MEAN THE CORKER. THIS FEAR OF A.I. IS NOTHING NEW FOR MUSK. RECENTLY, HE ALSO TWEETED, "IF YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT A.I. SAFETY, YOU SHOULD BE. VASTLY MORE RISK THAN NORTH KOREA," RIGHT ABOVE A POSTER THAT SAYS, "IN THE END, THE MACHINES WILL WIN." IT'S TRUE. THE MACHINES ALWAYS WIN. GIVE ME MY KIT KAT, YOU BASTARD! ( APPLAUSE ) AND BACK IN JULY, MUSK ISSUED THIS WARNING ABOUT A.I.:
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT. I KEEP SOUNDING THE ALARM BELL, BUT, YOU KNOW, UNTIL PEOPLE SEE, LIKE, ROBOTS GOING DOWN THE STREET KILLING PEOPLE, LIKE, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.
Stephen: AND IF "WESTWORLD" IS ANY INDICATION, WHEN WE DO SEE ROBOTS SHOOTING PEOPLE, WE'LL JUST WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) MUSK'S COMMENTS SET OFF A BIT OF A FEUD WITH FACEBOOK FOUNDER AND PRE-TEEN BOY WHO JUST SAW A NAKED LADY, MARK ZUCKERBERG-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND ZUCK, WHO RESPONDED THAT MUSK'S COMMENTSES WERE PRETTY IRRESPONSIBLE. TO WHICH MUSK TWEETED BACK "I'VE TALKED TO MARK ABOUT THIS. HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUBJECT IS LIMITED." HEY, ELON, IT'S NOT MARK ZUCKERBERG'S FAULT THAT HE'S MISINFORMED. HE GETS HIS NEWS FROM FACEBOOK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, SO-- SO, ARE THE MACHINES READY TO RISE UP AND START WORLD WAR III? AND WILL THERE BE ANYTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO DESTROY WHEN THEY DO? THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "CYBORGASM." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S A LONG INTRO. THAT'S A LONG GRAPHIC INTRO. I WANT-- I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR VIEWERS FOR STAYING WITH US THROUGH THAT GRAPHIC INTRO. ELON MUSK MIGHT BE RIGHT TO WORRY ABOUT A.I. BECAUSE RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN ACQUIRE BIASES AGAINST RACE AND GENDER." WELL, THAT EXPLAINS THIS SCENE IN "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY."
OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, HAL.
I'M SORRY, DAVE. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
I'M SCARED YOU MIGHT BE A MEXICAN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: APPARENTLY, APPARENTLIA GREAT MOVIE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE END OF IT, BUT IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. APPARENTLY, A.I. IS BIASED BECAUSE IT GLEANS THE MEANING OF WORDS BY ANALYZING HUMAN TEXT, SO PROGRAMMERS DID THE WORST THING POSSIBLE: THEY FED THE COMPUTERS TEXT FROM THE INTERNET. GREAT! NOW THEY'RE RACIST AND FIGHTING OVER WHO THE BEST "STAR TREK" CAPTAIN WAS. AND EVEN WORSE, THE RACIST ROBOTS ARE ON THE MOVE BECAUSE GOOGLE'S DEEP MIND A.I. JUST LEARNED TO WALK. HERE'S FOOTAGE OF A.I. LEARNING TO WATCH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I LOOK LIKE RUNNING TOWARDS THE OPEN BAR AT A WEDDING. COME WITH ME! COME WITH ME! I WANT BOURBON! I WANT BOURBON. WHO WANTS-- PLEASE GIVE ME BOURBON! WHY DID THEY DO A WHOLE MASS? WHY DID THEY DO A WHOLE MASS! OH, MY GOD, "UPTOWN FUNK," I LOVE THIS SONG! I'M EXHAUSTING. THIS IS ACTUAL FOOT ANNUAL OF THE PROGRAM TRYING TO NAVIGATE AROUND A WALL. HE GIVES UP IN FRUSTRATION ANDIDIZE. UNCANNILY HUMAN! THAT'S THE SAME WAY I RESPOND TO SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT TASKS. ( LAUGHTER ) CLEAN OUT THE GARAGE? I'D RATHER BE DEAD. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS INSTALLMENT OF "CYBORGASM." JOIN ME NEXT TIME, WHEN IT WILL DEFINITELY STILL BE THE REAL STEPHEN COLBERT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TRACEE ELLIS ROSS. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A QUICK REMINDER. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GIVE-- IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GIVE SOMEBODY A GREAT HALLOWEEN PRESENT-- AND AREN'T WE ALL, JON?
Jon: OH, YEAH.
Stephen: CONSIDER "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONING IF YOU DON'T CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN, AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T, THE NEXT DAY IS ALL SAINTS DAY. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT ALL SAINTS DAY PRESENT THIS IS THE ONE. IT'S LIKE GOING TO CHURCH. THAT'S HOW CLOSE THIS IS GOING TO CONFESSION.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: YOU LIKE GOING TO CONFESSION, JON?
Jon: I LIKED GOING TO CONFESSION AS A KID, I LIKED GOING BEHIND THAT THING.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAS IT DONE?
Jon: OH, WOW. YEAH. I READ THE BOOK, THOUGH, I LIKED THE BOOK.
Stephen: YOU'RE COVERED. YOU'RE COVERED.
Jon: I LIKED THE BOOK. YEAH, YEAH.

Stephen: HEY! ♪ ♪ ♪ YOU.
Stephen:  KNOW WHAT? LOVELY TO SEE YOU. I'M GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE WITH MY WIFE TONIGHT WHEN SHE SEES THIS.
WHY?
Stephen: I DIDN'T HELP YOU UP THE STAIRS.
YOU SORT OF DID, BUT I NEEDED EXTRA HELP.
Stephen: I SHOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED. I AM A TERRIBLE HOST.
NO, I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER, SIR! ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I BOW TO YOUR FORMAL ACCENT, M'LADY. LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU. I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. LOVELY TO SEE YOU! I KEEP DOING IT! M'LADY. WHAT WOULD MONSIEUR MEAN.
Stephen: "MY SIR."
MONSIEUR.
Stephen: I LOVE THE TUX YOU'RE WEARING. PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE MORE FORMAL ON LATE NIGHT. YOU DON'T SEE THAT.
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS TUX-- TRACEE ELLIS ROSS DESIGN FOR J.C. PENNY.
Stephen: WHAT!
YEAH.
Stephen: CAN I SEE THE LABEL?
LOOK AT THAT.
Stephen: SURE IS.
AND THERE'S T.E.R.s EVERYWHERE. 59 BUCKS FOR THE PANTS. AND 59 BUCKS FOR THE JACKET. AND THE SHIRT, COME ON.
Stephen: "LIFE NEEDS SPARKLE" IT SAYS RIGHT THERE.
IT DOES.
Stephen: 59, AND 59.
AND 29 FOR THE SHIRT. AFFORDABLE CLOTHES FOR EVERYBODY, STEPHEN!
Stephen: YOU'RE LOSING MONEY NOT BUYING THAT CLOTHING.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: AND YOU CAN WEAR IT ANYWHERE.
ANYWHERE! WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN DESIGNING CLOTHE FOR A LONG TIME?
I HAVE NOT. THIS IS A FIRST. THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE. I HAVE BEEN DESIGNING THEM IN MY HEAD SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER, AND THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE. I'M SO EXCITED. IT'S A HOLIDAY LINE, J.P. PENNY OUT NOVEMBER 12. WE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.
Stephen: I IMAGINE AS A TEENAGER HUACCESS TO SOME PRETTY DARN GOOD CLOTHES--
THE BEST.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER, THE LOVELY TALENTED LEGENDARY DIANA ROZ WAS A FASHION ICON IN HER OWN RIGHT.
YEAH, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU GUYS ARE PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME SIZE, RIGHT?
SADLY FOR HER, WE ARE. YES.
Stephen: OKAY, SO WOULD YOU RAID?
I RAILED EYE CALL IT "SHOPPING." ( LAUGHTER ) I CALL IT SHOPPING. AND, YES, I WOULD RAID HER CLOSET --
Stephen: DO YOU STILL? DO YOU STILL GO SHOPPING?
YES, SIR, YES, MONSIEUR. I CALL IT SHOPPING. MY MOM HAS AMAZING TASTE AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR HER AS I SAID SHE AND I WEAR THE SAME SIZE. AND IN HIGH SCHOOL, FOR EXAMPLE, I REMEMBER SHE WAS LEAVING TO GO FOR WORK, AND SHE WAS GOING DOWN DRIVEWAY AND I WATCHED HER GO DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND I WENT IN HER CLOSE CLOSET AND I WAS, LIKE TAKING EVERYTHING I LIKED. I LIKED TO PUT IF IN MY CLOSET FAZ IT WERE MINE AS OPPOSED TO SNEAKING IT OUT OF HER CLOSET. AND SHE CAME BACK IN. SHE FORGOT SOMETHING. AND I WAS LIKE, "I'M JUST HELPING TO ORGANIZE YOUR CLOSET AS A SURPRISE FOR WHEN YOU GET HOME!" ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AND DID SHE BUY THAT?
NO.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, GOOD. YOU, ALSO EY-- I MEAN, YOUR CHILDHOOD MUST HAVE BEEN FULL OF FUN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU IN THIS PHOTO?
I'M SO BAD AT THAT. EIGHT, BETWEEN EIGHT AND 12.
Stephen:  EIGHT AND 12.
THIS WAS A POLAROID TAKEN BY ANDY WARHOL.
Stephen: OKAY.
THE ANDY WARHOL. DID NOT KNOW WHO HE WAS. WAS JUST A WEIRD MAN. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THEN YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS.
BUT HE MADE EXTRAORDINARY ART.
Stephen: HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY WEIRD, THOUGH. HE WORE THE WHITE WIG.
WHICH FOR ME NOW WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN. BUT AS A CHILD, IT WAS LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING. IT WAS AN AIRPORT HANGAR, ALL PAINTED-- FLOOR, CEILINGS, WALL, EVERYTHING, MINT GREEN.
Stephen: HERE IN THE CITY.
HERE IN THE CITY. HE TOOK PICTURES OF US AND WE WEREN'T MEANT TO MOVE AND HE TURNED THEM INTO PAINTINGS AND I NOW AT 44 GET TO SAY I WAS PAINTED AND PHOTOGRAPHED BY ANDY HALL.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THAT CAN EXPRESSION IS SAYING?
SHE'S LIKE, "WHO IS THIS GUY?" I'M LIKE, MOOOOOM..." RIGHT OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE.
Stephen: YOU'LL THANK ME LATER.
KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR MOM.
Stephen: SO IT'S SEASON FOUR.
WHICH IS INSANE, YES.
Stephen: SEASON FOUR OF "BLACK-ISH." CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND--
NOW, LISTEN --
Stephen: IT STARTED LAST WEEK.
WE STARTED LAST WEEK.
Stephen: STARTED LAST WEEK
AND WE STARTED WITH THE JUNE-TEENAGE EPISODE AIR, MUSICAL EPISODE, WHICH WAS FANTASTIC, AND RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE D.N.A. OF OUR SHOW, WE ARE JUMPING IN ON THOSE HEAVY TOPICS, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE A COMEDY. AND THIS WEEK, OUR EPISODE IS ON POST-PARTUM.
Stephen: THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING YOU DO. YOU-- YOU FOLKS OVER THERE MANAGED TO TACKLE REALLY WEIGHTED ISSUES BUT STILL KEEP IT A COMEDY WITHOUT ANY LAUGH TRACK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU GUYS JUST DO REALLY INCREDIBLE MATERIAL.
I THINK THE WRITERS ARE INCREDIBLE. I REALLY DO. I THINK THE WAY THEY ENTER THE SUBJECT MATTER IS INTERESTING. THE FACT THAT WE DEAL WITH THESE-- THE "N" WORD, GUN CONTROL, POLICE BRUTALITY, AND STILL IT'S FUNNY WITHOUT US MAKING FUN OF THOSE TOPICS IS REALLY EXCITING. IT MAKES IT REALLY FUN WORK FOR ME TO DO.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU AND ANTHONY ANDERSON FROM "BLACK-ISH." WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SCENE?
BO IS A DOCTOR AND IS EXPERIENCING THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-PARTUM AND HASN'T EXPERIENCED IT BEFORE AND ISN'T QUITE READY TO SAY THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
Stephen: IN DENIAL.
AND WE FIND A QUIZ IN THE MAGAZINE AND TAKE IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE FUN?
WHAT.
IF WE TAKE THIS POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION QUIZ TOGETHER.
DRE, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. I'M OKAY.
TOTALLY, TOTALLY. BUT, I THINK WE SHOULD-- WE SHOULD TAKE, IT JUST IN CASE ONE OF US HAS A DEBILITATING MOOD DISORDER. SO I'LL GO FIRST. "DO YOU FEEL SAD, HOPELESS, OVERWHELMED, EMPTY?" THAT'S A NOPE FOR ME. HOW ABOUT YOU?
UH, WELL, I FEEL SAD.
UH-HUH.
AND I FEEL HOPELESS. AND I FEEL OVERWHELMED, BUT I DON'T FEEL EMPTY SO, I GUESS IT'S A NO FOR ME.
OKAY! THIS IS FUN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: REALLY LOVELY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND TRUE!
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT.
Stephen: IT'S VERY TRUE.
IT'S VERY TRUE. AND IT'S A VERY REAL THING THAT MANY WOMEN EXPERIENCE, AND IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT DIAGNOSED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD. SO I HOPE WE DO A LITTLE BIT TO HELP THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT I-- I COULD NEVER EXPERIENCE.
WHICH IS?
Stephen: A WOMAN CAN HAVE A BABY. I CAN NEVER HAVE A BABY, I CAN'T EXPERIENCE THIS. BUT YOU COULD HAVE ANOTHER EXPERIENCE THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
NO!
Stephen: YOU DO NOT DRINK COFFEE OR SUGAR. HOW DO YOU IN AMERICA TODAY--
IN AMERICA!
Stephen: HOW DO YOU ESCAPE DRIPPING COFFEE? IT IS EVERYWHERE AND IT IS THE NECTAR OF THE GOD.
FIRST OF ALL, I DRANK COFFEE ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL DURING AN EXAM. AND WE WERE IN THE GYM. AND I SWEAR TO GOD, I DRANK TWO SIPS AND I WAS LIKE, OH, NOW THIS IS WEIRD. BECAUSE I FELT LIKE MY ENTIRE SOUL WENT UP AND SLAPPED ON THE CEILING. AND I WAS-- AND THE DIFFICULT PART OF IS THAT PART KNOWS ALL THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST-- I'M A VERY-- I HAVE A VERY WIRY, ENERGETIC PERSONALITY, SO COFFEE AND SUGAR AND STIM LANTZ OF ANY KIND, EVEN CHOCOLATE, MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M HAVING AN ANXIETY ATTACK OR PANIC ATTACK.
Stephen: WOW. SEE, THAT'S WHY I DRINK THE COFFEE.
I DON'T LIKE THAT FEELING.
Stephen: IT KEEPS ME WEAK ALL THE TIME.
IT JUST FEELS LIKE ANXIETY. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ENERGY. I GO TO SLEERNG OR SOMETIMES IF I'M REAL TIRED-- BECAUSE I WAKE UP AT FOUR CHECKIN THE MORNING FOR WORK SOMETIMES. I DO JUMPING JACKS --
Stephen: WAIT, AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING DO YOU JUMPING JACKS.
YEAH, OR I DO SOME YOGA-- IT'S CRAZY BUT IT'S TRUE, I DRY BRUSH. YOU HAVE EVER DRY BRUSHED? >.
Stephen: WHAT.
EXACTLY. IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR CIRCULATION-- I'M SO SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF BRUSH ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
LIKE A TOILET BRUSH. IT'S NOT A TOILET BRUSH, BUT THE BRISTLES ARE THAT FIRM.
Stephen: AND WHAT DOES ONE DO?
YOU DRY BRUSH YOUR SKIN AND IT HELPS THE CIRCULATION AND IT WAKES YOU UP.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE ANCIENT ROMANS WHIPPING THEMSELVES WITH LAUREL BRANCHES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
TO ME IT SOUNDS SO MUCH HEALTHIER THAN A CUP OF COFFEE.
Stephen: I'LL GET YOU SOME BETTER COFFEE.
CLEARLY, THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT DON'T DRINK COFFEE. EVERYBODY ELSE IS LIKE SHE'S NUTS.
Stephen: BETWEEN EVERY ACT OF THIS SHOW I GET A FRESH CUP OF COFFEE.
LITERALLY YOU WOULD WATCH ME-- AND I WOULD SCRP DISAPPEAR. I WOULD BE GONE.
Stephen: WOULD BE A GREAT TRICK.
WOULD BE A AGREEMENT TRICK! YOU WANT ME TO DISAPPEAR!
Stephen: WELL, WE DO HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. IT WAS LOVELY IT SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "BLACK-ISH" AIRS TUESDAY NIGHTS ON ABC. TRACEE ELLIS ROSS EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LUKE ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMENT, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM THE "FAST AND FURIOUS" MOVIES AND "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST." I KNOW HIM AS BARD THE BOWMAN FROM "THE HOBBIT." PLEASE WELCOME, LUKE EVANS! GOOD TO SEE YOU! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER A FEW TIMES OVER THE YEARS. DO YOU-- FIRST TIME WE HAVE HAD AN INTERVIEW TOGETHER. DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME WE MET?
I CERTAINLY DO. YOU CAME TO NEW ZEALAND WHEN I WAS SHOOTING "THE HOBBIT."
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
AND SOMEHOW WANGLED YOUR WAY ON TO ONE OF MY KEEPS WITH YOUR FAMILY.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACT IT. PETER JACKSON ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO PLAY IT'S FAMILY WANTED TO PLAY SPY NETWORK.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT THE VERY NIGHT WE SHOT THAT SCENE, DO YOU REMEMBER GOING TO A PARTY?
WE WENT TO ONE OF THE WRITERS OF "LORD OF THE RINGS" AND "THE HOBBIT," AND YOU HAD A TOIKEN-OFF. AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TOIKEN QUESTIONS I EVER HEARD ANYBODY BE ASKED.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK THEY WERE THAT HARD, ACTUALLY. THAT WAS A PEEK MOMENT FOR ME, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I REMEMBER ABOUT THE PARTY. DO YOU WANT TON WHAT I REMEMBER ABOUT THE PARTY? I WAS THERE WITH MY WIFE AND MY TWO BOYS, AND THE BOYS HAD GOTTEN THERE FOR A FEW DAYS TO DO FISHING IN NEW ZEALAND, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE THERE.
IT IS GREAT.
Stephen: AND EVY HAD GOTTEN DOWN THERE. AND I SAID, "I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE BOYS. YOU ENJOY THE PARTY. I'VE BEEN ON A VACATION A FEW DAYS." IT WAS FRAN WALSH'S HOUSE. SHE SAID, "DO YOU WANT THEM TO TAKE A NAP?" AND I PUT THEM DOWN FOR A NAP AND I CAME OUT LOOKING FOR MY WIFE. AND I CAN'T FIND MY WIFE. AND I SAID, "HAS ANYBODY SEEN EVY?" "SHE'S THERE, BACK IN THERE WITH LUKE," OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M NOT SURE. SO I COME AROUND THE CORNER AND THERE IS MY WIFE TALKING TO YOU, LOOKING AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SHE'S ONE OF THE CHEERLEADERS IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND I SAID-- AND I SAID-- I SAID, "HEY, GUYS!" AND I TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH. AND THIS IS THE PHOTOGRAPH I TOOK AT THAT MOMENT. ( APPLAUSE )
CAUGHT REDHANDED.
Stephen: SHE IS COMPLETELY-- SHE IS-- SHE'S LOOKING AT ME LIKE, "YEAH, YOU CAUGHT ME." ( LAUGHTER ) "HE'S KINDS OF CUTE."
SHE'S VERY A LOVELY LADY.
Stephen: I CAN POINT SOMETHING OUT. HOW MUCH SKIN YOU'RE SHOWING.
IT WAS SOMEWHERE.
Stephen: LOOK HOW MUCH SKIN. I GET NO SKIN. LOOK AT THE SKIN MY WIFE GETS.
WE CAN UNDO THE BUTTONS.
. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS?
THIS IS ACTUALLY-- WEIRDEE --
Stephen: A SYMBOL OF NEW ZEALAND.
IT'S THE HOOK, THE FISHING HOOK, MADE OUT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL JADE.
Stephen: I CAN SEE THAT? THAT'S WARM. THAT'S REALLY WARM.
THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEART. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, THE NEW MOVIE YOU HAVE IS CALLED "PROFESSOR MARSTON AND THE WONDER WOMEN."
YES.
Stephen: NOW, EXPLAIN TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, WHERE WONDER WOMAN CAME FROM.
PROFESSOR MAFORTON WAS A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR IN THE 1930S AND WITH HIS WIFE CREATED THE EARLY LIE DETECTOR TEST, WHICH IS PART OF THE STORY. HE HAS A POLYAMOROUS RELATIONSHIP WITH TWO WOMEN FOR HIS WHOLE LIFE, HAS CHILDREN WITH THEM BOTH, THEN GOES ON AND CREATES WONDER WOMAN. THE SAME PERSON DID ALL OF THESE THINGS. AND IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY --
Stephen: HOW DOES THE PROFESSOR BECOME THE CREATOR OF A COMIC BOOK SUPERHERO?
HE HAD A VERY VIVID IMAGINATION AND WAS INSPIRED BY THE TWO WOMEN IN HIS LIFE. THE CREATION OF WONDER WOMAN IS INSPIRED BY THESE TWO WERNL THE WAY THEY LOOKED AND SHE THE DEFLECTED BULLETS -- THE BRACELETS. THAT'S WHAT ONE OF THE WOMEN USED TO WEAR. IT'S VERY INTERESTING HOW HE DREW MANY PARALLELS FROM HIS LIFE WITH THIS-- WITH THIS-- WITH HIS OWN LIFE, WHICH IS QUITE UNUSUAL.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE.
THAT'S RIGHT, YES.
Stephen: WITH OLIVER PLATT.
WHO PLAYS M.C. GAINS WHO IS BASICALLY THE MAN WHO CREATED SUPERMAN AND THE COMPANY BECAME D.C. COMICS. PITCHING SUPREME ATHE WONDER WOMAN, YES.
Stephen: JIM.
PRIMA, THE WONDER WOMAN, WILL NOT BE AN ORDINARY COMIC BOOK. BUT INSTEAD, THE START OF A POWERFUL FEMINIST MOVEMENT. SHE WILL BE CAREFULLY CRAFTED BASED ON A LIFETIME OF RESEARCH INTO THE HUMAN MIND, INSERTED INTO A POP LUST MEDIUM AND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN.
DO YOU ALWAYS LAY IT ON SO THICK? SUPREMA THE WONDER WOMAN? IT'S TOO WORDY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HER... WONDER WOMAN?
WONDER WOMAN... ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: NOW, AS YOU WERE SAYING, THE CHARACTER HAS POLYAMOROUS RELATIONSHIP.
YES.
Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND-- I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET, BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT FOR MANY REASONS, THIS IS ONE OF THEM. THERE ARE UNCONVENTIONAL SEX SCENES IN THIS MOVIE, I UNDERSTAND.
YES.
THREE PEOPLE--
THREE, YES.
Stephen: ROPES.
ONE IS ENOUGH.
Stephen: COSTUMES.
COSTUMES.
Stephen: I IMAGINE A SEX SCENE MUST BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH BUT WHEN YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE CREATIVE LIKE THAT, DOES IT GET EASIER OR HARDER?
IT'S NEVER EASY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE 10 MIDDLE-AGED SWEATY CAMERA CREW AND BOOM OPERATORS -- NO OFFENSE, GUYS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I'M SURE NONE TAKEN.
YOU COULDN'T BE SWEATY. IT'S LEAK'S FRIDGE. BUT IT WAS VERY HARD ON THE SET. THE DIRECTOR, ANGELA, DECIDED SHE WOULD PLAY SOME MUSIC TO SORT OF LOOSEN US UP. SO WE'RE ALL VERY NERVOUS. THERE ARE THREE OF US. WE'RE HAVING TO DO DRESS-UP AND ALL-- WATCH THE SHOW. AND SHE PUTS THIS SONG ON, AND WE'RE ALL STANDING THERE TRYING TO GET READY FOR IT, THE CAMERAS ARE ROLLING. AND OUT OF THE SPEAKERS ♪ LET'S GO IT ON ♪ MARVIN GAY, WHICH WAS QUITE-- WE BURST OUT LAUGHING. AND WEIRDLY SHE USED THAT LAUGH IN THE FILM BECAUSE IT WAS VERY HUMAN, YOU KNOW. PEOPLE LAUGH WHEN THEY MAKE LOVE SOMETIMES. SO... ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN-- I'VE NEVER BEEN SO LUCKY? WELL, IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
