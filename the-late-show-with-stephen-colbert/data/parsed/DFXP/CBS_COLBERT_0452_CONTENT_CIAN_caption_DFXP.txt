IT LOOKS LIKE THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS CAN'T EVEN STOP THE FEUD BETWEEN CNN AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. SO THE NETWORK SAYS THEY ARE SKIPPING THE ANNUAL WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, COFFEE JOE CALLS TRUMP CUCKOO. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES CAROL BURNETT AND LEWIS BLACK. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, JOSEPH. HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, JON. THAT'S NICE. THAT'S NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY!
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. INCREDIBLE. THESE PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE. THESE PEOPLE ARE AMAZING. THIS IS THE KIND OF CROWD I WOULD WANT TWO NIGHTS A WEEK. UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: DOUBLE HEADER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT IS FRIDAY, AND IT'S BEEN QUITE A WEEK FOR THE PRESIDENT. CALLING SENATOR WARREN POCAHONTAS IN FRONT OF NAVAJO CODE TALKERS, DENYING THAT WAS HIS VOICE ON THE "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE, BUT WE'VE ALL ACCEPTED THAT A LITTLE BIT OF CRAZY WAS PART OF THE DEAL WITH A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. KIND OF LIKE HOW WE ACCEPT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF RAT POOP IN HOT DOGS. LAUGH IT'S THE FLAVOR. THIS IS DELICIOUS. IT IS TRUE. LOOK IT UP. THIS WEEK, JUST FEELS DIFFERENT SOMEHOW THIS WEEK. AND YESTERDAY, WHAT'S THE SHOW, ON THE JOE COFFEE MORNING, AND THE BREW CREW, COFFEE JOE LAID IT ALL OUT.
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, SOMEBODY THAT THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS" SAYS IS MENTALLY UNFIT, PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM SAY IS MENTALLY UNFIT, THAT PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM DURING THE CAMPAIGN TOLD ME HE HAD EARLY STAGES OF DEMENTIA.
Stephen: OH, SO WE'RE DOING THIS NOW? IT'S OKAY TO SAY THE "D" WORD? I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL JUST SUPPOSED TO SMILE AND PRETEND HE WAS BEING COLORFUL, LIKE UNCLE MARTY WHEN HE STARTED WEARING KLEENEX BOXES AS SHOES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) , OF COURSE,-- IT'S CHARMING. OF COURSE, JAVA JOE, HERALD OF THE DAWN, KNOWS IT'S DICEY TO ACCUSE THE SITTINGP RESIDENT OF GOING SENILE, SO HE WENT ON.
NOW, LISTEN, YOU CAN GET MAD AT ME IF YOU WANT TO.
YOU CAN SAY IT'S NOT OKAY TO SAY--
BUT IT IS OKAY TO SAY-- WHEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS?
Stephen: BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED WOULD'VE BEEN NICE.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST-- JUST-- THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE. RIGHT? IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL! AND JOE JOE STARBUCKS ISN'T THE ONLY ONE POINTING OUT TRUMP'S RECENT DOWNTURN. SO IS TRUMP'S BIOGRAPHER, A GUY WHO SPENT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME WITH TRUMP ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO.
HE IS DECOMPENSATING, A PSYCHIATRIC TERM. BUT WHAT IT MEANS IN SIMPLE TERMS IS HE IS LOSING HIS GRIP ON REALITY. HE IS MORE LIMITED IN HIS VOCABULARY.
Stephen: OH, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT THAT LIMITED. IT JUST WENT UP TO 280 CHARACTERS. LAUGH ALTHOUGH, THERE ARE SOME TROUBLING SIGNS. JUST LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT AT HIS TAX BILL RALLY THIS WEEK.
THESE MASSIVE TAX CUTS WILL BE ROCKET FUEL.  ( LAUGHTER )   LITTLE ROCKET MAN, ROCKET FUEL FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.  ( APPLAUSE ) HE IS A SICK PUPPY.
Stephen: SIR, STAY ON THE TAXES, THEN GO TO NUCLEAR WAR! DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SCATTING: "TAX CUTS, ROCKET FUEL, ROCKET MAN, MANHOLE, HOLY COW, COWABUNGA, BUNGALOW, HOW LOW CAN YOU GO, DEEDILY BOOP-BA DOOP A DOOP-- SICK PUPPY!" BOP-BOP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BOP. ONE THING THAT HAS PEOPLE CONCERNED IS THAT YESTERDAY TRUMP RETWEETED SOME DISTURBING RACIST VIDEOS. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF JUST HOW AWFUL THESE ARE, ONE OF THEM IS CALLED "MUSLIM MIGRANT BEATS UP DUTCH BOY ON CRUTCHES," PROBABLY MY LEAST FAVORITE HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSON FAIRY TALE. THIS VIDEOS WERE PUT OUT BY THE FAR-RIGHT HATE GROUP BRITAIN FIRST, SO IT'S CONCERNING THAT TRUMP WOULD RETWEET THE VIDEO, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY'RE NOT ACCURATE. IN THE TOUCH BOY ON CRUTCHES, LOCAL MEDIA AND POLICE NEVER IDENTIFIED THE ATTACKERS AS MUSLIM. SO BASICALLY THESE VIDEOS ARE SOMEONE COMMITTING AN ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE. THIS REMIND ME, I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS VIDEO OF A MUSLIM MAN VISUALLY ATTACKING AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.
Stephen: WE HAVE GOT TO BUILT THAT WALL. BETWEEN US AND-- WHO IS IT BETWEEN? AND TRUMP RETWEETING THIS HATE GROUP HASN'T GONE OVER TOO WELL IN BRITAIN. TAKE IT FROM BRITAIN TRIEMENT TERESA MAY WHO SAID:  IT'S REALLY TOO COHERENT FOR OUR PRESIDENT TO UNDERSTAND. MADAM YOU NEED TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO TRUMP SPEAK ON A TWEET. HASHTAG. HASHTAG. , OF COURSE, GREAT BRITAIN IS OUR STRONGEST ALLY, SO NATURALLY, DONALD TRUMP TOOK THE HIGH ROAD AND MOVED ON TO OTHER MATTERS OF STATE. I'M JUST KIDDING. HE TWEETED, "DOT @THERESA MAY, DON'T FOCUS ON ME, FOCUS ON THE DESTRUCTIVE RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM THAT IS TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE ARE DOING JUST FINE!" DON'T BELIEVE HIM! ENGLAND, WE NEED YOUR HELP. TAKE US BACK! WE'LL BE GOOD!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL EVEN-- WE'LL DRINK TEA. WE'LL DRINK TEA.  ( APPLAUSE ) OH, AND THERE WAS ALSO ONE PROBLEM WITH TRUMP'S RESPONSE. HE ORIGINALLY TWEETED AT THE WRONG TERESA MAY. HEY, IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. REMEMBER F.D.R. ACCIDENTALLY BOMBED NEW JERSEY RESIDENT ADOLPH HILTER. NOW, THERE IS-- GOOD MAN. THE SPELLING HILTER, HILTER, IS A GOOD GUY. OF COURSE, THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT ABOUT TWO DECADES AGO, TRUMP WAS A LOT MORE ELOQUENT. IN FACT, THERE'S A CONTROVERSIAL QUOTE THAT JUST CAME OUT FROM AN INTERVIEW IN 2000 THAT TRUMP DID WITH "MAXIMUM GOLF" MAGAZINE, WHICH IS ALSO THE AMOUNT OF GOLF TRUMP PLAYS AS PRESIDENT. APPARENTLY, WHILE BEING MAXIMUM INTERVIEWED, TRUMP POINTED OUT A "YOUNG SOCIALITE" AT MARA-LAGO AND TOLD A REPORTER, "THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD LIKE FIRST-RATE..." AND THERE IT IS. "THE GRABBY AREA." NOW, TO BE FAIR, MAYBE TRUMP WASN'T REFERRING TO THE FEMALE ANATOMY. MAYBE HE WAS REFERRING TO THE POPULAR BRITISH CHILDREN'S MOVIE CHARACTER, FIRST RATE PUSSY. WHO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM FIRST RATE PUSSY: CAT ABOUT TOWN, FIRST RATE PUSSY: TEA-TIME SHENANIGANS: AND, OF COURSE, FIRST RATE PUSSY MEETS FIVE-STAR TROUSER SNAKE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO WHY-- REALLY?  ( APPLAUSE ) BIG FANS. THEY-- THEY-- THEY ALL READ THOSE BOOKS AS CHILDREN. NOW, WHY ARE WE JUST NOW HEARING ABOUT THIS? WELL, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE INTERVIEWER, THE EDITOR IN CHIEF CHANGED THE QUOTE TO "THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD LIKE FIRST-RATE TALENT." WOW, I GOTTA SAY, AN EDITOR WHO LACKS THE COURAGE TO RUN THAT QUOTE IS A REAL... TALENT.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) BUT THERE WERE ALSO LESS SEXY SCANDALS THIS WEEK, LIKE THE ONE AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THE C.F.P.B. WAS DESIGNED TO REGULATE THE RECKLESS BEHAVIOR THAT LEAD TO THE STOCK MARKET COLLAPSE OF 2008. BUT PEOPLE ON WALL STREET AND REPUBLICANS HATE THE C.F.P.B., INCLUDING DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET AND LOSING HIS HARRY POTTER, MICK MULVANEY.
IT IS TO ME, SIR, ONE OF THE MOST OFFENSIVE CONCEPTS I THINK IN A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS AN ALMOST COMPLETELY UNACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AGENCY. IT TURNS UP BEING A JOKE, WHICH IS WHAT THE C.F.P.B. REALLY HAS BEEN IN A SICK, SAD KIND OF WAY. AND GUESS WHO TRUMP APPOINTED TO TAKE OVER THE C.F.P.B. IT'S MICK MULVANEY. DESPITE WHAT HE SAID IN THE PAST HE TAKES HIS NEW JOB SERIOUSLY.
THIS AGENCY WILL STAY OPEN. RUMORS THAT I AM GOING TO SET THE PLACE ON FIRE OR BLOW IT UP OR LOCK THE DOORS ARE COMPLETELY FALSE.
Stephen: NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT FIRE OR EXPLOSIONS. LAUGH "UH, THANK YOU FOR HIRING ME. I TAKE THIS POSITION SERIOUSLY. RUMORS THAT I'M GOING TO EMBEZZLE A BILLION DOLLARS, THEN CREATE A DISTRACTION BY SETTING OFF THE SPRINKLERS WHILE I ESCAPE TO THE AIRPORT ARE COMPLETELY FALSE. QUICK QUESTION: WHICH WAY IS THE AIRPORT?"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. CAROL BURNETT IS HERE! BUT FIRST, WHEN WE COME BACK, I SHARE MY DARKEST CONFESSIONS. STICK AROUND.  ( APPLAUSE ) JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND RIGHT THERE! NOW, JON, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST SITTING IN WITH THE BAND TONIGHT PLAYING THE BASS. WHO DO YOU HAVE ON THE BASS THIS EVENING?
MY DAD IS PLAYING BASS, MICHAEL BATISTE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I LIKE THE SHADES. I LIKE THE SHADES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO BE COOL.
Stephen: YOU GOT TO BE COOL. YOU'RE TOO COOL FOR THIS SCHOOL, THAT'S FOR SURE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, MICHAEL AND THANK YOU FOR BEING AT THANKSGIVING DINNER.
NICE HAVING ME.
Stephen: IT SURE WAS. IT SURE WAS.
Stephen: FOLKS, WE'RE ABOUT TO DO CONFESSIONS, WHICH REMINDS ME: YOU SHOULD BUY MY NEW BOOK: "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." IT'S AN ACTUAL BOOK. IT HAS PAGES AND EVERYTHING. IT'S EVERYTHING YOU LOVE ABOUT MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS, COMBINED WITH EVERYTHING I LOVE ABOUT SELLING BOOKS. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE, "SOMETIMES I LOOK AT A SHAMPOO BOTTLE AND THINK, SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE TESTED THIS ON ANIMALS FIRST?" OTHERWISE, AREN'T THEY TESTING IT ON ME?"  (  LAUGHTER  ) LOTS OF WISDOM LIKE THAT. NOW WE DO CONFESSIONS HERE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC, I DON'T MAKE IT TO CHURCH THAT OFTEN BECAUSE I BELIEVE FAITH SAY PRIVATE MATTER. AND WHAT I MISS MOST IS CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience: OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. "THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, RIL I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( ORGAN MUSIC ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, I NEVER TOOK MY HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS DOWN, SO FOR CHRISTMAS, I'M JUST ADDING BEARDS AND HATS TO MY SKELETONS AND TELLING THE KIDS THAT SANTA LOST WEIGHT.  ( LAUGHTER ) THIS YEAR, THIS YEAR, AUDIENCE, I'M RECYCLING OLD CARDS, BUT I'M CROSSING OUT, "SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THIS YEAR I'M DOING ALL OF MY SHOPPING ONLINE. THAT'S WHY I ASK PEOPLE FOR THEIR SIZE, AND THEIR FAVORITE COLOR OF PORN.  ( LAUGHTER )   SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES I READ THE SIDE EFFECTS ON MY MEDICATIONS TO THE TUNE OF "WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE."  (  LAUGHTER  ) ♪ BLURRED VISION, WEIGHT GAIN, DIARRHEA, STOMACH PAIN ♪ WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE! ♪  ( LAUGHTER )   I NEVER WIPE DOWN THE MACHINES AT THE GYM AFTER I'M DONE EATING RIBS ON THEM.  ( LAUGHTER )   SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES WHEN I PLAY THE VIDEO GAME "CALL OF DUTY," I PRETEND TO HAVE BONE SPURS AND GO INTO REAL ESTATE WITH MY FATHER.  ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) MY DOCTOR SAID I NEEDED MORE ROUGHAGE, SO I STOPPED CHEWING MY OREOS BEFORE I SWALLOW THEM.  ( LAUGHTER )   I HAVE SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER, SO TO FIGHT THE DEPRESSION, I GOT A SPECIAL LAMP SO I CAN SEE MY SPECIAL BOTTLE OF BOURBON.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, "EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON," I PUSH THEM DOWN THE STAIRS AND SAY, "DO YOU KNOW WHY I DID THAT?"  ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE ) SOMETIMES I'LL TELL PEOPLE I GOT TO "DROP THE KIDS OFF AT THE POOL." BY "KIDS," I MEAN "POOP." AND BY "POOL" I MEAN "POOL."  ( LAUGHTER )   FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE!
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CAROL BURNETT.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. MY FIRST GUEST IS A LEGEND WHOSE VAIRT SERIES IS CELEBRATING ITS 50th ANNIVERSARY. PLEASE WELCOME THE ONE, THE ONLY, CAROL BURNETT. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HI, JON!
Stephen: IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK.
Stephen: NOW, KIDDO-- IF I CAN CALL YOU THAT.
OH, SURE, YEAH, PLEASE.
Stephen: NO, KIDDO, YOU'RE A LEGEND NOW. EVERYBODY LOVES YOU. PEOPLE LEAP TO THEIR FEET WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE THEATER, BUT IS THIS TRUE-- YOUR FIRST JOB IN NEW YORK YOU WERE A HAT CHECK GIRL?
YES, I WAS.
Stephen: WHERE.
AT A LADIES' TEA ROOM.
Stephen: OKAY.
THAT'S HOW BRIGHT I WAS-- WOMEN DON'T CHECK THEIR HATS.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NO ONE CHECKS THEIR HAT ANYMORE.
THEY DON'T WEAR THEM.
Stephen: NO ONE WARES A HAT. WAS THAT THE LONG GREEN THERE?
IT WAS CALLED SUSAN PALMER'S TEA ROOM, BUT THEY HAD AN OYSTER BAR DOWNSTAIRS THAT THE MEN WOULD GO TO. SO IN ORDER TO GET A TIP, I WOULD GRAB THE MEN AS THEY WERE GOING DOWNSTAIRS AND SAY, "CHECK YOUR COAT, SIR?" SO THEY'D GIVE ME THEIR COAT. AND THEN I WOULD TAKE A SCISSORS-- NOW YOU KNOW THE LITTLE THING IN THE BACK.
Stephen: THE HANG TAB, YEAH.
I CUT THAT OFF. AND THEN I WOULD RESEW IT WITH A DIFFERENT-COLOR THREAD. SO WHEN THEY WOULD COME BACK UP AND ASK FOR THEIR COAT, I WOULD SAY, "THIS WAS BROKEN, BUT I FIXED IT FOR YOU."  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND THEN--  ( APPLAUSE ) THEN INSTEAD OF GETTING A QUARTER, THEY'D GIVE ME AN EXTRA DIME. I'D GET 35 CENTS FOR THAT.
Stephen: WOW!
YEAH, I WAS A CON ARTIST.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU'RE A GRIFTER.
THAT I WAS.
Stephen: AND A DANCER, BECAUSE--
WHAT?
Stephen: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS PHOTO.
OH, MY --
Stephen: WE DUG UP HERE. IS YOU ARE NO STRANGER TO THIS THEATER.
NO.
Stephen: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, BUT I HADN'T SEEN ANY OF THE PHOTOS. YOU WORK ON THE OLD "GARY MOORE" SHOW SHOT AT THE SAME TIME AS THE "ED SULLIVAN SHOW.
ON THIS STAGE.
Stephen: IN THE 50s?
'59, '60, AND '61.
Stephen: YOU YOU ARE WITH GARY MOORE AROUND 1560. NICE GAMS, BY THE WAY. AND THE GUEST BOOK. NOW, AT THE SAME TIME YOU WERE, LIKE, MAKING YOUR BREAK ON BROADWAY IN "ONCE UPON A MATTRESS."
I DOUBLED.
Stephen: YOU WERE DOING THIS. THAT WAS YOUR DAY JOB.
THAT WAS MY DAY JOB AND I DID "ONCE UPON A MATTRESS" EIGHT TIMES A WEEK ON BROADWAY.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU DO THAT? THAT MUST HAVE ABSOLUTELY WIPED YOU OUT.
I WAS YOUNG, I WAS VERY YOUNG, AND I WAS VERY HUNGRY. SO I HAD BOTH JOBS. BUT I NEVER HAD A DAY OFF. AND SO, IN "ONCE UPON A MATTRESS" IT'S THE STORY OF THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA, SO THE PRINCESS IS SUPPOSED TO, TOWARDS THE END OF THE SHOW, GET ON TOP OF 20 MATTRESSES AND NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP. SO THAT'S THE WHOLE BIT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ONE MATINEE, I FELL ASLEEP.  ( LAUGHTER ) IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE! I PUT PEOPLE TO SLEEP, BUT I FELL ASLEEP.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO, TO FALL ASLEEP ON STAGE.
EXACTLY. I WAS EXHAUSTED. SO ALL I REMEMBER IS THE STAGE MANAGER GOING, "CAROL! CAROL! CAROL! WAKE UP!" AND I JUMPED UP LIKE THIS. IT'S A WONDER I DIDN'T FALL OFF THE MATTRESS.
Stephen: THREE OR FOUR YEARS ON "GARY MOORE?"
YES.
Stephen: ONE OF THOSE TWO. HOW LONG AFTER THAT DID YOU START THE "CAROL BURNETT SHOW."
I STARTED THE "BURNETT" SHOW IN '67 SO THAT TOOK A WHILE.
Stephen: HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT? GARY MOORE WAS ALSO FOR CBS, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: AND DID THEY SAY, "YOU. YOU GET A VARIETY SHOW?"
I SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH CBS FOR 10 YEARS, AND THEY SAID WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS EYE DON'T KNOW. I HAD A REALLY GOOD AGENT-- IF WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS IF I WANTED TO DO A VARIETY-- COMEDY VARIETY SHOW, ALL I WOULD HAVE TO DO IS PUSH THE BUTTON, AND CBS WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT ON 30, ONE-HOUR SHOWS, WHETHER THEY WANTED TO OR NOT.
Stephen: THAT IS A GOOD AGENT.
THAT WAS A GOOD AGENT.  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WOW!
AND I THOUGHT, "I'LL NEVER WANT TO DO THAT." WELL, TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIFTH YEAR, THE LAST WEEK OF THE FIFTH YEAR, I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO PUSH THAT BUTTON.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND I DID. AND I CALLED ONE OF THE VICE PRESIDENTS BACK HERE-- I WAS IN CALIFORNIA-- IT WAS BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S. AND I GOT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF CBS ON THE PHONE, AND SAYID, "HI." HE SAID, "CAROL, MERRY CHRISTMAS. HOW'S IT GOING?" I SAID, "GREAT. YOU KNOW, MIKE, I WANT TO PUSH THAT BUTTON." HE SAID, "WHAT BUTTON?" I SAID, "YOU KNOW, WHERE FIVE YEARS AGO YOU SAID THEY COULD DO--" HE TOTALLY FORGOT. HE DIDN'T KNOW, DIDN'T REMEMBER. AND HE SAID, "WELL, GREAT, I'LL CALL YOU BACK." SO I'M SURE HE GOT A LOT OF LAWYERS OUT OF THE CHRISTMAS PARTIES THAT NIGHT, YOU KNOW. CALLED ME BACK THE NEXT DAY, AND HE SAID, "YEAH, WELL, I SEE THAT, BUT, YOU KNOW, CAROL, COMEDY VARIETY TELEVISION, IT'S A MAN'S GAME.
Stephen: WOW.
AND HE SAID, "IT'S NOT FOR YOU GALS. IT'S REALLY-- IT'S DEAN MARTIN. IT'S MILTON BERLE. SID CAESAR, YOU KNOW, JACKIE GLEASON." HE SAID, "WE'VE GOT THIS GREAT SITCOM WE'D LOVE YOU TO DO CALLED "HERE'S AGNES."  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: I HEAR VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THAT ONE.
I SHOULD HAVE-- I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT.
Stephen: IT GOT AWAY FROM YOU.
I SAID, "NO, I DON'T WANT TO BE AGNES EVERY WEEK." SO THEY HAD TO PUT US ON THE AIR.
Stephen: WOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW DID THAT WORK OUT? HOW DID THAT WORK OUT?
I STILL KIND OF WONDER IF I SHOULD HAVE DONE "AGNES." I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: I DON'T. BECAUSE THE-- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE GREATEST VARIETY COMEDIAN OF ALL TIME.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S THE GREATEST VARIETY SHOW EVER MADE. LOOK AT THE CHARACTERS. LOOK AT ALL THESE CHARACTERS. THIS IS JUST A HAND FULL OF THE CHARACTERS YOU INHABITED ON THE SHOW. YOU KNOW--  ( APPLAUSE ) WAS THERE-- WAS THERE ANYTHING OF-- OF ALL THE THINGS DID YOU OVER THE YEARS, WAS THERE ANYTHING AT CBS-- WHICH IS A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION-- ANYTHING THEY SAID, "NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT SKETCH." OR "CAN'T DO THAT LINE," OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IN 11 YEARS THE NETWORK ONLY TALKED TO ME ABOUT ONE THING, CENSORS, RIGHT.
Stephen: SURE, SURE, STANDARDS AND PRACTICES.
STANDARDS AND PRACTICES. WE WERE DOING A SKETCH WHERE I WAS A NUDIST--  (  LAUGHTER  ) NO, NO, NOT LIKE THAT. THERE'S ENOUGH VIOLENCE IN THE WORLD WIEWT WOUT ME FLASHING. BUT ANYWAY, I WAS STANDING BEHIND A FENCE.
Stephen: VERY TASTEFUL.
AND A SIGN SAID, "KEEP OUT." MY SHOULDERS WERE BARE, AND BARE LEGS WITH HIGH-TOP SNEAKERS ON. AND HARVEY KORMAN WAS INTERVIEWING ME VOICE-OVER. AND IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF JOKES ABOUT A NUDIST COLONY. HE SAID-- ONE OF THE JOKES WAS, HE SAID, "SO WHAT DO YOU NUDIST DO FOR RECREATION?" AND MY LINE WAS, "WELL, WE HAVE DANCES EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT." "WELL, HOW DO YOU NUDISTS DANCE?" AND MY LINE WAS, "VERY CAREFULLY."  (  LAUGHTER  ) WELL, FOR SOME REASON, THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS RISQUE.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT WAS TOO DIRT GEE IT WAS TOO DIRTY. THEY SAID, "YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER LINE." THIS IS WHAT THEY BOUGHT. "SO WHAT DO YOU NUDIST DO FOR RECREATION?" "WE HAVE DANCES EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT." "HOW DO YOU NEWSISTS DANCE?" "CHEEK TO CHEEK."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOT BAD.
THAT WAS BETTER!
Stephen: NOT BAD. OKAY, SO, YOU'VE GOT-- THE BOOK THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE 11 YEARS DOING THE "THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW." WHICH IS OUT IN PAPERBACK RIGHT NOW. AND THERE IS A SPECIAL COMING OUT ON DECEMBER--
THIRD.
Stephen: DECEMBER THIRD.
SUNDAY.
Stephen: I AM IN IT.
YES, YOU ARE!  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BUT I WANT TO GO BACK IN A TIME MACHINE AND TALK TO MY YOUNGER SELF AND SAY, "HANG IN THERE. YOU'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO DO SCENES WITH THIS PERSON."
NOT ONLY SCENES, SINGING.
Stephen:  A LITTLE BIT OF SINGING.
YOU HAVE A GREAT SET OF PIPES.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR SAYING THE THING I ASKED YOU TO.  ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK HERE. BUT DON'T GO AWAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE CAROL BURNETT, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND CAROL BURNETT. NOW CAROL.
YES.
Stephen: I HEARD SO MANY TIMES THE STORY OF WHY YOU TUGGED YOUR EAR BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER-- I HEARD TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. ONE IT WAS FOR YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND ONE FOR YOUR CHILDREN. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF PULLING ON YOUR EAR?
MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN I GOT MY FIRST JOB IN TELEVISION HERE IN NEW YORK I CALLED HER COLLECT IN CALIFORNIA AND I SAID, ," NANNY, I'M GOING TO BE ON TV SATURDAY." AND SHE SAID, ," SAY HELLO TO ME." AND I SAID, "I DON'T, THEY'RE GOING TO LET ME SAY 'HEPO NANNI'." AND WE WORKED THIS OUT AND MEANT, "HELLO, NANNY, I'M FINE." AND I KEPT DOING IT AND LATER WHEN I GOT MORE SUCCESSFUL. IT WAS "HIGH, NANNY. I LOVE YOU. I'M FINE. YOUR CHECK'S ON THE WAY."  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: ANY PERFORMERS SAY THEY COPIED THAT TO SIGNAL THEIR FAMILY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: BECAUSE I DID. I USED TO DO THIS TO MY MOM, GIVE HER ONE OF THESE. DO THAT TO SAY HI AT THE END OF THE SHOW.
DID YOUR NOSE GREW? BECAUSE MY EAR GREW.
Stephen: IT GOT LONGER?
A MILLIMETER OR TWO LONGER.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE MOST FAMOUS FOR IS, OF COURSE, YOUR TARZAN YELL. OKAY. NOW, ARE YOU GUYS FAMILIAR WITH CAROL'S TARZAN YELL?  ( APPLAUSE ) WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER YOU COULD DO THAT?
I WAS ABOUT NINE, NINE OR 10 YEARS OLD. I HAD A BEAUTIFUL COUSIN WHO-- WE WERE THE SAME AGE. AND WE WOULD GO TO THE MOVIES, AND WE WOULD-- LIKE NELSON EDDIE AND JEANETTE McDONALD. AND WE'D COME HOME AND ACT THEM OUT. SHE WAS ALWAYS JEANETTE AND I WAS NELSON, BECAUSE SHE WAS THE REALLY PRETTY ONE. AND SO--  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE WOULD DO TARZAN AND JANE. SO GUESS WHO WAS TARZAN? ME.
Stephen: AT LEAST YOU WEREN'T A CHEETAH.
OOO-OOO! SO I TAUGHT MYSELF THE YELL WHEN I WAS ABOUT NINE OR 10 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: DID IT EVER COME IN HANDY OFF STAGE WHEN PEOPLE WERE SEARCHING FOR YOU IN THE WOODS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? IS THERE A PRACTICAL PURPOSE TO IT?
WELL, ONE TIME, I WAS HERE IN NEW YORK, AND I WAS-- I WAS DOING A SPECIAL, AND I HAD TO RUN ACROSS THE STREET TO BERG BERGDORPH GOODMAN'S TO GET SOME STOCKING. THEY OPENED AT 10:00 AND I WAS THERE EARLY IN THE LINGERIE DEPARTMENT. AND A LOVELY LADY SAID, "MIS BURNETT, MAY I HELP YOU?" I SAID, "I NEED SOME STOCKINGS." AND SHE SAID, "YES." AND SHE ASKED IF I WOULD SIGN FIVE OR SIX AUTOGRAPH FOR HER GRANDCHILDREN, AND I DID. AND I WENT TO PAY FOR THE STOCKINGS AND I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE THE WRITE CREDIT CARD. I SAID, "CAN I WRITE YOU A CHECK?" AND SHE SAID, "I'LL NEED SOME IDENTIFICATION."  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND I SAID, "BUT, YOU KNOW," SHE SAID, I KNOW, BUT WE HAVE TO GET YOUR LICENSE NUMBER AND ALL OF THAT. I SAID, "PLEASE, CAN'T I?" SHE SAID, "LET ME ASK MISS CARLTON ACROSS THE WAY." SHE WAS A FLOOR MANAGER. "IF SHE'LL OKAY YOUR CHECK." SHE GOES ACROSS THE WAY, THEY'RE WHISPERING. "MISS CARLTON WILL OKAY YOUR CHECK IF YOU DO THE TARZAN YELL." AND I'M IN BERGBORPH GOODMAN AND I SAID OKAY, I'LL DO IT. AND IT WAS A DOOZY. IT WAS A GOOD ONE. AND BEHIND THE LADY, THERE WAS AN EXIT DOOR, BURST OPEN, AND THERE WAS A SECURITY GUARD WAY GUN.  ( LAUGHTER ) SO I ONLY DO IT UNDER CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Stephen: I HESITATE TO ASK, BUT DO YOU STILL DO THE TARZAN YELL?
I THINK I CAN.
Stephen: WOULD YOU BE SO-- WOULD YOU--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BE SO KIND? I KNOW.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: TELL THE GUARDS. TELL THE GUARDS THIS IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
OKAY, I'LL TRY. AAAAAH-AAAAAH-AAAAH-AAAAAAH!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH, I LOVE THAT. THAT'S MY FAVORITE. NOW, AS SOMEBODY-- I HOST A TYPE OF VARIETY SHOW, A TALK SHOW IS A TYPE OF VARIETY SHOW. ONE OF THE THINGS, WHEN I TOOK OVER THIS JOB, ONE OF THE THINGS I ASKED DAVE-- BECAUSE HE-- I CAME IN AND HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF ABOUT THE SPACE SPACEAND ABOUT DOING A SHOW LIKE THIS. I SAID, ," I HAVE A WEIRD QUESTION, WHERE DO YOU HIDE FROM YOUR PRODUCERS WHEN THEY NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO IT? WHEN YOU WANT TO GET AWAY AND JUST THINK." AND HE GAVE ME A COUPLE OF PLACES THAT I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE WHO WORKS HERE YET BECAUSE I WANT TO HIDE I WANT TO HIDE. WHERE WOULD YOU HIDE-- YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE, A STAR WITH A SHOW WITH YOUR NAME ON IT, PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO ASK YOU THINGS.
THE ONLY TIME I KIND OF HID OUT WAS JUST BEFORE ON WEDNESDAYS WHEN WE WOULD DO A RUN-THROUGH FOR THE CREW AND, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY COMING IN AFTER WE'D REHEARSED FAIR COUPLE OF DAYS.
Stephen: WHAT DAY WOULD YOU ACTUALLY SHOOT?
WE'D SHOOT ON FRIDAY. BUT WE'D HAVE A RUN-THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. SO ABOUT 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE RUN-THROUGH, I WOULD GO ACROSS THE HALL FROM THE REHEARSAL HALL TO THE LADIES' ROOM AND I WOULD GO INTO ONE OF THE STALLS AND I WOULD SIT DOWN ON THE TOILET SEAT. AND I WOULD GO THROUGH THE SHOW IN MY MIND, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I COULD BE ALONE THERE. AND THIS ONE-- ONE DAY, I WAS GOING TO DO A CHARACTER I HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE CALLED "STELLA TODDLER," IT WAS THIS OLD, OLD LADY. AND I HAD DONE OLD LADIES BEFORE AND I HAD ALWAYS DONE THIS KIND OF VOICE. AND I THOUGHT I HAVE TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT VOICE. SO I'M SITTING ON THE TOILET SEAT AND I'M GOING, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE THIS WOULD BE GOOD. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE DOWN LOWER. WELL, I THINK THIS IS REALLY GOOD. IT'S-- OH, I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT THIS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) I OPEN THE DOOR, AND THERE WERE TWO WOMEN STANDING--  (  LAUGHTER  ) "I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS."
Stephen: WELL, CAROL IT'S SO LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I CAN'T WAIT TO-- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TOGETHER. "THE CAROL BURNETT 50th ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL" AIRS SUNDAY AT 8:00 ON CBS. CAROL BURNETT, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING IDEAL AT BY MY NEXT GUEST FOR OVER 20 YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" LEWIS BLACK. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND?
AAAH, I'M REALLY GOOD.
Stephen: YEAH, WE'LL SEE. I KNOW YOU HAVE THE NEW STAND-UP TOUR, "THE JOKE'S ON US." YOU GOT VINYL OUT OF YOUR LAST COMEDY... CONCERT?
IT'S A DOUBLE ALBUM.
Stephen: DOUBLE ALBUM OFFED WITH LOU.

THANK YOU.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: YOU'RE AN AMERICAN. I'M AN AMERICAN. LET'S TALK ABOUT AMERICAN TRADITIONS. HOW WAS YOUR THANKSGIVING?
I LEAVE THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH!
Stephen: THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE PILGRIMS DID.
YEAH. NO, I GET OUT.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU GO? WHY DO YOU GO, FIRST OF ALL?
I GO BECAUSE ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO, A FRIEND OF MINE AND I WERE HAVING DINNER AT HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE, AND WE REALIZED HIS MOTHER COULDN'T COOK A TURKEY. AND IT WASN'T-- IT WAS TASTELESS. AND IT WAS-- WHY WERE WE DOING THIS? AND MY MOTHER, I HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED YEARS BEFORE THAT, WOULD COOK A TURKEY AND IT WOULD TASTE AS IF IT HAD A MUSCULAR PROBLEM. SO IT WAS, LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
Stephen: SO YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY.
WE LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND GO TO, YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR PORTUGAL.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR THANKSGIVING, LEWIS?
PORK. ALWAYS GOOD FOR A JEW TO DIG INTO A LITTLE PORK.
Stephen: PORTUGUESE PORK. GRILLED OCTOPUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
I HAD SOME OCTOPUS THERE. WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT GOING AWAY, AND ESPECIALLY NOW.
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S-- THERE'S NOTHING BEATS GOING TO A COUNTRY YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE.
Stephen: YEAH.
SO YOU'RE SITTING IN A BEAUTIFUL CAFE. AND NOBODY AROUND YOU. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ANYONE IS SAYING. AND IT'S NO GREATER-- IT'S SERENE, BECAUSE THAT MOMENT IN TIME, THERE ARE NO (BLEEP) ANYWHERE.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING.
YEAH.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF WHICH, LET'S TALK A LITTLE POLITICS FOR A SECOND. ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS? HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE REPUBLICANS' TAX BILL AT ALL? HAS--
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DO-- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?
I THINK IT HELPS US. YOU AND ME.
Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT CASH.
YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH.
SOTHAT MEANS SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE WRONG WITH IT. HERE'S WHY. WE DON'T NEED HELP. A LOT OF PEOPLE NEED HELP. NOT US. SO--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THE TRICKLE DOWN.
OH, YEAH. THAT TRICKLE --
Stephen: TRICKLE DOWN. BUT THIS IS-- THIS IS-- THIS IS MORE TRICKLE DOWN. YOU JUST FILL UP THE TOP BUCKET AND IT TRICKLES DOWN.
YOU WANT TO TEST THAT TRICKLE-DOWN THEORY. DRINK ABOUT 20 BEERS, THEN PEE YOUR PANTS, OKAY? THEN PUT A CUP DOWN HERE.
Stephen: YES
AND STAND AND SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THAT PEE TO FILL UP THAT CUP.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
WE'LL DO IT NEXT WEEK.
Stephen: NOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS ARISING IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. YOU'RE ONE OF THE ELDER STATESMEN OF OUTRAGE. WHAT IS-- WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL OF OUTRAGE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON NOW, WHAT WE'RE FINDING OUT NOW?
I'M JUST KIND OF STUNNED THAT MY GENERATION, WHICH SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE SENSE OF THE-- THE FIRST REAL KICK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WOMEN'S LIBERATION. YOU KNOW, ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW. MY GENERATION KIND OF KNEW THAT AND WAS TALKING ABOUT IT AND DISCUSSING IT. AND IN THE MEANTIME IT WASN'T DEALT WITH. WOMEN DIDN'T GET EQUAL PAY. WOMEN DIDN'T GET-- YOU KNOW, THEY DIDN'T GET (BLEEP). SO AS A RESULT IT ALL GOT PUT ON A BACK BURNER, ALL OF IT. IT ALL GOT THROWN IN THE BACK, YOU KNOW, GOT THROWN ON THE BACK BURNER. AND THEN EVENTUALLY THE STOVE EXPLODED. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW. THE STOVE HAS EXPLODED.
Stephen: IT'S A GREASE FIRE.  ( APPLAUSE ) DON'T THROW WATER ON IT.
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU-- I MEAN, THE THING THEY DON'T GET IS, YOU KNOW, I HAD A TV SHOW FOR ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND WE DID, LIKE, TWO SHORT SEASONS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GET THE ENERGY.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, I FIND THAT AMAZING, TOO.
ISN'T THAT UNBELIEVABLE!
Stephen: THAT IS THE GREATEST THING TO KEEP YOU ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW IS TO WORK HARD ENOUGH. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING SEXUAL, YOU KNOW, MISCONDUCT IN AN OFFICE, I'M LIKE, "YOU SHOULD FIRE THEM JUST FOR NOT BEING BUSY ENOUGH." WHERE DO YOU FIND THE TIME TO DO THAT, TO BE A (BLEEP)?
I DON'T KNOW. THE EXHAUSTION THEY FELT JUST WHEN COMEDY CENTRAL WOULD GIVE ME NOTES, LIKE AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING, ABOUT WHAT WE DID THE DAY BEFORE AND WHAT THE SHOW WAS GOING TO BE. SO BY 10:15, I DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO HAVE SEX. BY THE TIME THEY'RE DONE --
Stephen: BECAUSE NORMALLY 10:15 IS THE TIME-- PERFECT TIME TO HAVE SEX, 10:15.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS WERE HAVING IT-- ANY-- HOW DO YOU-- ALL I CARED ABOUT IS WHEN CAN I GET MY DRINK? THAT WAS ALL I CARED ABOUT. WHEN IS THE DAY OVER AND I CAN, YOU KNOW, KNOCK SOMETHING BACK.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I WISH I HAD SOMETHING FOR YOU RIGHT HERE. YEAH.
YEAH, WELL, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? I DON'T GET IT. I MEAN WHO THE HELLUE CAN MAKE EYE MEAN THE OTHER THING IS THE WHOLE THING ABOUT MASTURBATING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. I MEAN, HOW-- I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO ASK FOR DATES SOMETIMES.
Stephen: I GO TO GREAT LENGTHS SO WOMEN WILL NEVER SEE NAKEDNESS.
I KNOW! YOU KNOW!
Stephen: THERE'S NO PRIDE HERE!  (  LAUGHTER  ) I'D BE WEARING AN OVERCOAT IF THEY WOULD ALLOW ME RIGHT NOW.  ( LAUGHTER ) I'M A 53-YEAR-OLD MAN! THIS IS WHY-- THIS IS WHAT I TELL MY WIFE, WHEN THESE THINGS COME UP WITH MATT LAUER, I GO, "THIS IS WHY I'M NOT FIT. IF I WERE FIT, THIS IS WHAT WOULD BE GOING ON." THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAN IS IN HIS 50s AND HAS A SIX PAG, YOU KNOW SOMETHING (BLEEP) IS WRONG. HIS NEW TOUR IS "THE JOKE'S ON US." THE ALBUM IS "BLACK TO THE FUTURE." LEWIS BLACK, EVERYTHING. LATE SHOW." JOIN ME NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE JOINED BY SARAH PAULSON, MARK HAMILL, AND A PERFORMANCE BY BLEACHERS. GOOD NIGHT!
