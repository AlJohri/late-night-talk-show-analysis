Stephen: GOOD EVENING. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. BEFORE WE BEGIN: A DISCLAIMER AND A  WARNING FOR VIEWERS OF TONIGHT'S EPISODE. DUE TO NEWS EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, TONIGHT'S BROADCAST OF "THE LATE SHOW" CONTAINS GRAPHIC MATERIAL, SPECIFICALLY THE PHRASE: "DONALD TRUMP KISSED VARIOUS WOMEN ON THE MOUTH." (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I'M SORRY. THIS MATERIAL MAY BE UNSUITABLE FOR SOME VIEWERS, INCLUDING CHILDREN, ADULTS AND LIVING CREATURES WITH A MOUTH. ADDITIONALLY, VIEWERS WITH "EYES" SHOULD BE WARNED THAT WE MAY SHOW IMAGES SUCH AS THIS: THIS... OR EVEN THIS. (AUDIENCE REACTS) IT WAS A SLOW YEAR AT THE MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT. AND ONE FINAL DISCLAIMER: THIS SHOW WILL CONTAIN REFERENCES TO THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP MAY BECOME PRESIDENT.  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Announcer: TONIGHT... STEPHEN WELCOMES JASON SUDEIKIS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MICHAEL WEATHERLY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND MEGYN KELLY! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, EVERYBODY! NICE TO SEE YOU UP THERE AND DOWN HERE, EVERYBODY OUT THERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT IS REALLY CRISP. IT'S MAY 16TH, I HOPE EVERYBODY BUNDLED UP. IT WAS 39 DEGREES IN NEW YORK THIS MORNING. I NEARLY FROZE MY MAYPOLE OFF. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE WEATHER HAS GONE INSANE. ALL OVER THE PLANET. DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS FREEZING HERE TODAY, CLIMATE SCIENTISTS SAY THAT APRIL WAS THE HOTTEST MONTH ON RECORD. IT WAS SO HOT, DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO MAKE OUT WITH IT. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MONTH. APRIL'S A TOTAL TEN. TOTAL TEN.
THERE WERE SIGNS THAT GLOBAL WARMING WAS GETTING WORSE FOR A LONG TIME. BACK IN FEBRUARY, INSTEAD OF SEEING HIS SHADOW, THE GROUNDHOG BURST INTO FLAMES. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE GLOBE HAVE BEEN STEADILY CLIMBING FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS. SO IF YOU WERE WONDERING IF YOU SHOULD TURN YOUR JEANS INTO CUT-OFFS... NO. NEVER DO THAT. NO REASON. DOESN'T LOOK AS GOOD AS YOU THINK. AS I WARNED YOU AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW, TONIGHT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S MOUTH. YOU SEE, YESTERDAY'S "NEW YORK TIMES" HAD A 5,000 WORD STORY WITH A FRONT PAGE HEADLINE: "CROSSING THE LINE: TRUMP'S PRIVATE CONDUCT WITH WOMEN," AND THE TIMES EMAILED A NEWS ALERT READING: "SPECIAL REPORT: DONALD TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY UNNERVED WOMEN IN PRIVATE ENCOUNTERS OVER 40 YEARS." UNNERVING WOMEN FOR 40 YEARS? HARD TO BELIEVE. THAT IMPLIES THERE WERE 29 YEARS WHERE HE WAS NOT UNNERVING WOMEN. I'M GOING TO WANT A FACT CHECK. AND LISTEN TO THESE BOMBSHELL REVELATIONS. ACCORDING TO A FORMER MISS USA CONTESTANT, WHEN SHE MET DONALD TRUMP AT THE PAGEANT: "HE KISSED ME DIRECTLY ON THE LIPS. I THOUGHT, 'OH MY GOD, GROSS.'" (LAUGHTER) OKAY. BUT IN FAIRNESS TO MR. TRUMP, HE WAS JUST TRYING TO TURN HIMSELF INTO A PRINCE. PERFECTLY INNOCENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY. ALL RIGHT. IT GOES ON TO DETAIL HOW TRUMP BRAGGED ABOUT HIS SEXUAL PROWESS, AS WELL AS HIS DAUGHTER'S HOTNESS, AND HAD A PREOCCUPATION WITH WOMEN'S BODIES. WHICH MEANS TRUMP COULD BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO APPOINT AN ACTUAL "FEDERAL BIKINI INSPECTOR." (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING, NEW YORK TIMES -- I'M NOT SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP OBJECTIFYING WOMEN FOR 40 YEARS ISN'T A STORY. IT'S JUST BEEN A STORY FOR 40 YEARS. (LAUGHTER) THIS SPECIAL REPORT, NOT THAT SPECIAL. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE BANNER HEADLINE ON THE FRONT PAGE IS RESERVED FOR SOMETHING SURPRISING  LIKE: "IN PRIVATE, DONALD TRUMP MAKES WOMEN COMFORTABLE." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NO ONE SAW THAT COMING! SAID ONE WITNESS, "KEPT EYES UP HERE." (LAUGHTER) THAT'S THE BIG REVELATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE OBVIOUS HEADLINES LIKE: "POPE IS CATHOLIC,"  "BEAR DEFECATION DISCOVERED IN WOODS," AND "BEAUTY PAGEANT OWNER OBJECTIFIES WOMEN." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) IN ACTUAL NEWS, DID YOU SEE THIS FOOTAGE FROM YESTERDAY'S GAME BETWEEN THE TORONTO BLUE JAYS AND TEXAS RANGERS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY. THERE WAS A HUGE FIGHT BETWEEN THE TEAMS. AFTER A HARD SLIDE, TEXAS' SECOND BASEMAN ROUGNED ODOR PUNCHED TORONTO'S JOSE BAUTISTA RIGHT IN THE FACE. OF COURSE, SINCE BAUTISTA'S TEAM IS CANADIAN, HE IMMEDIATELY APOLOGIZED FOR BEING PUNCHED IN THE FACE. IT'S A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE FROM BASEBALL PLAYERS, SINCE THEIR MUSCLES TEND TO ATROPHY WHILE WAITING FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS SHOCKS A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT THIS FIGHT DID NOT SURPRISE ME AT ALL. BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, EVERY TIME I TRIED TO GET TO SECOND BASE, I GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE. YOU KNOW WHAT? HEY, SAY HELLO TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OH, FOLKS. YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION? I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. I CARE ABOUT IT A LOT. YOU LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: WILL BE GOOD TO KNOW WHO'S CALLING THE SHOTS IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. HERE'S SOME BIG NEWS IN THE 2016 ELECTION: PEOPLE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP ARE RUNNING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HILLARY CLINTON IS CURRENTLY BEATING BERNIE SANDERS IN EVERY MEASURABLE CATEGORY -- EXCEPT HOW MANY PEOPLE WOO WHEN YOU SAY THEIR NAME. (LAUGHTER) CHECK IT OUT: "BERNIE SANDERS." (CROWD REACTS) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "HILLARY CLINTON." (CROWD'S LESSER REACTION)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NOT AS BIG, BUT LET'S ADD IN THE SUPERDELEGATES. WOO... IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL. CHECK THE RULES. TO CLOSE THE ENTHUSIASM GAP, THIS WEEKEND, SECRETARY CLINTON UNVEILED HER SECRET WEAPON TO FIX THE ECONOMY.
MY HUSBAND, WHO I'M GOING TO PUT IN CHARGE OF REVITALIZING THE ECONOMY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT.
STEPHEN: YES, HER HUSBAND WILL REVITALIZE THE ECONOMY. NOW WE KNOW WHO THE ARROW ON CLINTON'S LOGO IS POINTING AT. "I'M BACK. HEARINGS WHATHEY, WHAT'S UP? I STILL GOT IT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "I STILL GOT IT... ANYBODY WANT IT?" THINGS WERE PRETTY GOOD UNDER BILL. JUST IMAGINE IF WE COULD BRING BACK THE '90S. TOGETHER, BILL AND HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO GET AMERICA ONLINE WITH A VISION AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL PEPSI. OUR ECONOMY WILL WAKE FROM ITS NAPSTER, TAKE OFF LIKE A WHITE BRONCO, AS THEY CUT OUR TAXES LIKE LORENA BOBBIT, AND CRUSH OUR ENEMIES LIKE NANCY KERRIGAN'S KNEES. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MM-HMM. SO PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE SPIN DOCTORS AND THEIR "YADA YADA" - THE CLINTONS WILL DOUBLE-DARE TO BE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE FAMILY MATTERS, AND TOGETHER, THEY WILL LEAD US INTO THE NEXT WILLENIUM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WITH ANNOUNCEMENTS LIKE THIS, HILARY'S CAMPAIGN MIGHT JUST BE SAVED BY THE BILL, AS LONG AS HE NEVER HAS TO SAY "OOPS, I DID IT AGAIN." (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THERE WAS ANOTHER BIG VOTE THIS WEEKEND: EUROVISION. THANK YOU, EUROPEANS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EUROVISION IS A NO-HOLDS-BARRED MUSICAL THROWDOWN WHERE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES COMPETE TO SEE WHO CAN WRITE THE BEST POP SONG. IT'S THE BIGGEST EUROPE-WIDE CONTEST SINCE THE 14TH CENTURY'S "SO YOU THINK YOU CAN BLACK PLAGUE." (LAUGHTER) NO ONE WON THAT ONE. (LAUGHTER) THE COUNTRIES ARE JUDGED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR SIGNATURE SONG. IT'S CALLED "EUROVISION" -- "EURO", MEANING "EUROPE" AND "VISION," MEANING "SOUND". (LAUGHTER) I IMAGINE WHY IT WOULD BE CALLED THAT. FOR EUROPEANS, THIS IS THE BIGGEST MEDIA EVENT EVERY YEAR. AND THIS WEEKEND, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS 60-YEAR HISTORY, EUROVISION WAS BROADCAST IN AMERICA. SO WE FINALLY SAW AMAZING ACTS LIKE THESE: (SINGING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WOW, THEIR WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW IS REALLY DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS WEEKEND, EVERYTHING CAME TO A HEAD WHEN JAMALA OF UKRAINE WON WITH HER SONG, "1944." ARE YOU READY TO GET DOWN?! AND I MEAN "REALLY" DOWN, BECAUSE THE SONG IS ABOUT STALIN'S MASS DEPORTATION OF THE CRIMEAN TATARS DURING WORLD WAR II.
♪ "WHEN STRANGERS ARE COMING, THEY COME TO YOUR HOUSE ♪ THEY KILL YOU ALL, AND SAY 'WE'RE NOT GUILTY'
STEPHEN: WELL, WE FOUND THE SONG OF THE SUMMER! NOTHING PUMPS UP THE JAM LIKE ETHNIC CLEANSING! (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO CONGRATULATE JAMALA OF UKRAINE AND SAY, "ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS!" BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT - THE ONLY REASON YOU WON EUROVISION IS BECAUSE AMERICA WASN'T IN IT! WHY CAN'T WE COMPETE? WE'RE THE MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRY IN THE WORLD: WE INVENTED THE FRAPPUCINO AND THE G-STRING. WE EAT WAY MORE PIZZA THAN ITALY, AND WE'RE "THIS" CLOSE TO ELECTING BENITO MUSSOLINI. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND WE'RE READY FOR NEXT YEAR'S EUROVISION, BECAUSE I ALREADY FOUND THE ARTIST WHO WILL REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY.

I'M WELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.
Stephen: I SAW YOU POINTING TO JON.
THE OLD BAND.
Stephen: YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING CONNECTION WITH THE BAND WHICH I FOUND OUT RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW TONIGHT.
THAT IS TRUE.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH THE PEOPLE? YOU AND YOUR LOVELY WIFE.
WE WENT TO SEE THEM IN CONCERT LAST APRIL. BEACON --
WEBSTER. LIV WAS NINE MONTHS PREGNANT. IT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT. SOMETIME BETWEEN JON AND "STAY HUMAN"'S SHOW, SHE THOUGHT SHE PEED, HER PANTS. WE FOUND OUT IT WAS A HIND WATER LEAK. HER WATER BROKE BUT JUST ON THE INSIDE. IT WASN'T LIKE YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES. IT WASN'T AN EMERGENCY. NO MOPS NECESSARY. SO BASICALLY, YOUR GUY'S BAND, YOU KNOW THIS, BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT OTIS A LITTLE GUY WAS DANCING IN THE WOMB, AND WE WOULD GO TO ALL THE CONCERTS, BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL YOU GUYS GOT HIM TO MOVING THOSE LITTLE ELBOWS OF HIS, BROKE THE SACK AND WAS BORN THE NEXT NIGHT, 24 HOURS LATER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE A GREAT NAME FOR YOUR NEXT ALBUM "BREAK THE SACK."
AT LEAST AN E.P.
Stephen: YEAH. BESIDES YOU CONNECTED TO THE BAND, WE HAVE A CONNECTION.
SURE.
Stephen: WE CAME UP IN THE CHICAGO IMPROV SCENE. YOU WERE IN SECOND CITY AFTER I WAS.
BUT I SAW YOUR GROUP, YOU AND CORRELL AND AMY.
Stephen: AND PAUL. YEAH, AND WHEN YOU WERE IN SECOND CITY, WHICH IS AN AMAZING THEATER COMPANY OUT OF CHICAGO YOU GET TO DO, IN THE TOURING COMPANY, OLD ARCHIVE SCENES.
Stephen: THEY TOUR HIM AROUND THE THE COUNTRY.

Stephen: DAN AKROYD STUFF. AND I PLAYED --
Stephen: DID YOU PLAY ME? I PLAYED PARTS THAT YOU PLAYED.
Stephen: WOW. HOW CHALLENGES.
IT REALLY IS. A TREMENDOUS RANGE. YOU CAN SING.
Stephen: WHAT THE HELL IS FUNNY ABOUT THIS?
NO, BECAUSE WE GOT TO WATCH THE TAPES!
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. O IF THE WRITER ISN'T FUNNY, YOU ALWAYS ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S THE TRUTH! YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: I HAVE AN ENORMOUS AFFECTION FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY.
IT CATCH US UP TO MINE, FINALLY.
Stephen: CAN I TALK ABOUT ABOUT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE FOR A SECOND? THE ANGRY BIRDS PEOPLE SENT THIS OVER.
IT'S A HAPPY GO LUCKY ISLAND AND I'M AN OUTSIDER, SEAN PENN PLAYS TERRENCE.
Stephen: YOU'RE ACTING WITH SEAN PENN.
EXACTLY. NOT REALLY, BUT YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S ANIMATION. ARE YOU EVER IN A ROOM WITH HIM WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THE MOVIE?
NO, NEVER. MAYBE BY HIS DESIGN, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CLAUSE OF HIS. THE CRAZY THING, I RAN INTO HIM AROUND JANUARY, SHOOTING "LAST MAN ON EARTH" WITH WILL FORTE IN MALIBU. THIS WAS AFTER THE EL CHAPO THING HAPPENED. I WENT OVER AND SHOOK HIS HAND. I SAID, WE WERE IN A MOVIE TOGETHER. THE TWO OF US COMPLAINING, LIKE, IT'S REALLY HARD TO BREATHE AND PRETEND YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND INSIDE A LITTLE TINY BOOTH. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE SEES SOMETHING OVER MY SHOULDER, SAYS, ALL RIGHT, I'M OUT OF HERE, PUTS THE THING, BOLTS AWAY, GOES INTO THE RESTAURANT. HE THOUGHT IT WAS PAPARAZZI. I SAW A CAR FOLLOW HIM THAT HAD SIRENS AND -- I THINK IT WAS THE FEDS FOLLOWING HIM BECAUSE TO HAVE THE EL CHAPO THING.
Stephen: MIGHT BE PUTTING A BAG OVER HIS HEAD AND --
I DON'T KNOW, I GOT NERVOUS. I WAS, LIKE, OKAY, I'M MEETING UP WITH SEAN PENN IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN MALIBU, HAVING A QUICK CONVERSATION, THE POLICE SEE US AND HE BOLTS. I'M RUNNING AROUND WITH OUR LITTLE GUY OTIS, AND I'M, LIKE, THIS MIGHT END UP BEING BAD. NOTHING CAME OF IT. NOT AS OF YET.
Stephen: IF YOU DO GET ARRESTED, LET US KNOW.
YOU GET ONE PHONE CALL, RIGHT? RIGHT.
YOU DON'T MIND.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. ARE YOU KIDDING? IF YOU WERE, LIKE, UNDERNEATH A BELARUS DISCO, THEY TAKE YOU, AND YOU SAY, CAN I CALL COLBERT? THIS WILL WORK.

THESE DONKEYS, THEY'RE EATING ANYTHING. THEY EAT CANS, HUMAN BONES. THEY DON'T GIVE A FLYING FIGURE.
Stephen: VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THE HUMAN BONE THING. PEOPLE ASSUME DONKEYS AREN'T CARNIVORES, BUT THEY ARE.
THEY DON'T EAT THE MEET. THEY ONLY EAT THE BONES.

WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE LIVE TELEVISION?
Stephen: YOU DO LIVE EVERY NIGHT.
I FIND IT EXHILARATING. BEFORE YOU START THE SHOW, IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU TURN INTO A SUPERHERO WHERE YOU BECOME YOUR STRONGESTSELF.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR SUPERPOWER, NAILING DONALD TRUMP?
TOUGH QUESTIONS.
Stephen: OKAY. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE LAST YEAR. I MEAN, IT'S A HUGE YEAR FOR YOU. YOU'RE ALREADY A RESPECTED JOURNALIST BUT YOU'VE BECOME A SORT OF CULTURAL ICON IN THE LAST YEAR PARTLY BECAUSE OF GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH DONALD TRUMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK CULTURAL ICON BEARS WITH IT A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY, LIKE, YOU KNOW, PAPARAZZI IS GOING TO START FOLLOWING ME AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY BORED.
Stephen: REALLY? NOW WE SEE PICTURES OF OURSELVES GOING TO PETCO. (LAUGHTER) WE LEAD FAR TOO BORE AGO LIFE TO BEAR THAT LABEL.
Stephen: WELL, IT WAS LAST AUGUST THAT YOU AND MR. TRUMP HAD A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO WHETHER YOU WERE ASKING FAIR QUESTIONS.
YES, CORRECT.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE SITTING DOWN WITH HIM ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER PEOPLE, LAVERNE COX, MICHAEL DOUGLAS AND ROBERT SHAPIRO IN "MEGYN KELLY PRESENTS." WHY DID YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM?
THAT'S OBVIOUS. I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WANTED TO SEE THAT SIT-DOWN. IT HAD TO HAPPEN AT SOME POINT. IT'S BEEN SUCH A CRAZY YEAR WITH HIM THAT EWE HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE HEART-TO-HEART OVER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON. THEN I CAN HAVE HIM BACK ON "THE KELLY FILES," AND WE CAN HAVE DEBATES LIKE I HAVE WITH ALL THE OTHERS EXCEPT HILLARY CLINTON. I'M COUNTING ON YOU, HILLARY. YOU'RE NEXT. THIS WAS A CHANCE FOR ME TO SIT DOWN, CLEAR THE AIR AND WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO TRUMP ABOUT IS TEMPERAMENT AND THAT'S THE THEME OF THE INTERVIEW YOU WILL SEE TOMORROW NIGHT.
Stephen: HIS TEMPERAMENT AS A LEADER.
YES, AND WITH RESPECT TO WOMEN AND WITH RESPECT, TO SOME EXTENT, TO YOURS TRULY. I HAVE NOT WANTED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT ME, BUT I ASK HIM ABOUT HIS CONDUCT AND ABOUT HIS RESPONSIBILITY, NOW THAT HE HAS GOTTEN SO POWERFUL. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, HE STEPS AWAY FROM THE OVAL OFFICE, WHICH IS SOMETHING I RAISE WITH HIM, AND WHETHER HE APPRECIATES THAT AND THE EFFECT HIS WORDS HAVE ON -- FORGET ME -- ON LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, MEXICANS AND MUSLIMS. WHEN YOU HAVE A MICROPHONE AS BIG AND POWERFUL AS TRUMP'S, WHETHER YOU NEED TO EXERCISE MORE RESTRAINT, AND I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE AUDIENCE TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER HE GETS THAT.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF HIM ADDRESSING THAT.
MOST KIDS BETWEEN AGES 6 AND 16 HAVE BEEN BULLIED AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES. WERE YOU EVER BULLIED?
NO, I WASN'T, BUT I HAVE SEEN BULLYING. AND BULLYING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST AS A CHILD. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE BULLIED WHEN THEY'RE 55 YEARS OLD.
COULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE 45. IT HAPPENS. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET OVER IT, FIGHT BACK, DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO. I HAVE BEEN SAYING DURING IN WHOLE CAMPAIGN I'M A COUNTER-PUNCHER. I RESPOND. SOMETIMES I RESPOND PRETTY STRONGLY. IN JUST ABOUT ALL CASES, I HAVE BEEN RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY DID TO ME.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE? DO YOU THINK THAT HE ONLY RESPONDS, HE ONLY COUNTERPUNCHES OR DOES HE START?
I THINK IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE I THINK HE THOUGHT COMING AFTER ME WAS A COUNTERPUNCH AGAINST ME. I ARGUE AS JOURNALISTS WE ARE THE COUNTERPUNCHES. THE POLITICIANS GET UP THERE, MAKE COMMENTS, OFFER THEIR POLICIES OR CHARACTERS TO BE ASSESSED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEN IT'S OUR JOB TO PUNCH THEM A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE OVAL OFFICE, SO WE HAVE TO ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS, WHICH, IN MY OWN VIEW, DOESN'T MAKE US FAIR GAME FOR, YOU KNOW, A YEAR OF PERSONAL INSULTS, BUT --
Stephen: DID HIS FOLLOWERS COME AFTER YOU, AFTER THE TWO OF YOU WERE SEEN AS ADVERSARIES?
I MEAN, YES, THERE IS NO QUESTION IT'S BEEN A DARK YEAR IN MANY WAYS, BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF SILVER LININGS. I THINK WHEN YOU'RE TESTED LIKE THAT, IT SHOWS YOU WHO YOU ARE AND WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE AND IT WAS DEFINITELY BROUGHT MY HUSBAND AND ME CLOSER TOGETHER. IT HASN'T BEEN ALL BAD. THE OUTSIDE WORLD SAYS, WOW, YOU WERE ON THE COVER OF "VANITY FAIR." YES, I WAS. I WAS IN LOTS OF MAGAZINES AND INCLUDING THE COVER OF SOME EVEN BEFORE DONALD TRUMP. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS, I HAVE WORKED FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE. MY FATHER DIED WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLD. I KNOW YOU HAVE A SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE. I PUT MYSELF THROUGH LAW SCHOOL. I CLAWED MY WAY UP. I WORKED FOR NINE YEARS AS A CORPORATE ATTORNEY TO PAY OFF MY DEBT. I GOT MY OWN JOB PAYING $17,000 A YEAR IN JOURNALISM. I WORKED MY WAY UP TO PRIME TIME FOX NEWS. I HAD THE NUMBER TWO SHOW IN ALL OF CABLE NEWS, AND THEN I HAD AN AUGUST DEBATE WITH DONALD TRUMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT. I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE I WOULD HATE ANYONE TO THINK THAT YOUR SUCCESS IS RELATED TO HIS HOSTILITY TOWARD YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THE SUCCESS YOU HAVE BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK AND YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DO, NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE ATTACKED HER.
I SUBMIT, TOO, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU HANDLE THOSE ATTACKS. PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE AND TRUMP SAID PUBLICLY HE THINKS HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MY SUCCESS.
HE THINKS HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING.
FOR MY SALARY, HE SAID. (LAUGHTER) MY GOAL THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN TO CONDUCT MYSELF WITH DIGNITY AND LIKE A PROFESSIONAL, AND I'M NOT PERFECT, BUT I THINK I CAN CHECK THOSE TWO BOXES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SPECIAL AND PLEASE COME AGAIN. LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
