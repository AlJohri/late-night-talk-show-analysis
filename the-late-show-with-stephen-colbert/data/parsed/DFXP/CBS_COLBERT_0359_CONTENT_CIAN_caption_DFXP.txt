IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JIM GAFFIGAN. ANNA CHLUMSKY. AND LOUIE ANDERSON! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I GOTTA SAY, FIRST OF ALL, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. FIRST OF ALL, IT'SED FROM. HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. IT'S A FRIDAY CROWD. FRIDAY CROWD, CAN'T FAKE IT. NOW, OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT JUST ANY OLD FRIDAY. IT'S THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF DONALD TRUMP'S "INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK." IT'S ALL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS WEEK, RIGHT, INFRASTRUCTURE? YOU KNOW, FIXING OUR OLD BRIDGES AND THEN JUMPING OFF THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU REMEMBER THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, TRUMP PROMISED TO SPEND $1 TRILLION-- THAT'S TRILLION WITH AN "N" ON THE END-- FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT NOW, HE'S CHANGED THAT TO $200 BILLION, WHICH IS 20% OF HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE. SO HE'S ISSUING A SLIGHTLY REVISED HAT THAT JUST SAYS "MAKE!" ( LAUGHTER ) BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BY THE SAME PIERCAGE. MAKE! TRUMP KICKED OFF INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK ON UNDERSTOOD-- WE ALL REMEMBER-- WITH A SPEECH ABOUT PRIVATIZING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, FOLLOWED BY A BIG SIGNING CEREMONY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IT ALL LOOKS VERY OFFICIAL: WHITE GUYS IN SUITS, CHILD-SIZED DESK-- DONE. DONE! AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, PRIVATIZED, RIGHT? WELL, NO, BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT WHAT TRUMP SIGNED WASN'T... WHAT'S THE WORD? ANYTHING. IT'S JUST WHAT'S CALLED A "DECISION MEMO," WHICH IS A WELCOME CHANGE FROM HIS "CONFUSION TWEETS." THAT'S A COOL TRICK, THAT'S A COOL TRICK, MAKING IT OFFICIAL LOOKING. YOU CAN MAKE ANY DECISION SEEM PRESIDENTIAL WAY THAT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'VE GOT MY PENS. I'VE GOT MY THINGS. "I WILL HAVE THE SWEET POTATO FRIES AND A REFILL ON MY MOUNTAIN DEW... D-O-O. SIGNED, DONALD TRUMP." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME PART OF TRUMP'S INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT'S REAL. WHAT ABOUT HIS SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISE, THE WALL? WELL, IN A MEETING OF CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS, TRUMP SAID HE WANTS TO DEFRAY COSTS FOR THE WALL BY COVERING IT IN SOLAR PANELS. YEAH IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE ITS OWN POWER. IT WILL BE THE WORLD'S FIRST SELF-STANDING WALL. MOST WALLS YOU'VE GOT TO PLUG IN OR IT FALLS RIGHT OR OVER. THAT'S WHY THEY PUT THE SOCKET RIGHT ON THE WALL, SO IT CAN PLUG ITSELF INTO ITSELF. HERE'S THE THING I DON'T GET: HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE, SO WHY SOLAR? IS IT JUST A WAY TO GET LIBERALS TO LIKE IT? "I'M MAKING THE WALL SOLAR POWERED AND ORGANIC. ALSO, IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN MAKE THE WALL GAY? JUST TELL ME. GAY WALL, KEEP THE MEXICANS OUT." ( APPLAUSE ) AFTER FLOATING THIS IDEA, TRUMP TOLD LAWMAKERS THEY COULD TALK ABOUT THE SOLAR-PANELED WALL AS LONG AS THEY SAID IT WAS HIS IDEA. DON'T WORRY, CIRC BY THE TIME THE HEARINGS ARE OVER, I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING, "IT WAS ALL HIS IDEA. IT WAS THAT GUY. JUST HIM-- JUST-- JUST..." "IT WAS HIM. IT WAS HIM." ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP ALSO SAID THAT HE THINKS THE WALL COULD BE UP TO 50 FEET HIGH. 50 FEET! I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY IMPOSING, AND THERE'S NO WAY TO GET OVER THAT. UNLESS-- AND THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD EVER HAPPEN-- SOMEONE COMES UP WITH THE 51-FOOT LADDER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MEXICO, THEY'LL NEVER GET THAT TECHNOLOGY. THEY'LL NEVER GET THAT TECHNOLOGY. OF COURSE, THE BIG STORY TODAY IS STILL JAMES COMEY'S SENATE TESTIMONY YESTERDAY. IT WAS ON ALL THE NETWORKS, COMMERCIAL-FREE. I MEAN, NOT ENTIRELY. WE ALL SAW WHAT COMEY WAS WIRING AT THE HEARING. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, COMEY WAS PRETTY ROUGH ON THE PRESIDENT, BUT RIGHT AFTER HIS TESTIMONY, TRUMP SENT HIS LONG-TIME PERSONAL LAWYER AND DEVIL WHO HAS A THING HE WANTS YOU TO SIGN, MARC KASOWITZ. TO RESPOND. AND KASOWITZ STARTED WITH A SIMPLE INTRODUCTION.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M MARC KASOWITZ, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL LAWYER.
Stephen: "AND I AM THE BUSIEST MAN IN THE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVEN'T TAKEN A BATHROOM BREAK IN 27 YEARS. I WILL NOW BLINK OUT MY REAL MESSAGE:  RESCUE ME." KASOWITZ EXPLAINED WHY EVERYTHING COMEY SAID PROVES THE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
CONTRARY TO NUMEROUS, FALSE PRESS ACCOUNTS LEADING UP TO TODAY'S HEARING, MR. COMEY HAS NOW FINALLY CONFIRMED PUBLICLY WHAT HE REPEATEDLY TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP PRIVATELY.
Stephen: "PLEASE SIR, I'D LIKE TO LEAVE THE ROOM NOW." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT EVEN THOUGH EVERYTHING COMEY SAID PROVED TRUMP WASN'T GUILTY, HE WAS ALSO A LIAR.
THE PRESIDENT LIKEWISE NEVER PRESSURED MR. COMEY. THE PRESIDENT ALSO NEVER TOLD MR. COMEY, "I NEED LOYALTY. I EXPECT LOYALTY." HE NEVER SAID IT IN FORM, AND HE NEVER SAID IT IN SUBSTANCE.
Stephen: "HE ALSO NEVER ENTERED THE DRESSING ROOM. WAIT, WHICH TRUMP LAWSUIT AM I IN RIGHT NOW?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'VE SAID TOO MUCH." KASOWITZ FOCUSED ON SHIFTING THE BLAME AWAY FROM TRUMP AND ONTO COMEY.
TODAY, MR. COMEY ADMITTED THAT HE LEAKED TO FRIENDS OF HIS PURPORTED MEMOS OF THOSE PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS.
Stephen, OF COURSE! WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN COMEY WAS A LEAKER. THE SOURCE OF ALL THIS INFO WAS A SHADOWY FIGURE IN A D.C. PARKING GARAGE WHO WENT BY THE NAME "TALL THROAT." ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, KASOWITZ RAN OFF WITHOUT TAKING QUESTIONS. AND ONE REPORTER WITNESSED AN "AWKWARD SCENE AS KASOWITZ TRIED TO ESCAPE WITH NO PRESS QUESTIONS: "HE AND AIDES STOOD IN THE ELEVATOR STARING AT US. FORGOT TO PUSH DOWN BUTTON." SEE YA. SEE YA, SUCKERS. WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YOU, BITE ME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT KASOWITZ MADE UP FOR THAT LITTLE GOOF WITH A BIGGER ONE, BECAUSE WHEN HE EMAILED HIS STATEMENT OUT TO REPORTERS, IT READ, "I AM MARC KASOWITZ, 'PREDISENT' TRUMP'S PERSONAL LAWYER." THE ULTIMATE LEGAL LOOPHOLE: TRUMP WAS NEVER PRESIDENT! HE WAS "PREDISENT" THE ENTIRE TIME! THAT WAY, HE CAN NEVER BE "IMPOOCHED." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, UH-HUH, YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH. HERE'S THE DEAL. HERE'S THE DEAL-- EVEN THOUGH HE'S LEADING TRUMP'S DEFENSE, KASOWITZ DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY OR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. OR THE GOVERNMENT, REALLY. AND, APPARENTLY, TRUMP CAN'T FIND OTHER LAWYERS TO JOIN THE TEAM, BECAUSE SOME OF AMERICA'S TOP LAW FIRMS DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP AS A CLIENT. THAT'S CRAZY. LAW FIRMS ARE NOT KNOWN FOR BOTH PARTICULARLY PICKY ABOUT THEIR CLIENTS. IN FACT, HERE'S A PARTIAL LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAD NO TROUBLE. FINDING A LAWYER: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO PROBLEM! SO, WHY WON'T THESE LAWYERS TAKE TRUMP'S CASE? WELL, ONE SOURCE SAID THEY'RE AFRAID, "THE GUY WON'T PAY, AND HE WON'T LISTEN." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS-- THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING. I DON'T BLAME THESE LAWYERS. I WOULDN'T WANT TO REPRESENT A GUY WHO YOU KNOW IS GOING TO TWEET:  "THE FAKE LAWYERS ARE WORKING SO HARD TO GET ME FREE, BUT I AM GUILTY. #NEVERPAYING." I DID IT. TOTALLY DID IT. BUT IF TRUMP EVER HAS DIFFICULTY FINDING LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN THE FUTURE, OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS ONE FIRM YOU CAN FIND ON YOUR TV THAT HE CAN TURN TO.
HERE AT GALINO & FARNES, WE I HAVE A REPUTATION FOR REPRESENTING ANY CLIENT. >UP TO NOW, ANYONE.
WE HAD TO DRAWT LINE SOMEWHERE. SO IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY AND SUSPECTED OF COLLUSION AND/OR OBSTRUCTION, DON'T CALL US. WE ARE TOO BIZ TOW TAKE YOUR CASE. HERE ARE THE THINGS WE WILL AND POSSIBLY BE TOO BUSY DOING:
SO AS YOU CAN SEE, WE ARE ALL BOOKED UP.
SORRY! THE.
NO.
TAKE OUT THE NUMBER!
TAKE IT DOWN!
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JIM GAFFIGAN IS HERE. ANNA CHLUMSKY IS HERE. LOUIE ANDERSON IS HERE! STICK AROUND! THEY'RE ALL HERE! THEY'RE ALL HERE! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HAY, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE, THAT LOVELY BAND RIGHT THERE. FOLKS, I'M SO EXCITED. I'M SO HAPPY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE STAND-UP COMEDIANS. AND HE'S ABOUT TO RELEASE HIS FIFTH ALBUM: "CINCO." PLEASE WELCOME THE LOVELY AND TALENTED MR. JIM GAFFIGAN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK, STEPHEN.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. WE HAD KIND OF A MANLY KIND OF-- KIND OF A MANLY STILTED HANDSHAKE OVER THERE. I WASN'T SURE WHETHER TO GO IN FOR THE HUG OR NOT. ARE YOU A HUGGER?
I'M NOT AFFECTIONATE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE FIVE CHILDREN, SIR.
I'M TRYING TO RAISE CREATIVE CHILDREN SO I'M WITHDRAWING WHENEVER I CAN, WITHDRAW AFFECTION. I THINK THAT WILL MAKE SOME MUSICIANS. WHAT DO YOU THINK, BAND, WILL IT WORK?
Stephen: A FATHER'S JOB IS TO BE DISTANT, AUTHORITATIVE AND NEVER QUITE PLEASED. THAT'S WAY THE CHILDREN CAN UNDERSTAND GOD.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT ANSWER.
Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR NETFLIX SPECIAL "CINCO."
YES.
Stephen: "CINCO." NOT BECAUSE OF CINCO DE MAYO BUT BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR FIRST.
FIFTH HOUR SPECIAL.
Stephen: NOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN ALBUM, ALSO CALLED "CINCO," RIGHT THERE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
YUP.
Stephen: WHAT-- WHAT IF-- IF I'VE SEEN YOUR NETFLIX SPECIAL AND I LOVED IT.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT AM I GETTING FROM THE ALBUM I DIDN'T GET FROM THE SPECIAL?
WELL, THE ALWUM'S ALL IN SPANISH WHICH I THOUGHT WAS-- NO, THE ALBUM, WE MADE A POINT-- MY WIFE AND I WRITE EVERYTHING TOGETHER, AND WE MADE A POINT OF INCLUDING COMMENTARY TRACKS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL TRACK WHERE WE TALK --
Stephen: IS IT-- BECAUSE IT'S A DOUBLE ALBEM BUM.
SO THERE ARE TWO ALBUM S.
Stephen:  IS IT EVERY OTHER TRACK?
IT'S TWO DIFFERENT ALBUMS. IT'S JUST FOR THE COMEDY NERD THAT'S LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, HE HAS JOKES ON BREAD. WHAT WERE HE AND HIS WIFE THINKING ABOUT?" THERE ARE NO JOKES ON BREAD. THAT'S ON A DIFFERENT ALBUM! THERE ARE COMMENTARY TRACTION, SOME BACKGROUND ON WHAT WE CAME UP WITH, WHAT INSPIRED THE JOKE.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY ON A DVD.
VERY MUCH. AND THERE'S ALSO BONUS-- THERE'S A BONUS TRACK OF MY-- I'M KNOWN AS THIS KIND OF DAD COMEDIAN, BUT MY FIRST STAND-UP, YOU KNOW, SIX MINUTES THAT I DID ON CAROLINE'S COMEDY HOUR WAS ALL MATERIAL ABOUT MY DAD WHERE I MADE FUN OF MY DAD.
Stephen: THAT'S NIECE.
SO I INCLUDED THAT ON THE ALBUM.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. WE TALKED BEFORE. YOU'RE A CATHOLIC. I'M A CATHOLIC.
I'M A CATHOLIC. I'M NOT A GOOD CATHOLIC.
Stephen: ARE THERE-- ARE THERE GOOD CATHOLICS?
WELL, THERE ARE --
Stephen: A GOOD CATHOLIC WOULD NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF A GOOD CATHOLIC.
RIGHT. WELL THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THERE'S NOT A TEST, RIGHT? LIKE, IF THERE WAS A TEST FOR CATHOLICS, NO ONE WOULD PASS.
Stephen: THERE IS, JIM.
THERE IS? ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THERE'S A FINAL EXAM.
THERE IS?
Stephen: THERE'S A FINAL EXAM AT THE END OF IT. "PENCILS DOWN, GENTLEMEN, PENCILS DOWN!"
THAT'S WHAT BEING AN OLD PERSON IS ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHY CHURCH IS FILLED WITH OLD PEOPLE. THEY'RE CRAMMING IN IT AT THE END, RIGHT.
Stephen: CHOOS EXACTLY--
"I'M HERE! I'M HERE! TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR SOME TIME, MAKE UP FOR MY 20s."
Stephen: WE'VE TALKED POPE.
YES.
Stephen: WE'VE TALKED FRANCIS. WE BOTH LIKE FRANCIS.
I LIKE FRANCIS.
Stephen: DID YOU SEE WHEN OUR PRESIDENT WAS RECENTLY ON HIS BRIEF WORLD TOUR THERE, HE STOPPED BY THE VATICAN AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE POPE. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE REACTION?
I THINK OF THE POPE AS SOMEBODY WHO-- WHO IS-- YOU KNOW, HE'S FOCUSE FOCUSED ON MER AND I'VE NEVER SEEN THE POPE LOOK MORE MISERABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S-- I MEAN, YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND YOU HAD TO KISS YOUR AUNT AND SHE HLIKE, FACIAL HAIR? THAT'S WHAT THE POPE KIND OF-- HE LOOKED SAD. BUT HE'S LIKE-- I GUESS HIM BEING NICE TO TRUMP, HE'S LIKE, "MAYBE THIS WILL COUNT AS ONE OF MY MIRACLES." RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW?
Stephen: WELL, YEAH.
YOU KNOW?
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S-- THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE YEAH, BECAUSE MIRACLES-- LIKE IF SOMEBODY BECOMES A SAINT-- LIKE IS JOHN PAUL II A SAINT YET?
I THINK-- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT UP TO ME.
Stephen: I THINK THEY DID. I THINK THEY GAVE-- I THINK THEY FAST TRACKED JOHN PAUL II THROUGH VENERABLE, BLESSED, AND STRAIGHT TO SAINT. AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE, LIKE TWO OR THREE--
YOU NEED TWO MIRACLES.
Stephen: TWO MIRACLES-- ASSOCIATED WITH YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S TWO. IT'S NOT LIKE HALF OF US WOULD BE, "YOU KNOW, IF IT WAS ONE, I'D GO FOR IT, BECAUSE I CAN DO THAT THING WITH MY ELBOW." YOU KNOW? ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF SAINTS, WHERE I LIVE, DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN, IS WHERE THE FIRST AMERICAN SAINT IS BURIED. HIS ST.-- NOW I CAN'T THINK --
Stephen: HE'S ON THE DOORS OF ST. PATRICK'S.
ST. --
Stephen: ELIZABETH ANN SETON IS THE FIRST AMERICAN SAINT.
NO, HE WAS A SLAVE.
Stephen: WHAT?
HE WAS A SLAVE.
Stephen: HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EARLIER THAN HER BUT SHE WAS THE FIRST SAINT. I PROMISE YOU.
HE WAS A SAINT, AND HE WAS A HAIRDRESSER. HE WAS A HAIRDRESSER, AND HE IS AT ST. PATRICK'S CANADA CA NEEDERAL.
Stephen: IT WAS ST. PAUL MITCHELL. ST. VIDAL SASSOON. YOU KNOW WHAT? TWITTER IS GOING TO LET YOU KNOW. BUT HE WAS A HAIRDRESS GLER WE'LL TAKE A BREAK. YOU CAN STICK AROUND FOR ANOTHER THING.
WHEN HOE GOT DONE CUTTING PEOPLE'S HAIR, THEY WERE LIKE, "THIS IS A MIRACLE."
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JIM GAFFIGAN. WE'RE BACK. WE'RE BACK WITH JIM GAFFIGAN. HELP ME OUT HERE, DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE BEARD OR IS THIS A NEW THING?
IF I WANT MY CHILDREN TO NOT BE FRIGHTENED, YEAH. I HAVE THE TYPE OF FACE THAT NEEDS TO BE COVERED. LOUVRE LAUGH.
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. NOT IN THE LEAST.
LAST YEAR I JUST HAD THE MUSTACHE. BUT I HAVE THE BEARD. I LOVE MY BEARD. I LOVE IT. BECAUSE I'M A PALE GUY AND IT'S JUST KIND OF ROUND LIKE A BLOCK.
Stephen: YOUR WHOLE FAMILY, YOU HAVE A LOVELY FAMILY-- THESE ARE YOUR FIVE CHILDREN RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT HOW ALL OF THEM-- ALL OF THEM BLOND, ALL OF THEM-- WHAT ARE YOUR-- WHAT ARE YOUR SUNSCREEN COSTS IN YOUR FAMILY.
THERE'S A LOT. THAT'S HOW WOE STORE THEM, TOO. THAT'S HOW WE STORE OUR CHILDREN.
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND DID YOU JUST TOUR IN JAPAN?
WE WERE IN JAPAN. I-- NOT JUST FOR STAND-UP. I WAS THERE MODELING. I WAS MOD LENGTH. ( LAUGHTER ) SEE, I WISH THAT WASN'T FUNNY, YOU KNOW? I WOULD MUCH PREFER PEOPLE SAY, "REALLY? MODELING IN? BUT PEOPLE SAYING, "YOU MODELING? NEVER." I WAS IN JAPAN. AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, THE JAPANESE-- THEY'RE JUST BETTER AT BEING HUMAN. LET'S JUST BE SERIOUS.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
I MEAN, DESIGN-- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE POLITE. I MEAN, THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS THERE I FELT OVERWEIGHT-- PROBABLY BECAUSE I AM OVERWEIGHT. BUT LIKE THEY'RE GENERALLY-- THE JAPANESE ARE THIN. THERE ARE OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE IN JAPAN, BUT NOT LIKE IN AMERICA. WE'RE BETTER, RIGHT. BECAUSE IF YOU GET REALLY FAT IN JAPAN, THEY MAKE YOU SUMO WRESTLE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY MAKE THEIR FAT PEOPLE FIGHT EACH OTHER. ( LAUGHTER ) TO ENTERTAIN THE THIN PEOPLE! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND THE FAT PEOPLE IN JAPAN GO ALONG WITH IT!
Stephen: IT'S AN HONOR. IT'S A REAL HONOR. THEY WEAR THAT LITTLE DIEPER AND THE HAIR--
THEY'RE LIKE, "WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?" "IT'S PRESTIGIOUS. NOW YOU TRY TO PUSH THAT OTHER PUDGY GUY OUT OF THAT CIRCLE WHILE WE TRY NOT TO GIGGLE."
Stephen: DOES YOUR-- DOES YOUR COMEDY TRANSLATE TO THE JAPANESE?
I'M VERY-- YOU KNOW, I'M VERY AMERICANA, BUT THERE IS --
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SAY "HOT POCKET" IN JAPANESE IS THE QUESTION?
DUMP LING? I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS AMAZING IN JAPAN. AND I-- I'M SUCH A HUGE FAN. AND NOT JUST I LOOK JAPANESE. AND THEY'RE SO POLITE. AND MY CHILDREN-- YOU SAW THEM-- THAT'S THEM BEHAVING WELL, IN A PILE AT THE AIRPORT.
Stephen: OH, OKAY.
MY KIDS ARE HORRIBLY BEHAVED, AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WE WOULD CATCH A JAPANESE PERSON LOOKING AT OUR KIDS. AND THEN THEY WOULD LOOK AT ME. AND I WOULD ALWAYS SAY THE SAME THING, "WE'RE CANADIAN." YOU KNOW?
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
OF COURSE, WE'RE NOT CANADIAN.
Stephen: SURE, YEAH.
BUT THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS DO WHEN THEY TRAVEL INTERNATIONALLY, THEY TELL PEOPLE THEY'RE CANADIAN-- WHICH I THINK IS COWARDLY. THAT'S REQUEST I TELL PEOPLE I'M NORTH KOREAN, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I GET THE RESPECT I DESERVE.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT A LOVELY WIFE. YOU HAVE THE LOVELY KIDS. FATHER'S DAY IS COMING UP. DO YOU HAVE BIG EXPECTATIONS FOR FATHER'S DAY?
NOT REALLY. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE KIDS-- THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) THEY HAVE NOVEMBER MONEY BECAUSE-- AND THEY'LL MAKE STUFF FOR YOU, AND THEN YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "GREAT!" ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, I'M JOKING. BUT IT'S-- IT'S ALL GARBAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU LOOK AT IT AND YOU'RE LIKE, "HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO..." I MEANTIME AMOUNT OF LYING, RIGHT. LIKE THEY GIVE YOU A CARD, AND YOU'RE LIKE, "THIS IS GREAT. CAN I HAVE THIS?" YOU DON'T WANT IT. YOU KNOW. BUT YOU HOLD ON TO IT. AND THEN YOU JUST STUFF IT IN THE GARBAGE. THAT'S HORRIBLE! I DON'T DO IT IN FRONT OF THEM! I WAIT TILL THEY'RE IN THEIR ROOM AND I BRING IN A GARBAGE CAN AND I THROW IT IN THERE. NO, I DON'T DO THAT.
Stephen: YOU'RE-- YOUR WIFE IS ALSO YOUR WRITING PARTNER.
YES.
Stephen: YOU GUYS CREATE YOUR SHOWS TOGETHER. I UNDERSTAND SHE IS RECOVERING NOW FROM A SERIOUS-- SHE HAD A BRAIN TUMOR.
IT WAS INSANE.
Stephen: IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
TWO MONTHS AGO-- YEAH, SHE'S FINE. THEY REMOVED A BRAIN TUMOR. IT WAS DEBENIGN. SHE'S FINE. SHE'S HOME. THE BRAIN TUMOR IS GONE.
Stephen: WAS IT-- WAS IT BIG?
IT WAS-- IT WAS BIG. IT WAS-- IT WAS-- THE BRAIN SURGEON TOLD ME, HE GOES, "IT WAS THE SIZE OF A PEAR" WHICH IS-- WHICH IS HUGE. AGAIN, SHE'S FINE. IT WAS CONFUSION-- I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ALWAYS-- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT MAYBE-- IT'S ALWAYS FRUIT PEARS OR LEMONS. AND I THOUGHT ARE THESE DOCTORS BAD AT ANALOGIES? BUT THENY REALIZED THE SURGEON HE WAS PROBABLY JUST LOOKING AT ME GOING, "I HAVE TO DUMB THIS DOWN FOR THIS GUY. NO WAY THIS GUY UNDERSTANDS CENTIMETERS. HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EAT FRUIT, BUT HE'S PROBABLY-- MAYBE HE'S SEEN A PEAR ON HIS WAY TO BUY ICE CONGRESSMEN, YOU KNOW."
Stephen: I'M GLAD TO HEAR SHE'S FINE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ALBUM. LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. "CINCO: THE ALBUM" IS AVAILABLE TUESDAY. JIM GAFFIGAN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANNA STICK AROUND WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST THIS FRIDAY NIGHT STARS AS ONE OF THE FEW COMPETENT ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STAFFS, OR "VEEP."
THIS IS A BIG DAY, PEOPLE. CAMPAIGN STARTS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE BUDDY CALHOUN THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF A DRY COYOTE TURD OF A STATE.
I LOVE THAT EPITHIEWZASM.

TRACY, HOW ARE WE DOING ON YARD SIGNS.
PLEASE WELCOME ANNA CHLUMSKY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) HELLO! HEY! ♪ WHAT CAN MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY MY GIRL ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU! NICE TO SEE YOU!
Stephen: NOW, LOOK, THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE ON HERE, I DEFINITELY-- YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY WAS A FAN OF "VEEP." NOW I HAVE BECOME A SO... DEPENDENT UPON IT, I LOVE IT SO MUCH. BECAUSE WITH OUR NEW POLITICAL REALITY IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AS CRAZY AS THAT SHOW IS, IT-- IT'S BETTER.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
TIT IS. AND THEY'RE SOMEHOW MORE COMPETENT ON OUR SHOW THAN-- THAN IN REALITY.
Stephen: THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF AFFECTION, ALSO. WHILE ALL THE CHARACTERS ON THE SHOW ARE INCREDIBLY SELFISH.
YEAH. YOU STILL ROOT FOR THEM, WRARS I DON'T THINK YOU ROOT FOR ANYBODY...
Stephen: THE INSULTS THAT YOU HURL AT EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.
YES.
Stephen: DOES THAT BLEED OVER INTO YOUR REAL LIFE, LIKE IN THE CAST? BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD, THAT THEY ALMOST SEEM AFFECTIONATE.
WELL, THERE IS-- WE HAVE AN AFFECTIONATE KIND OF REFRAIN THAT WE HAVE EVERY TIME DEAR MATT WALSH KIND OF ACTS LIKE HIS CHARACTER IN REAL LIFE.
Stephen: SO YOU OFF CAMERA.
SO OFF CAMERA-- SORRY, MATT, IF I'M BLOWING UP YOUR SPOT, AS THEY SAY. BUT, YEAH, LIKE HE'S LIKE SET HIMSELF ON FIRE BEFORE. AND, LIKE --
Stephen: MATT WALSH THE MAN, NOT THE ACTOR, HAS SET HIMSELF ON FIRE?
YES, YOU KNOW, WE USED TO FILM IN BALTIMORE AND IT WAS FREEZING SO THEY HAD, LIKE, A PROPANE HEATER AND HE JUST STOOD TOO CLOSE TO IT-- ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVE NOT TOLD HIM I'M TELLING THIS STORY.
Stephen: MATT PLAYS THE INCREDIBLY INCOMPETENT PRESS, IS THE SPEECHWRITER.
YES. BUT HE ALWAYS HAS FOOD ON HIM. SO EVERY TIME SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS JULIA IS LIKE, "CLASSIC MIKE." SO "CLASSIC MIKE" IS OUR MEANEST REFRAIN AS CAST MEMBER S.
Stephen:  IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR INSULT THAT YOU'VE HURLED AT EACH OTHER THAT YOU LIKE? IS THERE A FAVORITE ONE?
MY FAVORITE IS WHEN SHE SAID, "I FEEL LIKE I'M ON LIFE SUPPORT AND EVERYBODY KEEPS PULLING THE PLUG TO CHARGE THEIR PHONES." ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE, THAT --
Stephen: YES.
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO APT.
Stephen: YES, THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. YOU'VE WRAPPED FOR THE SEASON.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS-- I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A TRADITION AT THE END OF EACH SEASON THAT YOU STARTED.
YEAH, I WENT AND DID THIS. MY-- YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF GOVERNMENT OFFICES, CARRIED OVER FROM A MILITARY TRADITION, MANY OFFICIALS IN GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE A CHALLENGE COIN THAT IS FROM THEIR OFFICE. AND THAT'S OFTEN SOMETHING THAT THEY GIVE TO PEOPLE. SO I STARTED HAVING CHALLENGE COINS MADE AS IF THEY WERE AMY'S CHALLENGE COIN.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.
Stephen: OH,.
SO, YOU KNOW, AND --
Stephen: DO IT LIKE THIS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: AND DON'T LOOK AT IT, JUST HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND.
LOOK AT IT!
Stephen: CELINA MIRE, THE CHARACTER OF JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, LIBRARY AND BIRTH PLACE, BECAUSE SHE'S NO LONGER PRESIDENT.
NOTICE THERE'S ONLY ONE STAR BECAUSE ONLY ONE TERM.
Stephen: OH, ONE TERM. EIGHT MONTHS OR SOMETHING. AND IT SAYS, "PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES." THAT'S VERY SWEET. YOU CAN SEE THAT? "PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 'VEEP' SEASON SIX." MAY I KEEP THIS?
YES. WE HAVE ONE FOR EACH SEASON.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME WE SAW EACH OTHER YOU WERE MASSIVELY PREGNANT.
YES, YES.
Stephen: YOU ALMOST GAVE BIRTH HERE. THIS IS YOUR SECOND CHILD, RIGHT?
YES, YES.
Stephen: SO WHAT'S IT LIKE GOING FROM ONE TO TWO? IT'S NOT MAN-TO-MAN DEFENSE.
IT IS AND THAT IS SO HELPFUL, YOU KNOW. THE THOUGHT OF ANY MORE IS-- IS TERRIFYING BECAUSE THEN YOU'D BE OUT-MANNED.
Stephen: HAVE TO GO TO A ZONE AFTER THAT.
YEAH. AND, YEAH, SO I DON'T KNOW. LOVE IS ABUNDANT, BUT ATTENTION ISN'T.
Stephen: SURE, SURE. ARE THEY WINNING AT THIS POINT, THE TWO OF THEM?
WELL, I THINK SO. EXCEPT I FIND-- I FIND THAT I'M FALLING ASLEEP IN THE STRANGEST PLACES. I-- I HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP-- I FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF DIM SUMMIT OTHER DAY WITH OUR COUSINS. I FELL ASLEEP RECORDING WHAT WE CALL A.D.R.--
Stephen: YOU ARE IN THE BOOTH RECORDING AGAINST THE SCREEN.
AND I FELL ASLEEP.
Stephen: ON A MICROPHONE. BECAUSE IT'S DARK IN THERE AND QUIET?
AND IT WAS, "BEEP, BEEP, BEEP." AND I HEARD THE BEEPING. AND THEN I HEARD THEM SAY, "OKAY, ANA, DO YOU WANT TO TRY THAT AGAIN?" BECAUSE I FELL ASLEEP STANDING.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE BETWEEN THE TWO?
THREE YEARS.
Stephen: BOYS, GIRLS.
GLIRLZ HAS THE EARLIER GIRL SAID OF THE YOUNGER GIRL,"SEND HER BACK," OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
NO, I'VE BEEN-- I-- I-- I DON'T. I'VE DRAWN A REALLY LUCKY STICK BECAUSE SHE'S IN LOVE WITH HER. LIKE, SHE-- YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? THEY SHARE A ROOM. SHE'S GOT A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE BECAUSE YOU KNOW, SHE'S BEHIND BARS IN HER CRIB. SO IT'S JUST LIKE, "I'M GOING TO READ AND ACT LIKE A MERMAID AND SING ALL OF MY LITTLE OPERAS TO YOU." AND YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH.
Stephen: DOES SHE TREAT HER LIKE A DOLL, DRESS HER UP AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
SHE HASN'T TRIED TO DRESS HER UP. BUT IT'S HER BABY. IT'S "OUR BABY" AND "MY BABY." SHE'S THRILLED WITH HER. YEAH, SHE REALLY IS CRAZY ABOUT HER. IT'S AWESOME. IT WON'T LAST BUT --
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A SISTER? DO YOU HAVE A SISTER?
NO, I DON'T. I HAVE A HALF-BROTHER. HE'S 14 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME SO HE WAS LIKE MY PRACTICE KID, I ALWAYS SAY. BUT, YEAH, I LOVE HIM TO DEATH. BUT WE DIDN'T GROW UP IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD SO THIS IS NEW TO ME WATCHING THIS SIBLING STUFF.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK. THEY ARE SMALL BUT RELEAPTLESS OPPONENTS.
YES, FOREVER.
Stephen: LOVE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: "VEEP" AIRS SUNDAYS ON HBO. ANNA CHLUMSKY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH STAND-UP FROM LOUIE ANDERSON. STICK AROUND. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT WON AN EMMA FOR PLAYING ZACH GALIFIANKIS' MOTHER ON "BASKETS," BUT HE IS BEST KNOWN FOR THE STAND-UP HE'S BEEN DOING ON LATE-NIGHT TV SHOWS LIKE THIS FOR OVER 30 YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME LOUIE ANDERSON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HI, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! OH! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY, HUH? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I ALMOST WENT FOR A WALK! ( LAUGHTER ) I CAME THIS CLOSE... I WANT TO BE MORE HEALTHY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T-- PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME, WE DON'T LAY IN BED ALL DAY AND EAT. YOU KNOW, IT JUST HAPPENS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF YOU EAT HEALTHY YOU NEED A HEALTHY FRIEND. I HAVE A HEALTHY FRIEND, AND SHE SAYS TO ME, "LOUIE, I'M GOING TO TURN YOU AROUND!" "WELL, YOU BETTER BRING ANOTHER PERSON." AND WHEN YOU GO TO EAT WITH SOMEONE HEALTHY, WELL, IT'S NOT EASY. BECAUSE SOMEBODY AT THE TABLE NEXT TO YOU HAS SOMETHING, AND YOU SMELL IT. ( SNIFFS ) WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S BANG, BANG SHRIMP? OH, MY GOD! CAN I GET A BANG, BANG SALAD? AND, YOU KNOW, I AM-- I AM. I'VE EATEN EVERY BAD THING, EVERY BAD THING I'VE EATEN. SO NOW I LOOK AT THE HEALTHY SIDE OF THE MENU. WHAT'S ON HERE. SALMON. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY. I ALWAYS WANT TO SAY TO THE SERVER, "YOU GOT ANYTHING LESS FISHY? YOU GOT ANY PORK THAT SWIMS? YOU GOT ANY SPAMON? THE ONLY TIME I WANT TO EAT SALMON IS WHEN I'M WATCHING THE ANIMAL PLANET AND A GRISLY PLUGS ONE FROM A STREAM. I THINK TO MYSELF, "I SHOULD GIVE SALMON ANOTHER TRY." ( LAUGHTER ) "HE MAKES IT LOOK SO DELICIOUS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YES. IT DOES. THANK YOU. YEAH. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THE SERVER, POOR SERVER WHEN YOU'RE WITH A HEALTHY PERSON. THEY JUST CROSS-EXAMINE THEM. "IS IT FREE RANGE CHICKEN?" WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? "IT MEANS THEY GET TO RUN FREE, LOUIE!" "BEFORE THEY KILL THEM?" ( LAUGHTER ) THAT SEEMS CRUELER TO ME! THE CHICKENS IN THE COOP ARE TRYING TO WARN HER, "YOU'RE LIVING A LIE, BETTY!" ( LAUGHTER ) "YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE I'M FREE RANGE!" ( LAUGHTER ) "THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU, BETTY!" "YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS OF ME. I'M FREE RANGE!" ( LAUGHTER ) BANG-BANG! "OH, I TRIED TO WARN HER! BETTY!" ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: LOUIE ANDERSON, EVERYBODY! COME ON OVER. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU. HI, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU.
WHAT A GREAT SHOW.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen:  LISTEN, AS I SAID, YOU'VE BEEN DOING STAND-UP ON SHOWS LIKE THIS FOR 30 YEARS. YOU'VE BEEN A STAND-UP COMEC TRAVELING AROUND FOR 40 YEARS NOW. DO YOU THINK STAND-UPS-- BECAUSE YOU PLAY IN SO MANY DIFFERENT TOWNS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES-- DO YOU THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THE COUNTRY BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE?
I THINK SO, A LITTLE BIT. OR AT LEAST YOU SEE IT ALL. LIKE, YOU KNOW, I WENT TO OREGON, OR OR-GONE-- I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU SAY IT. YOU GET CORRECTED UP THERE. OR-GONE, OREGON. THAT'S WHAT I SAID! IT'S NICE TO STAY UP THERE BECAUSE YOU STAY IN A HOTEL WHERE YOU CAN HUNT FROM THE WINDOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I GOT-- I GOT MY LIMIT, "TWO TOURISTS, SO... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DO YOU SEE ANY IMPRESSIVE THINGS? WHEN I WAS A YOUNGER CAT, WE WOULD TOUR AROUND THE UNITED STATES.
AND LOVED-- "OH, THERE'S THE WORLD'S LARGEST LIGHTHOUSE BY A TOWER."
IT'S TRUE. Y WENT TO SAN ANTONIO. I SAW THE ALAMO.
Stephen: THAT'S COOL.
YEAH ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S COOL.
AND, YOU KNOW, MRS. SERKS RZIK IN THIRD GRADE MADE THAT THING SEEM HUGE. BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU GO, "OH! IS THAT IT? I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD HAVE HELD THIS FAIR COUPLE OF DAYS." I ALWAYS CARRY A STEAK KNIFE WITH ME. BUT IT'S TRUE. AND, OF COURSE, I WENT TO BOSTON, AND, YOU KNOW, THE GUY DRIVING ME SAID WE'RE ON THE ROAD WHERE PAUL REVERE RODE. "THAT'S GOOD." "THAT'S GOOD. I BETTER HE WAS GOING FASTER THAN WE ARE IN THIS TRAFFIC. OF." "DO YOU SEE A LANTERN UP AHEAD?"
Stephen: WE'RE ON "BASKETS." YOU PLAY ZACH GALIFIANKIS' MOM. YOU WON AN EMMY FOR IT THIS PAST YEAR.  YEAR.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND YOU HAVE A LOVELY-- VERY BELIEVABLE, YOU KNOW, MOTHERLY QUALITY WITH HIM ON THE SHOW. DO YOU-- DO YOU EXHIBIT THAT SAME RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM OFF CAMERA, TOO?
WELL, I'M A MATERNAL PERSON ANYWAYS. THAT'S A LITTLE OFF RIGHT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I-- SO-- ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S' GOOD AUDIENCE. GOOD AUDIENCE.
Stephen: THEY'RE GOOD. PAYING ATTENTION
I WAS GOING TO DO THIS, BUT IT'S 2017. NO ONE WANTS THEIR-- YOUR SPIT ON THEM. NOBODY. EVEN YOUR MOM. "MOM!" BUT, YES, I AM. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I'LL WAKE UP BEHIND HIM AND PUSH HIS HAIR BACK AND STUFF. HE'S HEEL GO, "WHAT THE...?" "I'M YOUR MOTHER!" I SAY, "DID YOU EAT ENOUGH TODAY? DO YOU FEEL GOOD? DID YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM?" ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HE'S A LOVELY PERSON POWORK WITH. AND I REALLY DO, I FEEL-- I DON'T LET ANYONE CALL ME LOUIE ON THE SET. I MAKE THEM CALL ME CHRISTINE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU HAVE A LOVELY MATERNAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM ON THE SHOW. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF I THINK-- I THINK ZACH HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR SOME REASON.
YEAH, I'M THERE TO BAIL HIM OUT.
Stephen: JIM.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO GET IN HERE?
MOM, IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS TRESPASSING AND MISCHIEF, I THINK.
MISCHIEF?
MISCHIEF, YEAH, GENERAL MISCHIEF.

WERE YOU CHASING A MOUSE AROUND? JIM, IS IT BECAUSE I SENT YOUR FRENCH WIFE AWAY?
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU, MOM. I'M A MILLENNIAL.
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S A FUN SHOW.
