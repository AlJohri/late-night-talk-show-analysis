Stephen: HEY, SENATOR WARREN! THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT TRUMP'S SPEECH.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: I HAVE TO ASK -- ANY CHANCE I CAN ANNOUNCE ON MY SHOW TONIGHT THAT YOU ARE HILLARY'S PICK FOR VICE PRESIDENT? THAT WOULD BE PRETTY HUGE NEWS FOR ME TO BREAK!
STEPHEN, I THINK IF IT WERE ME, I'D PROBABLY KNOW BY NOW, SO PROBABLY NOT. BUT SHE HAS A LOT OF GREAT OICES, AND I'M ROOKING FORWARDY' - I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEENEWS WHO SHE PICKS.
Stephen: FAIR ENOUGH. HAD TO ASK. HAVE A GREAT SHOW. SEE YOU OUT THERE.
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

Stephen: THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FEELS GOOD! WOW! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK YOU ALL FOR STAYING UP. INTO THE WEEKEND, AT THIS POINT. DO A LIVE SHOW, THEY SAID. IT'S IMPORTANT, THEY SAID. ELL, IT'S THE FINAL NIGHT OFEND, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND LO, IT HAS COME TO PASS. A DAY LONG FORETOLD -- THE TRUMPENING. (LAUGHTER) TONIGHT WAS A HISTORIC MOMENT UNITING AMERICA'S POLITICAL SYSTEM, ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX AND SELF-TANNER INDUSTRY. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL ALL REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE GOT TOO DRUNK TO REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE. THE EVENING WAS KICKED OFF BY R.N.C. CHAIRMAN REINCE PRIEBUS, WHO REMINDED VIEWERS OF AN ESSENTIAL AMERICAN TRUTH.RE
LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IS MORE THAN JUST A SLOGAN ON A BUMPER STICKER.
Stephen: YES, IT'S MORE -- I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER SEEN IT ON A BUMPER STICKER. I THINK THE BUMPER STICKER IS LIFE, LIBERTY, GRASS OR ASS. NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HOW YOU GUYS DOING? GOOD?
Jon: YEAH, GOOD.
Stephen: VERY EXCITING. OF COURSE, TONIGHT'S MAIN EVENT WAS TRUMP'S ACCEPTANCE SHOUT. G THE BIGGEST, MOST FABULOUS, LUXURIOUS 5-STAR DIAMOND ADMIRAL CLASS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH IN THE HISTORY OF TALKING. OVERALL TAKEAWAY -- GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS -- GOOD NEWS, AMERICA IS STILL A SHINING CITY. BAD NEWS, JUST RAGING DUMPSTER FIRES SET BY RAGING BARBARIANS COMING TO KILL US ALL. (LAUGHTER) AND RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, HE MADE A BOLD PROMISE.
HERE, AT OUR CONVENTION, THERE WILL BE NO LIES.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. FAIR ENOUGH. (LAUGHTER) LET'S CHECK ON THAT.
I HUMBLY --
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THERE'S ONE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NO! SORRY. THAT IS A FOUL BALL. AND TRUMP WASTED NO TIME TAKING A SWIPE AT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW A RED LINE IN SYRIA, AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW IT MEANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.ED
Stephen: OH, PLEASE, THAT IS -- ACTUALLY PRETTY ACCURATE. OKAY, ONE FOR TEAM ORANGE. GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM. NOW, TRUMP PAINTED HIMSELF AS AN UNDERDOG OPPOSED BY A CROOKED SYSTEM.
BIG BUSINESS, ELITE MEDIA AND MAJOR DONORS ARE LINING UP BEHIND THE CAMPAIGN OF MY OPPONENT.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. THEY HAVE. AND BECAUSE A LOT OF COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH A CONTROVERSIAL CANDIDATE LIKE TRUMP, THE CONVENTION LOST SPONSORS LIKE ORD, UPS, AND JP MORGAN CHASE.D  BUT ONE COMPANY STOOD BY THEAS REPUBLICANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR CANDIDATE. "ROBINSON'S TURD POLISH" -- THEIR SLOGAN:  IT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT, SO MAKE IT SHINY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S A TURD YOU CAN SEE YOUR FACE IN. (LAUGHTER) AND TRUMP HAMMERED DEMOCRATS FOR BEING DECEPTIVE CORPORATE CRONIES.
SO IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE CORPORATE SPIN, THE CAREFULLY-CRAFTED LIES AND THE MEDIA MYTHS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING THEIR CONVENTION NEXT WEEK. Y
Stephen: BUT IF YOU WANT HASTILY-ASSEMBLED LIES AND NO CORPORATE SPONSORS, YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen:TADA! I GOT THE HIPS. GOT THE HIPS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DONALD DID NOT DO THAT AT ANY POINT, I HAVE TO BE HONEST. HE DIDN'T DO THIS. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP'S CORE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR -- HILLARY CLINTON BAD.
HILLARY CLINTON IS PROPOSING MASS AMNESTY, MASS IMMIGRATION, AND MASS LAWLESSNESS. MY OPPONENT WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. HILLARY CLINTON'S MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS WILL NEVER CHANGE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT -- SHE'S GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING AND NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE! MAKE UP YOUR MIND, HILLARY! AMERICA NEEDS TO KNOW WHY IT HATES YOU SO MUCH!NG (APPLAUSE) SPEAKING OF WHICH, TRUMP HAD A STRONG MESSAGE TO WIN OVER NEW SUPPORTERS.
I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST OURCH CITIZENS, JUST LIKE IT WAS RIGGED AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS. HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE. BUT HIS SUPPORTERS WILL JOIN OUR MOVEMENT.
Stephen: OH, YEAH. IT'S TRUE. MAKES SENSE. IF HIS SUPPORTERS CAN'T HAVE BERNIE, THEY'LL GO TO TRUMP. KINDA LIKE IF YOU ASK FOR A COKE, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE IT, YOU SAY, "THEN JUST FILL MY MOUTH WITH BEES." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, TRUMP KNOWS THAT WHEN OU'RE GIVING THE BIGGEST SPEECH) OF YOUR LIFE, YOU GOTTA PLAY THE HITS.
I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A GREAT BORDER WALL.
Stephen: WHOO! WHOO! WHOO, WHOO! DO "CROOKED HILLARY." WHOO! DO "I PREFER SOLDIERS WHO DON'T GET CAPTURED!" DO "CHI-NYA." CHI-NYA! THAT IS WAY TOO HOT TO PUT IN MY POCKET RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. NEAR THE END, TRUMP TURNED REFLECTIVE.
MY DAD, FRED TRUMP, WAS THE SMARTEST AND HARDEST WORKING MAN I EVER KNEW. I WONDER SOMETIMES WHAT HE WOULD SAY IF HE WERE HERE TO SEE THIS TONIGHT.
Stephen: I THINK HE'D SAY, I'M PROUD OF YOU. ALSO, "HOW IS THAT YOUR HAIR? YOU WERE BALDING WHEN YOU WERE TWENTY ." (LAUGHTER) DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. (APPLAUSE) IT WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE. I GOT TO GIVE THAT TO HIM. REALLY FIRED UP THE ROOM AND FINALLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION, WHAT IF FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER WAS IN CHARGE OF THE ANGRY MOB? FINALLY, WAS THE SPEECH ANGRY AND FILLED WITH DISTORTIONS? SURE. BUT THE SONG THEY CHOSE TO PLAY AT THE END WAS A REFRESHING BIT OF HONESTLY. ♪ YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT ♪ T
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! STICK AROUND! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT ♪
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! STICK AROUND! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOO! HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, AS FUN AS IT IS TO WATCH AND TALK ABOUT THE CONVENTION, THERE IS A LITTLE NON-CONVENTION NEWS OUT THERE. TODAY, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT FOX NEWS C.E.O. ROGER AILES, WHO WAS ACCUSED OF REPEATED SEXUAL HARASSMENT, HAS RESIGNED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE RESIGNATION COMES ON THE HEELS OF A FOX NEWS INTERNAL PROBE. (LAUGHTER) INTERNAL PROBE, BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S ACCUSED OF ASKING FOR. NOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT, ALTHOUGH I SPENT WELL OVER A DECADE MAKING FUN OF HIS NETWORK AND HIM AND THE DAMAGE I THINK HE DID TO THE WORLD, THE NEWS OF THIS MAN LOSING HIS JOB GIVES ME NO PLEASURE. (LAUGHTER) JIMMY, CAN WE GET THE CAMERA OFF ME FOR A SECOND? (CHEERING) IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEONE I COULD SHARE THIS LACK OF PLEASURE WITH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: OH, JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NORMALLY THIS TIME OF NIGHT, I'M JUST SLEEPING.
Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW ROGER AILES HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
OH, I MIGHT HAVE READ SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: WELL, HE STEPPED DOWN TODAY.
HUH. JIMMY, CAN YOU TAKE THE CAMERA OFF ME FOR A SECOND? (CHEERING)
Stephen: SO THANKS FOR STOPPING BY. IS THERE SOMETHING I COULD HELP YOU WITH?
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD JUST MAYBE TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION FOR A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: OF COURSE. WELL, I'M GONNA JUST NEED THE -- YOUR DESK.
Stephen: WANT TO SIT HERE? YEAH. (CHEERING)
Stephen: REALLY NICE DOWN HERE.T'S BEEN A WHILE.
Stephen: ACTUALLY -- OH, RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO DO. THIS (CHEERING)
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. GOES RIGHT ON THE HAIR.
Stephen: HAVE A GOOD TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AH, THANK YOU. WELL, THE CONVENTION'S OVER. AND THE REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO DEFENSE HE SAID IVANKA WAS GOING PEAK BUT THIS ANGRY GUY CAMEON'S OUT AND VOMITED ON EVERYBODY FOR AN HOUR. THE REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR PLAN FOR AMERICA. JAIL THEIR POTENTIAL OPPONENT. INJECT RUDY GIULIANI WITH A SPEEDBALL-AND-RED-BULL ENEMA, AND SPEND THE REST OF THE TIME SCARING THE HOLY BEJESUS OUT OF EVERYBODY.  I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT.TIME ME, I'M JUST GONNA ENJOY WATCHING THE GYMNASTICS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM.LY THAT WILL BE THE CONTORTIONS MANY CONSERVATIVES WILL HAVE TO DO TO EMBRACE DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WHO EMBODIES ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE FOR YEARS SAID THEY'VE HATED ABOUT BARACK OBAMA.
MOST INEXPERIENCED NOMINEE TO EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENTS IN HISTORY.
NOTORIOUSLY THIN-SKINNED. STRAIGHTFORWARDLY AUTHORITARIAN.
A RAGING NARCISSIST WHO HAS NO GRIP ON REALITY.RC (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
A THIN-SKINNED NARCISSIST. NO GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE. YES, THAT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE -- BARACK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) SO RIGHT WING MEDIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, NOW, JUSTIFYING THIS CHOICE. CAN THEY MAKE THE TURN? THEY ALREADY ARE. LET'S TRACE THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE EYES OF ONE OF THEIR MOST TALENTED GYMNASTS. HIS NAME ESCAPES ME, SO LET'S REFER TO HIM AS LUMPY. (LAUGHTER) HI, LUMPY. FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S HOW LUMPY FELT ABOUT BARACK OBAMA'S DIVISIVENESS.
THIS PRESIDENT IS THE MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. DIVIDED ALONG RACIAL LINES, RICH VERSUS POOR, BLACK VERSUS WHITE, OLD VERSUS YOUNG.
CATS VS. DOGS, BATMAN VS. SUPERMAN. THE ONE VS. THESE OTHER TWO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR A WHILE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, ACTUALLY. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU DON'T LIKE DIVISIVENESS, WHAT ABOUT TRUMP SUGGESTING MEXICO IS SENDING US THEIR RAPISTS? IF YOU DON'T LIKE DIVISIVE RHETORIC, THEN --
PERHAPS INARTICULATE, BUT HE DID SAY, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. HE DIDN'T SAY ALL MEXICANS.
AND CINCO DE MAYO! HE HAD THE TRUMP TOWER TACO BOWL! THAT IS ONE OF THE HEALINGEST MEALS ON THE TRUMP TOWER MENU. LOOK, I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON RACIAL UNITY, BUT SOME OF OUR MORE NOTED HISTORICAL LEADERS IN THAT AREA DID RETWEET WHITE SUPREMACISTS LESS. LESS THAN TRUMP. SO I BELIEVE -- I'M JUST SAYIN'. (LAUGHTER) THEN THERE WAS THE OBAMA CRONY THAT LUMPY COULDN'T STAND. HIS OLD FRIEND TELEPROMPTY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE CAN'T READ A SENTENCE WITHOUT A TELEPROMPTER. HE SLEEPS WITH THE DARN THING.
YEAH, HE PROBABLY SLEEPS WITH THE DAMN THING. AND THEN PROBABLY DOESN'T CALL IT THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SAY ON THE TELEPROMPTER,  TO CALL! (LAUGHTER) LUMPY, YOUR 180, PLEASE.
WE'VE SEEN HIM GIVING A SERIES OF POLICY SPEECHES, USING A TELEPROMPTER, STAYING ON MESSAGE, REALLY WELL DONE FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. Y
YOU HATE TELEPROMPTERS! YOU'RE SAYING NOW TELEPROMPTERS ARE FOR STUPID PEOPLE! AND I THOUGHT TRUMP HANDLED IT PRETTY GOOD. (LAUGHTER) BUT INEXPERIENCE ASIDE, DIVISIVENESS AIDE, THE WORST THING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA IS HIS ELITISM.
BARACK OBAMA IS ANYTHING BUT MAINSTREAM. SITTING IN HIS MILLION-DOLLAR HOME, CLAIMING TO BE FOR THE PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO WONDER HOW IN TOUCH HE IS WITH THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. TAKE A LOOK AT HIM ORDERING HIS BURGER WITH A VERY SPECIAL CONDIMENT. DIJON MUSTARD?AM. I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THAT FANCY BURGER, MR. PRESIDENT.
YEAH, YOU PROBABLY EAT THE BURGER WITH YOUR MOUTH, INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE A REAL AMERICAN AND HAVING A MAGNUM FIRE IT UP YOUR ASS, LIKE THEY SERVE 'EM AT ARBY'S! THAT'S HOW THEY SERVE THEM AT ARBY'S, THEY SHOOT THEM RIGHT UP YOUR ASS. MEAN WHILE, HERE'S HOW LUMPYAT FEELS ABOUT THE GUY WHO SITS IN A LITERAL GOLDEN THRONE AT THE TOP OF A GOLDEN TOWER WITH HIS NAME IN GOLD LETTERS AT THE TOP OF IT, EATING PIZZA WITH A KNIFE AND FORK. OW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT GUY?DE
I THOUGHT ONE OF THE MORE FASCINATING DESCRIPTIONS OF YOUR DAD CAME FROM YOU. YOU ONCE CALLED HIM ON MY SHOW A BLUE COLLAR BILLIONAIRE. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S NOT A THING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT? PLEASE -- IT IS TRUE. TRUMP SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY YOU'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND OWN A FLEET OF AIRPLANES WITH. LOOK, ALL THAT STUFF IS SUPERFICIAL. AND I'M SURE IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT ETHICS OR PRINCIPLES TO EMBRACE SOMEONE WHO EMBODIES EVERYTHING THEY SAID THEY HATED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE. AND THAT'S WHERE LUMPY AND FRIENDS HAVE FOUND THE PRESIDENT LACKING.
WHO SITS IN THE PEWS OF JEREMIAH "GD AMERICA" AND "AMERICA'S CHICKENS HAVE COME HOME TO ROOST" AFTER 9/11? IS THAT A CHRISTIAN CHURCH TO YOU? HE SAYS HE'S A CHRISTIAN. I'M A CHRISTIAN. I WOULDN'T GO TO REVEREND WRIGHT'S CHURCH.
BUT OBAMA WOULD. BECAUSE HE'S THE TYPE OF CHRISTIAN THAT'S, YOU KNOW, NOT CHRISTIAN.IG WELL, WHEN THE POPE SAID THAT TRUMP'S TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION WAS NOT CHRISTIAN, SURELY THAT GAVE LUMPY PAUSE.
WHO'S THE POPE TO SAY THATYO DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A CHRISTIAN? HOW CAN A POPE OR ANYBODY DECIDE IF SOMEBODY'S A CHRISTIAN IN THEIR HEART?
YEAH, WHO DIED AND MADE THAT GUY POPE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO ONE? OH, HE JUST RETIRED? I FEEL THAT. SO HERE'S WHERE WE ARE. EITHER LUMPY AND FRIENDS ARE LYING ABOUT BEING BOTHERED BY THIN-SKINNED, AUTHORITARIAN, LESS-THAN-CHRISTIAN READERS-OF-PROMPTER BEING PRESIDENT, OR YOU DON'T CARE, AS LONG AS IT'S "YOUR" THIN-SKINNED PROMPTER AUTHORITARIAN TYRANT NARCISSIST GIVING YOU YOUR COUNTRY BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS.IN ONLY ONE PROBLEM. IT'S NOT YOURS. YOU DON'T OWN IT. IT NEVER WAS. THERE IS NO "REAL" AMERICA. YOU DON'T OWN IT. YOU DON'T OWN PATRIOTISM. YOU DON'T OWN CHRISTIANITY. YOU SURE AS HELL DON'T OWN RESPECT FOR THE DRIVERY AND SACRIFICE FOR MILITARY, POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TRUST ME. SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR WITH THEIR "BLUE LIVES MATTER" RHETORIC WHO EITHER REMAINED SILENT OR ACTIVELY FOUGHT AGAINST THE 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS BILL REAUTHORIZATION. SO I SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE'RE LIVE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NEVER BEEN ON A TELEVISION SHOW WITH STAKES BEFORE. SO I SEE YOU. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THOSE REAL AMERICANS FIGHTING FOR THEIR PLACE AT THE TABLE? OFFER PROBLEM WITH THEM BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE SUBGROUPS OF AMERICANS ARE BEING DIVISIVE. TAKE IT UP WITH THE FOUNDERS. "WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL." RESPECT, LIN-MANUEL. THOSE FIGHTING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE IDEAL OF EQUALITY ARE NOT BEING DIVISIVE. THOSE FIGHTING TO KEEP THEM OUT ARE. SO, LUMPY, YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE EMBRACED DONALD TRUMP. CLEARLY THE C NEXT TO YOUR NAME DOESN'T STAND FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVE, BUT CRAVENLY CONVENIENT C -- (AIR HORN BLOWING)
Stephen: SORRY. AS JUST CLEANING MY AIR HORN.LOW IT WENT OFF. WHAT DID YOU SAY? OOPS. WE'RE OUT OF TIME. JON STEWART, EVERYONE! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO HAS BEEN DOGGING DONALD TRUMP FOR MONTHS NOW ON TWITTER. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON AGAIN.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALWAYS A BIT OF A FIRE BRAND AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. DID YOU WATCH THE CONVENTION THIS WEEK?
YES.
Stephen: OKAY.AD GIVE ME AN OVERALL IMPRESSION OF THE MESSAGE OF THE REPUBLICANS THIS WEEK.
UM, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE NASTIEST, MOST DIVISIVE CONVENTION THAT WE'VE SEEN IN HALF A CENTURY, AND THAT --
Stephen: WELL, DO YOU THINKA THAT'S THEIR FAULT OR THEY'RE EXPRESSING A GENUINE ANGER IN THE WORLD? IT'S EASY TO SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING ANGRY BUT ISN'T THAT WHY BERNIE DID SO WELL?
PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AND HAVE GOOD REASONS TO BE ANGRY. INCOMES ARE FLAT, EXPENSES ARE UP, YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH COLLEGE WITHOUT BEING CRUSHED BY DEBT. SENIORS CAN'T STRETCH A SOCIALN SECURITY CHECK TO COVER FOOD AND RENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS TO BE ANGRY BUT LET'S BE CLEAR, DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SPEECH TONIGHT. WHERE ARE NOT THE ANSWERS? HE SAID PEOPLE HAVE PUSHED YOU AROUND, I'M HERE TO PUSH BACK. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT MESSAGE?
ARE YOU KID MEG?
Stephen: NO. O HERE'S THE PROBLEM -- EVERY TIME YOU KIND OF SCRATCH THE SURFACE A LITTLE BIT AND SEE WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS REALLY TALKING ABOUT, WHAT HE'S REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT ALL HIS LIFE AND THAT IS HOW TO IMPROVE THE WORLD FOR DONALD TRUMP.E B SO I HEARD THE PART WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT TAXES AND SAID, I'M THE GUY, I WANT TO DO TAX CUTS. WHAT HE FAILED TO MENTION IS THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD GET ABOUT A $1.3 MILLION TAX CUT OUT OF THAT DEAL. HE JUST TAKES CARE OF DONALD TRUMP FIRST, LAST AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. THAT'S WHAT HE'S ABOUT.N (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: GET A LITTLE SOMETHING BACK. WELL, HE SAID THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED, AND THAT WAS KIND OF BERNIE'S MESSAGE, TOO, THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO IF THEY BOTH ORT OF BELIEVE THE SAME THING,TH IF THAT MESSAGE IS APPEALING TO BOTH THEIR FOLLOWERS, WHY DON'T YOU THINK BERNIE'S FOLLOWERS WOULD GO TO DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE, AGAIN YOU MAY SAY SCRATCHING AN ITCH, BUT POLITICS IS EMOTIONAL. IF HE COULD EMOTIONALLY APPEAL TO PEOPLE WHY WOULDN'T THEY GO BEER THERE IF THEY THINK HE CAN CHANGE THINGS BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON IS A WASHINGTON INSIDER. YEAH, SHE IS. SHE LIVED THERE SINCE JOSHUA FIT THE BATTLE OF JERICHO. (LAUGHTER)
YOU RAISED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE GAME BEING RIGGED, IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY IS RIGGED. S
Stephen: YOU'VE SAID THE SAME THING MANY TIMES YOURSELF.
RIGHT, WASHINGTON WORKS FOR THOSE WHO CAN HIRE ARMIES OF LAWYERS AND WORKS FOR BILLIONAIRES LIKE DONALD TRUMP. FOR THE REST OF US, NOT SO WELL. THE DEMOCRATS SAY WE'VE GOT TO TAKE BACK GOVERNMENT AND MAKE IT WORK FOR ALL OF US. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE THINK IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.NA
Stephen: SOUNDS A LOT LIKE WHAT HE SAID TONIGHT, THOUGH.ER
NO, WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS IS THERE IS A PROBLEM OUT THERE AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ISAT THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT EACH OTHER. WHAT YOU NEED TO BE AFRAID OF IS EVERY OTHER AMERICAN. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THATHAT  SPEECH TONIGHT, HE SOUNDED LIKE SOME TWO-BIT DICTATOR OF SOME COUNTRY THAT YOU COULDN'T FIND ON A MAP. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I WANT TO DEFEND HIM A SECOND, HE'S NOT A TWO-BIT DICTATOR, HE SOUNDED LIKE A BILLIONAIRE DICTATOR. TWO BITS IS INSULTING TO THE MAN.
HE SOUNDED LIKE A DICTATOR OF A SMALL COUNTRY RATHER THAN A MAN WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE OF THE STRONGEST DEMOCRACY ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH. THAT'S WHAT HE SOUNDED LIKE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I WANT TO HEAR MORE. WE HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL TO SERVE OUR CORPORATE OVERLORDS BUT BACK WITH MORE ELIZABETHRT WARREN. STICK AROUND. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WACKUM BACK! WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF "A FIGHTING CHANCE," "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER NOW AVAILABLE IN PAPERBACK. LET'S TALK ABOUT FIGHTING CHANCE. HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE FIGHTING DONALD TRUMP FOR THE PRESIDENCY. DO YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE UNDERESTIMATING DONALD TRUMP?

DONALD TRUMP IS A BAD GUY.TI I'M GOING WITH THAT.
Stephen: YOU SAID THAT I SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOUR TWEET STORMS, YOU SAID YOUR POLICIES ARE DANGEROUS, WORDS RECKLESS, OUR RECORD IS EMBARRASSING ANDen THE FREE RIDE IS OVER.R
YEAH, UH-HUH.
Stephen: YOU SAID DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE, YOU ARE A PERFECT MATCH, TWO SMALL, INSECURE, WEAK MEN WHO USE HATE AND FEAR TO DIVIDE OUR COUNTRY AND OUR PEOPLE, AND TO DONALDD  TRUMP, YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A THIN-SKINNED BULLY. ARE YOU BULLYING HIM HERE?FE

THIS IS A GUY WHO JUST WENT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND SAID ASICALLY TO ALL OF AMERICA, BE G AFRAID OF EACH OTHER, AND YOU LISTEN TO A SPEECH LIKE THAT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THERE IS ANYBODY LEFT IN AMERICA WHOL ISN'T AFRAID OF DONALD TRUMP. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, SOME PEOPLE O ARE AFRAID. THEY'RE AFRAID BECAUSE THEIR LIFE IS NOT WHAT THEY EXEKD IT TO BE OR FEEL THEY HAVE THINGS TAKEN FROM THEM. HOW ARE THE DEMOCRATS ADDRESSING THAT? HILLARY CLINTON'S MESSAGE IS, YOU KNOW, HE SAYS I'M WITH YOU, LL FIGHT FOR YOU, I'LL WIN FOR T YOU. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE GOING TO BE NEXT WEEK AT THE D.N.C.?
THE DEMOCRATS WILL TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER. WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS IS TURN ON EACH OTHER. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THE SAME GUYS IN POWER AND WHOAL RIGGED THE SYSTEM GET TO STAY IN POWER.
Stephen: LET'S ASK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND WHAT HER POLITICAL CHARACTER IS. PEOPLE SAY DONALD TRUMP MAY NOTS BE TELLING THE TRUTH BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE I LIKE THE WAY HE SAYS IT. LARY CLINTON IS NOT FORGIVEN: LE FOR WHAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE OF AS LIES THAT SHE'S TOLD, EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND WAS FORGIVENE ENDLESSLY FOR THE LIES WE KNOW HE TOLD, WHY DO YOU THINK SHE CANNOT GAIN THE TRUST OF PEOPLE THE WAY, SAY, A MALE CANDIDATE CAN? THAT'S CALLED LEADING THE WITNESS, BY THE WAY.
LEADING THE WITNESS. (LAUGHTER) WHAT I'M GOING TO GO WITH IS SHE'S BEEN UNDER ATTACK FOR 25 YEARS. A LOT OF FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST HUNG UP THEIR SPURS AND SAID I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

Stephen: WHAT IS THAT? LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT CONVERSION THERAPY, IS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
