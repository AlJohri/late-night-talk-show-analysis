SCHOOL IS BACK IN SESSION, AND SO IS CONGRESS! DON'T FORGET TO PICK UP YOUR BACK-TO-CONGRESS SUPPLIES:  PENS TO MAKE LAWS. A REALLY COOL TRAPPER KEEPER TO KEEP YOUR LAWS IN. A MUSTACHE TO HIDE FROM VOTERS WHEN THEY FIND OUT WHAT LAWS YOU PASSED. A COPY OF "THE ART OF THE DEAL" TO CURRY FAVOR WITH THE PRESIDENT. A COPY OF YERTLE THE TURTLE TO CURRY FAVOR WITH MITCH McCONNELL. A CEDAR WARDROBE TO HANG UP YOUR SOUL BEFORE YOU VOTE. CLOROX WIPES TO SANITIZE ANYTHING TED CRUZ TOUCHES. AND FINALLY A SPINE REMOVER FOR WHEN YOU DISREGARD WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COUNTRY AND VOTE ALONG PARTY LINES.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES LIEV SCHREIBER. JOE BUCK. AND SONEQUA MARTIN-GREEN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. DONALD TRUMP DID MORE THINGS TODAY. FOR INSTANCE, HE TRAVELED TO NORTH DAKOTA TO TALK TAX REFORM. AND BY "TALK TAX REFORM," I MEAN RAMBLED INCOHERENTLY UNTIL THEY TURNED HIS MIC OFF. TRUMP STARTED BY ADDRESSING LOCAL ISSUES, LIKE NORTH DAKOTA'S CURRENT DROUGHT.
BUT YOU HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS DROUGHT. I JUST SAID TO THE GOVERNOR, "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD DROUGHTS THIS FAR NORTH. GUESS WHAT? YOU HAVE THEM." ( LAUGHTER )
THEY KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A NORTH DAKOTA, BUT THEY HAVE ONE. IT'S NORTH AND THE SOUTH AT THE SAME TIME.
BUT YOU HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS DROUGHT.
DON'T TELL THEM I TOLD YOU THIS, BUT THOSE PEOPLE IN HOUSTON ARE SCREWED, OKAY? THEY HAD THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE UPON A TROUT. THE OPPOSITE-- I'M FOOR GETTING THE WORD FOR IT. I'M GOING TO GO WITH BIG WET. THEY'VE GOT A BIG WET DOWN THERE. THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS NOT INSULTED. THEN HE GOT TO THE HEAT OF THE MEAT, THE REASON HE WAS THERE. HE LAID OUT HIS TAX PLAN.
HERE ARE MY FOUR BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR TAX REFORM: FIRST, WE NEED A TAX CODE THAT IS SIMPLE, FAIR, AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND. SECOND, WE WILL CUT TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. THIRD, WE NEED A TAX CODE THAT RESTORES OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE.
Stephen: "FOURTH, I'M NEVER RELEASING MY TAX RETURNS." EVER. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. TRUMP ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE % OF MANUFACTURING LABELS.
ALL AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE LINED, ONCE AGAIN, WITH PRODUCTS PROUDLY BEARING THE WORDS "MADE IN THE U.S.A." WHAT DO YOU LIKE BETTER? READY? MADE IN AMERICA? MADE IN THE U.S.A.? WHAT DO YOU LIKE? YOU LIKE MADE IN THE U.S.A.? SEEMS TO BE. WE SHOULD PICK ONE OR THE OTHER, PROBABLY.
Stephen: YEAH, WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PICK ONE. AND THEN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE CAN JUST PICK THE OTHER ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE SEEMS-- I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. I THINK THAT'S-- I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS NOW. I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS NOW. HE SEEMS TO THINK THE PRESIDENT'S JOB IS TO PICK THE LABELS THAT GO ON PRODUCTS. "YOU LIKE 'MADE IN THE USA' BETTER? GREAT, I'LL HAVE MY FACTORY IN CHINA CRANK OUT A BUNCH OF THOSE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "OKAY, MY TIES, HER SHOES, THE LABELS." AND TRUMP ALSO REFERENCED A RECENT CONVERSATION HE WITH A FOREIGN LEADER.
I SPOKE TO A LEADER OF A MAJOR, MAJOR COUNTRY RECENTLY, BIG, BIG COUNTRY. THEY SAY OUR COUNTRY IS VERY BIG. IT'S HARD TO GROW. WELL, BELIEVE ME, THIS COUNTRY IS VERY BIG.
Stephen: "I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHICH COUNTRY IT WAS, BUT IT RHYMES WITH BRAUSTRALIA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND-- FUN FACT-- I'M LYING. I DIDN'T TALK TO ANYBODY." ( LAUGHTER ) AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A REAL PLAN FOR THE ECONOMY, THAT'S FAIR.
MY ADMINISTRATION STRONGLY REJECTS THIS OFFSHORING MODEL, AND WE'VE EMBRACED A NEW MODEL IT'S CALLED THE AMERICAN MODEL, VERY SIMPLE, THE AMERICAN MODEL.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURPRISED. HE IS KNOWN FOR EMBRACING AMERICAN MODELS. DOESN'T EVEN ASK. JUST GRABS HIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S AN OLDY BUT GOODY. THAT'S AN OLDING-- THAT'S AN OLDY BUT BADDIE. BUT BY FAR, THE MOST AWKWARD MOMENT-- AND FOR TRUMP THAT'S A PRETTY HIGH BAR-- WAS WHEN HE BROUGHT UP IVANKA.
SOMETIMES THEY'LL SAY, YOU KNOW, "HE CAN'T BE THAT BAD A GUY. LOOK AT IVANKA." NO, COME ON UP, HONEY. SHE'S SO GOOD. SHE WANTED TO MAKE THE TRIP. SHE SAID, "DAD, CAN I GO WITH YOU?" SHE ACTUALLY SAID, "DADDY, CAN I GO WITH YOU?" I LIKE THAT, RIGHT? "DADDY, CAN I GO WITH YOU?" "YES, YOU CAN."
Stephen: NOT WEIRD AT ALL. ALL OF TRUMP'S ADVISORS CALL HIM DADDY. SEAN SPICER WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO STARTED IT. ( LAUGHTER ) AS TRUMP SO SENSITIVELY MENTIONED, TEXAS IS STILL DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICAN HARVEY. AND THEY WILL BE FOR YEARS. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER HURRICANE, IRMA, IS BEARING DOWN ON FLORIDA. IT'S THE LARGEST ATLANTIC HURRICANE EVER REPORTED. EXPERTS SAY IT'S THE SIZE OF FRANCE. HEY! THIS IS AMERICA! WE MEASURE THINGS IN DELAWARES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HOW MANY DELL WARES IS FRANCE, DO WE KNOW? HOW MANY DELL WARES IS FRANCE? 10? IT'S 10. 10 DELL WARES. THAT'S FRIGHTENING. ONE FRANCE, I CAN HANDLE ONE TRANCE. 10 DELAWARES GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE. SO IRMA IS A FRIGHTENINGLY INTENSE STORM, BUT DON'T WORRY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TWEETING AT IT. "WATCHING HURRICANE CLOSELY. MY TEAM, WHICH HAS DONE-- AND IS DOING-- SUCH A GOOD JOB IN TEXAS, IS ALREADY IN FLORIDA. NO REST FOR THE WEARY!" THAT'S A REALLY ODDLY CASUAL WAY TO DESCRIBE EXHAUSTED FIRST RESPONDERS RACING TO SAVE LIVES. IT REMINDS ME OF F.D.R.'s PEARL HARBOR SPEECH.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS SUDDENLY AND DELIBERATELY ATTACKED BY NAVAL AND AIR FORCES OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN, BUT THAT'S THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: TOOK IT WITH A LOT OF APLUMB. DON'T FORGET TO TUNE IN NEXT TUESDAY FOR THE "HAND IN HAND" BENEFIT. IT'S RAISING MONEY FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY HURRICAN HARVEY AND HURRICANE IRMA. I WILL BE THERE ON THE SHOW, WORKING THE PHONES. GIVE ME A CALL. ASK ME WHAT I'M WEARING. NOTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) REMEMBER THE 2016 CAMPAIGN?
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO BACK AND RELIVE EVERY EXCRUCIATING DETAIL, GOOD NEWS-- HILLARY CLINTON HAS A NEW BOOK, "WHAT HAPPENED." WHICH IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL TITLE "ANYBODY WANNA BUY A BARGE FULL OF UNUSED FIREWORKS?" STILL STINGS A LITTLE. OF COURSE, IT WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE IN AUDIOBOOK. IN FACT, WE HAVE A CLIP.
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. DAMN IT!
Stephen: I'M SURPRISED THEY ALLOWED CHINA IN THERE. THEY PUT, LIKE, A TEA SET IN THERE WITH HER. I'M SURPRISED THEY PUT THAT IN THE RECORDING BOOTH. IT'S ABOUT 10 HOURS OF THAT. SO THE BOOK DOES NOT HIT SHELVES UNTIL SEPTEMBER 12, BUT SOME EXCERPTS HAVE STARTED TO LEAK. FOR EXAMPLE, HILLARY ADMITS THAT, "IN THE PAST, FOR REASONS I TRY TO EXPLAIN, I'VE OFTEN FELT I HAD TO BE CAREFUL IN PUBLIC. NOW I'M LETTING MY GUARD DOWN." A LITTLE LATE! ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE A PILOT CRASH LANDING AND THEN SAYING, "THOSE WHO ARE STILL ALIVE, PLEASE PUT UP YOUR TRAY TABLES." ( LAUGHTER ) THE BOOK ALSO HAS A LOT OF JUICY PEEKS BEHIND THE SCENES, LIKE WHAT IT WAS LIKE MAKING THE CONCESSION CALL TO DONALD TRUMP, SAYING, "IT WAS ALL PERFECTLY NICE AND WEIRDLY ORDINARY, LIKE CALLING A NEIGHBOR TO SAY YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TO HIS BARBECUE." OH, WHICH IS A SHAME, BECAUSE SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING A COLD SALAD AND COMPETENT LEADERSHIP. ( APPLAUSE ) SURE, WHY NOT? LEADERSHIP. WHY NOT. LET'S ENCOURAGE IT. WHILE WE CAN. IF THERE ARE ANY DIE-HARD HILLARY FANS OUT THERE, YOU CAN SEE HER IN PERSON WHEN SHE GOES ON HER BOOK TOUR TO SPOTS LIKE MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN. AGAIN, A LITTLE LATE TO BE GOING TO MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE BIG THING PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING ON FROM THE BOOK IS HER CRITICISM OF BERNIE SANDERS. SHE DESCRIBES FEELING MUZZLED DURING THE PRIMARY. "PRESIDENT OBAMA URGED ME TO GRIT MY TEETH AND LAY OFF BERNIE AS MUCH AS I COULD. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A STRAITJACKET." WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE BERNIE'S THE ONE WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S A MENTAL PATIENT. "JOE STALIN IS UNDERNEATH MY BED. I AM SAVING MY URINE IN JARS TO KEEP IT FROM BEING COLLECTED BY THE ASCENDED MASTERS OF THE RED SQUAD WHO SEEK TO ABSORB ME INTO THE HIVE MIND." NEXT QUESTION. AND SHE..." ( APPLAUSE ) AND SHE ALSO-- IN THE BACK, SHE ALSO TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE DEBATING SANDERS WHO PROMISED THE VOTERS THE WORLD. HILLARY WOULD PROPOSE A PLAN THEN "BERNIE WOULD ANNOUNCE BASICALLY THE SAME THING, BUT BIGGER. ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, IT WAS LIKE HE KEPT PROMISING FOUR-MINUTE ABS, OR EVEN NO-MINUTES ABS. MAGIC ABS!" IT'S TRUE. AND FACED WITH THE CHOICE BETWEEN HILLARY'S DAILY WORKOUT PLAN AND BERNIE'S NO-MINUTE ABS, AMERICA WENT WITH POTATO ASS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) A LITTLE BUTTER, A LITTLE BUTTER. SOME SOUR CREAM. SOME CHIVES, BACON BITS IN THERE. IN THE BOOK, SHE EVEN REPRINTS A SUPPORTER'S FACEBOOK POST CHARACTERIZING HER DYNAMIC WITH BERNIE. BERNIE: "I THINK AMERICA SHOULD GET A PONY." HILLARY: "HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR THE PONY? WHERE WILL THE PONY COME FROM? HOW WILL YOU GET CONGRESS TO AGREE TO THE PONY?" BERNIE: "HILLARY THINKS AMERICA DOESN'T DESERVE A PONY." BERNIE SUPPORTERS: "HILLARY HATES PONIES." "HILLARY HATES PONIES, SPECIFICALLY, TWILIGHT, SPARKLE, RAINBOW DASH, APPLEJACK, FLUTTERSHY, AND PINKIE PIE. ARE MY BERNIE BRONIES IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT?" ALL IN ALL-- THAT WAS VERY KIND. ALL IN ALL, HILLARY'S BOOK IS A SOBERING LOOK AT HOW EASILY PEOPLE CAN BE TAKEN IN BY UNREALISTIC PROMISES. ON A SIDE NOTE, BERNIE'S ON THE SHOW TOMORROW NIGHT. AND I THINK HE'S GONNA BRING ME A PONY! WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. LIEV SCHREIBER IS HERE. WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL BE AT THAT DESK TALKING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND.
Jon: YES, INDEED. LOOKING GOOD OVER HERE, BOY
Stephen: JON, I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST IN THE BAND TONIGHT. WOULD YOU TELL THE KIND PEOPLE WHO YOU HAVE SITTING IN WITH THE BAND TONIGHT.
Jon: YES, INDEED. WE HAVE THE FABULOUS SHEILA E.
Stephen: WELCOME, SHEILA E. SHE'S GOT A NEW ALBUM OUT CALLED, "ICONIC: MESSAGE 4 AMERICA" WITH-- AND I HEARD THIS TODAY, AND IT'S FANTASTIC A NEW FUNK VERSION OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. AND SPEECHES BY AMAZING LEADERS LIKE BARACK OBAMA, AND MARTIN LUTHER KING.
Stephen: LISTEN TO IT. IT'S APPROPRIATE. I WOULD SAY THAT A FUNK VERSION OF THE OF NATIONAL ANTHEM IS APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUR NATION IS FUNKED. THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER LEAK FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, FOLKS. SUNDAY, CNN RELEASED THE LETTER THAT OBAMA LEFT FOR TRUMP ON HIS INAUGURATION DAY. APPARENTLY, "TRUMP HAS SHOWN THE
THAT'S LIKE LEAVING A NOTE FOR THE BABY-SITTER SAYING, ZOE'S BOTTLE IS IN THE FRIDGE. BY THE WAY, ZOE IS A HUMAN TODDLER. HUMAN TODDLERS REQUIRE FOOD AND WATER, OR THEY DIE. THE LETTER STARTS OFF PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD, "DEAR, MR. PRESIDENT, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR REMARKABLE RUN." NICE OPENING. NOT LIKE SWEET AND SOUR (BLEEP). WHAT JUST HAPPENED? NICE, NICE. THEN, OBAMA ACKNOWLEDGES THE UNCERTAINTY OF BEING PRESIDENT, WRITING, "THIS IS A UNIQUE OFFICE WITHOUT A CLEAR BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS." TRUE. ALTHOUGH, WE'RE GETTING A PRETTY DETAILED DIAGRAM OF FAILURE. ( LAUGHTER ) OBAMA ALSO TOLD TRUMP TO REMEMBER REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT. "AND, FINALLY, TAKE TIME, IN THE RUSH OF EVENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES, FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY." GOOD ADVICE. ONCE THIS WHOLE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS OVER, I HOPE THE PRESIDENT TAKES THE TIME TO VISIT DON JR. IN JAIL. HE THEN SIGNED-- ( APPLAUSE ) HE THEN SIGNED THE LETTER "GOOD LUCK AND GODSPEED: BO" OH MY GOD! OBAMA'S DOG BO WROTE THIS! AMAZING!" AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LETTER, OBAMA ADDED, ""P.S., IF IT COMES UP, NAZIS ARE THE BAD GUYS." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LIEV SCHREIBER. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM "SPOTLIGHT" AND AS SABER TOOTH IN "X-MEN: ORIGINS." HE'S CURRENTLY NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY AS THE STAR OF SHOWTIME'S "RAY DONOVAN." PLEASE WELCOME LIEV SCHREIBER! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HI.
HI.
Stephen: HEY, TOUGH GUY.
HOW YOU DOING?
Stephen: HEY. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M WELL, I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. I WAS TALKING TO THE AUDIENCE BEFORE THE SHOW HOW HAPPY I AM. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU FOR A LONG TIME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS SINCE I SAW YOU AS YAGO.
YOU SAW THAT.
Stephen: NOT A NICE GUY, YAGO.
HE HAS SOME PROBLEMS. HE HAS SOME ISSUE S.
Stephen:  AT THE END OF THE PLAY IT DOESN'T SAY HE'S TORTURED TO DEATH OFFSTAGE?
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT PART. THEY SAID HE GETS TORTURED TO DEATH? DOESN'T HE SAY, "I WILL SPEAK NO MORE" OR SOMETHING. THAT'S IT.
Stephen: MAYBE. YOU PLAYED THE PART. I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE THE GUY. YOU PLAY A LOT OF TOUGH GUYS. OBVIOUSLY SABER TOOTH, AND RAY DONOVAN IS A TOUGH GUY. ARE YOU A TOUGH GUY?
NO. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT. I THINK I'M ABSENT MINDED.
Stephen: WHAT?
I'M ABSEBT MINDED, I FORGET THINGS. AND I THINK THAT FACE OF FORGETTING THINGS-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ...TRANSLATES ON FILM AS TOUGH.
Stephen: I GET IT.
AND I THINK --
Stephen: LET ME TRY, CAN I TRY?
GO AHEAD. ( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S IT. IT'S THE ADJUSTMENT, TOO. DID YOU SEE WHAT HE DID WITH HIS EYES ON THE SECOND PART? IT'S BECAUSE YOU START HERE AND YOU GO... AND THEN YOU GO... ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S THE 100-YARD STARE.
Stephen: BUT WE SHOULD NOT MISTAKE YOUR LONG PAUSES FOR HOSTILITY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER MY LINE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NOW, YOU-- YOU WENT TO THE YALE SCHOOL OF DRAMA, OKAY. THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL, YEAH.
Stephen: YALE ANYTHING YOU THROW A DART AT IT.
IT'S EXPENSIVE.
Stephen: IT'S EXPENSIVE.
BUT YOU COULD MAKE IT BACK NOW.
IT'S EASY.
Stephen: GO TWICE. WHATEVER. SLEEP THROUGH HALF THE CLASSES. HOW ACTORALY WAS IT? WERE THERE ACTING EXERCISES? DID YOU HAVE TO DO VOCAL EXERCISES?
IT WAS A GREAT SCHOOL.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT THERE WAS THAT A LOT OF THAT ACTORY-SMACKTERY STUFF IT'S A LITTLE SILLY LIKE "HA-HA" AND ALL THAT STUFF. ( LAUGHTER ) I TOOK IT SERIOUSLY. I STILL DO. THE WORST THICK WAS THIS THING CALLED THE RING OF FIRE, THAT WESLEY-- MY FAVORITE TEACHER, THIS WONDERFUL GRAND DANCER AND TEACHER, TAUGHT MOVEMENT. THIS IS A REAL THING. HE SAID "YOU ALL GET IN A CIRCLE--" HE WOULD TALK LIKE THIS. "YOU ALL GET IN A CIRCLE, AND ONE AT A TIME YOU'LL GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCLE, AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO MAKE EVERYBODY LAUGH." AND ONE BY ONE WE HAD TO GET IN THE CENTER OF THIS CIRCLE. AND THE MOST RIDICULOUS (BLEEP) THAT PEOPLE DID. AND IT WAS SO NOT FUNNY. AND SO-- ( LAUGHTER ) TERRIFYINGINGLY HUMILIATING. BUT I GUESS HIS POINT WAS THAT TO BE AN ACTOR, OR I GUESS TO DO ANYTHING IN SHOW BUSINESS, THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DO IS MAKE A COMPLETE ASS OF YOURSELF.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE HUMILIATION. THAT'S IT, YEAH.
SO I DID A-- I DID A-- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO DO SOMEONE FARTING SILENTLY. SUBTLE.
Stephen: SUBTLE.
YOU KNOW, A GUY WHO IS GOING TO WORK IN FILM. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS WITHOUT EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE IN ADVANCE THAT WHAT I WAS DOING WAS SILENTLY FARTING, THEY HAD NO CONCEPT OF WHAT I WAS DOING. AND I JUST LOOKED LIKE I COULDN'T REMEMBER MY LINES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AGAIN.
AGAIN. THAT WAS JUST SORT OF-- YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW MY SON DOES IT-- WELL, HE DID-- YOU EVER SEE A BABY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THEM AND THEY SUDDENLY START TO POO, THAT FACE.
Stephen: YEAH, THEY LOOK VERY HAPPY SUDDENLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW IT WORKS.
Stephen: YEAH. STILL A LITTLE HOSTILE. STILL SLIGHTLY HOSTILE.
CAN YOU DO-- CAN YOU DO SILENT FART FACE?
Stephen: SURE.
IF YOU COULD DO TOUGH --
Stephen: SURE, WHY NOT, SURE, WHY NOT. ( LAUGHTER )
NO, THAT'S-- THAT'S INFANT (BLEEP) FACE.
Stephen: OH,E I THOUGHT YOU SAID THEY WERE THE SAME FACE.
NO, SILENT FART FACE IS THIS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU SEE, I--
IT'S DIFFERENT.
Stephen: NO, THAT REALLY PLAYED AS YEARNING FOR A LOST LOVE. YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE OFF IN THE DISTANCE. BUT YOU GREW UP ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE.
I DID.
Stephen: TOUGH GUY.
I DID.
Stephen: THAT'S A TOUGH GUY PLACE TO GROW UP, THE LOWER EAST SIDE. WAS IT THE LOWER EAST SIDE BEFORE IT GOT--
I'M REALLY OLD.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I GREW UP ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE-- I WAS THERE-- I FIRST GOT THERE IN THE EARLY 70s AND IT WAS LIKE GHETTOS. FIRST STREET AND FIRST AVE. WAS THE EPICENTER OF FIVE DIFFERENT GHETTOS. BELOW THAT WAS ALL ORTHODOX JEWS. IF YOU WENT A BLOCK EAST IT WAS ALL PUERTO RICAN AND DOMINICAN, AND IF YOU WENT A BLOCK NORTH IT WAS POLISH, IF YOU WENT A BLOCK WEST, IT WAS THE BOWERY, THE MEN'S SHELTERS. SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY SAFE BECAUSE THESE WERE ALL COMMUNITIES, TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITIES, BUT IN THE LATE 70s, EARLY 80s, WHEN CRACK HIT, THAT DEVASTATED THE LOWER EAST SIDE. AND I REMEMBER THAT A LITTLE BIT. I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE, LIKE, A HISTORY THING, BUT-- ( LAUGHTER ) I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU. WERE YOU HERE?
Stephen: WHAT? IN THE 70s? NO, I VISITED IT ONCE.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
Stephen: I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA?
THERE'S A SOUTH CAROLINA?
Stephen: THERE IS A SOUTH CAROLINA, YEAH, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ BIG-- WAS IT BIG WET DOWN THERE? BECAUSE THAT --
Stephen: BIG WET IS IN TEXAS. THOUGH THE BIG WET IS COMING. IRMA MIGHT MAKE THE TURN UP THERE, AND WE MIGHT HAVE THE BIG WET. YEAH, YEAH, HE'S AN INSPIRING LEADER. ( LAUGHTER ) ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO SNEAK A SILENT FART TO ME, ALWAYS. YEAH... YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: THIRD YEAR, THIRD YEAR.  ( APPLAUSE ) ARE YOU-- ARE YOU-- ARE YOU COMPETITIVE? ARE YOU LIKE, "I'M NOMINATED. I COULD GIVE A DAMN WHETHER I WIN?"
I'M-- I'M JUST-- I'M NOMINATED I COULD GIVE-- NO, IT'S AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED.
Stephen: IT IS AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED.
I'VE BEEN NOMINATED SIX TIMES.
Stephen: SIX TIMES!
I DON'T WIN. THAT'S MY THING. I JUST GET NOMINATE. I DON'T WANT TO WIN FOR TWO REASONS. FINI THINK IF YOU WIN YOU DON'T GET NOMINATED ANYMORE.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT TRUE.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH.
OH, RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOT TRUE.
WELL, YOU'RE CLEARLY SPECIAL.

YEAH. YOU HAVE ONE. LAWYERS.

WELL, YOUR LAWYER CALLS A GUY FROM BRIGHTON BEACH.
Stephen: REALLY?
IF YOU WANTED HIM TO, I'M SURE HE COULD.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY HE CHARGES SO MUCH AN HOUR. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU HAVE A FIXER? I HAVE A GOOD LAWYER. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S HOW YOUR LAWYER TOLD YOU TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION? ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAVE-- WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAS GONE IN THIS CLIP HERE WITH "RAY DONOVAN"?
I THINK IT HAS C. THOMAS HOWELL IN IT WHO PLAYS MY COURT-APPOINTED THERAPIST. I THINK. YEAH, RAY IS IN THERAPY, KIND OF ANGER MANAGEMENT THERAPY.
Stephen: SO THE COURT HAS MADE YOU GO TO ACRE MANAGEMENT.
YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE RAY IS A TOUGH GUY.

Stephen: TOUGH GUY. JIM.

THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NOW, LIFE, I'VE NEVER-- I'VE NEVER CALLED A GAME. WHAT IS-- WHAT IS THE SECRET TO BEING A GREAT SPORTS BROADCASTER? WHAT'S THE SECRET TO THE SUCCESS? IS IT THE VELVETY VOICE? IS IT THE ABILITY TO TURN A PHRASE? IS IT A CLEAR BIAS AGAINST NEW YORK SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH IS IT?
YEAH. IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY. NO, I GET THAT A LOT. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, STEPHEN, A GREAT BLADDER IS SOMETHING THAT CAN REALLY --
Stephen: A GREAT BLADDER?
IT CAN REALLY COME IN HANDY, AND LET ME EXPLAIN. ONE --
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IF I WILL. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS CBS IT IS A FAMILY SHOW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "A GREAT BLADDER?" HOW DOES IT WORK.
THEN WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.
Stephen: IS IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET TO LEAVE THE BOOTH.
YOU DON'T REALLY GET TO LEAVE THE BOOTH. MOST STADIUMS HAVE A BATHROOM INSIDE THE BROADCAST BOOTH WHERE WE ARE. BUT IN THE OLDER STADIUMS YOU HAVE TO DO A TOM CRUISE PULLEY-AND-LADDER SYSTEM TO GET TO THE BATHROOM IN THE MIDST OF A COMMERCIAL BREAK. SO THE PROBLEM ONE TIME HAPPENED IN MILWAUKEE. THE PACKERS USED TO PLAY A HOME GAME THERE. AND I'M DOING THE GAME. FIRST HALF IS COMING TO A CLOSE. WE'RE OUT OF ALL THE TV TIME-OUTS. AND THE HALF WILL NOT END. AND I'M TURNING TO PEOPLE IN THE BOOTH, TAKING MY HEADSET OFF GOING, "I'VE GOT TO PEE. I HAVE GOT TO PEE." THE HALF WILL END, SOMEBODY GETS HURT. WE'RE ON THE ENTIRE TIME. IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. I'M JUMPING UP AND DOWN. FINALLY, WE TAKE A 30-SECOND BREAK, AND THE GUY WHO IS WORKING WITH ME HANDS ME A LITTLE WATER BOTTLE, LIKE AM I WILLIAM TELL? I'M GOING TO SHOOT IT IN THERE? NO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. SO I SLAP THAT AWAY. I'M WEARING THIS PARKA BECAUSE IT'S COLD. THEY PUT A TRASH CAN IN FRONT OF ME. I'VE GOT 20 SECONDS. THEN I GET STAGE FRIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, I'M IN A BOOTH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
Stephen: IS THERE A GLASS FRONT ON THIS BOOTH?
NO, IT'S WIDE OPEN. ( LAUGHTER ) WIDE OPEN.
Stephen: AND COLD, I'M GUESSING.
AND VERY COLD. IT'S FOOTBALL! YEAH, YOU HAVE TO BE OUT IN THE ELEMENTS. SO THAT PRESENTS A PROBLEM IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT I END UP WITH STAGE FRIGHT. THEY'RE COUNTING ME BACK FROM COMMERCIAL-- FIVE, FOUR, THREE-- AND THEN, BOOM! FLOOD GATES OPEN, AND I START PEEING. THE PROBLEM WAS, PLAY RESUMED, AND I ACTUALLY CALLED A TOUCHDOWN LIVE ON NATIONAL TV WHILE PEEING IN A TRASH CAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU! I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT. THANK YOU!
Stephen: THAT'S AN INSPIRING STORY.
YEAH, IT IS. IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST --
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T TELL THAT ONE MORE OFTEN.
IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST ONES I TELL KIDS WHO WANT TO GET INTO BROADCASTING.
Stephen: YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? ONE OF MY PRODUCERS -- YOU BROUGHT THIS FOR US TO LOOK AT.
YEAH.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS. IT LOOKS LIKE THE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD BE PRESENTED AT YOUR COMMITMENT HEARING.
YEAH. NO, IT'S BAD.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S CONTROLLED CHAOS. THAT'S THE THING I PUT TOGETHER DURING THE COURSE OF THE WEEK BEFORE AN N.F.L. GAME. I THINK PEOPLE KIND OF ASSUME WE JUST SHOW UP. BUT WE ACTUALLY DO PUT WORK IN. AND THEN I'M PUTTING NOTES IN DURING THE COURSE OF THE WEEK. AND I KNOW WHERE ALL THOSE NOTES ARE TO GET TO LIVE DURING A GAME.
Stephen: WHAT GAME IS THIS?
THAT IS SUPER BOWL SUPER BOWL LI.
Stephen: IT SAYS BRADY.
TOM BRADY, EXCLAMATION POINT.
Stephen: HOOS HOW YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME?
YEAH, TOM BRADY, HE'S NUMBER 12. AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW MY MORONIC BRAIN HAS TO GO. I HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME. A PLAY HAPPENS. A GAY MAKES A CAP. HE'S CALLED A SPOART, HE'LL POINT. I'LL GO, MARTELLUS BENNETT MADE THAT CATCH. AND HE FLIPS IT OVER, ROBERT ALFRED MADE THE TACKLE. AND I LOOK TO ANOTHER GUY WHO HAS A GREASE ABOARD AND IT'S 15 YARDS.
Stephen: SO YOU LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
CORRECT.
Stephen: YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO POINT TO THINGS. OTHERWISE 53 PEOPLE ON A ROSTER AND 32 TEAMS THERE'S NO WAY YOU WOULD KNOW WHO PEOPLE ARE. IT WOULD BE LIKE, "BIG GUY HAS THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD! OH, BIGGER GUY HIT HIM!
I'VE DONE THAT. I'M NOT ABOVE THAT. YEAH. NO, I'M NOT SCARED TO DO THAT.
Stephen: WHAT'S, LIKE, THE WORST CALL YOU'VE MADE IN ALL OF YOUR BROADCAST CAREER, BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU MADE?
THIS SUMMER, I WAS DOING THE U.S. OPEN. MOST PEOPLE THINK, CBS, THIS VERY NETWORK IS THE GREAT HOME TO GOLF AND IT IS BECAUSE OF JIM NANTZ, WHO DOES WHAT I DO AT YOUR NEW YORK. JIM NANTZ WOULD NEVER MAKE THIS MISTAKES. THIS YOUNG MAN WINS THE U.S. OPEN, AND THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL GIRL BOUNDING DOWN THE HILLSIDE TO EMBRACE THE NEW U.S. OPEN CHAMPION, BROOKS KAPKA. AND SHE KEEPS APPEARING IN THE PICTURES. AND EVENTUALLY I READ THE CARD AND OH, THERE'S, WHATEVER, STACY JOHNSON, BROOKS LONGTIME GIRLFRIEND WHO IS A GREAT COLLEGIATE SOCCER PLAYER --
Stephen: WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP OF THIS.
OH, GOOD, GREAT.
LET'S RELIVE IT.
LEAVING THE FIELD. HIS GIRLFRIEND, BECKY EDWARDS, ALL-AMERICAN SOCCER PLAYER AT FLORIDA STATE.
JOE, THAT'S ACTUALLY HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND. THAT'S JENNA SIMMS. THEY'RE ALL STAYING TOGETHER THIS WEEK.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: THAT'S A TOUGH CALL. THAT'S A TOUGH CALL.
THAT SUCKS.
Stephen: IS THAT IN THE NEW BOOK? YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK "LUCKY BASTARD."
THAT WOULD GO IN THE FOLLOW-UP BOOK "THE UNLUCKY BASTARD." IT WAS BAD, BUT IT'S LIVE TV. THE WAY IT GOES. THE SUBTITLE OF BOOK IS, "MY LIFE, MY DAD, AND THINGS I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY ON TV."
HE WORKED AT CBS FOREVER.

YES, YES, 10 YEARS BEFORE. 10 YEARS BEFORE. AND WE'RE-- WE'RE-- WE'RE DISCOVERING A LOT, DISCOVERING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE DISCOVERY OF OURSELVES, HONESTLY.
Stephen: THERE'S A CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES UPON. TELL ME IF I'M GETTING SOMETHING WRONG OR STOP ME IF I'M SAYING SOMETHING NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO KNOW. ONE OF THE CROSSOVER SPHRZ YOUR SERIES AND THE ORIGINAL IS CERIC, WHO IS SPOCK'S FATHER, RAISES YOU.
YES.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE NOT VULCAN.
RIGHT.
YOU'RE HUMAN.
YES.
Stephen: BUT YOUR PARENTS WERE KILLED BY KLINGONS.
YES.
Stephen: I'M A LITTLE OBSESSED ABOUT ANY DETAILS I CAN GET OUT OF IT. SO ARE YOU-- DO YOU HAVE A MOTION IF YOU WERE RAISED BY VULCANS?
I DO, BECAUSE I AM HUMAN.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO I AM A HUMAN IN THE CULTURE OF VULCAN. RIGHT. SO THERE'S ASSIMILATION HAPPENING THERE.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND THERE'S CULTURE SHOCK THAT HAPPENED THERE.
Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THE AUDITION WAS JUST DOING THIS?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S REAL GOOD. EXCEPT YOUR THUMB HAS TO BE --
Stephen: HAS TO BE ON THE SIDE?
YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR THUMB OUT. THERE YOU GO! THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! IT CAME QUITE NATURALLY, SO IT WAS MEANT TO BE.
Stephen: THE VULCAN PHILOSOPHY--
YES.
Stephen: THE BASIS OF IT. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. YOU HAVE BEEN RAISED BY VULCANS.
GET IT RIGHT.
Stephen: IS "INFINITE DIVERSITY IN INFINITE COMBINATIONS." DOES AMERICA NEED A LITTLE "STAR TREK" RIGHT NOW?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YES! OH, MY GOSH! THINGS ARE AT A FEVER PITCH AT THIS POINT, RIGHT, DIVISION AND SEPARATIST THINKING. I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO SEE WHAT WE CAN BE AND WHAT WE CAN BECOME. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOW DOES. IT ALWAYS HAS, SO WE'RE JUST GOING BOLDLY IN THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS.
Stephen: THE ORIGINAL SHOW-- OF ALL OF THE SHOWS, BUT GENE RODDENBERRY, CREATED THE ORIGINAL SHOW, DEALT WITH CURRENT SOCIAL SOCIETAL ISSUES OF ALL KIND BY PUTTING THEM IN SPACE.
YES, BECAUSE HONESTLY, THE FANTASY OF IT, PROVIDES A SORT OF-- IT TAKES AWAY THE BAR YERK RIGHT? SO PEOPLE CAN LET GO. THEY CAN SUSPEND THEIR DISBELIEF AND BE IMAGINATIVE, AND IN DOING THAT, THE MESSAGE COMES THROUGH SUBCONSCIOUSLY. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF SCI-FI, RIGHT?
Stephen: WOW, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE BRAINWASHING US.
AND THEN...
Stephen: CBS IS-- THEY'VE THROWN THE KITCHEN SINK AT THIS. THIS IS A HUGE PRODUCTION. WHAT IS THE-- WHAT IS, LIKE, THE CRAZIEST LOCALE OR THE BIGGEST THING THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN DOING IN SHOOTING THIS?
YEAH, OH, MAN. OKAY, WELL, EVERYBODY IS ON THEIR TOP GAME, NUMBER ONE. I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT, BEHIND THE CAMERA AND IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. AND WHEN WE WERE-- WE SHOT IN JORDAN. AND THE JORDANIAN CREW WAS SO AMAZING, SO WARM AND WELCOMING. AND THE PRINCE OF JORDAN CAME TO VISIT SET ONE KAY, AND HE BROUGHT HIS SON, AND THEY WERE "TREK" FANS WHICH WAS AMAZING AND I WAS SO THROWN OFF BECAUSE I GO, "HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU GREET ROYALTY? THIS IS MY FIRST TIME. DO I NEED-- DO YOU NEED ME TO BOW? DO I NEED TO CURTSY? AM I GOING TO HAVE TO KISS HIS HAND? THAT'S FIEB, IF THAT'S CUSTOMARY. AND WHAT DO NEED TO DO HERE?" HE WAS SO DOWNED TO EARTH THE HAND SHAKE WAS FINE. IT WAS KIND OF ANTICLIMACTIC.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN AMERICAN, YOU SAY THE I BOW TO NO KING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. "STAR TREK: DISCOVERY" PREMIERES SEPTEMBER 24 ON CBS ALL ACCESS. SONEQUA MARTIN-GREEN, EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. STICK AROUND ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
