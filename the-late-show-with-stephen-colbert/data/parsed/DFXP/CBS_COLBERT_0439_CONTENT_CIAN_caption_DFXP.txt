PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES NORMAN REEDUS. SEAN ASTIN. AND COMEDIAN PAT McGANN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TACK, TACK, TACK, TACK PARTICULAR THANKS SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, FOLKS, ONE YEAR AGO TODAY, DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT. GIVE HIM A CHANCE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) YESTERDAY, DEMOCRATS COMMEMORATED THIS ANNIVERSARY, BY KICKING TRUMP'S ASS, USING HIS ARCH ENEMY: THE POPULAR VOTE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, LET'S GO AROUND THE HORN. LET'S SEE THE RESULTS. LET'S START IN HELENA, MONTANA, WHERE WILMOT COLLINS BECAME THE FIRST BLACK MAYOR IN MONTANA'S HISTORY.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I LIKE THAT! I LIKE THAT!
Stephen: ALSO-- AND THIS IS FUN-- THE FIRST BLACK PERSON IN MONTANA'S HISTORY.  ( LAUGHTER ) WYOMING IS THE 21st ONE OUT THERE. AND IN NEW JERSEY, DEMOCRAT PHIL MURPHY WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A SAD DAY FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. SO, A DAY FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. AND IN HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, GOVERNOR-ELECT MURPHY EXPRESSED THE WAY A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WERE FEELING LAST NIGHT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) LET ME TRY THAT. HOLD ON.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Jon: MAKE YOU WANNA JUMP!
Stephen: THEY'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO BE HAPPY. SO, DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR SWAGGER BACK. THEY'VE ALREADY UPDATED THEIR LOGO TO THIS.  (  LAUGHTER  ) THEY ALSO MADE MAJOR GAINS IN VIRGINIA'S HOUSE OF DELEGATES, WINNING AT LEAST 15 SEATS IN AN UPSET--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. 15 SEATS IN AN UPSET THAT STUNNED MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES. BOTH PARTIES? SO, EVEN THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T DEMOCRATS WOULD WIN. "WHAT? NO, PEOPLE HATE US. I DEMAND A RECOUNT!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) VIRGINIA ALSO ELECTED ITS FIRST TRANSGENDER STATE LAWMAKER  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DANICA ROEM. AND IN A MOMENT OF, I THINK, SWEET IRONY, THE MAN SHE BEAT WAS BOB MARSHALL, THE REPUBLICAN WHO INTRODUCED VIRGINIA'S "BATHROOM BILL."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, SOON THERE'LL BE ONE BATHROOM BOB MARSHALL CAN'T USE: THE ONE IN HIS OFFICE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) OF COURSE, THE BIG RACE IN VIRGINIA LAST NIGHT WAS FOR GOVERNOR, WHERE DEMOCRAT RALPH NORTHAM STOMPED REPUBLICAN ED GILLESPIE 54 TO 45 AND IT PROVES THE STATE'S OLD SAYING "VIRGINIA IS FOR LOVERS OF EVERYONE BUT ED GILLESPIE." ONE PERSON WHO SAID HE LOVED GILLESPIE WAS DONALD TRUMP, BUT THE SECOND GILLESPIE LOST, TRUMP THREW HIM UNDER THE TWEET BUS: "ED GILLESPIE WORKED HARD BUT DID NOT EMBRACE ME OR WHAT I STAND FOR." CLEARLY, IF HE WORKED HARD, ALSO--
Jon: OOOH! I GET IT, I GET IT.
Stephen: HE DOESN'T. ALSO, YOU'RE LYING. BECAUSE GILLESPIE COPIED YOUR WHOLE PLAYBOOK, "PORTRAYING NORTHAM AS ENABLING LATINO GANGS, HITTING N.F.L. PLAYERS FOR KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND PROMISING TO KEEP CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS UP." HE EVEN COPIED THE PART WHERE YOU LOST THE STATE OF VIRGINIA  (  LAUGHTER  ) WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, "IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OF YOU LOST THE STATE OF VIRGINIA." MR. TRUMP, ALL OF THESE ELECTIONS WERE ABOUT YOU. SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF VOTERS IN EACH STATE SAID TRUMP WAS A REASON FOR THEIR VOTE, WITH FAR MORE VOTING TO OPPOSE YOU THAN SUPPORT YOU. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH MAKING EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU, SIR. IT MEANS EVERYTHING, EVEN LOSING, IS ABOUT YOU. THAT'S THE DOWNSIDE OF NARCISSISM, ALONG--  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. YEAH. ALONG WITH NO ONE REALLY LOVING YOU.  ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY, AND TRUMP IS ALREADY THERE, BECAUSE HE'S IN ASIA. YESTERDAY, TOMORROW, TODAY, HE GAVE A BIG SPEECH TO SOUTH KOREA'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND PRAISED THE RESILIENCY OF THE SOUTH KOREAN PEOPLE.
IN LESS THAN ONE LIFETIME, SOUTH KOREA CLIMBED FROM TOTAL DEVASTATION TO AMONG THE WEALTHIEST NATIONS ON EARTH. LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS RISEN FROM JUST 53 YEARS TO MORE THAN 82 YEARS TODAY. LIKE KOREA, AND SINCE MY ELECTION EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO TODAY, I CELEBRATE WITH YOU.
Stephen: URRRR! THAT IS A HARD TURN FROM KOREAN LIFE EXPECTANCY TO "I WON THE ELECTION."  (  LAUGHTER  ) DO NOT HAVE THIS MAN GIVE THE TOAST AT YOUR WEDDING: "CONGRATULATIONS TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM. I HOPE THEY HAVE A LONG AND HAPPY MARRIAGE, AS HAPPY AS I WAS WHEN I HOSTED THE HIGHLY-RATED 'CELEBRITY APPRENTICE.' TOP REALITY SHOW OF ALL TIME, TREMENDOUS. I MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ THEN TRUMP CONTINUED TO TALK ABOUT HIMSELF.
THE UNITED STATES IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING OF A MIRACLE ITSELF.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. EVER SINCE YOU WERE ELECTED, ALL MY WATER TURNED TO WINE-- TECHNICALLY BOURBON, BUT I'M DRINKING A LOT OF IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN-- ♪ ♪ ♪ THEN THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING SOUTH KOREA: GOLF.
KOREAN GOLFERS ARE SOME OF THE BEST ON EARTH. IN FACT-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY.
Stephen: YES, SO PLEASE DON'T.
THE WOMEN'S U.S. OPEN WAS HELD THIS YEAR AT TRUMP NATIONAL GOLF CLUB IN BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY.
Stephen: NOW, IT MAY SOUND CRASS, BUT A LOT OF PRESIDENTS USE FOREIGN TRIPS TO HAWK THEIR PERSONAL PRODUCTS. REMEMBER, NIXON WENT TO CHINA, BUT HE WAS JUST THERE TO PROMOTE DICK NIXON'S SALAD FIXIN'S. "I AM NOT A CROUTON!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT THE BIG QUESTION GOING INTO TRUMP'S TRIP TO SOUTH KOREA WAS HOW HE'D DEAL WITH THE THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA. NOW, PAST PRESIDENTS HAVE MADE A POINT TO VISIT THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE ZONES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, OR THE D.M.Z., BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH. BUT LAST WEEK, BEFORE HE LEFT, THE PRESIDENT WAS PLAYING COY ABOUT A D.M.Z. VISIT.
THE D.M.Z., YES OR NO? ARE YOU GOING, YES OR NO?
WELL, I'D RATHER NOT SAY. BUT YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, SIR?
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.
Stephen: DOES DONALD TRUMP KNOW WHAT THE WORD "SURPRISE" MEANS? "I'D RATHER NOT SAY IF WE'RE THROWING YOU A PARTY. BUT ON YOUR BIRTHDAY, SHOW UP TO THE BOWLING ALLEY AT 5:00, AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED. ALSO, ALSO-- AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR ANY PARTICULAR REASON-- CAN YOU BRING SHEET CAKE?"  (  LAUGHTER  ) SOMETIMES-- SOMETIMES-- SOMETIMES I ENJOY THE JOKES TOO MUCH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) THEN, THIS MORNING, PRESS SECRETARY HARRAH-- I ALMOST SAID "HARRAH SUCKABEE SANDERS. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS-- IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT. GATHERED REPORTERS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OVER! IT'S OVER! WE HAD A GOOD RUN, TWO YEARS, TWO MONTHS. ANYWAY, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS GATHERED REPORTERS WHO WERE TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND MADE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT... SORT OF. BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A BIG SECRET "THAT SHE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT EVEN TO UTTER THE LOCATION ALOUD" AND SAID, "THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING" WHILE HOLDING UP A PIECE OF NOTEBOOK PAPER ON WHICH SHE HAD SCRAWLED THE LETTERS 'D.M.Z.'"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHICH, OF COURSE, STANDS FOR "WHERE'S THE FJORD?" IN CASE THEY'RE GOING TO NORWAY. IT WAS ALL GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN, UNTIL THE VISIT TO THE D.M.Z. WAS CALLED OFF DUE TO FOG. THAT'S RIGHT, NORTH KOREA! WATCH OUT KIM JONG-UN! DO NOT TEST DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE IF YOU DO, HE WILL RAIN DOWN FIRE AND FURY THE LIKES YOU'VE NEVER SEEN-- UNLESS IT'S MISTY. IN WHICH CASE, SEOUL IS ALL YOURS! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. NORMAN REEDUS IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, TRUMP VISITS CHINA, AND I'M VISITED BY A FRIENDLY HOBO. HE'S VERY NICE. STICK AROUND.  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, FOLKS. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, INFORMATION PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL OFF ON HIS TRIP THROUGH ASIA. HE ARRIVED TODAY IN CHINA, ALTHOUGH HE KEPT CALLING IT THAILAND BECAUSE IT'S WHERE THEY MAKE HIS TIES. HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIS OLD BUDDY CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING. THEY'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE XI VISITED MAR-A-LAGO AND TRUMP ASKED HIM HOW CHINA GOT MEXICO TO PAY FOR THEIR WALL. SEEING THE TWO TOGETHER, I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY BONDED, THEY'RE BOTH LEADERS OF SUPER POWERS. IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, A FRIEND, A BUDDY, THE KIND OF PERSON WHO CAN FINISH YOUR...
...PUDDING. PUDDING. HE CAN FINISH YOUR PUDDING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON STEWART, EVERYBODY! JON-- I DON'T KNOW IF I AM.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, JON, I GOTTA ASK-- PLEASE. HE'S HERE ALL THE TIME. SIT DOWN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JON STEWART, OBVIOUSLY. JON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UNDER MY DESK.

Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD ME TALK BUIN THAT? YOU ARE MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN MY FAVORITE MOVIE. I AM-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- HOW TO DESCRIBE HOW EXCITED I AM TO MEET YOU RIGHT NOW.

Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD DAD.
ELIZABETH, I LOVE YOU. NOW WE'LL WEIL GET BACK TO THE NORMAL PART. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS" THAN ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE "LORD OF THE RINGS" COMBINED GLI FOUND OUT-- AND IT ONLY SLIGHTLY BROKE MY HEART, THAT YOU-- WHEN YOU GOT THE PART, YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT "LORD OF THE RINGS."
MY DEGREE FROM U.C.L.A., IS IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HISTORY-- OR HISTORY IN AMERICAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE.
Stephen: OKAY.
IT'S A BRITISH-- IT'S AN ENGLISH STORY.
Stephen: YES, IT IS.
U.C.L.A., THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAD THEY KIND OF-- ACTUALLY, WHEN MY AGENT CALLED ME, SHE SAID, "HONEY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FLAWLESS BRITISH ACCENT BY TUESDAY." THIS IS EYE REAL CONVERSATION. AND I SAID OKAY. SHE SAID "PIERCE JACKSON IS DOING THE 'LORLD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY '" FOR NEW LINE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE "LORD OF THE RINGS" PART WAS. SHE SAID IT'S THE SEQUEL TO THE HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT. HONESTLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE "PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH. GLVMENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
Stephen: AT ANY POINT DID YOU READ THE BOOKS?
YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD.
I-- I-- THERE WERE SOME THAT DIDN'T.
Stephen: SOME ON THE-- IN THE CAST?
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.
Stephen: WHO DIDN'T READ THEM.
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.
BUT I READ THEM COVER TO COVER THREE TIMES, AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM. TO ME, IT WASN'T LIKE BEING TRANSPORTED INTO ANOTHER WORLD. IT WAS LIKE WORK, YOU KNOW. IT WAS LIKE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOULD HE HOLD THE PIPE? YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD --
Stephen: RIGHT.
HOW WOULD-- ALL THE LITTLE-- THE LITTLE YOU IN GLANSZ THEY CHANGED A FEW THINGS ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER.
OKAY, GO ON. AND I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU BY THE WAY.
Stephen: I'D LOVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS, BE A GUEST ON MY OWN SHOW.
SORRY.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER, YOUR VERSION OF SAM, YOU CALL HIM MISTER FROADO, IN THE SCRIPT HE WAS MASTER.
I THINK I SAY MASTER SOMETIMES. THEY'RE LONG, YOU CAN'T WATCH ALL THE THEM AT ONCE --
Stephen: YES, YOU CAN. YOU CAN WATCH ALL OF THEM AT ONCE. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE PANTS ON.  ( LAUGHTER ).
APPARENTLY, THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.
Stephen: EXACTLY. ARE YOU YOUR OWN FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM "LORD OF THE RINGS." SAM IS THE HERO, TOLKIEN HIMSELF SAID SAM IS THE HERO OF "LORD OF THE RINGS."
I THINK THAT SAM WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WANT TO BE CONSIDERED HERO OF THAT STORY SO MY OFFICIAL, ON-THE-RECORD ANSWER IS NO. I HAVE TWO FAVORITE CHARACTERS. GOLUM, THE STINKER, EVEN THOUGH HE KEEPS CALLING ME STUPID, FAT HOBBIT, IT'S ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING CHARACTERS. AND TREE BEARD.
Stephen: SURE, YEAH.
I LOVE TREE BEARD. AND SOOTS SO KIND OF-- I GUESS IT'S SORT OF TYPICAL AND POLITICAL WHATEVER. DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WHEN YOU GO ACROSS ENGLAND, THE SMOKESTACKS BELCHING, AND PEOPLE WERE HAVING LUNG PROBLEMS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, AND TOLKIEN WROTE THIS STORY, AND IN THE STORY HE CREATES THESE TREES, THESE SLOW, LUMBERING, THINKING, TALKING TREES THAT WERE JUST LIKE MY DAD-- REMEMBER JOHN AFTIN, GOMEZ.
Stephen: YES.
HE'S AN IMP. AND THAT'S IT, I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT, MY DAD IS TREE BEARD. AND THEY COME TO LIFE AND FIGHT TO DEFEND --
Stephen: THE FOREST.
THE FOREST AND, YEAH, AND ACCIDENT SCENEY AND STUFF. SO I JUST LOVE THE IDEA OF, LIKE, WHETHER OR NOT MAN WANTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PART IN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, THE ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T CARE. IT'S GOING TO COME-- IT'S GOING TO RISE UP AND PROTECT ITSELF.
Stephen: I HOPE SO.  ( APPLAUSE ) I HOPE SO.
IT WILL.
Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS."
YEAH, "STRANGER THINGS."
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE ON "STRANGER THINGS," SECOND SEASON. IT'S SET IN THE 80s. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ONE OF THE STARS OF THE GOONIES, AND OTHER THINGS LIKE ""E" "T"" ARE BIG INFLUENCES ON THIS SHOW. WHEN YOU'RE IN IT, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS REALLY FAMILIAR TO ME?
YES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT-- WHAT'S SO COOL IS THE DUFFER BROTHERS WHO CREATED IT, THEY'RE SO SWEET AND SUCH BEAUTIFUL GUYS. AND YOU'RE STANDING THERE AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT, LIKE, A RADIO SHACK OR, YOU KNOW, A GREMLIN CAR OR ALL THESE KIND OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE-- AND THEIR IDEA, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE UNPACKING ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND OR SOMETHING. THIS GREAT DISCOVERY. THEY HAVE, LIKE, HISTORICAL ADVISERS ON THE SET TO TALK ABOUT WHAT POSTERS WOULD BE RIGHT TO GO ON THE SET. SO TO ME, LIKE, THE 80s IS-- WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE, BUT TO ME THE 80s IS-- HE'S KIND OF TIMEs, RIGHT? LIKE, YOU CAN'T EVEN--  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) YOU ARE. YOU ARE. ANYHOW, IT IS-- YES, IT IS A WONDERFUL THING TO WORK WITH THESE YOUNG PERFORMERS, AND WYNONNA RIDER AND THE FANS LOVE IT TO DEATH, AND I'M JUST BLESSED AGAIN TO BE INVITED TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SPECIAL.
Stephen: WELL, WE'RE BLESSED THAT YOU ARE. LOVELY TO SEE YOU, SEAN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: "STRANGER THINGS" IS ON NETFLIX NOW. SEAN ASTIN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE FROM COMEDIAN PAT McGANN.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"."
Stephen: FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST IS A COMEDIAN COMING TO US FROM CHICAGO. PLEASE WELCOME, PAT McGANN! ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
ALL RIGHT! I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. IT'S GOOD TO BE OUT, RIGHT, JUST GOOD TO BE OUT. GOT KIDS AT HOME. MY WIFE AND I HAVE THREE, THREE UNDER FOUR. YEAH, THAT'S HOW PEOPLE REACT. SOME PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT IT'S LIKE. HERE'S A FAST FACT-- 75% OF THE ASSES I WIPE, AREN'T MINE. ( LAUGHTER ) I GOT ONE IN PRESCHOOL. ONE FROM PRE-PRESCHOOL. DID YOU KNOW THAT EXISTED, PRE-PRESCHOOL. MY WIFE IS LIKE, "HE WANTS TO GO. WE HAVE TO SIGN HIM UP. HE WANTS TO GO TO SCHOOL." HE WANTS TO GO TO SCHOOL? HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL IS. HE WANTS TO GO TO SCHOOL, WALK HIM OUT TO THE GARAGE, HERE WE ARE. THIS IS OUR FIRST DAY. HERE'S A BROOM. WE'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SWEEP TODAY. "HE MIGHT BE GIFTED." THAT'S WHAT MY WIFE SAID. HE WAS EATING A CRAYON YESTERDAY, A PURPLE ONE, LOOKS LIKE YOU AFTER A GLASS OF WINE. SOMETIMES WE'LL TAKE ONE. YOU KNOW, I'LL TAKE ONE, MY WIFE WILL TAKE ONE, KIND OF DIVIDE AND CONQUER. SHE TOOK MY DAUGHTER OUT THE OTHER NEED AND SENT A TEXT, "STAYING OUT, THOUGHT YOU GUYS MIGHT LIKE SOME BOY TIME." REALLY, THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S BOY TIME. TEXT ME WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE SO I CAN GET RID OF ALL THE STRIPPERS AND BLOW. "BOY TIME?" WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? WATCH A GAME? THROW THE BALL AROUND. STAND ON THE CHAIR AND FLICK THE LIGHT SWITCH ON AND OFF? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET INTO? TAKE ALL THE KLEENEX OUT OF THE BOX, ONE MY ONE? THAT'S AWESOME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I'LL JUST STUFF THEM BACK IN THERE. I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE HANGING OUT WITH THE FELL AS.  ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT TO VEGAS. I GET IT. SOME OF YOU DON'T HAVE CIZ KIDS. JUST PAY ATTENTION ANYWAY. I'M FROM THE FUTURE.  ( LAUGHTER ) PROBABLY IN YOUR 20s? ENJOY THAT. I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT MY 20s AT HOME. I MET MY WIFE WHEN I WAS 31. SOMETIMES SHE'LL ASK ME, "WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN YOUR 20s?" I'M JUST LIKE, "NOTHING. I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN MEXICO ONE WEEKEND."  (  LAUGHTER  ) YEAH, NOW IT'S JUST ALL ABOUT THE KID, YOU KNOW. AND WE'RE EXHAUSTED. WE ARGUE, WE LOVE EACH OTHER. SHE TRIED TO INSULT ME THE OTHER DAY. SHE SAID, "YOU'RE NOT ORGANIZED." I SAID, "OUCH. I'M NOT ORGANIZED." SHE ACTS LIKE WE MET AT THE CONTAINER STORE. I MET TERAT A BAR AT NOON. MAYBE THAT'S A SIGN I HAVE CRAP ON MY DRERS. I'M NOT PUTTING THEM TO BED TONIGHT, SO THAT MAKES ME HAPPY NORTH PUTTING MY KIDS TO BEDDA. THAT'S THE WORST. YOU HAVE TO LIE TO THEM. THAT'S WHAT WE DO, LIE EVERY DAY. WE'RE JUST LIKE, "BIG DAY TOMORROW."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "GET SOME REST. YOU'VE GOT A BIG DAY TOMORROW. BIG DAY! YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP AND CRY ABOUT BROCCOLI. AND KEEP US FROM HAVING SEX  (  LAUGHTER  ) SOMETIMES THEY DO HAVE BIG DAYS, THOUGH, THESE KIDS. OVER-SCHEDULED. LAST WEEK MY WIFE WAS LIKE, "YOU HAVE TO BRING HER TO MUSIC, THEN SWIMMING, THEN GIOF GYMNASTICS. WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET A CALENDAR." "NO, WE SHOULD PROBABLY CANCEL SOME STUFF. START WITH GYMNASTICS. THAT DOESN'T RUN IN OUR FAMILY. I FEEL LIKE YOU SIGN YOUR KID UP FOR GYMNASTICS YOU HAVE BRING THE PARN IN THE ROOM TEST THE GENE POOL. CARTWHEEL, NO, ALL RIGHT, WE CAN'T ACCEPT YOUR CHILD.  ( LAUGHTER ) MY DAUGHTER HAD BALLET, AND MY WIFE IS LIKE, "GET HER DRESSED. SHE'S GOT BALLET." I SAID, "REALLY, I HAVE TO GET HER DRESSED? MAYBE THAT'S A SIGN THESE SHOOEZ NOT READY FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS. MAYBE I SHOULD BRING HER TO 'HOW TO GET DRESSED'. AND THEN I'LL DROP HER OFF AT 'LISTENING'."  (  LAUGHTER  ) YEAH, SHE DOESN'T LISTEN SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW. SHE'S IN THE BATH THE OTHER NIGHT, MY DAUGHTER. "COME OUT OF THE BATH." "NO,." "OUT OF THE TUB." NO I'M STAYING THERE FOR A COUPLE OF WHIELZ. FINE STAY IN THERE A COUPLE OF WHILES. THAT'S HOW CRAZY IT IS. YOU START SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE. AND I'M STANDING THERE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG A COUPLE OF WHILES IS, SO I JUST WAIT A WHILE, TWICE. LAUGH JUST ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THAT'S MY LIFE NOW. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. WHEN YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS, YOU ANSWER A MILLION QUESTIONS. EVERY DAY IS A HUGE PRESS CONFERENCE. IT STARTS IN THE MORNING "HOW COME THERE ARE HOLES IN MY CHEERIOS." "JUST EAT IT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR? THAT'S PROFIT FOR GENERAL MILLS" MY SON WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE INSIDE OF OUR WINDOWS WERE FROSTED. DUDE, THAT'S SCIENCE. I WENT TO CAG SCHOOL. NO CLUE.  ( LAUGHTER ) "WHEN IS MAGOING TO BE MOMENT?" THAT'S A BIG ONE I GET. "WHEN IS MOM GOING TO BE HOME?" "DON'T YOU THINK I'M WONDERING THE SAME THING. I DON'T KNOW. HOW ABOUT THIS, WHEN I START PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU, SHE'S CLOSE."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) WHEN I PUT MY PHONE ON THE COUNTER, SHE'S IN THE DRIVEWAY! YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. THANK YOU.
