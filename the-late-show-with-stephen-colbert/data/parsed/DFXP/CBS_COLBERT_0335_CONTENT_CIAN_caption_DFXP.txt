Stephen: WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT IT IT IS DAY-- (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: IT IS DAY 100-- 102 OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY, 1,358 DAYS TO GO. BUT WHO'S COUNTING? (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NOW TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT THIS HUNDRED DAY THING IS TOTALLY ARBITRARY, OKAY. TOTAL LEER UNIMPORTANT. AND TO PROVE HOW UNIMPORTANT IT IS, HE TOOK OUT A TV AD, HE CUT A CAKE ON AIR FORCE ONE, AND HE HELD A RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE THEME OF THAT RALLY, PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. WHICH IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL SLOGAN, PROMISES MADE, NEVER MIND, NEVER SAID IT, FAKE NEWS, WATCH FOX AND FRIENDS. SO, NICE, GOT A RHYTHM. (APPLAUSE) HE ALSO PROVED JUST HOW UNIMPORTANT THIS WAS WITH A BUNCH OF INTERVIEWS OVER THE WEEKEND. FIRST ON FRIDAY HE TALKED WITH REUTERS ABOUT HIS NEW JOB.
WELL, I LOVE MY-- I LOVED MY PREVIOUS LIFE, I LOVED MY PREVIOUS LIFE. HI SO MANY THINGS GOING. I ACTUALLY, THIS IS MORE WORK THAN MY PREVIOUS LIFE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER.
Stephen: HUH. HOW ABOUT THAT?
Jon: HE THOUGHT IT IT WOULD BE EASIER.
Stephen: IT IT TURNS OUT BEING LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD IS HARDER THAN LICENSING YOUR NAME TO LUXURY MEAT. DELICIOUS. BUTS THAT HE'S NOT ALL. HE TRUMPED ON.
I THOUGHT IT IT WAS MORE-- I'M A DETAILS ORIENTED PERSON, I THINK YOU WOULD SAY THAT. BUT I DO MISS MY OLD LIFE.
Stephen: WE ALL DO, SIR. WE ALL MISS IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I GET WHY HE MISSES IT, I GET IT MAN. BECAUSE IN HIS OLD LIFE HE COULD SPEND HIS DAYS GOLFING, INSULTING PEOPLE ON TWITTER AND HANGING OUT WITH HIS FAMILY. ALSO, NOW. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON HE'S BUMMED. IT'S ALSO BECAUSE, I CAN'T DRIVE ANY MORE. AND YOU KNOW HE DROVE ALL THE TIME. HE WAS A GREAT DRIVER. JUST LOOK HOW COMFORTABLE HE IS BEHIND THE BHEEL. (LAUGHTER) -- WHEEL. THAT'S PACKLY HOW I DRIVE. HANDS AT 7 AND 5, MOUTH OPEN, SCREAMING. AAHHH! RED LIGHTED! THANKS, OBAMA.
Jon: OPEN ROAD.
Stephen: OF COURSE HE ADDRESSED THE PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENT OF HIS PRESIDENCY, EXISTING. BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF DISCUSSING CHINESE AMERICAN RELATIONS WITH THE REUTERS REPORTERS STOPPED TO HAND OUT COPIES OF WHAT HE SAID WERE THE LATEST FIGURES OF THE 2016 ELECTORAL MAP SAYING PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT, THE RED IS OBVIOUSLY US. THE BLUE, OBVIOUSLY DEMOCRATS, EXCEPT WHEN IT'S WATER, HARD TO TELL. AQUA MAN, PERSONAL FRIEND, GREAT GUY. PROBABLY. PROBABLY. (APPLAUSE) THERE IS EVEN A PICTURE.
I COLORED THESE MYSELF. THESE ARE ALL-- THESE ARE ALL PLACEMATS. I HAD THEM-- I HAD THEM-- CAN YOU PUT THAT PHOTO BACK UP. THIS IS MY IMPRESSION OF A T-REX, LITTLE HANDS, LIKE THIS, LIKE-- (APPLAUSE) LIKE THIS.
Stephen: EVERYTHING IS IN HERE. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THE OFFICIAL DEFINING HUNDRED DAYS INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE RIGHT HERE ON CBS WITH THE NATION FACE HIMSELF JOHN DICKERSON YESTERDAY. AND HE STARTED OFF WITH NORTH KOREA.
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION SAID TO NORTH KOREA, DON'T TEST A MISSILE. THEY HAVE TESTED A MISSILE. IS THE PRESSURE NOT WORKING?
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY DON'T TEST A MISSILE. HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT HE HAS TO DO.
Stephen: SO YOU ARE OFFICIAL POLICY IS, YOU DO YOU. WHAT CAN I SAY, HITLER GONNA HITLER. KIM JONG GONNAU N.
THEN OUR FRIEND JOHN DICKERSON ASKED TRUMP WHAT HE THOUGHT OF KIM JONG UN.
I CAN TELL IT YOU THIS, A THE LO OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHEN I SAY IT IT HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF 26 OR 27 WHEN HE TOOK OVER FROM HIS FATHER. A LOT OF PEOPLE, I'M SURE, TRIED TO TAKE THAT POWER AWAY. WHETHER IT IT WAS HIS UNCLE OR ANYBODY ELSE. AND HE WAS ABLE TO DO IT. SO OBVIOUSLY HE'S A PRETTY SMART COOKIE.
Stephen: SO, TRUMP THINKS-- NO, NO, TRUMP THINGS KIM JONG UNIS A SMART COOKIE TO WHICH ALL OF NORTH KOREA REPLIED, COOKIE? HE'S A MONSTER. THE POINT IS HE IS A MONSTER. FAT LITTLE MONSTER. NOW DICKERSON GAMELY TRIED TO GET TRUMP TO COMMIT TO RELEASING HIS TAX RETURN FINALLY BUT IT IT WAS THE SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE ABOUT UNDER AUDIT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO REPHRASE THE QUESTION. MR. PRESIDENT, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR TAX RETURNS AS A METAPHOR FOR YOUR PENIS.
I HAVE A VERY BIG TAX RETURN. YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURE, MY TAX RETURN IS PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THAT, FROM THE FLOOR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE'S TAX RETURN, EVEN OTHER WEALTHY PEOPLE, THEIR TAX RETURN IS THIS THING. MY TAX RETURN IS THIS HIGH.
Stephen: WE GET IT. YOU HAVE A HUGE TAX RETURN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NICE, A FULL RELEASE. PLAWTION (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THERE ST. SORRY-- SO I HEARD. I WOULDN'T KNOW. I'M FLAT ERRED BUT I'M NOT INTO THAT SCENE. LATER IN THE SAME INTERVIEW TRUMP GAVE DICKERSON A TOUR OF THE OVAL OFFICE.
THIS IS THE RESOLUTE DESK T SAY GREAT DESK WITH A PHENOMENAL HISTORY. THIS WAS FDR, IT WAS RONALD REAGAN, IT WAS KENNEDY. THERE ARE SOME GREAT PRESIDENTS BEHIND THIS DESK.
Stephen: HE YES, AND IF YOU PUT YOUR EAR TO IT LIKE A SEA SHELL, YOU CAN HEAR ALL OF THEM ROLLING IN THEIR GRAVE. AND PRESIDENT TRUMP-- (APPLAUSE) AND PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPLAINED THAT VISITORS ARE AWED BY THE POWER OF THE OVAL OFFICE.
IN ONE CASE I WON'T SAY WHO, SOMEBODY YOU KNOW VERY WELL, THE HEAD OF A MAJOR, MAJOR COMPANY. THE PERSON CAME INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND STARTED TO CRY. THIS IS A TOUGH PERSON, BY THE WAY. CAME INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND STARTED TO CRY.
Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, IF I CAME TO THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAW YOU SITTING BEHIND THE DESK, I WOULD CRY TOO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NOW THERE WAS A NICE MOMENT WHEN JOHN DICKERSON TALKED ABOUT SOME PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS THOUGHTS WITH TRUMP, OTHER MEN WHO HAVE STOOD IN THAT ROOM AND THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENCIMENT BUT I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR SURE THAT DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTOOD THE MESSAGEMENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAID THE REASON THE OVAL OFFICE IS ROUND IS THERE ARE NO CORNERS YOU CAN BEHIND IN.
IN IS TRUTH TO THAT. THERE ARE CERTAINLY NO CORNERS.
Jon: WAIT, WAIT, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY, LET'S BE POSITIVE. AT LEAST HE KNOWS HIS SHAPES. HE KNOWS OVAL, OKAY. HE KNOWS THE PENTAGON. AND RHOMBUS, BECAUSE IT'S REINCE PRIEBUS' MIDDLE NAME, REINCE RHOMBUS PRIEBUS. AND OT SUBJECT OF PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS, DICKERSON ASKED TRUMP IF HE STILL STANDS BY CLAIMS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WIRETAPPED HIM.
DO YOU STAND BY THAT CLAIM.
I DON'T STAND BY ANYTHING.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. HE DOESN'T STAND BY ANYTHING, EXCEPT THE DRESSING ROOM DOOR AT MISS U.S.A. PAGEANT. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHO NEEDS SOME LOTION. BUT BASED ON A TRUE STORY, THAT JOKE. BUT DICKERSON ASKED HIS QUESTION ANYWAY.
BUT I'M ASKING YOU. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ME.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS AM YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN OPINIONS.
BUT I WANT TO KNOW YOUR OPINIONS, YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STAITLE.
THAT'S ENOUGH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: CAN'T TALK ANY MORE, NO, CAN'T TALK ANY MORE. IMPORTANT-- IMPORTANT PRESIDENCY WORK HERE. GOT TO PRESIDENT ALL OVER THESE PAPERS HERE. LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE, WHAT THIS, YES, STILL PAPER, STILL BLANK PAPER, NOTHING ON THERE, LET'S SEE, LET ME READ THIS PRESIDENTIAL BRIEFING. YEAH, I GOT THE BRIEFING RIGHT HERE. I GOT THE BRIEFING, YES, IT'S TRUE, WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YES, OH, OH, YEAH, SORRY, JOHN, CAN'T TALK, GOT TO-- GOT TO DO SOMETHING, GOT TO-- GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE NATION OF CHARMINISTAN, SORRY ABOUT THAT. WE MUST WIPE THEM OFF THE MAP, UH-HUH. IS DICKERSON STILL OVER THERE, I DON'T WANT TO LOOK. IS HE STILL-- BRRRING, BRR,ING, SORRY, HELLO, HELLO, YES, A VERY SECURE PHONE, YES, THIS IS DONALD TRUMP.

ALL RIGHT. DO WE HAVE A REVERSE SHOT, JIM? YEAH, THERE YOU GO. BUT I GOT TO SAY, WALKING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE WASN'T EVEN THE PRESIDENT'S BIGGEST INSULT TO JOHN DICKERSON.
AND I THINK ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY FUNNY WHEN THE FAKE MEDIA GOES OUT, WHICH WE CALL THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, WHICH SOMETIMES I MUST SAY IS YOU.
YOU MEAN ME PERSONALLY.
WELL, YOUR SHOW, I LOVE YOUR SHOW. I CALL IT DEFACE THE NATION.
Stephen: REALLY. DONALD TRUMP-- JOHN DICKERSON IS A FAIR-MINDED JOURNALIST. AND ONE THE MOST COMPETENT PEOPLE WHO WILL EVER WALK INTO YOUR OFFICE AND YOU TREAT HIM LIKE THAT? NOW, JOHN DICKERSON HAS WAY TOO MUCH DIGNITY TO TRADE INSULTS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO HIS FACE. BUT I, SIR, AM NO JOHN DICKERSON. (APPLAUSE) AND WHEN YOU, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMETHING WE CALL THE TIFFANY WAY. WHEN YOU INSULT ONE MEIVE THE CBS FAMILY, YOU INSULT US ALL, BA ZYNGA, ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: GET THE GLOVES OFF.
Stephen: MR. TRUMP, YOUR PRESIDENCY, I LOVE YOUR PRESIDENCY. I CALL IT IT DES GRACE THE NATION. -- YOU ARE NOT THE POTUS, ARE YOU THE BLOTUS, ARE YOU THE GLUT ON WITH THE BUTTON. ARE YOU A REGULAR GORGE WASHINGTON. ARE YOU THE PRESI-DUNCE, BUT ARE TURN ITING TOO A REAL PRIK-TALT TATOR. SIR, YOU ATTRACT MORE SKIN HEADS THAN FREE ROGAINE. YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE MARCHING AGAINST YOU THAN CANCER. YOU TALK LIKE A SIGN LANGUAGE GORILLA WHO GOT HID IN THE HEAD. IN FACT THE ONLY THING YOUR MOUTH IS GOOD FOR IS BEING A PUTTIN'S [BLEEP] HOLSTER. YOUR PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY, IS GOING TO BE A KID'S MENU AN A COUPLE OF JU GG'S MAGAZINE. THE ONLY THING SMALLER THAN YOUR HANDS IS YOUR TAX RETURN. AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT ANYWAY YOU WANT. WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. CHRIS PRATT IS HERE. AND SO IS NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. WHEN YOU COME BACK, I WILL BE RIGHT HERE WITH HISTORY LESSONS FOR DONALD TRUMP. STICK AROUND.

Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR. NOW JON, I JUST HAVE A COUPLE-- I JUST GOT A COUPLE MORE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT DONE ALL TRUMP WHILE WE'RE AT IT, IF YOU DON'T MIND. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I JUST DON'T WANT TO LET THESE GO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DONE ALL TRUMP ON THE SHOW FOR AWHILE. AND I'M SURE YOU ARE SAYING TO YOURSELF, BUT WAIT, STEPHEN, WHEN IS DONE ALL TRUMP GOING TO WAY IN ON CIVIL WAR HISTORY. (LAUGHTER) I'M GOING TO PRETEND IT YOU'RE THINKING THAT. WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK BECAUSE JUST THIS MORNING THE TRUMP SOUND BITE TRAIN PULLED INTO SIRIOUS RADIO.
WE HAD ANDREW JACKSON BEEN A LITTLE BIT LATER YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE CIVIL WAR. AND HE WAS-- HE WAS REALLY ANGRY THAT HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH REGARD TO THE CIVIL WAR. HE SAID THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS.
Stephen: EXACTLY. EXACTLY. ANDREW JACKSON SAID THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS, OKAY. HE SAID WE DON'T NEED A CIVIL WAR. ALL MY SLAVES ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY. NOW AND ONE RARELY HEARS THIS, IN FAIRNESS TO ANDREW JACKSON, I'M NOT-- I'M NOT SURPRISED HE DIDN'T STOP THE CIVIL WAR GIVEN THAT HE DIED 16 YEARS BEFORE IT STARTED. OR AS DONALD TRUCH WOULD PUT IT, I PREFER PRESIDENT WAS DON'T DIE. THEN DONALD TRUMP WRAPPED UP HIS CIVIL WAR SIM POSIUM WITH A GROUND-BREAKING QUESTION.
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, YOU KNOW, THE CIVIL WAR, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHY. PEOPLE DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION. BUT WHY WAS THERE THE CIVIL WAR.
Stephen: IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF OUR TIME. WHY WAS THERE A CIVIL WAR. ALSO, WHO MURDERED THE TITANIC. WE'LL NEVER KNOW. WE'LL NEVER KNOW. AND BECAUSE-- (APPLAUSE) NO WAY OF KNOWING. NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED, JON, NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED THE QUESTION.
Jon: NOT ONCE.
Stephen: AND BECAUSE WE CAN NEVER KNOW THE CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR.
SLAVERY, SLAVERY, IT WAS SLAVERY!
Stephen: HEY, GHOST OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, EVERYBODY. I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, SIR, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?
SLAVERY, THE CIVIL WAR HAPPENED BECAUSE OF SLAVERY.
Stephen: YES, BUT WHY? UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED THAT.

Stephen: I DO, CUZ I FEEL LIKE, THE STRANGE THING ABOUT CHRIS PRATT RIGHT BEFORE HE CAME OUT HERE. THIS WILL BE FUN, I KNOW CHRIS, CHRIS AND I ARE FRIENDS, NO, I MET YOU LIKE THREE TIMES.
OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS THOUGH.
Stephen: BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M YOUR FRIEND, AND I THINK THAT IS YOUR MAGIC AS A PERFORMER, AS ANDY OR A STAR LORD, I KNOW THAT DUDE, I HUNG OUT WITH THAT DUDE.
THANK YOU, I WILL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.
Stephen: IT IS A COMPLIMENT, LIKE ARE YOU TOTALLY.
AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU. AND YOU ARE RIGHT, WE HAVEN'T SPENT TIME AT EACH OTHER'S HOMES. I DON'T HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER OR ANYTHING. MAYBE THAT COULD CHANGE.
Stephen: YOU WANT THAT.
I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GET STEPHEN'S NUMBER. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: SUPER EASY, SUPER EASY TO MEMORIZE.
DO I SHOW THE CAMERA?
Stephen: WHAT?
DON'T HOLD THAT UP. ONE AT A TIME.
Stephen: BUT WE DID, WE DID A-- BEFORE WE DID THE STRANGERS OF CANDY MOVIE BACK IN 9 DAY. I REMEMBER THERE IS THIS YOUNG KID WITH ALL THIS ENERGY AND YOU CAME BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF SHOOTING, YOU WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAME BACK, I MIGHT BE SUPERMAN, IT WAS A-- THAT SUPERMAN, THAT ERA. AND I THOUGHT I COULD TOTALLY SEE THAT GUY AS A SUPERHERO.
CASTING DIRECT DISER NOT AGREE.
Stephen: BUT THEY WERE WRONG, BUT NOW ARE YOU, THE ULTIMATE SUPERMAN. STAR LORD, YOU KNOW.
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL DIVINELY PLANNED. SO IF IT'S NOT WORKING OUT IN THE MOMENT, JUST HAVE FAITH THAT IT IT CAN, IT MIGHT WORK OUT IN THE FUTURE AND THE NOS THAT YOU GET TODAY MIGHT MEAN AN EVEN MORE POWERFUL YES IN THE FUTURE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: I DO. I DO. I THINK, IF I'M-- IF I'M HEARING YOU CORRECTLY, YOU ARE SAYING THAT GOD WANTED THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY TO BE MADE. LET'S JUST LEAVE IT THERE.
YEAH, I'M WITH IT. HE IS A BIG FAN.
Stephen: YEAH, WELL, EVERYBODY. THIS IS A HUGE MOVIE. AND NOT JUST LIKE UNITED STATES HUGE, THIS IS LIKE CHINA HUGE AND LIKE BRAZIL HUGE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND JAPAN, EVERYWHERE WE OWE MONEY, HUGE. SO WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR YOU TO GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD? DOES EVERYBODY KNOW YOU NOW AS STAR LORD?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE I HAVE THE BEST GAUGE BECAUSE WHEN I GO TO PLACES, IT'S NOT AS IF I'M GOING TO TRAVEL. I'M REALLY GOING TO PROMOTE A MOVIE. I LIKE TO SAY I'M NOT NECESSARILY TRAVELING SOME WHERE IT'S MORE I'M SHIPPED SOMEWHERE, YOU KNOW. AND WHEN I ARRIVE, THE CITY WE'RE ARRIVING KNOWS WE'RE COME SOG THERE WILL BE PEOPLE AT THE AIRPORT DRESSED UP, LIKE THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. I THINK I HAVE A SKEWED PERFECT-- PERSPECTIVE. IF I JUST WENT SOMEWHERE ON MY OWN WHICH I REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SO BUSY. I DON'T THINK IT IT WOULD BE SO HEIGHTENED. BUT I GET THEY ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET WHEN YOU ARRIVE.

Stephen: WELL, SO IT IT IS YOU WILL KAD GUARDIANS OF THE GAL OOKSY VOLUME 2.

Stephen: IT IT CALMED THE SAME THING EVERYWHERE YOU GO OR IS IT LIKE STAR CLUSTER CARETAKERS OR BRADLEY COOPER'S HIDDEN KA RON FACE-- RACCOON FACE WHAT IS IT CALLED?
WE DO HAVE-- THERE'S ONE CALLED THE-- I BELIEVE IT'S IN MANDARIN, IT'S CALLED LIKE THE SILVER RIVER PROTECTION TEAM, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: I WOULD WATCH THAT.
I WOULD WATCH THAT.
Stephen: SILVER RIVER-- BECAUSE THEY CALL THE MILKY WAY THE SIFERL RIVER.
THAT MUST BE-- IS THAT WHY?
Stephen: I JUST MADE THAT UP.
IT IT MAKES SENSE.
Stephen: I'LL ASK NEIL.

YOU'RE NOT A SUPERHERO.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE YOU WANT HIM TO THIFER YOU AS YOUR DAD NOT AS A GUY ON THE SCREEN.

Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE HONEST. YOU'RE HONEST.

Stephen: SO YOU AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY,ANA FERRIS YOUR LOVELY WIFE AND YOUR SON JACK. YOU GOT A STAR ON THE 408EEWOOD WALK OF FAME, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU. YEAH. LOOK AT THAT.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?
IN THAT MOMENT RIGHT THERE, IT FEELS REALLY NICE, BEING ABLE TO SHARE IT IT, A MOMENT LIKE THAT WITH-- I FEEL LIKE IF NONE OF MY FAMILY WAS THERE, I WOULDN'T REALLY FEEL ANYTHING. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS-- THIS KIND OF TIDAL WAVE THAT HAS HIT MY LIFE IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF OR SO. OR LIKE A HURRICANE OR SOMETHING. YOU JUST HUNKER DOWN AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CALM IN THE MIDDLE. AND EVERYTHING IS GOING WILD AROUND YOU. AND ARE YOU LIKE, IT DOESN'T EVEN FEEL THAT WINDY AND YOU SEE A SIGN FLY BY, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY. AND YOU SEE A COW FLY BY, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S IN THOSE MOMENTS WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FRIENDS, WHERE YOU ACTUALLY STOP FOR A SECOND AND ENJOY THE MOMENT, BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING A MOMENT AS WELL, YOU KNOW, WITH YOU. YOU SHARE THE MOMENT SO YOU KIND OF BECOME PRESENT IN THE MOMENT AND THAT'S REALLY NICE. AND THAT STAR IS TWO BLOCKS FROM AN APARTMENT I LIVED IN, ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO, A REALLY, REALLY PRETTY DUMPY APARTMENT. AND THAT AREA HAS CHANGED A WHOLE LOT SINCE I MOVED OUT OF THERE. IT HAS REALLY BECOME MUCH NICER AND STUFF. I USED TO WALK RIGHT OVER THAT SIDEWALK.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU NEAR, ANYBODY GOOD?
I'M NEAR KELLY RIPA.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S PRETTY COOL. SO WHEN PEOPLE COME TO SEE KELLY RIPA THEY WILL WALK RIGHT OVER ME.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO GO IN A MINUTE. BUT BEFORE WE GO, THE MOVIE HAS GOT AN AMAZING SOUNDTRACK JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME, LIKE VOLUME ONE. MAKING A MIX TAPE FOR SOMEONE IS REALLY INTIMATE.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU MAKE MIX TAPES FOR YOUR WIFE ANNA?
YOU KNOW, I DID ONCE. I DID ONCE, I DID ONE FOR MY BROTHER FIRST. AND IT WAS AN '80S MIX, SONGS, CALLED I GUESS HAD TO BE THERE, MIX, SONGS THAT JUST WORKED. I KNEW THEY WOULD CREATE THE SAME MEMORIES, CONJURE THE SAME MEMORIES, IT WOULD BE SENTIMENTAL FOR HIM, I GAVE IT IT TO HIM. HE CALLED ME, BRO, I'M CRYING. AND I'M LIKE I'M THE MIX TAPE GUY. I AM GOING TO DO ONE FOR ANNA. AND I MADE ONE FOR HER AND I PLAYED IT AND I WAS THINKING IN MY HEAD, LIKE, THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR LOVER-MAKING MIX, YOU KNOW. AND THE FIRST SONG I PUT WAS-- .
Stephen: GOOD TIP.
WELL, I THOUGHT-- I DECIDED TO PUT AL GREEN.
Stephen: SURE, LET'S STAY TOGETHER.
AND YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S-- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, GIRL-- I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU. ♪ AND. I WISH, I WISH SHE REACTED THAT WAY. SHE WAS KIND OF LOOKING AT ME AND I COULD TELL RIGHT A WHAT, BIG MISS, BIG MISS. IT'S A LONG SONG. AND I WAS LIKE-- WHATEVER YOU.
WHO ARE YOU? YOU DON'T LISTEN AL GREEN, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL. SHE IS LIKE WE'RE ALREADY MARRIED, IT'S COOL. I'M GOING TO GIVE IT IT UP.  AND THAT WAS THE FIRST SONG AND ONLY SONG WE GOT THREW AND I THREW IT AWAY. I WAS SO EMBARRASSED, IT WAS CRUSHING-- .
Stephen: WAS THE SONG IT LONG, WERE YOU SAYING.
FOR ME IT IT IS THE WRONG HUMPING TEMPO.
Stephen: WRONG WHAT?
THE WRONG HUMPING TEMPO.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU LIKE, WHAT DO YOU LIKE.
I NEED SOME EDM, NO, JUST KIDDING.
Stephen: GOOD GALLUP OVER THERE. Z WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, VOLUME 2 OPENS FRIDAY, CHRIS PRATT, EVERYBODY. WE'LL RIGHT BACK WITH NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. THANKS, MAN.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CHRIS PRATT OF ASTROPHYSICS, PLEASE WELCOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK, NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, IT'S ORION AND-- YEAH, IT IS BEAUTIFUL, THE SHOW IS ROCKIN' TONIGHT. OH MY GOSH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I THINK, HERE IS THE THING, I THINK OF YOU AS STAR LORD.
YEAH, NO, NO, I'M JUST HUMAN, YES.
Stephen: JUST HUMAN.
I'M JUST STAYING HUMAN, YEAH.
Stephen: NOW BIG SPACE NEWS THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. SPEAKING OF BEAUTIFUL, LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH. THIS IS THE CASSINI SPACE CRAFT.
YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.
Stephen: WHAT AM I LOOKING AT.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, THIS IS NOT DUST HERE. THIS, THIS IS EARTH SEEN THROUGH THE RINGS OF SATURN. EARTH AND JUST A REMINDER, WE ARE A SPEK IN THE MIDDLE OF AS COULD MICK VOID. OCCUPYING WHAT WE CALL EARTH. BUT IN FACT, IF YOU COME UPON OUR SOLAR SYSTEM FROM OUTSIDE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE AN ALIEN FIRST COMING UPON OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, EARTH WOULD BE BARELY NGHTSED BUT YOU. YOU WILL NOTICE SATURN AND JUPITER AND YOU WILL SAY WHAT ARE THESE-- THESE BALLS OF ROCK ORBITING CLOSER TO THE SUN. AND THIS IS CARL SAGAN MADE A POINT OF THIS BACK IN 1990 WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE PALE BLUE DOT. HE CONVINCED VOI YAJER, NASA, TO HAVE VOYAGER WHEN IT PASSED NEPTUNE, THE LAST PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, TO TURN-- I JUST TELL IT IT LIKE IT IS. HE CONVINCED VOYAGER TO TURN ITS CAMERA BACK TOWARDSth AND IT BASICALLY AMOUNTS TO EARTH'S FIRST EVER SELFIE. AND THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN. AND THERE WAS THESE PALE BLUE DOT SITTING IN THIS VOID. AND HE WROTE A WHOLE BOOK ON THIS. SO THESE PICTURES FROM SATURN WITH EARTH IS SORT OF THE MODERN COUNTERPART TO THE PALE BLUE DOT.
Stephen: THERE'S GOING TO BE A SERIES OF 13 FLY BYES OF CASSINI GOING INSIDE THE RINGS.
CASSINI HAS BEEN THERE FOR 12 YEARS. AND IT'S NOW IN ITS FINAL DEATH SPIRAL TO HE DESCEND INTO SATURN NEVER TO BE HEARD OF AGAIN.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME CLOSE SHOTS ALONG THE WAY. THIS IS THE TOP OF.
YES, WE WILL.
Stephen: THAT IS THE TOP OF A HURRICANE.
YOU KNOW, YOU GET THIS SIGH CLONIC ENERGY WHEN YOU ROTATE FAST. AND EARTH, WE GET STORMS ON EARTH AND WE ROTATE ONCE A DAY. SATURN, WHICH BIGGER THAN EARTH ROTATES ONCE EVERY TEN HOURS OR SO. SO THE CORIOLIS FORCE IS SEVERE ON BOTH SATURN AND JUPITER. YOU ZOOM IN ON THE CLOUD TOPS AND IT IS A TURBULENT MAELSTROM.
Stephen: THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS GETTING STIFFED. ALL RIGHT, NOW TELL IT IT LIKE IT IS, BABY. NOW YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK, ONE OF YOUR GREAT BOOKS. IT'S ASTROPHYSICS FOR PEOPLE IN A HURRY. WE'RE IN A HURRY. WE'RE HAD IN A HURRY RIGHT NOW. HIT ME WITH SOME ASTROPHYSICS I NEED TO KNOW B NEIL.
IN THERE, THERE ARE A DOZEN CHAPTERS. AN THANKS FOR ASKING ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE I-- MY SOUL IS IN THAT BOOK. IT IS AN EXPLORATION OF ALL THE FRAGMENTS OF THE COSMOS YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IN NEWS HEADLINES AND YOU CHANNEL SURF A DOCUMENTARY. AND YOU HEARD XO PLANET, DARK MATTER, DARK ENERGY, MULTIVERSE, BUT YOU NEVER QUITE PUT IT TOGETHER. SO I THINK OF THIS AS THE CON SUMATION OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COSMOS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT-- A WHOLE CHAPTER DARK MATTER AND WE END WITH AS COULD MICK PERSPECTIVE WHICH ANYBODY, YOU SHOULD NOT BE WALKING THE STREETS WITHOUT A BAPTISM OF AS COULD MICK PERSPECTIVE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BAPTISM.
YOU NEED TO BE IMMERSED. IF YOU LOOK UP IN THE UNIVERSE AND FEEL SMALL IT IS BECAUSE YOU STARTED OUT WITH AN EGO UNJUSTIFIABLY TOO HIGH TO BEGIN WITH. SO WHAT YOU-- SO YES, IT IT IS EGO BUSTING. YES, TO LEARN, NO EARTH, IS NOT THE MIDDLE OF THE YEURS, NEITHER IS THE SUN. NOORT IS OUR GALAXY AND ARE YOU SMALL, YOU IN TIME AND IN SPACE, THAT IS ALL TRUE. BUT THES COULD MICK PERSPECTIVE TAKES A STEP BEYOND THAT. AND IT IT ALLOWS YOU TO SAY, TO REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, THE ATOMS IN YOUR BODY, THE MOLECULES THAT COMPROMISE LIFE ARE TRACEABLE TO STARS THAT MANUFACTURE THOSE ELEMENTS IN THEIR CRUISE I BELIEVES OF THEIR CORE. AND THEN EXPLODE SCATTERING THAT ENRICHMENT ACROSS THE GALAXY OOKSY-- GALAXY ENABLING NEXT GENERATIONS OF STARS TO FORM PLANETS. AND AT LEAST ON ONE PLANET LIFE. AND AT LEAST AT THIS TIME, PEOPLE. SO WE ARE PARTICIPATES IN THE GREAT UNFOLDING OF THISES COULD MICK STORY. SO PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK, I'M SPECIAL BECAUSE I'M DIFFERENT. BUT THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT.
