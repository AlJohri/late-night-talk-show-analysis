HELLO, I'M ANTHONY EDWARDS. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER A LITTLE MOVIE FROM THE 80s CALLED "TOP GUN," A ROMANTIC MILITARY ACTION DRAMA ABOUT FLY BOYS AND VOLLEYBALL. AND NOW THAT IT'S BEEN ANNOUNCED THEY'RE MAKING A SEQUEL, I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION-- WHY DIDN'T I GET A CALL? DO I HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT I WAS IN THE MOVIE, TOO? SPOILER ALERT-- THAT'S RIGHT. I DIED. BUT JUST BECAUSE I'M DEAD DOESN'T MEAN THAT I CAN'T BE IN THE SEQUEL. I HAVE TWO WORDS FOR YOU:  GHOST, GHOST. ♪ ♪ ♪ THIS GHOST LIKES TO GANDER GOING IN FOR THE KISS. I CAN JOIN?
YEAH, I'M HERE. I WAS JUST HAVING A COCKTAIL WITH MARILYN MONROE AND THE WRIGHT BROTHERS.

IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JEFFREY TAMBOR JOHN BENJAMIN HICKEY. AND MUSICAL GUEST LAKE STREET DIVE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SO EXCITED FOR SUMMERTIME. IS ANYONE HERE LOOKING FORWARD TO FOURTH OF JULY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW WHO IS ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT? THE SENATE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEY'VE GIVEN THEMSELVES A JULY FOURTH DEADLINE FOR THEIR BILL TO GUT OBAMACARE. SO, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW YOUR FINGERS OFF WITH FIREWORKS, DO IT ON THE 3rd. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WITH THAT DEADLINE LOOMING, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL IS RUSHING TO PUT THE BILL TOGETHER IN WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED AS "A FRANTIC SCRAMBLE," WHICH IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE ALL YOUR HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. "HONEY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS MOLE ON MY THIGH?" CUT OFF THE LEG AND BURN IT IN A PIT!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW-- I'M SURE IT'S FINE. I'M SURE IT'S FINE. THE TOUGH PART OF THIS HAS BEEN GETTING REPUBLICAN MODERATES TO VOTE FOR THE BILL. THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF PHASING OUT EXTRA FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID IN 2020. WHICH IS THE PLAN RIGHT NOW. SO, TO LURE THEM IN, McCONNELL IS PROPOSING DOING IT IN 2023. "I'M SORRY, MITCH, I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE VOTE TO TAKE AWAY LIFE-SAVING HEALTHCARE FROM LOW-INCOME PEOPLE. WHAT'S THAT? THREE YEARS LATER? I'M IN!" ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT WILL BE IN THE FINAL BILL, BECAUSE ALL OF THE NEGOTIATIONS SO FAR HAVE TAKEN PLACE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THEY EVEN PUT A SOCK ON THE DOORKNOB SO NO ONE BARGES IN WHILE THEY'RE SCREWING POOR PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW-- THERE IT IS. IT'S VERY POLITE, JUST POLITE.
Jon: OH, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. TO PROTEST THE REPUBLICANS' SECRECY, DEMOCRATS HAVE VOWED TO SLOW WORK IN THE SENATE TO A CRAWL. YES, A CRAWL, DOWN FROM ITS CURRENT SPEED OF "TODDLER ON BENADRYL." SOUNDS DELICIOUS. I MIGHT GO FOR A LITTLE BIT OF THAT RIGHT NOW. THEY MAKE A GRAPE FLAVOR THAT IS JUST AMAZING. AND THEY'RE ESPECIALLY MAD BECAUSE BACK WHEN THEY WERE DRAFTING THE OBAMACARE BILL, THE SENATE DEBATED THE MEASURE ON THE FLOOR FOR 25 DAYS. BUT NOW REPUBLICANS WANT TO LIMIT DEBATE ON THEIR BILL TO JUST 20 HOURS. OR ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS BINGE WATCHING THE NEW "TWIN PEAKS," EXCEPT "TWIN PEAKS" IS LESS CONFUSING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO THE SENATE HAS NOT DEBATED HEALTH CARE IN THE OPEN, BUT SO FAR THIS YEAR, THEY HAVE DEBATED TOPICS LIKE AIRLINE OVERCROWDING, OUTER SPACE SETTLEMENTS, AND POOL AND HOT TUB SAFETY. WHICH IS GOOD, IT'S A VERY GOOD THING. BECAUSE IF THEIR HEALTH CARE BILL PASSES, SITTING IN A HOT TUB MAY BE YOUR ONLY CHOICE FOR BIRTH CONTROL. KILLS THE SWIMMERS. BUT-- ( APPLAUSE ) HOT TUB FANS. HOT TUB FANS. AND REPUBLICANS ARE GETTING DESPERATE TO PASS SOMETHING, ANYTHING. IT'S LOOKING SO DIRE, THAT THE GOP IS CONSIDERING CANCELLING THEIR AUGUST RECESS IN ORDER TO SALVAGE THEIR AGENDA. WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD. NO RECESS? RECESS IS WHEN THEY GET TO PLAY THEIR FAVORITE GAME: DODGE-VOTER. WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING? THERE'S MORE TURMOIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IRAN JUST BANNED ZUMBA CLASSES FOR BEING "UN-ISLAMIC." NOW, IN IRAN, ZUMBA HAD BEEN ADVERTISED UNDER NAMES LIKE "BODY RHYTHM" OR "ADVANCED AEROBICS" BECAUSE "DANCING IS TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL." OH, COME ON, IRAN! YOU CAN'T MAKE DANCING ILLEGAL! THAT NEVER WORKS. SOME HOT DUDE'S JUST GOING TO COME IN FROM THE BIG CITY AND RILE UP THE YOUTH BY DANCING TO KENNY LOGGINS IN A WAREHOUSE. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT? ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. NO. AND DO-- AND DO I NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT KEVIN BACON IS NOT HALAL? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE VERY KIND, VERY NICE.
Jon: I LIKE THAT ONE.
Stephen: HE'S SURPRISED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT JOKE WAS IN REHEARSAL. ANYONE HERE HAVE A KEN DOLL GROWING UP? KEN WAS GREAT. KEN WAS GREAT. THOUGH HE DOES GIVE YOUNG GIRLS AN UNREALISTIC VIEW OF HOW WILLING THEIR BOYFRIENDS WILL BE TO WEAR MATCHING OUTFITS. WELL, THERE'S BIG KEN NEWS, ONCE AGAIN, THERE'S BIG KEN NEWS. BECAUSE "GOOD MORNING AMERICA" UNVEILED A WHOLE NEW LINE OF KEN DOLLS.
MORE THAN FIVE DECADES AFTER WE FIRST MET BARBIE'S GUY KEN, MATTEL IS ANNOUNCING A NEW DIVERSE LINE OF KEN DOLLS FEATURING THREE DIFFERENT BODY TYPES, INCLUDING BROAD, SLIM, AND ORIGINAL.
Stephen: THAT IS A HUGE, HUGE UPDATE FROM THE OLD KEN BODY TYPE-- SEXLESS AND MELTED. BUT THERE'S ONE NEW KEN THAT'S CLEARLY THE STANDOUT.
THERE ARE SEVEN DIFFERENT SKIN TONES TO CHOOSE FROM AND NINE DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLES AND EVEN--
A MAN BUN.
ONE HAS A MAN BUN, WHICH I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. MAN BUN KEN! FOR WHEN YOU WANT YOUR BARBIE TO HOLD DOWN TWO JOBS TO SUPPORT HER BOYFRIEND UNTIL HIS APP TAKES OFF. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S JUST A COUPLE MORE-- "JUST A LITTLE WHILE, BABE, JUST A LITTLE WHILE." IT'S GREAT THAT MATTEL IS GOING FOR DIVERSITY, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT BARBIE WILL DATE ANYONE AS LONG AS THEY'RE NAMED KEN. ( LAUGHTER ) "SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT-- EVERY BOYFRIEND BEFORE ME WAS ALSO NAMED KEN? STOP THE MALIBU DREAM CAR RIGHT NOW. I'M GETTING OUT." QUICK QUESTION-- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, I WANT TO YOU ANSWER HONESTLY. ANY COPS IN THE AUDIENCE? YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF YOU'RE A COP OR THIS IS ENTRAPMENT. NO, OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT DRUGS. POLICE IN TEXAS RECENTLY BUSTED UP A DRUG RING AND SEIZED $1 MILLION WORTH OF METH-INFUSED LOLLIPOPS. YEAH, YEAH--
Jon: THAT'S A LOT.
Stephen: MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE METH, LIKE LOLLY POPS, DOES NOT REQUIRE TEETH. TRUE STORY. THAT JOKE IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. THE METH WAS COOKED AND COMBINED WITH CORN SYRUP IN AN OPERATION "THE WASHINGTON POST" DESCRIBED AS PART "WILLY WONKA," PART "THE WIRE." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS LIKE A DISTURBING LOOK INTO THE RAVAGES OF MIND-ALTERING DRUGS PLUS "THE WIRE." ONE OF THE CRAZIEST DETAILS IS THAT THE LOLLIPOPS WERE IN FUN SHAPES LIKE FLOWERS, BUTTERFLIES, R2-D2, AND YODA. OH, YEAH, IT WAS IMPORTANT. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THEM FUN SHAPES BECAUSE METH USERS ARE NOTORIOUSLY PICKY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HAVING YODA MADE INTO A METH LOLLIPOP WAS KIND OF SURPRISING FOR ME. SO, TO GET HIS PERSPECTIVE ON ALL OF THIS, WE TURN NOW, LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM DAGOBAH, YODA. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. YODA, EVERYBODY.
YEAH, GOOD TO BE HERE, IT IS.
Stephen: MASTER YODA, ARE YOU UPSET THAT POLICE FOUND METH LOLLIPOPS WITH YOUR LIKENESS ON THEM?
YES, PISSED, I AM! WASTED, THOSE LOLLIPOPS ARE. DELICIOUS THEY SOUND.
Stephen: WAIT, YOU WANT TO TRY THEM? 600 POUNDS OF METH LOLLIPOPS WOULD TAKE DOWN AN ELEPHANT.
JUDGE ME BY ME SIZE, DO YOU? HMM? HMM?
Stephen: YODA, THIS IS IMPORTANT. YODA, ARE YOU HITTING THE CRANK?
NO, NO. YODA CLEAN. RUBBERY SKIN, NO TEETH, BULGING EYES, COINCIDENCE THEY ARE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I GUESS I COULD BUY THAT. YOU ARE REALLY OLD.
OH, YES, 27 YEARS OLD, YODA IS.
Stephen: 27. SO, YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT ON METH.
NO, HIGH ON THE FORCE, I AM. LIFT A SPACE SHIP WITH MY MIND, I WILL! MMMMMMM!!! MMMMMMM!!!
Stephen: YODA, ARE YOU OKAY?
FREAKING OUT, I AM! ON THE FORCE, NOT ON THE HIGHSPEED CHICKEN FEED.
Stephen: YODA, EVERYBODY!
YAAARGHHHBLAAAAARGH! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JEFFREY TAMBOR IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK I'LL HAVE LIFESTYLE TIPS FROM ME AND MY GOOD FRIEND GWYNETH PALTROW. STICK AROUND. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

( APPLAUSE ) WELL, THE EVENT FEATURED CRYSTAL THERAPY, AURA PHOTOGRAPHY, SOUND BATHS, WHERE YOU COULD "SINK INTO THE SOUNDS OF CRYSTAL SINGING BOWLS." YOU CAN GET THE SAME EFFECT BY FLUSHING YOUR MONEY DOWN A CRYSTAL TOILET BOWL. THERE'S ALSO THAT GOOP-APPROVED I.V. DRIP, WHICH APPARENTLY IS FOR "GETTING YOU HYDRATED." ALTHOUGH, IF I'M GOING TO STICK A NEEDLE IN MY ARM, I'D LIKE TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE THAN HYDRATED.

I WAS A DATE PLAYER. THAT'S A PERSON --
Stephen: "KOJACONCLUDE" ANYBODY? "WHO LOVE YOUS BABY" WITH THE LOLLIPOP.
IT WAS GRANT'S TOMB ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE. IT WAS THE COLDEST DAY. I CALLED MY FATHER IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND I SAID, "DAD--" BECAUSE HE WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT ME.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU AT THIS POINT?
I WAS FOUR.
Stephen: YOU LOST YOUR HAIR EARLY.
I DID. IT JUST WENT. I WAS 35. MY DAD WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT ME. I WAS DOING A SHOW ON BROADWAY, BUT I SAID, "DAD, I'M ON "KOJAK." AND HE SAID, "WHAT NUMBER?" AND I SAID, "2, I'M ON 2." AND HE SAID, "OH, YEAH, WELL, WE GET 2."

WELL, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW --
Stephen: THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME. JILL SOLOWAY GAVE ME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF-- I MEAN WITH THIS ROLE, BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE GIFT OF A LIFETIME. I WAS VERY NERVOUS, YOU KNOW, BEING THIS GENDER MALE GIVEN THIS WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY. SO I DECIDED TO GO ON A FIELD TRIP WITH MY WONDERFUL-- MY TEACHER ZACHARY DRUKER, AND SAID, "I WANT TO GO SHOPPING AS MAURA. I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE." SOWE DRESSED HER UP VERY, VERY NERVOUS-- STILLAM. WE JUST FINISHED OUR FOURTH SEASON, BY THE WAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I WENT OUT. WE WENT TO A SHOPPING CENTER, AND I-- I WAS SHAKING. BUT I REMEMBER SAYING, "DON'T EVER FORGET THIS." AND I HAD MAURA ALL, YOU KNOW-- YOU KNOW, MAURA IS VERY YOUNG INTO HER TRANSITION, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S 70 YEARS OLD AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW QUITE HOW IT MAKE UP OR QUITE HOW TO WALK OR THE THING. AND WE WERE WALKING DOWN THE GROCERY AISLES AND I SAID, "WELL, HOW WOULD MAURA SHOP?" AND ZACHARY LEFT ME ALONE. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS MAN AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME-- AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LOOK BECAUSE IT WAS THE LOOK OF ABSOLUTE HATRED AND IT WAS A SMIRK OF ABSOLUTE PHOBIA, AND I WENT, "THAT'S--" YOU KNOW, "DON'T EVER FORGET THIS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAURA IS EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE." IT'S SO IMPORTANT. IT'S SO-- SO WHEN I-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, HERE WAS A WOMAN 70 YEARS OLD WHO WENT FOR HER FREEDOM AND SAID, " I'M GOING FOR IT. I'M GOING TO GO FOR MY AUTHENTIC SELF." AND I THINK SHE'S A HERO.
Stephen: DOES PLAYING HER-- DOES PLAYING HER MAKE YOU A BETTER JEFFREY?
I THINK IT MAKES ME A BETTER-- TO BE REALLY HONEST, I THINK IT MAKES ME ALL JEFFREY. IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, HOW IS YOUR FEMININE PART, YOUR MASCULINE PART?" I GO, "I JUST HAVE NEVER BEEN A FREER JEFFREY, A HAPPIER JEFFREY. I THINK IT MAKES ME A BETTER PAPA, A BETTER HUSBAND, AND CERTAINLY A BETTER GUEST ON A TV SHOW.
Stephen: EXCELLENT GUEST LAST QUESTION--
AND IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME VERY GRATEFUL. THIS CAME AT 70 YEARS OLD, THE ROLE OF MY LIFT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
I MEAN, I KNOW I DON'T LOOK 70-- WELL, I KNOW I-- I KNOW I DON'T LOOK 70.
Stephen: YOU DON'T ACTUALLY LOOK 70.

Stephen: 69-ISH. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN YOU SAID, "'KOJAK' AT 35 I SAID NO WAY IN MY HEAD. THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
I'M VERY LUCKY. AND I GET TO GO FROM HERE AND IN ONE MONTH GET TO START A FIFTH SEASON OF "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT."

IT'S SO NICE TO BE HERE AFTER THE SHOW ENDED BECAUSE WHOEVER DIDN'T SEE IT JUST HAS TO TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT HOW GREAT IT WAS.
Stephen: IT WAS AMAZING.
REMARKABLE PLAY. A MASTERPIECE AND GREAT FUN.
Stephen: IT MUST BE AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PLAY ON BROADWAY, TO SAY THOSE WORDS AND TELL THAT STORY.
YES. IT'S A BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN PLAY AND IT'S SO RELEVANT BECAUSE OF THE WALLS WE BUILD BETWEEN EACH OTHER BASED ON CLASS AND RACE AND EXPWRUNG OLD. REALLY, REALLY RELEVANT NOW. SO IT WAS GREAT FUN TO DO.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO-- I'VE NEVER DONE A BROADWAY PLAY-- WHAT'S IT LIKE TO DO A AND RUN KNOW IT'S COMING TO AN END? IS ALL THE LAST NIGHTS, ARE YOU CHOKING UP? LIKE--
YES, ARE YOU.
Stephen: TO STAY IN CHARACTER?
YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO BE TOO SENTIMENTAL ABOUT IT ALL. I MEAN, YOU'RE ALSO SLIGHTLY THRILLED BECAUSE IT'S THE GREATEST HONOR IN THE WORLD TO BE IN A BROADWAY SHOW AS AN ACTOR. IT'S LIKE THE EPICENTER OF THE ACTING UNIVERSE. BUT IT'S ALSO LIKE BEING IN YOUR VERY OWN EXISTENTIAL GROUNDHOG DAY BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER-- IT'S LIKE YOU-- IT'S LIKE IF YOU CAME HERE AND HAD THE SAME GUEST ON EVERY SINGLE NIGHT AND SAID THE SAME THINGS TO EACH OTHER. SO YOU HAVE TO TRY YOUR BEST TO MAKE IT VERY, VERY FRESH AND ALIVE. AND THE LAST FEW SHOWS, YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO CRY. AND I'M A LITTLE BIT OF A CONTROL FREAK, SO YOU ALSO WANT EVERYTHING TO BE PERFECT IN THE LAST FEW SHOWS. AND IN THE LAST MOMENT OF THE PLAY THAT I HAVE WITH ALLISON JANNEY, A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT-- AND WE WERE FEELING IT. I MEAN WE WERE FULL OF EMOTION. A CELL PHONE WENT OFF IN THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: OH!
THAT WAS SO LOUD-- AND IT WAS AN OLD-SCHOOL RING, AND THE PLAY TAKES PLACE IN 1989. SO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE AUDIENCE THOUGHT, "I THOUGHT THAT WAS PART OF THE PLAY." NO, IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAY.
Stephen: NO JURY COULD CONVICT ME.
NO JURY-- ABSOLUTELY. THERE SHOULD BE A FINE. THERE SHOULD BE A FINE.
Stephen: ALLISON JANNEY PLAYED YOUR WIFE, SHE PLAYS OUISA TO YOUR FLAN. I HEARD YOU SAY THAT SHE-- BASICALLY YOU TWO GOT STAGE MARRIED 20 YEARS BEFORE. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
THIS WAS, LIKE, MY EIGHTH OR NINTH JOB WITH ALLISON JANNEY, THE MAGNIFICENT ALLISON JANNEY. AND 25 YEARS AGO, I THINK, WE WERE IN AN OFF-BROADWAY PLAY TOGETHER. WE BOTH GOT CAST IN THE MOVIE "THE FIRST WIVES CLUB." I HOPE PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT. IT WAS A WONDERFUL MOVIE.  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Stephen: GOLDIE HAWN.
GOLDIE HAWN, BETTE MIDLER, AND THE GREAT DIANE KEATON. WE WERE SO BEYOND EXCITED BECAUSE, "A," WE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A MOVIE. AND "B" WE WERE DEAD BROKE. WE WERE AS BROKE AS BROKE COULD BE. WE GOT THERE AT 6:00 A.M. WE WAIT UNTIL 6:00 P.M., AND THERE'S A KNOCK ON OUR DOOR, AND THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SAYS, "HEY, YOU GUYS, YOU'RE RELEASED. GOLDIE HAWN HAS DECIDED SHE DOESN'T WANT THE SCENE TO BE IN THE MOVIE, AND YOU GUYS CAN GO HOME. AND, "A," WE WERE HEARTBROKEN, BUT, BOSTON, WE WERE ALSO LIKE, WOW IT MUST BE REALLY COOL TO BE A MOVIE STAR. YOU GET TO DECIDE YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
