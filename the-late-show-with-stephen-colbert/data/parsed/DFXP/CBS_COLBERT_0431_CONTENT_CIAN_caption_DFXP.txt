IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH TONIGHT THE DOSSIER STRIKES AGAIN. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES:  DR. PHIL AND CAPTAIN SCOTT KELLY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HEY, EVERYBODY. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. THAT'S ELECTRIC.
Jon:
YES.
Stephen: I HOPE YOU CAN FEEL THIS AT HOME, EVERYBODY. THIS ROOM IS ELECTRIC. I WISH THESE PEOPLE-- I WISH THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN HERE LAST NIGHT.
Jon: THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
Stephen: WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. THESE PEOPLE ARE SUPER STARS. YOU EITHER HAVE IT OR YOU DON'T. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CITIZEN. WELL, AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE ENERGY IN THE ROOM, IT'S FRIDAY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAY ON FRIDAY: "LIGHT FUSE AND GET AWAY QUICKLY." ONE THING WE LEARNED THIS WEEK IS THAT THERE IS NO MORE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT BELONGS TO DONALD TRUMP. THE G.O.P. IS NOW THE GROSS ORANGE PILE.  ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE HE'S GOT THEM, RIGHT? HE'S GOT THE BALLS IN A LITTLE FELT SACK IN HIS POCKET. TRUMP HAS FORCED OUT ANY MEANINGFUL OPPOSITION, AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS FALLING IN LINE LIKE FRIGHTENED DUCKLINGS. AS TRUMP TWEETED YESTERDAY, "DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE UNITY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!" AND I BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY HAVING HIM SAYING IT ON FOOTAGE.
YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE.
UNITY.
OF THE DARK SIDE.
Stephen: BUT AMONG HIS ALLIES ARE OUR ENEMIES. IT'S TIME FOR THIS WEEK'S RUSSIA ROUNDUP.  ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ REMEMBER THE DOSSIER? YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT? YEAH? THE COLLECTION OF DIRT ON TRUMP'S RUSSIA CONNECTIONS? WELL, IT'S IN THE NEWS AGAIN. AND BEFORE YOU ASK-- NO, WE DON'T HAVE THE PEE-PEE TAPE. YOU'LL KNOW WHEN WE DO. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WILL BE ON A LOOP. BUT WE DID LEARN THIS WEEK THAT "THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE D.N.C. PAID FOR THE RESEARCH THAT LED TO THE DOSSIER." THAT IS A HUGE SCANDAL FOR OUR SITTING "NOT PRESIDENT." SHE MIGHT BE UNPEACHED. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP MADE A BIG DEAL OF IT, RETWEETING A "FOX & FRIENDS" BULLETIN, "CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND D.N.C. PAID FOR RESEARCH THAT LED TO THE ANTI-TRUMP FAKE NEWS DOSSIER. THE VICTIM HERE IS THE PRESIDENT." NO, NO, NO, SIR. SIR, THE VICTIM, AS ALWAYS, IS THAT RUSSIAN MATTRESS. YOU'RE FINE. OKAY, SO THE DEMOCRATS PAID TO FIND DIRT ON THEIR OPPONENT, AND THEY FOUND SOME. AND HERE'S THE SCANDAL: THEY DIDN'T USE IT. SHE LOST. WHY DIDN'T YOU USE IT? FORGET "STRONGER TOGETHER." WHY WASN'T IT "STRONGER WITHOUT A RUSSIAN STOOGE WHO LOVES THE PEE-PEE?" ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) AND-- IT'S GOT A RING TO IT. IT'S GOT A "I LIKE IKE." AND BEFORE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN PAID A DIME, THIS OPPO RESEARCH WAS ACTUALLY FUNDED BY AN UNKNOWN REPUBLICAN CLIENT DURING THE G.O.P. PRIMARY. NOW, WITH 17 REPUBLICANS RUNNING IN LAST YEAR'S PRIMARIES, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY-- JEB BUSH. IT'S JEB BUSH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE NOW TRYING TO CLAIM THAT CLINTON FUNDING THE DOSSIER PROVES TRUMP'S INNOCENCE SOMEHOW. FOX NEWS EVEN WROTE THIS HEADLINE: "TRUMP RIPS CLINTON, D.N.C.-RUSSIA COLLUSION REPORTS." NO! NO, THEY DID NOT COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA. IF THEY PAID TO FIND OUT THAT TRUMP CLIEWLDED WITH RUSSIA, THAT'S NOT COLLUSION. THAT'S LIKE RUNNING A HEADLINE THAT SAYS, "TRUMP RIPS AL ROKER FOR COLLUDING WITH HUMIDITY." ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW-- HE SEEMED ANGRY. HE SEEMED REALLY ANGRY RIGHT THERE. NOW, ONE OF THE WAYS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS ACCUSED OF COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS IS THAT THEY WANTED TO RELEASE DAMAGING EMAILS WHICH WERE HACKED BY THE RUSSIANS AND GIVEN TO WIKILEAKS. BUT THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY OF THAT DURING THE CAMPAIGN, RIGHT?
RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT'S RUSSIA, BUT TRUMP NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT WIKILEAKS.
WIKILEAKS! I LOVE WIKILEAKS. OH, WE LOVE WIKILEAKS. BOY, THEY HAVE REALLY WIKILEAKS! BOY, I LOVE READING THOSE WIKILEAKS.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT THAT'S JUST LOCKER ROOM TALK. THERE'S NO PROOF-- THERE'S ZERO PROOF THAT THEY TRIED TO TEAM UP WITH JULIAN ASSANGE, OTHER THAN THIS: "TRUMP DATA GURU: I TRIED TO TEAM UP WITH JULIAN ASSANGE." BUT WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, WIKILEAKS FOUNDER AND MIKE PENCE IN WITNESS PROTECTION, JULIAN ASSANGE, TWEETED, "I CAN CONFIRM AN APPROACH-- PRIOR TO NOVEMBER LAST YEAR-- I CAN CONFIRM THAT IT WAS REJECTED BY WIKILEAKS." THAT'S RIGHT-- A FUGITIVE, WANTED BY THE C.I.A., TRAPPED IN THE ECUADORIAN EMBASSY FOR FIVE YEARS, REJECTED AN OVERTURE FROM WHAT COULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. "WHO'S THAT ON THE PHONE, DONALD TRUMP? I'D RATHER GO TO GITMO." SOME DAYS, I WOULD, TOO. BECAUSE THINGS ARE ROUGH OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE LITTLE PLEASURES IN LIFE AND THEN TOTALLY RUIN THEM, BECAUSE I JUST HEARD ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION THAT ALLEGES HARIBO GUMMI BEARS ARE MADE USING SLAVE LABOR.
Jon: OH!
Stephen: YES, YES, YES. THIS IS THE WORST NEWS SINCE I FOUND OUT JOLLY RANCHERS ARE MADE FROM RANCHERS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT SO JOLLY NOW, ARE YOU? APPARENTLY, HARIBO'S SUPPLIERS USE UNDERPAID AND OVERWORKED BRAZILIANS TO HARVEST CARNAUBA WAX, WHICH GIVES GUMMI BEARS THEIR GLOSSY FINISH WHILE PREVENTING THEM FROM CONGEALING TOGETHER IN LARGE CLUMPS-- WHICH MAKES THIS EVEN MORE TRAGIC, BECAUSE NO ONE CARES IF GUMMI BEARS STICK TOGETHER. MY FAVORITE FLAVOR OF GUMMI BEAR IS CLUMP. NOW, IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTROVERSY, HARIBO HAS UPDATED THEIR PACKAGING: "SORRY 'BOUT THE SLAVES!" ( LAUGHTER ) AND-- THEM NOT ME. THEY SAID THAT. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. HARIBO IS SAYING THAT ON THEIR PACKAGING. IT'S NOT ME. AND GUMMIES AREN'T THE ONLY FOOD CONTROVERSY OUT THERE. CEREAL MAKER KELLOG'S IS IN HOT WATER-- WHICH IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO EAT CEREAL. THEIR BOXES OF CORN POPS FEATURED THIS ILLUSTRATION OF A CORN POP MALL, WITH LITTLE CORN POPS SHOPPING, PLAYING, EVEN EATING AT CORN ON A STICK. JUST A FUN DAY OF CORN CANNIBALISM. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, YOU'LL NOTICE ONLY ONE OF THE CORN POPS IS BROWN, AND IT'S THE JANITOR.
Audience: OH!
Stephen: YES, YES.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: EVEN THE WORLD OF CORN POPS IS PLAGUED BY SYSTEMIC RACISM. LATER THAT DAY, THE REST OF THEM WENT TO A KORN KLUX KLAN RALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) PLAUS YEAH! YEAH, A COUPLE OF KLAN FANS OUT THERE. THAT'S NICE. A BIG TENT HERE AT "THE LATE SHOW." AFTER KELLOGG'S GOT CALLED OUT ON TWITTER, THE COMPANY RESPONDED, TWEETING, "KELLOGG IS COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. WE DID NOT INTEND TO OFFEND. WE APOLOGIZE. THE ARTWORK IS UPDATED AND WILL BE IN STORES SOON." THEY'VE EVEN PUT A PRIZE INSIDE THE NEW BOXES: A TINY COPY OF "BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME" BY TA-NEHISI COATES. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. DR. PHIL IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, MY LIFESTYLE BRAND, COVETTON HOUSE, GETS ITS OWN MAGAZINE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MISS THIS. I PROMISE YOU. NOT THIS ONE.
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. JON, JON, YOU KNOW THIS IS HALLOWEEN, RIGHT? PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. NOW, JON, JON, THIS IS HALLOWEEN WEEKEND COMING UP. DO YOU HAVE ANY, LIKE, PLANS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? DO YOU HAVE A HALLOWEEN PARTY TO GO TO.
Jon: YEAH, I'M JUST GOING TO HANG OUT AND GIVE OUT CANDY. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COME TO MY DOOR.
Stephen: DO YOU DRESS UP AS ANYTHING.
Jon: SOMETIMES.
Stephen: DO YOU SCARE THE KIDS AT ALL.
Jon: SOMETIMES. I DID THE POWER RANGER LAST YEAR. THE RED ONE.
Stephen: THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO DRESS UPS A TIRED MIDDLE-AGED MAN.
Jon: OH, WOW, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR COSTUME.
Stephen: JUST TO TERRIFY THE OTHER PARENTS. I'M THEIR FUTURE.
Jon: OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVES LIFESTYLE MAVEN GWYNETH PALTROW, RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. THAT SOUNDS LIKE MOST OF YOU OUT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND OF ALL THE EVERIES IN THE WORLD, I'M ONE OF THEM. I'M ESPECIALLY FOND OF HER LUXURY AND BEAUTY WEBSITE, GOOP, THE SOURCE FOR HIGH-END LIFESTYLE GOODS, LIKE $950 TOILET PAPER. FOR THAT PRICE, YOU COULD JUST WIPE YOUR BUTT WITH MONEY, BUT THEN GWYNETH PALTROW WOULDN'T HAVE YOUR MONEY.  (  LAUGHTER  ) PLUS, GOOP'S PACKED WITH WELLNESS TIPS AND PRODUCTS LIKE ENERGY-BALANCING STICKERS AND THE BEST SPA TO GET A VAGINAL STEAMING. VERY IMPORTANT, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR WHEN THE LABEL SAYS, "DO NOT IRON." WELL, GOOP HAS NOW GOOPED IT UP TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL, BECAUSE THEY JUST LAUNCHED-- AND I'VE GOT IT RIGHT HERE-- "GOOP" MAGAZINE. IT'S JUST LIKE THE WEBSITE, ONLY NOT FREE. HERE'S THE PREMIER ISSUE, FEATURING THE GOOPSTER HERSELF ON THE COVER ENJOYING A SENSUAL MUD BATH, OR HIDING FROM THE PREDATOR. IT'S HARD TO SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) THE CAPTION, THE CAPTION-- SEE THIS CAMS HERE? IT SAYS, "EARTH TO AGAIN EGHTD." THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE FUN WITH GOOP'S REPUTATION FOR BEING A LITTLE FLAKEY. AND "EARTH TO GWYNETH" IS MORE POLITE THAN THE ORIGINAL TITLE, "HOUSTON, WE HAVE (BLEEP)" NEW MAGAZINE. I'M SURE IT'S VERY NICE. PLEASE COME ON THE SHOW. I'M SURE IT'S VERY NICE. THE NEW MAGAZINE FEATURES ALL THE GOOPINESS YOU'VE COME TO LOVE, LIKE THIS SPREAD ABOUT CRYSTALS, WHERE I LEARNED THAT BLACK OBSIDIAN HELPS YOU FEEL MORE GROUNDED, AND YOU CAN PUT IT IN YOUR PILLOWCASE TO DECOMPRESS AFTER A LONG DAY," BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING MORE RELAXING THAN FALLING ASLEEP ON A SACK OF RAZOR-SHARP ROCKS.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) OR HOW ABOUT THIS INFORMATIVE ARTICLE ABOUT YOUR PELVIC FLOOR, THE BODY PART WELL ON ITS WAY TO BECOMING THE NEXT "IT" AREA. YEAH, PELVIC FLOOR IS THE "IT" AREA. BYE-BYE, THUMB WEB. NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU ANYMORE! NOW, FOR SOME REASON, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, THE ARTICLE ABOUT THE PELVIC FLOOR HAS A CLOSE-UP OF A GRAPE FRUIT ON IT. I DON'T GET IT, PERSONALLY. IT GOES ON TO DESCRIBE A SPECIALIST WHO CAN TONE YOUR PELVIC FLOOR IN A TEN-PACK OF PRIVATE SESSIONS FOR THE LOW COST OF $5,000. WOW, THAT PRICE REALLY MADE ME CLENCH MY GRAPEFRUIT.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH, THAT GRAPEFRUIT!
Stephen: AND DON'T WORRY THERE ARE PLENTY OF ADS. MY FAVORITE IS FOR "GOOP EDITION 02: A PERFUME OF COOL AIR, PALE SUN, NEW LIFE UNFURLING ON THE FOREST FLOOR." BECAUSE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SMELL LIKE THE FOREST FLOOR? "MMM! "WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? IS THAT PARTIALLY-DECOMPOSED CROW?" NOW, THE CONTENT IN HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET IT.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU GOTTA GO GET IT. THE CONTENT GOES ON AND ON! THERE ARE "DEEP-DIVES INTO CRYSTALS AND MUD MASKS, REIKI AND BEE VENOM TREATMENTS." CELEBRITIES, BY THE WAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS-- CELEBRITIES LOVE BEE VENOM TREATMENTS, ESPECIALLY NICHOLAS CAGE.
AH! THEY'RE IN MY EYES, MY EYES! AAAH!
Stephen: THE NIC CAGE SIGNATURE BEE VENOM FACE CRATE IS AVAILABLE ON GOOP FOR JUST $7,000.  (  LAUGHTER  ) PLUS, "GOOP" MAGAZINE JUST FEELS LUXURIOUS, ESPECIALLY SINCE GOOP RETAILS FOR $14.99! WOW! THAT IS SO EXPENSIVE, IT SHOULD BE IN "GOOP MAGAZINE"! NOW, LONGTIME FANS OF THIS SHOW KNOW THAT I HAVE MY VERY OWN HIGH-END, GOOP-INSPIRED/STOLEN LIFESTYLE BRAND, COVETTON HOUSE, AND YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED BY WHAT COVETTON HAS IN STORE.
BAROQUE SIMPLICITY. SHABBY ELEGANCE. GIVE ME MONEY. COVETTON HOUSE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME. HELLO, LIFESTYLE FANS. I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE   "COVETT CUARTERLY," THE PREMIUM LUXURY-- THE PREMIUM LUXURY LIFESTYLE WELLNESS PUBLICATION. THE PREMIERE ISSUE FEATURES ME ENJOYING A LUXURIOUS NACHO CHEESE SOAK. I DISCOVERED ITS EXFOLIATING PROPERTIES AFTER PASSING OUT UNDER THE PUMP DISPENSER IN THE SKYBOX AT YANKEE STADIUM. , OF COURSE, "COVETTON CUARTERLY" FEATURES ALL THE GREAT CONTENT YOU'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM COVETTON. GREAT FEATURES ON SCROTAL DRY CLEANING AND VAGINAL WASH-AND-FOLD. AND MAYBE--  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS ) MAYBE YOU'VE TAKEN CARE OF YOUR PELVIC FLOOR, BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR OVARIAN BREAKFAST NOOK?  (  LAUGHTER  ) ALL-- ALL ACCOMPANIED BY LAVISH PHOTOS OF FLOWERS, FOR SOME REASON. NO REASON. WE JUST LIKE FLOWERS. HOW THE HELL DID THEY GET A GRAPEFRUIT IN THAT FLRK I'LL NEVER KNOW. JIMMY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY... THANKS. PLUS, A FIVE-PAGE SPREAD ON MOISTURIZER TRAVEL KITS, TITLED "IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN." BEST OF ALL, "COVETTON CUARTERLY" RETAILS FOR JUST $950 PER ISSUE. QUITE A STEAL, CONSIDERING YOU CAN WIPE YOUR BUTT WITH IT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DR. PHIL.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF TV'S NUMBER ONE RATED DAYTIME TALK SHOW. PLEASE WELCOME DR. PHIL! ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU'VE GOT THEM EVERYWHERE.
Stephen: YEAH. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE PACKED EVERYWHERE IN HERE. NOW, DR. PHIL, YOU'VE BEEN AMERICA'S PSYCHIATRIST, PSYCHOLOGIST-- HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF?
WHATEVER.
Stephen: OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE BEEN A SHOULDER--
I'M A GUY.
Stephen: FOR AMERICA TO CRY ON, LEAN ON FOR 16 SEASONS. WE'RE DEALING WITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT-- LET'S TALK ABOUT--  ( APPLAUSE )
JUST-- JUST ONE?
Stephen: WELL, I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE CLAPPING ABOUT, BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THERE'S BEEN A RASH OF REVELATIONS ABOUT PEOPLE ENGAGING IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ABUSE. HARVEY WEINSTEIN, KNOW THE PERSON, THE REVELATIONS SORT OF KICKED OFF THIS LATEST ROUND OF REVELATIONS, HE WENT TO THERAPY FOR SEX ADDICTION FOR ONE WEEK. DOES IT WORK THAT WAY? IS HE LIKE, "ALL GOOD!"
(BLEEP) NO.
Stephen: IT'S A FAMILY SHOW, DOCTOR, A FAMILY SHOW. DR. PHIL.
COME ON, YOU HAVE A CHRONIC 30-YEAR, LAYERED, MULTI PROBLEM THAT HAS SO MANY DIMENSIONS, YOU COULDN'T UNRAVEL IT IN 30 YEARS. AND SOMEBODY GOES FOR A WEEK AND SAYS, "GOTCHA." NO.
Stephen: WELL, WHEN-- I'M-- I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT. IF SOMEBODY-- FIRST OF ALL, IT SEX ADDICTION A THING, DO YOU BELIEVE?
NO.
Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK SO?
NO, I DON'T. I WILL SAY THIS:  IN THE INDUSTRY THERE IS A BIG DEBATE ABOUT THIS, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PROFESSIONALS THAT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT WILL ARGUE THAT IT IS A THING. NOW, THE D.S.M.-5, THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL DOESN'T HAVE IT IN THERE. THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE IT. THEY DON'T CONSIDER IT TO BE A DISORDER. A LOT OF PEOPLE I RESPECT DO. I'M NOT ONE OF THEM. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WHEN YOUR WIFE CATCHES YOU, YOU GO, "OH, MY GOD. DEVIL MADE ME DO IT. IT'S AN ADDICTION. LET THE HEALING BEGIN." I HATE IT WHEN THEY SAY THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T THINK IT'S A THING. NOW-- G --
Stephen: SO IT'S JUST A FORM OF SELFISHNESS.
IT IS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S NOT PATHOLOGY THERE, BECAUSE I THINK UCERTAINLY IN CASES LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, THERE IS SEVERE PATHOLOGY THERE. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A SEXUAL ADDICTION.
Stephen: SO IF SOMEONE GOES TO A SEXUAL ADDICTION CLINIC TO BE TREATED FOR THIS, WHAT HAPPENS? DOES THE PERSON SAY, "I FEEL LIKE HAVING SEX." AND THEY GO, "DON'T FEEL THAT ANYMORE." WHAT IS IT THAT HAPPENS TO THIS PERSON?
WELL, THEY TRY TO GET THEM TO IDENTIFY WHAT TRIGGERS THE IMPULSE. THEY TRY TO DESENSITIZE THEM, AND IN ORDER OF SAYING, "OKAY, THINK ABOUT THAT. TRY TO CALM YOURSELF." THEY GO THROUGH A BUNCH OF THINGS WHERE YOU HAVE STIMULI THAT WOULD NORMALLY CAUSE YOU TO ACT, AND THEY TRY TO GET YOU TO NOT BE REACTIVE TO THAT. THEY TRY TO GET YOU TO EXERCISE IMPULSE CONTROL, TRY TO GET YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE, WHY THERE'S MORAL DECAY, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S A THING. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S A THING.
Stephen: YOU NEVER TREATED IT. YOU NEVER--
NO.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE IT. YOU DON'T HAVE SEX ADDICTION.
WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE IS SUCH A THING, SO, NO.
Stephen: YOU LIKE SEX, THOUGH.
WELL, IT DEPENDS WHO WE'RE TALK ABOUT. I'VE BEEN MARRIED 41 YEARS. IF YOU'RE MAKING ME AN OFFER, I'M PASSING.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU THINK THIS SORT OF THING IS PARTICULARLY BAD IN HOLLYWOOD, BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY THE REPUTATION FOR HOLLYWOOD? OR IS THIS ALSO HAPPENING-- YOU KNOW, SLIKE, THE MANAGER OF A GROCERY STORE IN IOWA, IS IT HAPPENING EVERYWHERE?
YOU KNOW, I'VE PROBABLY DONE 150 SHOWS ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING. THE ONLY REASON THAT IT'S IN THE PRESS NOW IS BECAUSE AMERICA LIKES TO TALK ABOUT PRETTY PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS. AND --
Stephen: HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS NOT--  (  LAUGHTER  ).
IT'S NOT HIM. IT'S THE --
Stephen: OH, RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.
BUT THIS HAPPENS IN EVERY WALK IN LIFE IN AMERICA, WHETHER A LINE SUPERVISOR IN A FACTORY, TALKING ABOUT A FACTORY WORKER. WHETHER IT'S A GROCERY STORE MANAGER, TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WORKING ON THE PRODUCE AISLE. IT'S NOT ANY MORE RAMPANT THERE THAN IT IS IN ANY OTHER PART OF AMERICA. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SEX. IT'S ALL ABOUT POWER AND ABUSE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, YOU DON'T--  ( APPLAUSE ) I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO GET POLITICAL, BUT I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION FOR--
HYPOTHETICALLY.
Stephen: HYPOTHETICAL, HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. FOR A FRIEND OF MINE-- SEVERAL, 300 MILLION FRIENDS OF MINE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) WHO ARE DEALING WITH A PROBLEM. AND SOME OF THEM ARE IN DENIAL THAT IT'S A PROBLEM, AND SOME OF THEM HAVE SEEN THAT IT'S A PROBLEM LONG BEFORE THE PROBLEM REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH A BULLY?
WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THINLY VEILED.
Stephen: THIS?
THIS IS A THINLY VEILED HYPOTHETICAL.
Stephen: PURELY, PURELY HYPOTHETICAL.
PURELY HYPOTHETICAL. WELL, IT DEPENDS ON IF YOU'RE IN DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BULLY, OR IF YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A VOTE ON THE BULLY.
Stephen: WHAT IF IT'S-- WHAT IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO THE BULLY, BECAUSE OF THEIR POSITION, HAS A LOT OF POWER OVER BOTH YOUR ECONOMIC, ECOLOGICAL, AND MILITARY FUTURE?  (  LAUGHTER  ) HOW DO YOU DEAL-- HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A BULLY, DR. PHIL! COME ON! DON'T DODGE THE QUESTION!
HYPOTHETICALLY.
Stephen: HYPOTHETICALLY, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A BULLY, SOMEONE WHO SEEMS TO ENJOY PUSHING PEOPLE AROUND.
YOU HAVE TO PUSH BACK.
Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU SHOULDN'T QUIT THE SENATE AND GO HOME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE HYPOTHETICAL SENATE.
Stephen: HYPOTHETICAL SENATE. YEAH, COULD BE THE SENATE FROM "STAR WARS." DON'T KNOW WHICH SENATE IT IS.
HYPOTHETICALLY, YOU HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR WHETHER YOU DON'T.
Stephen: OKAY.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MY DAD USED TO SAY, "YOU NEED TO DECIDE-- YOU NEED TO SPEND 5% OF YOUR TIME DECIDING WHETHER THE DEAL YOU GOT IT A GOOD DEAL OR A BAD DEAL, AND 95% OF THE TIME DECIDING WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT." AND THIS DEAL, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IS A BAD DEAL. OKAY, BAD DEAL. THAT'S THE DEAL YOU GOT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? OKAY, SO, WORK ON-- WORKING ON MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WORK ON DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.
Stephen: HYPOTHETICALLY.
HYPOTHETICALLY. IT'S A HYPOTHETICAL SENATE.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A LIAR? IS THERE SOME WAY TO CATCH SOMEBODY? WHAT IF SOMEBODY IS REPEATEDLY CAUGHT IN A LIE AND DOESN'T CARE IS IT CAN THAT PERSON EVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE UNBELIEVABLE MORASS OF LIES THEY SWIM AROUND IN, LIKE IT'S FISH AND FILTH.
OKAY --
Stephen: HYPOTHETICALLY.
HYPOTHETICALLY, THERE ARE DIFFERENT-- PEOPLE LIE FOR DIFFERENT REASON.
Stephen: YES.
AND IF YOU HAVE A COMPULSIVE LIAR --
Stephen: SEEM TO LIKE IT.
IF YOU HAVE A SOCIOPATHIC LIAR.
Stephen: YES.
WHO HAS NO REMORSE FOR THE LIES THEY TELL.
Stephen: DING-DING.
AND YOU WERE TO SAY, "ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO CHANGE THIS PERSON FROM LYING." THE LIES AREN'T HYPOTHETICAL, BUT WE'RE HYPOTHETICALLY TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO DOES THAT.
Stephen: YES, EXACTLY.
AND YOU PUT THAT PERSON IN THERAPY. THEY TEND TO GET WORSE.
Stephen: WHAT? LET'S SAY THIS HYPOTHETICAL PERSON, YOU MANAGE BY LAYING BIT OF CHEESE OUT OR SOMETHING AND YOU GET THEM INTO A ROOM WITH A DR. PHIL AND YOU SLAM THE DOOR SHUT AND SAY, "DEAL WITH ME NOW, BUBBA." AND IT WOULD MAKE IT WORSE FOR YOU TREATING THIS PERSON?
IT WOULD, AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. THERE ARE TWO PARTICULAR TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IN THERAPY. ONE IS THE PARANOID THAT REALLY DOES HAVE SOMEBODY AFTER THEM. THAT'S TOUGH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY PARANOID, BUT THEY DO HAVE A CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES THAT ARE TRYING TO PERSECUTE THEM.
Stephen: YES.
BUT NOT NEAR AS MUCH AS THEY THINK. AND THE OTHERS ARE WHAT MOST PEOPLE CALL SOCIOPATHS, PSYCHOPATHS, WHAT ARE NOW CALLED ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITIES. THEY GET INTO THERAPY, AND THEY LEARN FROM THE THERAPIST HOW TO BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT LOOKS BETTER. THEY LEARN THE SYMBOL SYSTEMS. THEY LEARN HOW TO MIMIC EMPATHY. THEY LEARN HOW TO DO THE THINGS THAT MAKE THEM LOOK BETTER. AND THEN THEY TAKE THAT AND USE IT TO VICTIMIZE THE NEXT WAVE OF PEOPLE THEY COME INTO. THEY DON'T GET BETTER. YOU'RE JUST TRAINING THEM TO GET BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO BAD.
Stephen: AND IT WOULD HELP IF THIS PERSON WAS, LIKE, REALLY INTELLIGENT AND HAS A GOOD BRAIN AND HAS ALL THE BEST WORDS AND WENT TO AN IVY LEAGUE STOOL SCHOOL?  ( APPLAUSE ).
WELL, ACTUALLY, IF YOU HYPOTHETICALLY HAD SOMEONE LIKE THAT, THEN THAT HELPS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT READING THE ROOM AND REALIZING THAT THEY'RE KIND OF OUTING THEMSELVES BY BEING THAT TRANSPARENT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE HOPE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF OUR COUNTRY?
I DO. I AM A INCURABLE OPTIMIST. AND I SEE, EVEN IN THE WORST TRAGEDIES, WHEN WE HAD THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTING, AND, YOU KNOW, I HATE TO BE SUCH A DOWNER, BUT I WAS INVITED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL THERE AND TALK TO SOME OF THE SHOOTING VICTIMS. AND I DID, AND I'LL TELL YOU, WHEN I SAW THE HUMAN SPIRIT AMONG THOSE PEOPLE AND SAW HOW THOSE PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER IN THAT FIELD AT THE TIME AND HOW THEY HELPED EACH OTHER AND DRUG EACH OTHER TO SAFETY AND CAME TOGETHER, I TELL YOU, MY FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE WAS LIFTED IN A WAY YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. THOSE PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER AND-- AND STRUGGLED TO HELP EACH OTHER. PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. AND THE WAY THEY GOT INTO THE TRAUMA CENTER, AND INSTEAD OF SAYING, "TAKE CARE OF ME. TAKE CARE OF ME." I TALKED TO THOSE TRAUMA DOCTORS AND THEY SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY SAID 'SHE LOOKS WORSE. TAKE CARE OF HER. I CAN WAIT. DO THAT'." I WAS UPLIFTED SEEING HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO THAT. AND I DON'T THINK CRISES MAKE HEROS. I THINK CRISES REVEAL WHO YOU WERE BEFORE IT HAPPENED, AND I THINK WE SAW A LOT OF THAT IN LAS VEGAS  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT TO TAKE INTO THE WEEKEND. THANK YOU, DR. PHIL. "DR. PHIL" AIRS WEEKDAYS NATIONWIDE. DR. PHIL, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A BELOVED HOLIDAY TRADITION.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. GLAEGZ, I'M AWFULLY EXCITED BECAUSE MY NEXT GUEST IS A VETERAN ASTRONAUTS WHO SPEND A RECORD-SETTING 340 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN ORBIT. PLEASE WELCOME CAPTAIN SCOTT KELLY!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, SCOTT. NICE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON. COME ON UP HERE. ♪ ♪ ♪

Stephen: STILL A GREAT COUNTRY. NOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU AND I HAVE EVER SPOKEN IN PERSON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I'VE SPOKEN TO YOU SEVERAL TIMES WHEN YOU WERE UP ON THE SPACE STATION, AND I HAVE ACTUALLY SPOKEN WITH YOUR TWIN BROTHER, MARK. HE AND I LANDED THE SPACE SHUTTLE SIMULATOR TOGETHER.
AND I THINK YOU INVITED HIM HERE BEFORE YOU INVITED ME, RIGHT?
Stephen: I THINK YOU WERE IN SPACE. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE HAD YOU ON, BUT YOU WERE IN ORBIT. 340 DAYS IN ORBIT. GIVEN-- GIVEN THE STATE OF THE EARTH, DO YOU EVER WISH YOU WERE STILL UP THERE.
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY.
Stephen: CAN WE SHOW THE VIEW?  ( APPLAUSE ) JIM, LET'S SHOW PEOPLE THE VIEW. SO THOSE ARE-- THOSE ARE YOUR SOCKS RIGHT THERE, RIGHT? WE'RE LOOKING AT A PICTURE OF--
THESE ARE MY SOCKS HERE, TOO.
Stephen: THOSE ARE YOUR SOCKS.
Stephen: NO, THOSE FEET RIGHT THERE.
OH!
Stephen: THOSE FEET RIGHT THERE. THOSE ARE YOUR SOCKS.
I SEE THEM. THE ONES WITH THE HOLES IN THEM.
Stephen: ARE THOSE SPECIAL SPACE SOCKS OR ARE THEY LANDS END SOCKS.
I THINK THEY'RE PATAGONIA.
Stephen: DID YOU HOLD UP YOUR PATAGONIA SOCKS AND YOU WERE FLYING OVER PATAGONIA.
WE JOKED ABOUT IT. WE HEAR THERE'S A GIFT SHOP THERE WHERE YOU CAN GET SWEATERS.
Stephen: WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW?
IT'S THE BAHAMAS. I CAN TELL BECAUSE IT'S SO BLUE AND EXPANSIVE, BEAUTIFUL.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER GET TIRED OF IT? LIKE AFTER-- AT WHAT POINT DID YOU GET CRANKY AFTER 340 DAYS?
I NEVER GOT TIRED OF THE VIEW BUT THERE WAS ONE DAY TOWARD THE END WHERE I OPENED UP THE BEHINDO AND I SEE WITHIN A COUPLE OF SECONDS A PATCH OF SAND THAT I RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY AS A SPOT JUST NORTH OF MOGADISHU IN AFRICA, AND I WAS LIKE, IT'S TIME TO GO HOME NOW.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T LITERALLY OPEN THE WINDOW, RIGHT?
WELL, NOT TO LET --
Stephen: BECAUSE THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA!
NOT TO LET THE AIR OUT.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WHEN YOU'RE UP THERE, WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. BECAUSE THE SMELLS-- YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THE SMELLS UP THERE.
THEY LICKER LONGER WITHOUT GRAVITY.
Stephen: DO YOU WEAR COLOGNE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
I DIDN'T.
Stephen: DO THE RUSSIANS WEAR COLOGNE?
POSSIBLY. I DIDN'T CHECK.
Stephen: BUT YOU WORKED WITH THEM, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: YEAH. WHAT'S IT LIKE--
THEY DIDN'T SMELL ANY WORSE THAN US. WE ALL SMELLED.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE SLEEPING IN SPACE?
SLEEPING IS HARD.
Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE ALL DAY LONG ON EARTH WE ARE OPPOSING GRAVITY, AND WHEN YOU COME HOME AND SIT DOWN ON THE COUCH TO WATCH YOUR SHOW, FOR INSTANCE, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MORE COMFORTABLE, AND LATER WHEN YOU GO TO BED YOU'RE MORE COMFORTABLE. IN SPACE, YOU KNOW, WHETHER YOU'RE FLOATING LIKE THIS WORKING OR FLOATING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW, DOING A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT OR WORKING ON THE COMPUTER OR GOING TO SLEEP, SAME LEVEL OF COMFORT, WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO GO TO SLEEP.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT-- WHAT ABOUT CLOSING YOUR EYES? I UNDERSTAND, LIKE, THERE ARE GRAYS UP THERE THAT FKD YOU.
THERE IS COSMIC RADIATION THAT YOU CAN SEE WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED, LITTLE FLASHES LIKE FIREWORKS. AND THEN WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT RADIATION IS ALSO GOING THROUGH YOUR BRAIN, KIND OF KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: SO WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, IT DOESN'T GET DARK. EVEN IF YOU'RE IN A DARK ROOM WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED THERE ARE LITTLE SPARKS GOING OFF?
OCCASIONALLY, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: DO YOU GAIN-- DO YOU GAIN HEIGHT IN SPACE? IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS?
I STRETCHED.
Stephen: YOU STRETCH. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT BEING COMPACTED BY GRAVITY?
CORRECT. SO I'M LIKE 5'6" NOW. MY BROTHER IS STILL THREE FOOT SIX. I GREW TWO FEET.
Stephen: WELL, THAT TAKES ME TO PART OF THE REASONS WHY YOU WENT UP THERE IS THAT YOU HAVE A TWIN BROTHER, MARK ALSO AN ASTRONAUT. THEY HAVE YEARS OF DATA ON YOUR HEALTH AND ON YOUR PHYSICAL CONDITION. AND YOU GUYS DID THIS TWIN STUDY. SO YOU WENT UP THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR, 340 DAYS. WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU WHEN YOU CAME BACK? WERE THERE MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN, LIKE, YOUR BONE DENSITY AND HIS?
SO A LOT OF THIS STUDY WAS GENETIC-BASED. SO THE SUSPICION OF THE--, YOU KNOW, THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS I WOULD GO UP IN SPACE AND BE EXPOSED TO RADIATION, A LOT OF RADIATION, YOU KNOW, HARSH ENVIRONMENT, STRESS. I WOULD AGE, AS REFLECTED BY MY TELOMERES AT A FASTER RATE. THE MERES ARE AN INDICATION OF OUR PHYSICAL AGE.
Stephen: THERE'S A COIL OF PROTEIN, CHROMOSOMES.
THEY THOUGHT I WOULD GET OLDER, AND THE SUSPICION WAS AS WE AGED, MAYBE I WOULD LOOK OLDER THAN MY BROTHER. WHEN WE WOULD GET TO BE 60, HE WOULD LOOK 60 AND I WOULD LOOK 70. BUT I THINK IF THAT HAPPENS, WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS MY BROTHER WOULD GET BOTOX. SEEMS LIEB THE KIND OF THING HE MIGHT DO.
Stephen: DO YOU LORD IT OVER YOUR BROTHER THAT YOU SPENT MORE TIME IN SPACE THAN HE DID?
EVERY CHANCE I GET.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, HERE YOU ARE-- HERE YOU ARE BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE CAPSULE WHEN IT LANDED IN KAZAKHSTAN. WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU GET BACK ON EARTH AFTER ALL THAT TIME IN SPACE?
UM, YOU MEAN, LIKE THE FIRST THING I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT?  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: IT'S NOT A NEWS SHOW, SIR. THERE'S-- WE HAVE NO DIGNITY HERE!
I WENT HOME AND I JUMPED IN MY SWIMMING POOL. BECAUSE I HADN'T TAKEN A SHOWER IN A YEAR. SO I WAS --
Stephen: WOW!
YEAH.
Stephen: WOW.
AND I JUST WANTED WATER --
Stephen: THERE WAS CHLORINE IN THE POOL I HOPE.
THERE WAS.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU CAN'T IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE SPACE.
FOR A YEAR.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF BREATHING THAT AIR IN AND SUCK IT OUT. EVERY ASTRONAUT WHO GOES UP THERE DOES THAT TRICK FOR US.
AND PLAYING WITH YOUR FOOD AND STUFF, THAT GOING TO OLD AFTER A WHILE.
Stephen: UH-HUH, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO SPACE. IS IT-- IS IT-- WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IT?
I WOULD. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. IT'S A PRIVILEGE. IT'S THE-- YOU KNOW, IT WAS A PROFESSIONAL, YOU KNOW, LIKE ACHIEVEMENT OF MY LIFE BEING ABLE TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IN SPACE. ESPECIALLY FOR A KID LIKE ME WHO WAS AS-- GROWING UP THIS KID THAT COULDN'T PAY ATTENTION IN SCHOOL. IF I WAS IN SCHOOL TODAY, I WOULD BE THE KID WITH A.D.D., OR A.D.H.D.
Stephen: YOU TALK ABOUT THIS IN YOUR BOOK "ENDURANCE," WHICH IS NOT ONLY ABOUT YOUR TIME IN SPACE BUT YOUR LIFE AND WHAT IT TOOK TO GET THERE. YOU WEREN'T A GOOD STUDENT. I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO BE A GOOD STUDENT TO BE AN ASTRONAUT.
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT. AND THEY THINK THAT--  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE SMARTEST KID IN THE CLASS GROWING UP. BUT I WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE, LOOKING OUT THE BEHINDO, DAYDREAMING. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS IN COLLEGE AND PICKED UP THE BOOK "THE RIGHT STUFF," AND IT, YOU KNOW, INSPIRED ME THAT I COULD DO MORE, IF I COULD ONLY BE A BETTER STUDENT.
Stephen: DID YOU END UP MEETING ANY OF THE GUYS WHO WERE PROFILED IN "THE RIGHT STUFF."
YEAHING, ABSOLUTELY OVER THE YEARS, YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU TELL THEM, "THIS IS WHAT INSPIRED ME TO BE AN ASTRONAUT?"
NO, I DIDN'T. I TOLD TOM WOLF, THOUGH.
Stephen: YOU TOLD TOM WOLF?
I TOLD TOM WOLF.
Stephen: SO IF THERE ARE OTHER KID OUT THERE WHO MIGHT BE A LITTLE A.D.D., WHO MIGHT BE STARING OUT THE WINDOW. THERE'S HOPE FOR THEM, IF THEY JUST BUCKLE DOWN THEY COULD STARE DOWN THIS WINDOW, TOO.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR GOING THERE. "ENDURANCE" IS OUT NOW. CAPTAIN SCOTT KELLY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANKS, SCOTT. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. JOIN ME NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE JOINED BY MARK RUFFALO, NICOLE KIDMAN, AND WHOOPI GOLDBERG. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
