(  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOOO! WHOOO! YEAH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU LADSEES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE SHOW! WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY. AS YOU CAN TELL BY YOUR CHANTING, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. LET'S ALL GET RELAX. WE'RE GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER NIGHT. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME REAL PROGRESS. (LAUGHTER) YOU GUYS CATCH THE GAME TONIGHT THAT HADN'T BEEN ON YET? MAN. THAT SURE WAS SOME SWEET ATHLETIC ACTION. I KNOW ONE TEAM PUT THE BALL IN THE SCORE AREA ENOUGH TIMES TO WIN. BUT TO ME, ALL THE BALL PEOPLE ARE WINNERS. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE HERE ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD WE'RE ALL PREPARING FOR HURRICANE JOAQUIN. NOBODY KNOWS, YOU GUYS WORRIED ABOUT IT, TALKING ABOUT IT.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE NOBODY KNOW WHERE IT WILL MAKE LANDFALL BUT METEOROLOGISTS PREDICT WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THE BOTTLE WATER AISLE OF YOUR GROCERY STORE WILL BE DEFER STATED! (LAUGHTER) -- DEVASTATED.
Stephen: AGAIN, PEOPLE APPLAUDING FOR DEVASTATION. AGAIN, HURRICANE JOAQUIN IS INTENSE AND ERRATIC LIKE ITS NAME SAKE JOAQUIN PHOENIX. SO PLEASE, STOCK UP ON CANNED GOODS, BATTERIES, BY THE WAY BY CANNED GOODS, I MEAN PRINGLES BECAUSE HURRICANES ALWAYS A CHEAP DATE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, IF YOU WERE THINKING OF GETTING A PUPPY THIS WEEKEND, DO NOT GET A PUPPY THIS WEEKEND, ALL RIGHT. CATS, OKAY. A CAT IS OKAY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS IS A TRUE STORY. DURING HURRICANE CHARLIE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, WE FOUND A KITTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD IN MY HOMETOWN, CHARLESSTON SOUTH CAROLINA. IT WAS A BAN CONNED-- ABANDONED AND WE ADOPTED IT. WE NAMED THE KITTEN CHARL-YEAR IN HONOR OF THE NAME CHARLIE. AND THE HURRICANE DIDN'T DO ANY DAMAGE BUT THE KITTEN CLAWED UP OUR SILK CURTAINS. SO YOU KNOW, IT WAS A TRADE-OFF. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ANYWAY, WE'VE GOT SOME WONDERFUL GUESTS TONIGHT. FIRST UP, I WILL BE TALKING WITH UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES. YOU MEET HIM YET? LOVELY GUY. HE HAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN THE WORLD. AND IF DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED, KERRY WILL BE SUCCEEDED BY GARY BUSEY. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED CLAIRE DANES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALWAYS LOVELY TO HAVE. SHE IS THE STAR OF "HOMELAND" WHICH THIS YEAR TAKES PLACE IN GERMANY SO I WILL ASK HER IF THEY ARE CHANGING THE NAME TO "FATHERLAND" THEN I WILL SIT DOWN WITH YOUTUBE STAR PEWDIEPIE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHO HAS A VERY SELECTIVE SCREAM IN THIS AUDIENCE, YOU WILL NOTICE. HE IS THE FIRST EVER TO REACH 10 BILLION VIEWS. AN HERE IS THE CRAZY PART. HE IS NOT A CAT. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, OH, OH, DOES ANYONE ELSE FEEL LIKE HAVING SEX RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER) ALSO THERE'S MUSIC PLAYING. THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY.
HI!
Stephen: THEY'RE ABOUT TO START THE SHOW. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING. A NEW STUDY SAYS TALKING TO A THERAPIST MAY NOT HELP TREAT DEPRESSION. AND IF HEARING THAT NEWS MAKES YOU DEPRESSED, I HAVE NO SUGGESTIONS. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY. CLAIRE DANES.  INTERNET SENSATION, PEWDIEPIE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: HEY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, JON BATISTE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, HUMANS. WOW! THANKS, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M GLAD YOU GUYS STUCK AROUND. SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE IOWA CAUCUSES ARE JUST A SCANT FOUR MONTHS AWAY. MEANING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE CORNER WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND YET. BUT THE CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY IN GEAR. THAT GEAR? NEUTRAL. BUT--  (LAUGHTER) THIS IS A VERY BIG DAY. YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT BUT IT IS THE DAY ALL CANDIDATES HAVE TO REPORT TO THE FED RAL ELECTION COMMISSION ON HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'VE RECEIVED IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS. AND THE BIG NEWS IS THAT VERMONT SENATOR AND ROOFTOP BEE KEEPER BERNIE SANDERS TOOK IN A WHOPPING $26 MILLION. I HAD NO IDEA. I HAD NO-- YES, I AGREE. IT'S EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THE SAME PEOPLE CHEERING ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO CHEERED FOR PEWDIEPIE. I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD MAKE THAT KIND OF CASH ON ETSY. 26 MILLION COLORS-- DOLLARS IS MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH MONEY AS JEB BUSH PULLED IN, EVEN THOUGH THIS SUMMER AN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE, I GAVE JEB BUSH THREE DOLLARS. (LAUGHTER) THEY ACTUALLY HAD A BUTTON FOR THAT AMOUNT. AND IT PERFECTLY MATCHED HOW MUCH I WANT HIM TO BE PRESIDENT. IT'S NOT ZERO, IT'S NOT ZERO, THEN AGAIN, ON THE WAY TO WORK TODAY I GAVE A HOMELESS GUY A PFEIFFER. AND SINCE THEN, JEB HAD THANKED ME IN THE FORM OF NONSTOP E-MAILS FROM HIS WHOLE FAMILY. I GET THEM FROM JEB AND ALL THE GEORGES, W, HW, P, BOY AND CURIOUS. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM. I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY KEEP HITTING ME UP FOR THE GREEN, BECAUSE THESE CAMPAIGNS NEED A CONSTANT INFLUX OF MONEY TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE OFFICES AND PHONES AND STAFF. SO THE STAFF WILL HAVE AN OFFICE WHERE THEY CAN CALL YOU ON THE PHONE TO ASK FOR MORE MONEY. SO CAMPAIGNS ARE CONSTANTLY INNOVATING NEW WAYS TO PULL IN FUNDS. HOWARD DEAN PIONEERED INTERNET FUND-RAISING. GEORGE McGOVERN WAS THE FIRST TO RAISE MONEY VIA DIRECT MAIL AND EVEN GEORGE WASHINGTON RAISED CASH BY BEING IT. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW I'M SO HAPPY TO SAY COMES ANOTHER BREAK THROUGH MOMENT IN CAMPAIGN FUND-RAISING. THANKS TO FLORIDA SENATOR AND SEARS PORTRAIT GALLERY SAMPLE DAD MARCO RUBIO. RUBBIO A WEB SITE ALREADY FEATURES SOME GREAT MERCHANDISE LIKE A MARCO POLO SHIRT, OR A WATER BOTTLE THAT SAYS "WATER GREAT NATION" GET IT? IT'S WATER, BECAUSE THAT PUN IS SO TORTURED IT'S LIKE BEING WATER BOARDED. BUT THE FUND-RAISING BREAKTHROUGH ON THE RUBBIO WEB SITE IS THAT FOR $250 YOU CAN ADOPT A RUBBIO STAFFER FOR A DAY. THAT, I GOT TO SAY, THAT REALLY PULLS AT THE HEART STRINGS. I MEAN I WASN'T GOING TO DONATE TO MARCO RUBBIO BUT I CAN'T LET HIS-- RUBIO BUT I CAN'T LET HIS STAFF WHO ARE EVIDENTLY ORPHANS GO UNPURCHASED. AND FOR YOUR IT 50 YOU WILL GET RECOGNITION ON TWITTER AND THEIR WEB SITE, AN UPDATE FROM THE STAFFER YOU ADOPTED AND A POSTCARD FROM THEIR TEAM. AND AS TRUE CONSERVATIVES, THEY MIGHT EVEN WRITE A MESSAGE ON IT ABOUT HOW INEFFICIENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BEFORE HAVING IT DELIVERED ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY FOR 35 CENTS. THIS, I BELIEVE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PEWDIEPIE! THIS IS TRULY GROUND BREAKING, I BELIEVE. IF IF THEY'RE MODELLING THEMSELVES ON SAVE THE CHILDREN, I'M THINKING THINGS ARE PRETTY ROUGH DOWN IN RUBIOH HQ. THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER BECAUSE THEIR BOSS TAKES ALL OF IT. AND WHETHER OR NOT I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH RUBIO'S POLICIES, I WAS SO INSPIRED THAT I'M COMMITTED TO DOING ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP OTHER THAN GIVING HIM MONEY. (LAUGHTER) HELLO. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AS I SPEAK, RUBIO CAMPAIGN STAFFERS ARE DIGGING THROUGH GARBAGE LOOKING FOR USED COFFEE FILTERS TO TURN INTO TACOS. THESE STAFFERS WORK 80 HOURS A WEEK. AND USE WET PAPER TOWELS TO TAKE A BUM SHOWER IN THE BATHROOM OF AN IOWA DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS. BUT FOR JUST 250 DOLLARS A DAY, THE PRICE OF A CUP OF COFFEE EVERY 11 MINUTES, WHICH IS LESS THAN THEY DRINK, YOU CAN SEND THESE STAFFERS THE HELP THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED TO KEEP GOING. LIKE MORE COFFEE. REDBULL, AND LET'S JUST SAY NEW HAMPSHIRE MARCHING POWDER. SO PLEASE, CALL TODAY, OR DON'T. THEY'LL CALL YOU. CUZ THEY'RE ON PHONE DUTY FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS. IT'S TOO LATE FOR TYLER HERE. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE TO HONESTLY SAY I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO GET IN MY LAP. (LAUGHTER) HOW ARE YOU DOING, BUDDY? YOU OKAY? YOU OKAY? TRAGICALLY TYLER HERE VOLUNTEERED FOR THE PERRY CAMPAIGN. AND NOW HE HAS TO BE PUT DOWN.
I WENT TO HARVARD.
Stephen: SHHH, SHHH, NONE OF THAT MATTERS NOW. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE GIVE TODAY. LET'S GO FOR A DRIVE, BUDDY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER SENATOR, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE CURRENT U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JOHN KERRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU DOING?
TYLER IS NOT GOING TO JUMP IN MY LAP, IS HE?
IF YOU GIVE HIM SOME CASH HE WILL. HOW MUCH, BY THE WAY, HOW MUCH DO YOU MISS FUND-RAISING?
IT'S THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD. I'M SO HAPPY, IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS JOB.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ANYBODY FOR MONEY, JUST NOT END THE WORLD. LET'S TALK ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD FOR A SECOND. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE IRAN DEAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CONGRATULATIONS, CONGRATULATIONS, I ASSUME, I DON'T KNOW. SOME PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU SAVED US. SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU'VE KILLED US. WHICH DO YOU THINK IT IS? I ASSUME YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD THING. TELL ME WHY, IF I'M SOMEONE WHO THINKS THAT YOU CAPITULATED LIKE NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, WHY THAT'S WRONG.
WELL, FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN RELIED ON WORDS. THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT. HE SIMPLY LISTENED TO WHAT --
HE HELD UP A PIECE OF PAPER --
YEAH, BUT THERE WAS NOVERRIFICATION. NOTHING CERTAIN. WE HAVE 159 PAGES THAT WE NEGOTIATED OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS THAT LAYS OUT, STEPHEN, EVERY SINGLE REQUIREMENT THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE TO PERFORM. THEY DON'T GET ANY RELIEF FROM THE SANCTIONS UNTIL THEY HAVE KNOCKED THEIR STOCKPILE OF ENRICHED FU CIRCUMSTANCES LE MATERIAL DOWN, UNTIL THEY HAVE DESTROYED MANY OF THEIR CENTRIFUGES, UNTIL THEY'VE STOPPED-- I MEAN THERE ARE A SERIES OF THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO BEFORE THEY GET ANY HELP. SO THEN WE HAVE THE VERIFICATION SYSTEM WITH 24/7, 365 WATCHING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE THE PROGRAM IS GOING. AND THAT GOES ON FOR 15, 20, THERE ARE DIFFERENT GRADES OF WHAT'S REQUIRED, 25 YEARS, WE TRACK EVERY SINGLE BIT OF URANIUM THAT IS PRODUCED IN THEIR MINES AND GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE. AND FOR LIFETIME, FOREVER, THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THIS THING CALLED THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL WHICH REQUIRES INSPECTIONS.
Stephen: THAT FOREVER SAY LONG TIME.
YEAH, IT IS.
Stephen: AND AREN'T WE KICKING THE NUCLEAR CAN DOWN THE ROAD 15 YEARS AND LETTING SOMEBODY ELSE AS SECRETARY OF STATE-- SECRETARY OF STATE TAYLOR SWIFT, LETTING HER DEAL WITH THIS 15 YEARS FROM NOW.
YEAH, THAT'S GARY BUSEY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I WOULD NOT WANT TO-- I WOULD NOT WANT TO NEGOTIATE WITH GARY BUSEY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT GUY IS GOING TO DO.
I WOULD LIKE TO NEGOTIATE WITH TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT. YOU CAN BE PART OF THE GIRL SQUAD. BUT THE IRANIAN, THE AYATOLLAHS, THE SUPREME LEADERS STILL CALL THE UNITED STATES THE GREAT SATAN AM HOW CAN WE TRUST THEM IF THEY BELIEVE WE'RE THE ULTIMATE EVIL. WHY WOULDN'T THEY LIE TO US IN ORDER JUST TO GET WHAT THEY WANT BECAUSE THEY DON'T OWE US ANYTHING BECAUSE WE'RE EVIL.
WELL, THEY MIGHT, STEVEN -- STEPHEN, AND THEY DO CALL US THE GREAT SATANMENT BUT THIS DEAL WASN'T INTENDED TO SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS WITH IRAN. PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A FUNDAMENTAL DECISION. IRAN CANNOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. WHY? BECAUSE IN IRAN WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON, IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT HARDER TO DEAL WITH AN THAN AN IRAN WITHOUT ONE. AND BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT NUCLEAR WEAPONS SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE REGION OR ANYWHERE, FOR THAT MATTER. SO THE FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEAL WITH THE NUCLEAR WEAPON. AND WE HAD A VERY TARGETED DISCIPLINED EFFORT HERE WHERE WE DID NOT GET SIDETRACKED. AS SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULD HAVE. AND THERE IS SOME CRITICISM OF US FOR THAT.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER ATTEMPT-- YOU, THE PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION TELLED TO WALK AWAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE MOST CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR YOU?
THERE WERE SEVERAL. THERE WERE A NUMBER. IN FACT, A WEEK OUT THERE WAS A MOMENT IN THE EVENING WHEN WE REALLY THOUGHT THIS WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I SAT DOWN WITH MY FELLOW FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM GER MANNY, FRANCE, CHINA, BRITAIN, RUSSIA, AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS POSSIBILITY THAT IT MAY NOT HAPPEN, AND THEREFORE WHERE WILL THINGS GO IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS A RESULT OF THAT. THEN THE NEXT DAY, I HAD A PERSONAL CONVERSATION WITH MY COUNTERPART FROM IRAN. AND WE REALLY KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THE STAKES FOR THE WORLD, FOR THE REGION, FOR ALL OF US. AND I SAID LOOK, IF YOU ARE'S NOT SERIOUS, WE'RE READY TO GO HOME. YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND. AND THEY CAME BACK AND SOMEHOW WE MANAGED TO GET BACK ON TRACK AND OBVIOUSLY A ABOUT A WEEK LATER WE CLOSED THE AGREEMENT.
Stephen: YOU RELATED YOUR EXPERIENCE IN VIETNAM TO YOUR DETERMINATION TO GET THIS DEAL. WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE?
WAR. I MEAN IF WE DIDN'T GET AN AGREEMENT WITH IRAN, THE PRESSURES THAT WOULD HAVE MOUNTED BECAUSE IRAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PURSUING ITS PROGRAM,.
Stephen: SO IT WAS WAR OR THE DEAL?
WELL, OUR PERCEPTION WAS-- IT WOULDN'T BE WAR DAY ONE OR IMMEDIATELY. BUT IF IRAN CONTINUED TO ENRICH AND ISRAEL AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION SAW THEM DOING THAT, THEN THE PRESSURE WAS GOING TO MOUNT INDEX ORABLY TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND IF YOU TRIED NEGOTIATION AND HAVE FAILED OR YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE, YOU THEN WIND UP BEING PRESSURED TOWARDS THE CONFLICT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED IN VIETNAM WAS PRETTY SIMPLE. THAT IT WAS A WAR IN WHICH TOO MANY OF MY FRIENDS DIED AND DIED, I BELIEVED, UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVERTED HAD DIFFERENT CHOICES BEEN MADE BY PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY. AND I VOWED THAT IF I WAS EVER ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IN A POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY, I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN AMERICA WERE NEVER SENT TO WAR UNLESS IT WAS A LAST RESORT. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. YOU CAN STICK AROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS WELL THAT ARE WORT TALKING ABOUT. WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL CONTINUE SPEAKING WITH SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY. JOIN US.
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY. MR. SECRETARY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. NOW WERE YOU LOOK PRETTY RESTED FOR A MAN WHO MUST HAVE A LOT ON HIS MIND, BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS HAVE STARTED BOMBING IN SYRIA. AND THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO BOMB ISIS TARGETS, BUT NOW Y'ALL ARE SAYING THEY'RE BOMBING PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TRAINED TO FIGHT ASSAD. I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW, GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK I CAN'T TRUST THIS PUTIN GUY. WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING OVER THERE?
PRETTY GOOD JUDGEMENT. WELL, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS A CATASTROPHE FOR EVERYBODY IN SYRIA AND IN THE REGION. A HUMAN CATASTROPHE UNPARALLELED, REALLY, IN MODERN TIMES RIGHT NOW. MORE REFUGEES THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN, WE'VE SEEN THEM INUNDATING EUROPE. 2 MILLION IN TURKEY, ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF TO CLOSE TO 2 NOW IN JORDAN AND ABOUT A MILLION PLUS IN LEBANON. AND THE OTHERS ARE JUST DISPLACED. I MEAN THE RUSSIANS TALK ABOUT HOW ASSAD IS THE ONLY GUY WHO CAN SAVE SYRIA. BUT THERE'S NO SYRIA TO SAVE OTHER THAN THE AREA THAT HE HAS. THERE IS A SYRIA TO SAVE.
Stephen: HE ALSO BARREL BOMBED HIS OWN PEOPLE AN GASSED THEM.
GASSED HIS OWN PEOPLE, BARREL BOMBED HIS OWN PEOPLE, STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, TORTURED HIS OWN PEOPLE. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST BRUTALLY TORTURED.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE PLAN IN SYRIA, AND AS A FOLLOWUP QUESTION, IS THERE A PLAN IN SYRIA?
BOTH QUESTIONS ARE FAIR. YES, AND YES. THE PLAN IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON ISIL. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR TO RUSSIA, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR A YEAR.
Stephen: SO THEY'RE FLYING AND WE'RE FLYING. TWO GREAT SUPERPOWERS IN THE WORLD FLYING OVER A WAR-TORN COUNTRY. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG, SIR. DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS AT ALL?
SURE. AN THAT'S PRECISELY WHY WE HAD A MEETING TODAY WITH THE RUSSIANS WHICH WILL BE FOLLOWED UP WITH ANOTHER ONE VERY QUICKLY. AS WE DO WHAT IS CALLED DECONFLICTING. WHICH IS IF THEY ARE THERE TO FIGHT ISIL --
DECONFLICTING? >>.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR AIRPLANE --
A NEW ONE FOR ME.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE-- IT'S A LOUSY WORD. BUT IT'S --
I'M SURE IT IS A GOOD GOAL.
THANK YOU. I ACCEPT THAT. (LAUGHTER) IT IS A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT PLANES AREN'T GOING TO BE SHOOTING EACH OTHER AND WE START SOMETHING WORSE. AND IT'S VERY SERIOUS. SO WE ARE TRYING TO DEFINE WHO WILL DO WHAT, WHERE, AND THIS WILL TEST WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE REALLY GOING AFTER ISIL OR WHETHER THEY'RE THERE TO SUPPORT THE ASSAD REGIME. IF THEY'RE THERE TO SUPPORT THE ASSAD REGIME, RUSSIA HAS MADE A CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE SIDING WITH ASSAD, WITH IRAN AND WITH HEZBOLLAH AGAINST THE ENTIRE REST OF THE COMMUNITY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, AGAINST SUNNIES, AND IT RUNS THE RISK OF REALLY INVITING EVEN MORE JIHADISTS TO COME INTO SYRIA. RUSSIA WILL THEN BECOME THE TARGET OF SOME OF THAT. SO WE HOPE THEY WILL SEE THE COMMON SENSE IN THE NEXT DAYS. BUT NO MATTER WHAT, WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR POLICY. AND IT IS OUR POLICY. OF DESTROYING ISIL. WE'VE DONE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE'VE THROWN 3,000 AIR STRIKES. WE'VE SAVED WHOLE COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE 100,000 PEOPLE THAT RETURNED TO TIKRIT IN IRAQ. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE KOBANI IN SYRIA. WE MOVED DOWN THE BORDER OF NORTHERN SYRIA. SO ISIL IS INCREASINGLY UNDER PRESSURE, STILL ABLE TO OPERATE. BUT THAT PRESSURE IS GOING TO GROW. AND IF WE CAN HAVE RUSSIA ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON ISIL, THEN WE HAVE A CHANCE OF DESTROYING HIM SOONER. IF THEY DON'T, WE WILL STAY FOCUSED ON THEM WITH OUR COALITION OF MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES, STEPHEN, WHICH WE'VE PUT TOGETHER.
Stephen: WHO ARE WE HELPING?
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE, THERE WAS TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE MODERATE REBELS IN SYRIA. WHO ARE WE HELPING?
WHO ARE THE GOOD GUYS OR ARE THERE ANY GOOD GUYS? ARE ALL THE GOOD GUYS THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE LEFT. THE REFUGEES ARE THE GOOD GUYS.
THE REALLY GOOD GUYS, THE REALLY GOOD GUYS ARE THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AND WHO OBJECT TO WHAT ASSAD IS DOING. BUT THERE ARE-- THERE IS A SOLID GROUP OF OPPOSITIONS WHO ARE FIGHTING ON THE GROUND, WHO ARE NOT EXTREMISTS, BUT WHO WANT A SYRIA THAT IS DEMOCRATIC AND SECULAR AND UNIFIED AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF THE CITIZENS. WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON A POLITICAL TRACK TO SEE AND TEST WHETHER RUSSIA IS, INDEED, CERTIFICATIA-- SERIOUS ABOUT VOLUME OF THIS PROBLEMMENT BUT THE ONLY WAY IN THE END THAT IT WILL BE SOLVED IS FOR ASSAD TO TRANSITION OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IN A STRUCTURED MANAGED WAY.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET HIM TO LEAVE. HE HAS DONE SUCH TERRIBLE THINGS. BUT WHERE DO YOU ALLOW HIM TO GO. DO YOU ALLOW HIM TO GO TO RUSSIA, GET A NICE-- IN THE MOUNTAINS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. GIVE A PIECE OF CHEESE AT THE BORDER. HOW DO YOU GET SOMEONE LIKE THAT TO EVER LEAVE ONCE THEY CROSS THE RUBICON.
IT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE LEFT. THE 30 YEAR DICTATOR IN TUNISIA LEFT AND IS LIVING SOUTH OF THERE NOW. THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT. AND IF RUSSIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING A SOLUTION AND WANTING TO SAVE CERTIFICATIA, THEN THEY CAN JOIN US IN THE EFFORT OF PERSUADING ASSAD TO BE THE SAVIOUR OF THIS COUNTRY, NOT THE KILLER OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. I HOPE THAT THEY WILL SEE THE BETTER WISDOM IN NOT BEING ALIGNED WITH ASSAD, ALIGNED WITH IRAN, ALIGNED WITH HEZBOLLAH. AND AGAINST ALL OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGHT ISIL AND SAVE SYRIA AT THE SAME TIME.
Stephen: WELL, MANY YEARS AGO I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO GET TO KNOW RICHARD HOLBROOK. AND I WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH HIM ONCE WITH HIM WILLEY NELSON AND ME, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
I DO BELIEVE IT.
Stephen: IT WAS A FUN PARTY. AND WILLIE WAS ASKING ME ABOUT THE IDEA OF CREATING A DEPARTMENT OF PEACE, A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT Y NOT A PEACE DEDEPARTMENT. AND RICHARD HOLBROOK SAID TO WILLIE, WILLIE, WE HAVE ONE, IT'S CALLED THE STATE DEPARTMENT. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENCE OF MAKING THAT A REALITY AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
