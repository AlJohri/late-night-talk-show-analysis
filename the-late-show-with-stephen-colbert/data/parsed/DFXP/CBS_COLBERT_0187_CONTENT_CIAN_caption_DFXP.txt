Stephen: A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. OH, I HAD! I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE. IN FACT, I CAN'T SEE MUCH RIGHT NOW. AFTER TWO STRAIGHT WEEKS OF LIVE SHOWS, I'M LIKE A NEMATODE, JUST REACTING BLINDLY TO SOUND AND COLOR. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES I SEE POKEMON WITHOUT MY PHONE! GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL! COME HERE! COME HERE, YOU! WHAT'S MORE-- THIS IS TRUE-- I AM TAPING THIS FRIDAY SHOW AFTER THE REGULAR LIVE SHOW THAT I DID LAST NIGHT ON THURSDAY. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M SO TIRED, I CAN TIME TRAVEL! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WILL SHARPEN ME UP? OH, THE COOL, REFRESHING TASTE OF BUD LIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES. BUD LIGHT: THE OFFICIAL BEER OF MID-WEEK DRINKING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TONIGHT, WE WILL BE LOOKING BACK AT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM MY COVERAGE OF THIS WEEK'S DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT THEM. I'M GOING TO BE TAKING A LITTLE NAPPY-NAP. JIM

I DID NOT AGREE TO APPEAR IN THIS. I WAS JUST TOLD TO WAIT HERE WITH THESE THINGS ON MY EARS. NO ONE MENTIONED THIS IS PART OF A WEIRDLY EARNEST A CAPPELLA SONG FOR CLINTON. AWFUL.
WHAT THE HELL! WE TALKED AT THE A CAPPELLA MEETING. I WAS GOING TO HAVE THE HAT AND THE HAIR. ♪ THIS IS OUR FIGHT SONG ♪
AGAIN, I DID NOT AGREE TO BE PART OF THIS. THIS SONG IS GOING TO IRRITATE PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JOHN OLIVER, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVINCING. DEATH. TAXES. HILLARY.
Stephen: WELCOME! WELCOME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HI, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO MY DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION HIGHLIGHTS SHOW, HOSTED BY ME AND MY BEST-- MY BEST BUD HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE ARE LITERALLY FRIENDS. HE'S TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT? EVERYONE'S LAUGHING AT ME? WELL, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO. I KNOW HOW TO SHUT YOU UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUD LIGHT: PUT IT IN YOUR WEEKEND HOLE. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, BACK WHEN I COULD STILL STAND, I WOULD DO THAT OVER THERE AND TELL JOKES. HERE'S A LOOK AT SOME OF OUR FAVORITES THIS WEEK. BERNIE SUPPORTERS HAVE LONG ACCUSED THE D.N.C. AND THEIR CHAIRWOMAN, DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, OF A PRO-HILLARY BIAS. AND NOW THAT THESE E-MAILS HAVE BEEN LEAKED, WASSERMAN SCHULTZ IS IN DEEP-- WHAT'S THE WORD?
DOO-DOO.
Stephen: THANK YOU. IN ONE LEAKED E-MAIL, A D.N.C. STAFFER SUGGESTS ATTACKING SANDERS' FAITH WONDERING: ( LAUGHTER ) , OF COURSE,. OF COURSE. THAT MAKES SENSE, PEEPS ARE VERY RELIGIOUS. THOSE LITTLE MARSHMALLOW CHICKS NEVER MISS AN EASTER SUNDAY. BY EARLY EVENING, THINGS HAD CALMED DOWN, BUT THEN BERNIE SUPPORTER SARAH SILVERMAN AND HILLARY SUPPORTER AL FRANKEN TOOK THE STAGE AND SARAH SILVERMAN GOT A LITTLE TIRED OF THE CROWD.
TO THE "BERNIE OR BUST PEOPLE" YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW. IT IS RARE WHEN THE COMEDIAN HECKLES THE AUDIENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE SARAH, AND I'M GLAD SHE SAID SOMETHING BECAUSE BERNIE SUPPORTERS ARE KNOWN TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO STRONG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN. THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT SPEECHES TONIGHT, BUT LEAVE IT TO MICHELLE OBAMA TO TRULY UNIFY THE DEMOCRATS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU SAW IT? INCREDIBLE. >
Jon: INCREDIBLE SPEECH.
Stephen: WITH TONIGHT'S MOVING SPEECH, SHE CONVINCED EVERYONE IN THAT ARENA THAT IT WAS FINALLY TIME TO ELECT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FORMER FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA.
I WANT SOMEONE WITH THE PROVEN STRENGTH TO PERSEVERE, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THIS JOB AND TAKES IT SERIOUSLY, SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE ISSUES A PRESIDENT FACES ARE NOT BLACK AND WHITE AND CANNOT BE BOILED DOWN TO 140 CHARACTERS.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S GOOD. I'M GOING TO TWEET THAT RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S GOOD. REALLY GOT IT. HILLARY CLINTON-- THIS MEANS HILLARY CLINTON COULD BE THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT, AND AMERICA WILL FINALLY CATCH UP WITH 1960s SRI LANKA. , OF COURSE, TONIGHT, PRIME TIME SPOT, DEMOCRATS BROUGHT OUT THE BIG DOG, POTENTIAL FIRST LADY'S MAN, BILL CLINTON. ( LAUGHTER ) AND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S OFFICIAL. THAT'S OFFICIALLY THE NAME. I'VE COINED IT. THAT'S OFFICIALLY THE NAME FROM NOW ON. AND, OF COURSE, BILL LED OFF WITH SOME CLASSIC CLINTON CHARM.
IN THE SPRING OF 1971, I MET A GIRL.
Stephen: BILL, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HILLARY! ALSO TONIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON'S RUNNING MATE, VIRGINIA SENATOR AND LOOSE-FIT KHAKI MODEL TIM KAINE WAS THERE. THE THRILLA WHO'S VANILLA. ♪ ♪ ♪ NOW, SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC THEY'RE HOPING TIM KAINE WILL ATTRACT? ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
Stephen: THEY WERE PUSHING THIS SPANISH THING SO HARD, THAT TONIGHT THEY INTRODUCED HIM BY BREAKING HIM OUT OF A PINATA.
YOU FELL FOR MY BRILLIANT WIFE AND PARTNER, MICHELLE. WHO SOMEHOW HASN'T AGED A DAY. I KNOW. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. HE HAS AGED. JIMMY, CAN WE SEE A PHOTO OF HIM IN 2008? THERE YOU GO. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, YEAH. AND, AND NOW IN 2016? YIKES. OH, HE'S-- THAT'S ABOUT THE MAKEUP. HILLARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO ACCEPT A MAJOR PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, HOWEVER YOU FEEL, HOWEVER YOU FEEL ABOUT EITHER OF THE CANDIDATES, I GOT CHILLS. I GOT GOOSEBUMPS. AS SOON AS YOU SEE IT HAPPEN, YOU GO, OF COURSE, IT'S SO OBVIOUS. WHY HASN'T THIS HAPPENED BEFORE? THIS IS HUGE. THIS IS THE BUGGEST BREAKTHROUGH FOR WOMEN SINCE THEY WON THE RIGHT TO BUST GHOSTS. HILLARY, OF COURSE, WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MADE HISTORY AT THIS CONVENTION. LAST NIGHT HER V.P. PICK, TIM KAINE, ACCEPTED NOMINATION TO BECOME THE 48th CONSECUTIVE MALE VICE PRESIDENT. THE STREAK CONTINUES! WAY TO GO!
HILLARY RODHAM GREW UP IN PARK RIDGE, ILLINOIS.
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING HILLARY IS GOING TO WIN EVANGELICALS, BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THAT WAS NARRATED BY GOD. THAT WAS GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: RESONANT VOICE.
Stephen: OH! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THIS WEEK HAS BEEN SO ROUGH AND RELEAPTLESS THAT AT TIMES I THOUGHT I NEEDED A SAFE WORD. MINE IS BUD LIGHT. A LITTLE DAB WILL DOIA. ABOUT 200 YEARS AGO, LAST WEEK, I WAS DOWN AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. AND MY FRIEND JULIUS FLICKER MAN FROM HUNGER FOR POWER GAME WAS ALSO THERE. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FAIR IF WE DID THE SAME THING THIS WEEK AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION AND WE WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF ACTUALLY GETTING-- CAN YOU SEE THIS-- WE GOT AN ACTUAL PODIUM PASS WHICH AS LOWZ YOU UP ON THE PODIUM FOR HIS WEASEL. AND THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE. JIM?
THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES! ICA LIGULA, WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. FINALLY, A CHANCE FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO PROVE TO THE BERNIE DELEGATES THAT SHE IS NOT A PUPPET OF THE BIG BANKS. AND WHAT BETTER PLACE THAN THE WELLS FARGO ARENA! OOOH, DELICIOUS, LETS GO! I FEEL LIKE I'M DESCENDING INTO THE LOWER INTESTINAL TRACT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RIGHT NOW, WHERE ALL OF THEIR IDEALS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXCRETED IN THE FORM OF A VIABLE CANDIDACY. HA-HA, IT PAINTS A PICTURE! OH, YES! WE HAVE ARRIVED. BEHIND ME YOU SEE THE THE PODIUM UPON WHICH HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE CROWNED THE NOMINEE. OH, SMELL THAT. THE THE AIR IS THICK WITH BERNIE'S CRUSHED DREAMS. IT'S LIKE A MUSK HANGING IN THE AIR. I'M SORRY, THAT'S CALIGULA. HE'S GETTING A BIT GAMEY. LETS GET HIM IN THE REFRIGERATOR, PLEASE? THE ACOUSTICS ARE WONDERFUL IN HERE. LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! THAT'S GOOD. THAT REALLY RINGS. THAT REALLY RINGS. CALIGULA GET THE SCENT. GET THE SCENT. AND GO FIND THE E-MAILS! THE ONE THING LEFT TO DO WAS THE ONE THING DEMOCRATS REALLY DIDN'T WANT ME TO DO-- MOUNT PODIUM WHERE HILLARY WOULD BE CROWNED. PODIUM PAZ. I HAVE A PODIUM PAZ
I'M JUST WALKING.
YOU CANNOT GO ON THE PODIUM SIR.
COY HAVE A PODIUM PASS. MY WEASEL HAS A PODIUM PAZ. I'M NOT GOING ON THE PODIUM. DON'T STOP ME NOW.
THERE HAD TO BE MORE THAN ONE WAY TO SKIN THIS CAT. WHAT IF MY WEASEL WENT ON AND I DIDN'T? I'LL LEAVE IF YOU JUST LET THE WEASEL ON. JUST THE WEASEL! WHAT COULD THE WEASEL HURT. THAT ONE DOWN THERE IS THE DECISION MAKER. SHE HAS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER ME RIGHT NOW. PLEASE, PLEASE, I HAVE A PODIUM PAZ. YOU SHOULD ALLOW ME ON THE PODIUM. PLEASE, I BEG YOU! I'M SOMEONE'S LITTLE BOY. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TO GO ON THE DEMOCRATIC PODIUM-- STAGE-- WHATEVER YOU CALL IT. I KNEW IT WAS TIME TO BRING IN THE BIG GUNS. YES, SPEAKER PELOSI PLEASE.

Stephen: I NEED YOU TO THROW SOME WEIGHT AROUND. LET'S GO. DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION PODIUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. COLBERT YOU'RE NOT GOING ON THE STAGE.
Stephen: I'M WITH HER. WE'RE ALL GOING ON TOGETHER. SO CLOSE, YET SO FAR AWAY. IS IT OKAY IF I GO ON THE PODIUM?

Stephen: THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO STOP ME. IT WAS A LOT OF FUN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT DOING A TALK SHOW IS WHEN OTHER PEOPLE TALK. YOU KNOW WHO DOES THAT REAL GOOD? JOHN OLIVER! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME! I DIDN'T MEAN-- I KNOW--
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Stephen: I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOUR DANCE BREAK. I KNOW AT HEART, YOU'RE REALLY JUST A HOOFER.
I SPEAK WITH MY BODY. WHEN MY BODY FEELS THE BEAT, IT EXPRESSES THAT BEAT, AND IT DOES THAT WITH WHATEVER THIS IS.
Stephen: OKAY, DID YOU-- DID YOU WATCH THE CONVENTION TONIGHT?
I DID, I DID. I'VE JUST BEEN WATCHING IT BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: YEAH?
I'M ALL ABOUT TIM KAINE. WHERE ARE MY KAINE-IACS IN THE AUDIENCE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT IS THE ENTIRELY REFLECTIVE VIEW OF TIM KAINE IN AMERICA. "OH, YEAH? HE SPOKE TONIGHT?" I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW HIM. THAT WAS SOME-- IF HE'S GOING TO BE AMERICA'S STEP-DAD, THAT WAS AN EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE, THE LEVEL OF DAD JOKES AND IMPRESSIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT MAN'S SOFT FACE. HE IS A TALL GLASS OF LACTAID. HIS DONALD TRUMP IMPRESSION DOESN'T JUST NOT SOUND LIKE DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE ANYBODY. ( LAUGHTER ) I WOULD BUY-- HE EVEN-- HE DID A DAD FLEX AT THE END WHERE THE ONLY THING HE WAS FLEXING WAS HIS FACE. HE WENT... WE DID IT! ( CHEERS ) THAT GUY. TIM KAINE. THAT'S THE STAR OF THE EVENING.
Stephen: YEAH.
FORGET THE PRESIDENT. TIM KAINE IS WHERE IT'S AT.
Stephen: DID YOU WATCH JOE BIDEN?
SURE, BUT, AGAIN, I CAN'T-- NO, NO, TIM KAINE--
Stephen: NO, JOE BIDEN?
JOE BIDEN WAS FINE.
Stephen: FEELINGS.
I'VE NEVER WANTED TO BE CALLED SCAMP BY SOMEONE AS MUCH AS I HAVE.
Stephen: HEY, SPORT.
HEY, SPORT. BEDTIME, SCAMP. LATE, HUH?
Stephen: ASSISTANT MANAGER OF A LOCAL HARDWARE STORE?
EXACTLY. HERE, I'LL OPEN YOUR BEER. I'D RATHER YOU DRANK IT HERE WITH ME.
Stephen: SO HE'S THE COOL STEP-DAD.
HE'S AS COOL AS HE COULD POSSIBLY BE. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE MORE ABOUT TO BREAK INTO A HARMONICA SOLO THAN THAT MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) EVER.
Stephen: HE CAN DO IT. HE CAN DO IT.
I THINK HE MUST HAVE BEEN FRISKED ON THE WAY OUT. "TELL ME YOU DO NOT HAVE IT WITH YOU, TIM." "THEY WANT TO HEAR IT!" "I PROMISE YOU, THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. I WILL SLAP IT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH."
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION OF HILLARY CLINTON?
THAT'S RIGHT! "I WILL OPEN-HAND SLAP IT OUT OF YOUR MOUTH." I SO WANTED TO HIM HEAR SAY, "I HEREBY ACCEPT THE NOMINATION FOR--"
Stephen: ♪ I ACCEPT THE NOMINATION ♪
EXCEPT MY IMPRESSION OF A HARMONICA IS MORE LIKE A TIM KAINE IMPRESSION, BECAUSE IT SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE A HARMONICA OR ANYTHING.
Stephen: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PLAY YOUR FINGERNAILS, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU JUST MAKE A SOUND WITH YOUR MOUTH.
LIKE A STUBBY FLUTE.
Stephen: DID YOU WATCH LAST WHAT WAS INTERESTING FOR ME, THIS WEEK WITH THE DEMOCRATS THEY DID WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO IN A POLITICAL CONVENTION WHICH THE REPUBLICANS FORGOT TO DO-- GREAT COUNTRY, GOING TO BE GREATER.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING TO FORGET TO SAY FOR FOUR DAYS. TO GET THE END OF FOUR DAYS AND SAY WE DEFINITELY SAID WE LOVED AMERICA, RIGHT? CHECK THE TAPE. WE MUST HAVE SAID IT. WE SAY IT ALL TIME.
Stephen: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY IT.
I KIND OF REMEMBER YOU SAYING IT.
Stephen: I WAS GOING TO SAY IT'S A FLAMING POOP PILE.
SOMEONE SAID IT I'M SURE. WE MUST HAVE SAID IT. OH, ( BLEEP ) I DON'T THINK WE SAID IT.
Stephen: ONE THING WE DIDN'T SAY WAS "S," "H," BECAUSE THIS IS LIVE.
SORRY, SORRY.
Stephen: HBO-- HBO/CBS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR MY LAST BROADCAST. WHAT AN HONOR YOU'RE MY LAST GUEST.
BECAUSE OF HBO, YOU GOT OFF LIGHTLY WITH THAT CURSE WORD. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE HAD SOME GREAT SHOWS LATELY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STANDS OUT FOR ME SUACTUALLY USE THE POWER OF YOUR PERCH TO HELP A RUSSIAN WARLORD--
CHECHEN WARLORD. IT'S A GEOGRAPHICAL GRAY AREA.
Stephen: THE RUSSIANS SAY IT IS RUSSIA--
PUTIN WOULD SAY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL, VLAD AND I GO WAY BACK. YOU ACTUALLY HELPED A WARLORD TRY TO FIND HIS CAT.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS-- ( LAUGHTER ) SO A CHECHEN WARLORD LOST HIS CAT, AND HE'S, APPARENTLY, VERY ACTIVE ON INSTAGRAM, WHICH IS OBJECTIVELY LUDICROUS. SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HELP HIM FIND HIS CAT.
Stephen: AND HE TWEETED YOU-- HE INSTAGRAMMED YOU.
HIS ACCOUNT-- THIS IS A CHECHEN WARLORD'S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. AND AGAIN, THINK ABOUT THAT SEQUENCE OF WORDS AND HOW NONSENSICAL IT SHOULD BE. AND YEAH, HE'S VERY ANGRY WITH ME.
Stephen: WHY? YOU HELPED HIM FIND HIS CAT!
NO, HE'S STILL NOT FOUND IT.
Stephen: AND HE'S BLAMED YOU?
ALL WE DID WAS, WHAT WE ASKED PEOPLE TO DO WAS, IF THEY SAW ANY CAT ANYWHERE, TO PLEASE TWEET AND INSTAGRAM HIM, SAYING, "IS THIS YOUR CAT?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HE DIDN'T-- HE HAS-- A MUCH WORSE SENSE OF HUMOR.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO GO HERE IN JUST A SECOND BECAUSE, AGAIN, WE'RE UP AGAINST A HARD BREAK BECAUSE WE'RE LIVE. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THIS AMAZING NEWS, IS THAT "GILMORE GIRLS" IS LAUNCHING.
YES.
Stephen: WHICH I'M A HUGE "GILMORE GIRLS" FAN.
WHO ISN'T? WHO ISN'T?
Stephen: THIS WAS IN THE TEASER TRAILER FOR THE NEW "GILMORE GIRLS." JIM? ♪ IF YOU LEAD I WILL FOLLOW ANY, ANYWHERE ♪
DO YOU THINK JOHN OLIVER WOULD FIND ME HOT? ( CHEERS )
YOU WANT ME TO-- ?
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT? DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW?
LORELEI, THE ANSWER IS, YES, I DO FIND YOU HOT. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. I'M A RED-BLOODED MALE WITH AN IN-BUILT HEAT DETECTOR, AND MY HEAT DETECTOR REGISTERS YOU AS EN FUEGO.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHO WOULD SOUND GOOD SAYING THAT? TIM KAINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SOMEONE VERY ANIMATED. HINT, IT WON'T BE ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE ARE RECORDING THIS AT 1:36 IN THE MORNING. FRESH AS A DAISY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, THIS WEEK FOR THE DEMOCRATS WAS ALL ABOUT MAKING HILLARY CLINTON A MORE THREE-DIMENSIONAL FIGURE. AND I THINK WE ACHIEVED IT BY MAKING HER TWO DIMENSIONAL.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME CARTOON HILLARY CLINTON. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, HELLO, HEY! HI UP THERE.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, SECRETARY CARTOON CLINTON. AND, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT TONIGHT.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT AMERICA. YOU KNOW, IT'S THE ONLY PLACE WHERE A SECRETARY OF STATE, SENATOR, AND LIFE-LONG PUBLIC SERVANT CAN BE PUT ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH A SCREAMING CANTALOUPE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH, FAIR ENOUGH.  ( CHEERS ) BUT, MADAM SECRETARY, FIRST, I HAVE TO ASK YOU, HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR HUSBAND DID IN HIS SPEECH TONIGHT?
WONDERFUL. YOU KNOW, HE WAS HEALTHY. HE STOOD THERE. WONDERFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, PRAISE INDEED, YUP. NICELY SAID, BEAUTIFULLY SAID. LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE D.N.C. HACKED EMAILS? HAS IT RUINED THE CONVENTION FOR YOU?
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION, AND IT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY THAT YOU ASKED IT OF ME. IT IS TRUE THAT THIS WEEK DIDN'T START EXACTLY AS WE PLANNED IT, SINCE 1998, BUT I-- ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. BUT I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR US ALL TO COME TOGETHER IN UNITY. OR HARMONY. OR SOLIDARITY. OR WHATEVER SYNONYM RESONATES MORE STRONGLY WITH YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JUST GOING TO DELETE. DELETING. DELETE. DELETE.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOU, MADAM, BUT GIVEN HOW UPSET-- GIVEN HOW UPSET PEOPLE ARE OVER THESE E-MAILS, CAN YOU REALLY EXPECT BERNIE SUPPORTERS TO GET BEHIND YOU?
AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR THAT POWERFUL QUESTION. YOU KNOW, TRULY, ONE OF OUR NATION'S FINEST QUESTIONS. STEPHEN, BERNIE SANDERS IS A GREAT FRIEND AND HAS BEEN FOR DAYS NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HI! HELLO! HEY, OUT THERE! I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR POINTING.
STEPHEN--
Stephen: YES?
BERNIE LIKES TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS, WHICH IS ALSO WHAT I DO-- WHEN I AM ALONE AND NO ONE IS WATCHING. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY!
Stephen: I'M OVER HERE. I'M OVER HERE.
ALL RIGHT, I'M BACK, OOIK BACK.
Stephen: LAST WEEK, LAST WEEK AT THE R.N.C., I MET A FEW REPUBLICANS, AND THEY HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU. WOULD THAT BE OKAY IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW?
A SURPRISE? HOORAY! I LOVE FITTING THOSE INTO MY SCHEDULE!
Stephen: GREAT. ALL RIGHT, THE FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM A REPUBLICAN, A DEBRA IN MICHIGAN.
SECRETARY CLINTON, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE E-MAILS THAT YOU DIDN'T GIVE TO THE F.B.I.?
Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
GREAT QUESTION, DEBRA. AS A FORMER SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE, I AM THE MOST HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSON TO EVER SEEK THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. BUT AS A GRANDMOTHER, SOMETIMES I MAKE A BOO-BOO ON THE COMPUTER. NOW, INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON MY E-MAILS, LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO TO FEMALES. THAT'S A VERY FUNNY JOKE, STEPHEN, BECAUSE THE WORDS SOUND SIMILAR. AND WE SMILE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) EXACTLY. THEY LIKE IT. THANK YOU! THANK YOU, OVER THERE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM ANOTHER REPUBLICAN DELEGATE FROM TINA IN FLORIDA.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO FIX THE ECONOMY?
YES, POWERFUL QUESTION. BEST QUESTION IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY. WORDS, STATED EMPHATICALLY. TILT HEAD 15-- NO, 20 DEGREES. IT MAKES ME THINK OF A TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE SWING STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND I MET A SINGLE MOTHER WHO TOLD ME SHE NEEDED A JOB. I WAS SO MOVED, I HIRED HER TO BE A TALKING POINT IN MY SPEECHES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, STEPHEN, TOGETHER WE DID! HIGH TOUCH OF HANDS, STEPHEN. COME ON. YES! WE ARE SHOWING CAMARADERIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YAY! THANK YOU! HELLO!
Stephen: OKAY, WELL, YOU SEEM REALLY HAPPY AND RELAXED, GIVEN THE ROUGH START TO THE WEEK. HAS YOUR RUNNING MATE TIM KAINE BEEN HELPING EASE THE STRESS?
BRILLIANT QUESTION. I WISH I WAS ALWAYS ASKED THAT QUESTION. SENATOR KAINE AND I HAVE BECOME VERY CLOSE. HERE'S SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM TIM KAINE. ♪ ( "LOW RIDER" ) ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ ALL MY FRIENDS KNOW THE LOW RIDER THE LOW RIDER ♪ THIS IS APPEALING, RIGHT? I MEAN, POPULAR MUSIC IS A SHARED CULTURAL REFERENCE POINT?
Stephen: IT IS. IT IS. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE LEARNED?

Stephen: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT-- WAIT A SECOND. IF I CAUGHT THAT LAST ONE, YOU LEARNED TO SAY "WHERE IS MY HUSBAND, BILL CLINTON?"
YES. I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN THAT IN OVER 14 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, HAVE A GREAT WEEK, MADAM. WEEK.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN, AND THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU!
Stephen: MADAM CARTOON HILLARY CLINTON, EVERYBODY!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ( "LOW RIDER" ) WELCOME BACK. THIS WEEK SAW THE RETURN OF AN OLD FRIEND: LAWYERS.
Stephen: FOLKS, I AM REALLY ENJOYING THESE LIVE CONVENTION SHOWS. YOU LIKING THEM? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE ELECTRIC. AND ONE MOMENT THAT I REALLY ENJOYED LAST WEEK WAS THE RETURN OF "STEPHEN COLBERT," THE HOST OF THE "COLBERT REPORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT. I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT. I'LL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T ENJOY IT SO MUCH? CORPORATE LAWYERS. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT SHOW, CBS's TOP LAWYER WAS CONTACTED BY THE TOP LAWYER FROM ANOTHER COMPANY TO SAY THAT THE CHARACTER "STEPHEN COLBERT" IS THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) WHICH IS SURPRISING BECAUSE I NEVER CONSIDERED THAT GUY MUCH OF AN INTELLECTUAL. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I ANNOUNCE THAT, THANKS TO CORPORATE LAWYERS, THE CHARACTER OF STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST OF THE "COLBERT REPORT," WILL NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN.
Audience: NO! ( BOOING )
Stephen: I KNOW! LOOK, I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. LISTEN, I FEEL THE SAME WAY, BUT WHAT CAN I DO? THE LAWYERS HAVE SPOKEN. I CANNOT REASONABLY ARGUE I OWN MY FACE OR NAME. ( LAUGHTER ) AND AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT GUY ON AGAIN, I CAN'T. SO INSTEAD, JOINING ME NOW, LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM PHILADELPHIA, PLEASE WELCOME, STEPHEN COLBERT'S IDENTICAL TWIN COUSIN, STEPHEN COLBERT. GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME, STEPHEN.
YOU'RE WELCOME, STEPHEN. HELLO, AMERICA. HELLO, COLBERT COUNTRY! STAY STRONG! BE BRAVE!
Stephen: NOW, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE, ARE YOU NOT THE GUY WHO HAD A TELEVISION SHOW FOR A DECADE?
ABSOLUTELY NOT, STEPHEN. THAT'S MY TWIN COUSIN. THIS IS MY FIRST APPEARANCE ON TELEVISION EVER. HOW AM I DOING, AMERICA? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'RE DOING GREAT. NOW, IDENTICAL TWIN COUSIN, HOW DOES THAT WORK?
IT'S SIMPLE, STEPHEN. OUR MOMS WERE IDENTICAL TWINS WHO MARRIED IDENTICAL TWIN HUSBANDS. THEN HAD SEX AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT AND GAVE US THE SAME NAME.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT CHECKS OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT LET'S JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT THAT GUY. HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS LORRAINE.
YES, MY WIFE'S NAME IS LORRENA.
Stephen: HE WENT TO DARTMOUTH.
I APPLIED TO DARTMOUTH.
Stephen: OKAY, SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT GUY.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT GUY. ALSO, I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S GAY. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. I'M JUST SAYING HE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT. WHERE THERE'S SMOKE THERE'S FIRE.
Stephen: OKAY, I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
MOST OF ALL, STEPHEN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY AND JOIN THE "LATE SHOW" TEAM.
Stephen: WAIT A MINUTE. SO YOU WANT TO BE A PERMANENT PART OF THIS SHOW ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN, WHENEVER YOU NEED ME, WILD HORSES, RIDDEN BY CORPORATE LAWYERS, COULD NOT KEEP ME AWAY.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.
YES, I AM.
Stephen: THANK YOU. STEPHEN COLBERT'S TWIN COUSIN. STEPHEN COLBERT, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE A DAMN FINE LOOKING MAN, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: HE'S A GOOD GUY. HE'S A GOOD GUY. I LIKE HIM. I'M HAPPY TO HAVE HIM ON BOARD. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO HAVE THAT OTHER GUY WHO USED TO HAVE THE TV SHOW. I REALLY LIKE SOME OF THE BITS HE USED TO DO. BUT, AGAIN, WHAT CAN I DO IN THE FACE OF CORPORATE LAWYERS? WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WERD. THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS.
THE TWO WEEKS OF POLITICAL CONVENTIONS ARE DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND WE NOW KNOW ONE THING FOR CERTAIN. WE KNOW THIS NOVEMBER IT WILL BE HILLARY CLINTON AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE POLLS SHOW THAT MANY OF US HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN THE OUTCOME WE REALLY WANT. SEE, WE WANT NEITHER. BOTH CLINTON AND TRUMP HAVE HISTORICALLY LOW APPROVAL RATINGS. IN FACT, 52% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAY THEY'RE ONLY VOTING FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT HILLARY TO WIN. AND I DON'T BLAME THEM FOR THAT SOFT SUPPORT. DONALD TRUMP IS A HARD MAN TO STAND BEHIND. MEANWHILE, 56% OF HILLARY SUPPORTERS SAY THEY JUST DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP TO WIN. HILLARY'S CRITICS SEE HER AS UNTRUSTWORTHY, SELFISH, AND TOO WILLING TO BEND THE RULES. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP'S CRITICS SAY HE'S PREJUDICED, UNPREPARED, AND HAS THE WRONG TEMPERAMENT FOR A PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYONE'S GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT THESE TWO. BOTH CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY DECADES-OLD BRANDS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE WONDER BREAD, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE PRESIDENT WONDER BREAD. THE SAME GOES FOR THE NEW McDONALD'S ANGRY MEAL. AND, LET'S FACE IT-- LET'S FACE IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOTH CANDIDATES KNOW IT. THAT'S WHY THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MOST NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN IN AMERICAN HISTORY. HILLARY CLINTON WILL SAY THINGS HAT MAKE TRUMP SEEM RACIST, AND  ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP, TRUMP WILL ATTACK HILLARY'S INTEGRITY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS NEGATIVITY COULD LIKELY TURN AWAY VOTERS FROM THE POLLS, BUT THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SINCE MANY AMERICANS-- SINCE MANY AMERICANS CAN'T BRING THEMSELVES TO VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE, THIS YEAR, I SAY, WE SHOULD CHANGE THE SYSTEM. SO ON ELECTION DAY, YOU CAN VOTE AGAINST THE CANDIDATE YOU DON'T WANT. THEN AT THE END OF ELECTION DAY, WE JUST COUNT ALL THE "AGAINST" VOTES, AND THE CANDIDATE WITH THE LOWEST SCORE BECOMES PRESIDENT. IT MAKES VOTING LIKE GOLF. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT, FOR SOME REASON-- BUT, IF-- ON THE OUTSIDE CHANCE THEY DO NOT INSTITUTE MY PLAN, NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CANDIDATES, PLEASE, YOU STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE POLLS ON ELECTION DAY. YES, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE FOR A PERSON YOU DON'T REALLY WANT, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN GETTING THE PERSON YOU REALLY DON'T WANT. AND THAT'S THE WERD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
