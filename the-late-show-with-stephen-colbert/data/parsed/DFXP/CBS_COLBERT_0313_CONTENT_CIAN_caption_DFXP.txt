Stephen: I HOLD IN MY HAND SOMETHING VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT IS A JOKE. ( LAUGHTER ) A JOKE THAT WE HAVE CONFIRMED HAS BEEN MURDER BY DONALD TRUMP. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANY JOKE CONNECTED WITH DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN RELEASED. THIS IS AN OLD JOKE FROM BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT. WE'VE OBTAINED THIS JOKE LEGALLY. THE FIRST AMENDMENT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO TELL THIS JOKE. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS-- THIS PIECE OF PAPER I HOLD IN MY HAND, THE PART FACING ME WITH THE WORDS THAT YOU CAN'T SEE, THIS IS THE DOCUMENT WITH THE JOKE. THE JOKE IN QUESTION, "WHY DID THE CHICKEN--" BUT FIRST A WORD ON CHICKENS. CHICKENS ARE FLIGHTLESS BIRDS DOMESTICATED 3,000 YEARS AGO IN MESOPOTAMIA. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY PRODUCE BOTH MEAT AND EGGS, AS WELL AS COMPANIONSHIP. THEY ARE EATEN BY PEOPLE LIKE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH, RIBOFLAVIN. RAMA-LAMA-DING-DONG. ROBO-RUH-ROE. HE'S A RUSSIAN WITH CONFIRMED TIES TO CHICKENS. MORE ON THAT LATER WHEN I DISCUSS IT WITH THIS CHICKEN EXPERT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BACK TO THE JOKE. "WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?" OKAY, WHAT ARE ROADS? ( LAUGHTER ) WHY DO WE NEED THEM? DO TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR ROADS? THEY DO. WHAT CAN BE A ROAD? IS IT A HIGHWAY, A ROAD, A TRACK, OR FOLLOWED BY A FOOT, CART, TRUCK, BICYCLE, AND, OF COURSE, OTHER. AND WHERE IS THIS ROAD-CROSSING CHICKEN GOING? MAR-A-LAGO? IS IT GOING TO RUSSIA TO BE CHICKEN KIEV? THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I WILL BE ANSWERING. BUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE HEARD THIS JOKE BEFORE. IT OUGHT TO GIVE YOU PAUSE THAT AFTER ALL OF THIS BUILDUP, I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE PUNCH LINE. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, "WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?" ( LAUGHTER ) THE ANSWER RIGHT AFTER THIS BREAK.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JESSICA LANGE. BASSEM YOUSSEF. AND JUDY GOLD. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. WOOO! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, JON. THANKS, EVERYBODY. WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO, MAN. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HUGE NEWS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ALMOST HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR YEARS NOW, PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE HIS TAX RETURNS. THE ONLY THING HE HIDES MORE FIERCELY IS THE TRUE COLOR OF HIS FACE. I'M GOING TO GUESS BEACHED JELLYFISH. WELL, LAST NIGHT AT AROUND 7:30, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OUR FRIEND RACHEL MADDOW UNLEASHED A FORCE 5 TWEET-ICON WITH: "WE'VE GOT TRUMP TAX RETURNS. TONIGHT, 9:00 P.M., MSNBC. SERIOUSLY." SO IMPORTANT FOR NEWS NETWORKS TO ADD "SERIOUSLY" TO ANY ANNOUNCEMENT, SO THE AUDIENCE KNOWS YOU'RE NOT PRANKING THEM, LIKE YOU DO IT'S A LONG TRADITION IN THE NEWS BUSINESS. WE ALL REMEMBER THE HINDENBERG BROADCAST.
OH, THE HUMANITY! THE FLAMES ARE GOING UP. I'M NOT YANKING YOUR CHAIN, FOLKS. FOR REALSIES!"
Stephen: FOR REELZIES. AND WE WERE ALL GRIEWD TO IT. WE ALL WATCHED THE TWITTER FEED. AND WHEN 9:00 CAME, RACHEL TOOK US ON AN EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER BECAUSE, LIKE A ROLLER COASTER, AT THE END WE WERE ALL RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED, AND FEELING A LITTLE QUEASY. FIRST, SHE LET US KNOW JUST HOW MUCH INFORMATION SHE HAD.
THIS DOCUMENT HAS SURFACED. IT HAS BEEN HANDED TO A REPORTER, AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS STORY. THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS STORY.
Stephen: SHE'S GOT NOTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN AFTER 20 MINUTES OF EXPLAINING WHAT TAXES ARE AND WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, MADDOW WAS READY SHOW US THE TAX RETURN.
WE GOT IT TONIGHT, AND I AM BUT IT'S A START, AND OUR LITTLE PIECE OF IT. WE JUST GOT IT. WE'LL GO THROUGH IT NEXT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHAT! A CLIFFHANGER? IS THIS NEWS OR A REALITY SHOW? I DON'T WANT TO WATCH "AMERICA'S GOT 1040s." PROBABLY BE PRETTY GOOD. PROBABLY BE PRETTY GOOD. AFTER THE BREAK, WE PHENYLLY GOT THE LONG-AWAITED REVELATIONS.
WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A COPY OF DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. WE HAVE HIS FEDERAL TAX RETURN FOR ONE YEAR, FOR 2005. HE PAID $38 MILLION-- LOOKS LIKE $38 MILLION IN TAXES. HE TOOK A BIG WRITE-DOWN OF $103 MILLION DOLLARS-- MORE ON THAT LATER. IF YOU ADD UP THE LINES FOR INCOME, HE MADE MORE THAN $150 MILLION IN THAT YEAR.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE, $38 MILLION, OKAY. WHAT IS IT, $10 THREE MILLION WRITE-DOWN. $150 MILLION IN INCOME, THAT ADDS UP TO... ZERO (BLEEP) BEING GIVEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) CHECK MY MATH ON THAT ONE. YEAH. HERE'S THE DEAL-- WE KNOW HE'S RICH ALREADY. ALL RIGHT. BE SURE TO TUNE IN TO RACHEL'S NEXT SPECIAL REPORT, "WOLF! WOLF! AN EXCLUSIVE LOOK AT WHAT THE BOY CRIED." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BEFORE RACHEL EVEN WENT ON THE AIR, HERE'S THE DEAL IT'S WHITE HOUSE STOLE HER THUNDER BY RELEASING ALL THE INFORMATION ON TRUMP'S TAX RETURN. SO, APPARENTLY, I THINK THIS PROVES IF THEY THINK YOU ALREADY HAVE THE INFORMATION, TRUMP'S TEAM IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONFIRM IT. I GUESS NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO TELL THE WHITE HOUSE THAT SOMEONE FEDEXED ME A URINE-SOAKED VIDEOTAPE. YOUR MOVE, GUYS. WHO KNOWS? WHO KNOWS WHAT'S IN THERE? NO IDEA. COULD BE ANYTHING. ( APPLAUSE ) THE WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT ALSO SAID, "BEFORE BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT, MR. TRUMP WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN IN THE WORLD WITH A RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS COMPANY, HIS FAMILY, AND HIS EMPLOYEES TO PAY NO MORE TAX THAN LEGALLY REQUIRED." YES, DONALD TRUMP DOES THE MINIMUM OF EVERYTHING. THAT'S HOW HE BECAME PRESIDENT-- BY GETTING NO MORE VOTES THAN LEGALLY REQUIRED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE GOT IN THERE, ANYWAY.  ( CHEERS ) LEGALLY, LEGALLY HE'S PRESIDENT. NOW, THE SHOW ALSO REVEALED THAT MADDOW GOT TRUMP'S TAXES BECAUSE "COPIES OF THE TAX RETURNS ANONYMOUSLY WERE PUT IN THE MAILBOX OF JOURNALIST DAVID CAY JOHNSTON." BUT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T BUY THAT STORY BECAUSE THIS MORNING, HE TWEETED: "DOES ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVE THAT A REPORTER WHO NOBODY EVER HEARD OF, 'WENT TO HIS MAILBOX' AND FOUND MY TAX RETURNS? @NBCNEWS, FAKE NEWS!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. DOES ANYBODY? REALLY, SERIOUSLY? NOBODY. COME ON.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: NOBODY, NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD OF THIS DAVID CAY JOHNSTON GUY, EXEPS MAYBE WHOEVER ENGRAVED HIS NAME ON TO A PULITZER. SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO PUT OUT THIS STORY OR WHY. BUT JOHNSTON HAS SOME THEORIES.
BY THE WAY, LET ME POINT OUT, IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE DONALD SENT THIS TO ME. DONALD TRUMP HAS OVER THE YEARS LEAKED ALL SORTS OF THINGS. DONALD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF LEAKING MATERIAL ABOUT HIMSELF WHEN HE THINKS IT'S IN HIS INTERESTS.
Stephen: ALTHOUGH, AGAIN, HE'S BETTER KNOWN FOR WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE LEAKING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, SO, SO-- ( LAUGHTER ) SO MAYBE TRUMP IS HIS OWN LEAKER. ( LAUGHTER ) IT SOUNDS CRAZY. I REALIZE THAT SOUNDS CRAZY. BUT IT'S NO CRAZIER THAN KELLYANNE CONWAY SUGGESTING OUR MICROWAVES ARE CAMERAS. "HELLO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ AND WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" MICROWAVE CAM. PRO TIP: ALWAYS REMOVE YOUR TINFOIL HAT BEFORE YOU STICK YOUR HEAD IN HERE OR ELSE IT WILL START TO SPARK. I'LL SET THE MICROWAVE TO TRUTH. ( BEEPING ) ( LAUGHTER ) FOLLOW ME HERE, OKAY. MAYBE TRUMP DID LEAK HIS OWN TAX RETURNS FROM THE YEAR WHEN HE "ACTUALLY" PAID TAXES, TO DISPEL RUMORS THAT HE HASN'T PAID TAXES FOR 20 YEARS. OR MAYBE THIS WHOLE TAX THING IS JUST A DISTRACTION FROM THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA. OR MAYBE THAT IS JUST A DISTRACTION FROM THE FACT THAT TRUMPCARE'S DEAD ON ARRIVAL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT MAKES SENSE. AND IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, IT MAKES EVEN BETTER SENSE! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT WAIT! I WILL TELL YOU, I WILL TELL YOU WHERE HE REALLY TRIPPED UP BECAUSE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- ON HIS TAX RETURN, ON THE LINE THAT ASKS, "IF YOU WANT TO DONATE $3 TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN," HE CHECKED YES. OKAY? AND THEN, A MERE 11 YEARS LATER, HE CONVENIENTLY RUNS FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND IS ABLE TO COLLECT HIS SWEET $3 BACK. FOLLOW THE MONEY! FOLLOW THE MONEY! HOW COULD YOU MISS THAT, RACHEL! HOW COULD YOU MISS THAT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL BE TALKING TO JESSICA LANGE. BUT FIRST, WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST ON DONALD TRUMP'S NIGHT OF RALLIES. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. PLEASE I'M JUST GONNA DO THIS OVER HERE AGAIN, DO IT OVER HERE AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT RIGHT NOW. I JUST FOUND OUT RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW SOMETHING WE DIDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW HOW WE HAD THE LATE-SEASON FORM STELLA? WELL WE MADE A LITTLE FUN OF THE WEATHER CHANNEL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO NAME ANYTHING, BUT THEY DO IT ANYWAY. THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. AND THEY NAMED IS WINTER STORM STAECIALG SO WE MADE FUN OF THEM BY RENAME IT WINTER STORM CRAZY BALLS. AND IT TURNS OUT, JUST HAVING SOME FUN, IT TURNS OUT THEY'VE GOT A SENSE OF HUMOR BECAUSE THEY'VE JUST TOLD US-- AND THIS IS-- I CAN SAY THIS? OKAY. NEXT YEAR, FOR THE 2017/2018 WINTER STORM SEASON, THE THIRD STORM, THE LETTER "C" STORM, WILL BE WINTER STORM COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE IT IS.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT! WOOO!
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS REAL. AND I HAVE-- I HAVE ALWAYS SAID IT IS SO GREAT THAT THE WEATHER CHANNEL DOES THIS. THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEY'RE REALLY SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR CULTURE.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT NEXT YEAR. PLEASE, EVERYONE STAY SAFE DURING WINTER STORM COLBERT. SPEAKING OF NATURAL DISASTERS, DONALD TRUMP. TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO A RALLY IN YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN. AND HE TALKED ABOUT HIS CLOSE TIES WITH THE AUTO INDUSTRY.
DURING MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE, I BROUGHT AMERICAN AUTO COMPANIES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. NONE OF THEM EVER GOT TO SEE THE OVAL OFFICE BEFORE, BECAUSE NOBODY TOOK THEM INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, OUR PRESIDENTS. THEY EMPLOY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, BUT I BROUGHT THEM INTO THE OVAL OFFICE.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. TRUMP WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO BRING AUTO EXECUTIVES INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. HE'S ALSO THE FIRST TO BRING IN STEVE BANNON, KFC LUNCH BUCKETS, AND THAT BEEPING HOUSEPLANT HE GOT FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. BEAUTIFUL, NEVER SEEMS TO BE WATERED. AND TRUMP ALSO TALKED ABOUT OTHER BIG CHANGES HE PLANS NOW THAT HE'S IN OFFICE.
OUR TRADE DEFICIT LAST YEAR REACHED NEARLY $800 BILLION. NOTHING HAPPENED. BUT SOMETHING DID HAPPEN, HAPPENED ON NOVEMBER 8. BELIEVE ME, IT HAPPENED.
Stephen: ALWAYS SO INSPIRATIONAL WHEN FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE ELECTION, THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS, "BELIEVE ME, THIS HAPPENED." IT REMINDS ME OF M.L.K.'S "THIS IS NOT A DREAM" SPEECH. WAKE UP. I THINK THAT'S HOW IT GOES.
Jon: I DON'T REMEMBER IT LIKE THAT.
Stephen: AND TONIGHT-- THAT WAS TODAY, TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT IS IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, HOLDING A HUGE RALLY IN HOPES OF WINNING LAST YEAR'S POPULAR VOTE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT MEANWHILE, THE OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT, THE TRUMPCARE, IS IN HUGE TROUBLE. IT'S TOO CONSERVATIVE FOR MODERATES AND TOO MODERATE FOR CONSERVATIVES. IT'S LIKE A FORMULA 1 RACE CAR MADE BY VOLVO THAT RUNS ON THE TEARS OF OLD PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) DOCTORS HATE IT, RETIREES HATE IT, HUMANS HATE IT, BREITBART HATES IT-- THIS BILL IS SO UNPOPULAR AND OFFENSIVE, TRUMP MIGHT APPOINT IT TO HIS CABINET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Jon: THERE MIGHT BE A POSITION FOR IT.
Stephen: BIG FANS OF TRUMP'S CABINET HERE TONIGHT. SO WITH OPPOSITION ON ALL SIDES, SOME ARE WARNING THE PRESIDENT WHAT PASSING THIS BILL COULD DO TO HIS RE-ELECTION HOPES.
I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GET CAUGHT ON THIS IN 2020. I THINK THIS IS A TRAP SET FOR TRUMP.
Stephen: OH, IT'S A CLASSIC TRUMP TRAP. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW HOW TO SET A TRUMP TRAP-- YOU JUST PROP A BOX UP WITH A STIRK PUT A TACO BALL UNDER IT AND DO THE TRUMP CALL: "CLASSY BOOBS! CLASSY BOOBS!" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JESSICA LANGE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I WAS JUST TALKING TO-- PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER. THANKS. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY ACTRESS WHO IS CURRENTLY PORTRAYING THE LEGENDARY ACTRESS JOAN CRAWFORD IN FX'S "FEUD".
BETTE, IT'S TODAY'S WORK, IT'S A GOOD SCENE AND JOAN LIKES IT.
I NEVER SAID THAT. I AGREE WITH BETTE, THE WRITING DOESN'T BEGIN TO CAPTURE HOW WOMEN GET UNDER EACH OTHER'S SKIN. THE INTENT IS THERE. BUT THE EXECUTION IS LACK LUSTRE.
YOU WORK ON THAT. SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.
WE'LL ANXIOUSLY BE AWAITING A REWRITE.
I LIKE THAT, "ANXIOUSLY AWAITING." ( LAUGHS ).
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JESSICA LANGE. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
YES. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME.
Stephen: NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HERE, LIKE THE PRODUCER WHO TALKED TO YOU BEFORE YOU CAME OUT HERE, TOLD YOU THAT YOU'RE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ME BEING IN SHOW BUSINESS.
NO!
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
WHY?
Stephen: WHY? WELL, I WAS A YOUNG MAN IN COLLEGE STUDYING PHILOSOPHY, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. I WASN'T GOG OPEN A PHILOSOPHY SHOP. AND I CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE, AND MY MOM, WHILE I WAS AWAY FRESHMAN YEAR, HAD GOTTEN CABLE, NOW THAT I WASN'T THERE ANYWHERE G.M. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I CAME HOME ONE NIGHT AFTER BEING OUT WITH FRIENDS AND THERE WAS THIS MOVIE ON THAT I HAD HEARD OF BUT NEVER SEEN CALLED "ALL THAT JAZZ." IN "ALL THAT JAZZ--" IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, IT'S A TREMENDOUS MOVIEUE PLAY THE INSPIRATION TO JOEL GIDDIAN YON. YOU'RE DEATH.
ANGEL OF DEATH.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE ANGEL OF DEATH.
, OF COURSE, RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I WATCHED AND I WENT, "DEATH DOESN'T LOOK THAT BAD. IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD." IT'S NOT A FLATTERING PORTRAYAL OF SHOW BUSINESS.
NO.
Stephen: AND I JUST THOUGHT I HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT. SO THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR HELPING SUCK ME IN TO THIS CIRCUS WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW.
THAT WAS FOSSE. HE WAS REALLY SOMETHING, WASN'T HE IN.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW HIM BUT, YEAH, WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: THE UGLY LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND THE UGLY IS BEAUTIFUL IN THAT WORLD.
NO, I MEAN, AND HE REALLY-- YOU KNOW, WITH THAT FILM, I MEAN, HE-- HE REALLY FELT STRONGLY ABOUT, LIKE, THIS IMAGINARY CHARACTER, YOU KNOW. AND WE WERE WAY OVER BUDGET, WAY OVER SCHEDULE, AND THE STUDIO DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT IT, AND HE REALLY INSISTED, LIKE, TAKING THAT LAST WEEK AND SHOOTING ALL THOSE SCENES WITH THE ANGEL OF DEATH.
Stephen: THAT WAS SHOTAR EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DONE?
YES, IT WAS HIS FANTASY OF HOW HE WANTED TO DIE. WHICH WAS GREAT, I THINK.
Stephen: YEAH. WELL IN TUPLAY AN ABSOLUTE-- YOU PLAY A-- A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY. HE SEES DEATH AS A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY, AS BEAUTIFUL AS A ROSE, HE SAYS.
YES.
Stephen: YOU AND THE ROSE ARE THE SAME. THAT'S QUITE A COMPLIMENT.
THAT WAS. YEAH. WELL, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. I MEAN, EVERYBODIY KNOWS YOU AS AN ACTRESS, BUT YOU'RE ALSO A PHOTOGRAPHER.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU'VE DONE THAT FOR A LOT OF YOUR LIFE, RIGHT? YOU LOVE PHOTOGRAPHY.
I DO LOVE PHOTOGRAPHY. I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING IT THAT LONG. I WAS INTERESTED IN IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME PBUT I'VE ONLY BEEN SHOOTING MYSELF-- NOT SHOOTING MYSELF. YOU UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THE NOMENCLATURE.
I HAVE ONLY BEEN SHOOTING ABOUT 15 YEARS OR SO.
Stephen: YOU ALSO MADE A CHILDREN'S BOONG OF BOTH PHOTOGRAPHY AND YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS CHILDREN'S BOOK.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BIRD.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY. WHAT IS THE TRUE STORY?
WELL I WAS SHOOTING THIS FILM CALLED "TITUS" IN ROME, AND I WAS THERE BY MYSELF. AND I ONE DAY WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET, AND THERE WAS, LIKE, A BIRD MARKET, AND I BOUGHT THIS LITTLE CANARY AND TOOK IT HOME. AND IT LIVED WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME THAT I WAS WORKING IN ROME. AND THEN THE FILM WAS OVER, AND IT WAS TIME TO COME BACK TO THE STATES. AND I THOUGHT, WELL, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THIS BIRD? I CAN'T JUST GIVE IT AWAY OR LEAVE IT. SO I CALLED SOME OF THESE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT I ASSUMED WOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF AND ASKED, "HOW DO I GET A BIRD BACK TO THE STATES?" AND THEY WOULD, LIKE-- THEY HAD NO IDEA. YOU KNOW, IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE, "OH, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT HIM IN QUARANTINE FOR A YEAR OR SO." BIRDS DON'T LIVE THAT LONG TO BEGIN WITH. SO IT WAS-- AND THIS WAS PRE-9/11. I ALWAYS HAVE TO PREFACE IT BY THAT. I PUT THE BIRD IN MY POCKET, AND WE WENT THROUGH CUSTOMS, AND PASSPORT CONTROL. AND THIS LITTLE, BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CANARY IN MY POCKET, AND WE GOT ON THE AIRPLANE, AND I TOOK HIM OUT OF MY POCKET, AND PUT HIM IN MY HANDBAG, AND HE HAD WATER AND FOOD. WE MADE THE FLIGHT. I TOOK HIM BACK EYE WENT TO THE BATHROOM WITH MY HANDBAG, AND I TOOK HIM BACK OUT OF THERE, PUT HIM BACK IN MY POCKET, AND WE WENT THROUGH CUSTOMS, AND --
Stephen: SO YOUR BAG WENT THROUGH THE X-RAY THING WAY BIRD INSIDE? AND NO ONE NOTICED?
NO, NO, NO, NO X-RAY. PRE-9/11. YOU WOULD JUST GO THROUGH-- YEAH. SO, NO. THE BIRD WAS IN MY POCKET. I MEAN, I JUST WALKED RIGHT THROUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THE BIRD WASN'T IN THE-- WHEN IT WENT THROUGH, LIKE, THE BAG.
Stephen: IT WASN'T IN THERE.
IT WASN'T IN THERE. THEN HE WAS IN MY POCKET. BUT HE WAS GREAT BECAUSE --
Stephen: YOU ARE-- ARE YOU-- YOU ARE TECHNICALLY--
I'M A BIRD SMUGGLER.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL.
I AM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I PROBABLY AM.  ( CHEERS ) RIGHT IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN WORRYING SOME PEOPLE LATELY BY TALKING ABOUT RETIREMENT.
AH.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE NOT DOING THIS? PLEASE DON'T, BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
WELL, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO FALCONRY.
Stephen: ANOTHER BIRD?
ANOTHER BIRD. A BIGGER BIRD.
Stephen: KEEP THIS ONE AWAY FROM YOUR CANARY. HAVE YOU FALCONNED?
NO, I NEVER HAVE, BUT I HAVE BEEN FASCINATED BY IT. I DO LOVE BIRDS, AND, LIKE, A BIG-- I JUST KEPT THINKING LIKE A BIG FALCON OR LIKE-- TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT ANIMAL, TO THAT BIRD, AND, LIKE, ACTUALLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. BUT THEN-- AND I LOOKED INTO IT. I MEAN TO GET A FALCONRY LICENSE IN NEW YORK IS CRAZY, WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH.
Stephen: YEAH.
IN CASE ANYBODY WANTS TO KNOW. IT'S LIKE-- THERE'S A LOT TO IT.
Stephen: THEY DISCOURAGE THE FALCONRY DOWN IN THE SUBWAYS. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO, SO-- AND THEN I STARTED THINKING IN PRACTICAL TERMS, WELL, WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH A FALCON IS YOU'RE SENDING HIM OUT TO KILL. YOU'RE SENDING HIM OUT TO HUNT.
Stephen: KILL MICE AND RABBITS.
RABBITS AND THINGS. AND I THOUGHT AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP WAY FALCON OR A HAWK, I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD REALLY WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN KILLING.
Stephen: OH. ARE YOU A VEGETARIAN?
YES.
Stephen: YOU ARE?
YEAH.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S VERY SWEET. THAT'S VERY NICE.
I JUSTUE KNOW, THE IDEA OF A FALCON RUNNING DOWN A RABBIT WAS LIKE --
Stephen: HE'S GOING TO KILL THE RABBIT ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ASK HIM TO.
WHETHER OR NOT I'M THERE.
Stephen: NOW, THE-- THE SERIES ON FX, IT'S A SHORT SERIES, CALLED "FEUD." IT'S ABOUT JOAN CRAWFORD AND BETTE DAVIS, WHEN THEY WERE MAKING "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?," RIGHT?
WELL, IT'S AROUND THAT AREA EYE MEAN THAT TIME. BUT IT-- IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE IT COVERS A LOT OF THEIR EARLIER LIFE. IT COVERS THEIR LATER LIFE. SO IT'S NOT JUST CONCENTRATED ON THAT TIME.
Stephen: DID THEY HAVE A LONG-TERM FEUD?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF COMPETITION. I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF-- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NOT-- THEY DID NOT ENJOY EACH OTHER WHEN THEY WORKED TOGETHER. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH.
Stephen: YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT UNDER OATH. IT WILL BE FINE. YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS RIGHT NOW.
I DO. I'M TRYING --
Stephen: I'D QT I'D LIKE A LAWYER PRESENT BEFORE I ANSWER THAT QUESTION."
ALL THAT DOUBLE SPEAK THAT YOU HEAR. I'M PRACTICING.
Stephen:  YOU'RE A FAMOUS ACTRESS. DO YOU HAVE ANY FUSED OUT THERE?
NO. I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE --
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE ONE? ( LAUGHTER ).
I FEUD IN MY HEAD WITH PEOPLE. BUT I DON'T HAVE-- LIKE, NOW I'M CARRYING ON A FEUD WITH KELLYANNE CONWAY, JUST IN MY HEAD.
Stephen: IN YOUR HEAD, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, YOU CAN OPEN YOUR MICROWAVE AND YELL RIGHT AT HER, RIGHT INTO THE MICROWAVE.
THE THING, IS REALLY, IF YOU GOT A SCRIPTANS ACTOR, AND THAT SCRIPT CAME, YOU KNOW, TO YOU AND, YOU KNOW, THEY PREFACE IT BY SAYING, YOU'VE BEEN OFFERED THIS PART." YOUR AGENT CALLS YOU, "YOU'VE BEEN OFFERED THIS PART." ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WOMEN IN THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW. SHE'S A COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT. SHE'S A SPOKESPERSON. AND THEN YOU PICK UP THE-- YOU READ IT, AND YOU THINK THEY'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. THIS IS, LIKE, ARE THEY-- YOU KNOW, HERE-- YOU'VE GOT A SCENE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT ALTERNATIVE FACTS? YOU'VE GOT A SCENE WHERE YOU, LIKE, YOU KNOW, IMAGINE THAT, LIKE, THE MICROWAVE IS TURNING INTO A CAMERA. I MEAN, YOU GO TO THE INAUGURATION DRESSEDAISE NUTCRACKER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: JUST THE LADY TO PLAY. YOU COULD DO SUCH A GOOD JOB. CAST THIS WOMAN.
WOULD YOU-- YOU CAN JUST HEAR THAT CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE ACTOR, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME? NOBODY'S GOING TO TAKE THIS CHARACTER SERIOUSLY. SHE'S A JOKE."
Stephen: JESSICA, NOBODY DOES. ( LAUGHTER ) JESSICA LANGE, EVERYBODY. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST HOSTED EGYPT'S FIRST POLITICAL SATIRE SHOW UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED IT WOULD BE EGYPT'S LAST POLITICAL SATIRE SHOW. PLEASE WELCOME BASSEM YOUSSEF! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
OH, MY GOD. I'M SO HAPPY.
Stephen: YOU ARE?
YEAH, I'M NOT DEPORTED YET. IT'S AMAZING.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, DOCTOR, YOU SAID AMERICA-- THIS WAS IN JULY-- YOU SAID, "AMERICA HAD THE HEALTHY BODY OF DEMOCRACY WITH A LARGE ORANGE MOLE ON ITS ASS." ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU ARE A FORMER DOCTOR. WHAT IS YOUR PROGNOSIS NOW?
HERE'S MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION, STEPHEN. AND BELIEVE ME, PEOPLE SHOULD STOP TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE MOLE. BECAUSE NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THE MOLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT COULD BE A BENIGN MOLE, A MALIGNANT MOLE, A RUSSIAN MOLE. IT COULD BE ANY KIND OF MOLE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON JUST GETTING RID OF THE MOLE. AND BECAUSE NOBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT-- YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF PROJECTS OUT. ONE IS YOU'VE GOT A BOOK CALLED "REVOLUTION FOR DUMMIES."
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, THIS BOOK IS OUT NEXT WEEK?
YES.
Stephen: NEXT TUESDAY? OKAY. YOU SAY "YOU CAN USE TRUMP AS A WAY TO EXPLAIN DICTATORS TO US."
YEAH.
Stephen: WHERE DOES TRUMP FALL ON THE DICTATOR SCALE BECAUSE HE'S NOT A DICTATOR. WHAT ARE THINGS ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR THAT SEEM RESONANT TO YOU.
FIRST OF ALL, IF HE WOULD RUN IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A LIBERAL HIPPIE TREE HUGGER. HE WOULD BE GRABBING BUSH EVERY DAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU MEAN TREE, A SMALL TREE.
LIKE SMALL TREINGS.
Stephen: SMALL TREE, EXACTLY.
AND I THINK THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN OFFER TO TRUMP TO LEARN. I THINK HE'S LEARNING FAST. HE JUST --
Stephen: MIDDLE EASTERN DICTATORS COULD OFFER A LOT TO TRUMP TO LEARN HOW TO DICTATE.
TO TUNE-- LIKE FINE TUNE HIS TYRANNY. AND THE BOOK IT'S THING IS ABOUT THE BOOK, IT KIND OF, LIKE, YOU CAN USE IT FOR PEOPLE AS A WARNING OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN FYOU BRAINWASH THE MASSES. FOR TRUMP IT COULD BE A GUIDE. SO YOU NEED TO BUY IT BEFORE HIM. AND "SOLUTIONS FOR DUMMIES" WHICH TRUMP WOULD DEFINITELY BUY.
Stephen: I HAVE JUST LEARNED THE EGYPTIAN PROSECUTOR HAS ORDERED THE RELEASE OF HOSNI MUBARAK. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN JAIL?
HE WAS NEVER IN JAIL. HE WAS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM FOR FOUR YIERS. WHICH ALSO PROVES THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE BEST PLACE FOR DICTATOR TO RETIRE. YOU CAN KILL, YOU CAN TORTURE, YOU CAN BE CORRUPT, YOU CAN OPPRESS PEOPLE, AND STILL YOU'RE GOING TO BE OFF THE HOOK. WHICH IS WHY WE SHOULD INVITE TRUMP TO GO THERE.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY WOULD APPRECIATE HIM IN WAYS THAT WE DON'T?
AND YOU WOULD APPRECIATE THAT HE'S GONE. SO IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE HIM.
Stephen: NOW, WE HAVE THIS SEGMENT WE DO ON THE SHOW HERE. IT'S CALLED "BIG FURRY HAT."
YEAH.
Stephen: AND WHERE I GO UP THERE AND I MAKE DECLARATIONS TO THE PEOPLE. YOU NOTICED THAT-- WAS IT MUBARAK OR MORSI.
MORSI.
Stephen: MORSI WORE A BIG HAT.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU MOCKED HIM--
2013.
Stephen: ON YOUR SHOW BY WEARING A BIG, STUPID HAT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HOW DID THAT TURN OUT FOR YOU?
OH, I-- I WAS-- THERE WAS A WARRANT FOR MY ARREST. I WENT THERE --
Stephen: AFTER THIS.
YEAH, YEAH. I WAS-- I WAS INTERROGATED FOR SIX HOURS. IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE THE GUY WHO WAS INTERROGATING ME AND THE LAWYERS IN THE ROOM WERE LAUGHING AT THE JOKES, BECAUSE HE WAS INTERROGATING ME ABOUT THINGS I SAID IN THE SHOW. AND WHAT WAS FUNNY IS THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE-- OF THE INTERROGATION, HE SAID, "WE HAVE SOME CDs FOR YOU, YOUR EPISODE, SO WE CAN REVIEW IT." AND THEY TRIED FOR 15 MINUTES TO PLAY IT ON THIS OUTDATED WINDOWS 95 COMPUTER. AND I TRIED TO HELP THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE IT WAS TAKING TOO LONG.
Stephen: RIGHT.
SO I WAS ACTUALLY HELPING THEM TO PLAY THE EVIDENCE AGAINST ME, WHICH IS CRAZY. BUT THAT IS, LIKE, THAT'S LIKE ONLY ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME. I WAS ACCUSED OF INSULTING THE PRESIDENT, INSULTING ISLAM, SPREADING FALSE RUMORS. LATER UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME I WAS INSULTED OF-- ACCUSED OF INSULTING THE ARMY, BEING A SECRET OPERATIVE. BUT THE CRAZIEST ACCUSATION I EVER HAD WAS THEY ACCUSED ME OF BEING RECRUITED BY THE C.I.A. THROUGH JON STEWART.
Stephen: THEY SAID THAT JON STEWART--
WAS A RECRUIT GR WHO RECRUITED YOU TO WORK FOR THE C.I.A.
TO BRING DOWN THE COUNTRY THROUGH SATIRE.
Stephen: AND YOU AND I BOTH KNOW-- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
OF COURSE.
Stephen: BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN I'M PROBABLY AN AGENT, TOO, BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN JON LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND THE IDEA THAT JON IS RECRUITING US IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
DO YOU THINK HE'S ACTUALLY IN AN "ANIMAL FARM?" ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LOVE. MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT YOU BEING ARRESTED-- IF YOU'LL PARDON ME HAVING A FAVORITE THING.
PLEASE GR I'.
Stephen: I'M A HEWN FAN OF YOU BEING ARRESTED. WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED YOU TURNED YOURSELF IN, AND A CROWD OF PEOPLE WENT WITH YOU AND THIS IS, AGAIN, AFTER YOU WORE THIS HAT, MOCKING THE PRESIDENT. YOU WERE ARRESTED AND YOU SHOWED UP... ( LAUGHTER ) WEARING THE HAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S THE REAL DEAL.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S A COMEDIAN.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU, STEPHEN, BECAUSE I AM THE THIRD MIDDLE EASTERN IN ONLY TWO WEEKS TO BE HOSTED ON THIS SHOW. AND I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU, ARE YOU TURNING US IN? ( LAUGHTER ) IS THERE SOME SECRET LOBOTOMY OPERATIONS HAPPENING INSIDE? IS IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN VERSION OF "GET OUT?" ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NO, AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT RECRUITING YOU FOR THE C.I.A.
DEFINITELY! DEFINITELY!
Stephen: BASSEM, LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HIS BOOK, "REVOLUTION FOR DUMMIES," AND HIS DOCUMENTARY, "TICKLING GIANTS," ARE OUT TUESDAY. BASSEM YOUSSEF, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JUDY GOLD. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS AN EMMY-WINNING COMEDIAN AND PODCASTER. PLEASE WELCOME JUDY GOLD. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME!  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
OH, MY GOD! DO YOU KNOW HOW EXCITED I AM! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I WATCH THE SHOW CONSTANTLY-- WELL, ONCE A NIGHT. AND I LOVED-- OH, YOU'RE SO TALENTED!
Stephen: I HAVE SUCH STRONG AFFECTION FOR YOU RIGHT NOW, TOO, FOR SOME REASON.
REALLY, REALLY.
Stephen: I ACTUALLY SAW YOU IN A WONDERFUL PRODUCTION OF "TAMING OF THE SHREW" IN THE SUMMER, SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK.
SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK. IT WAS AN ALL-FEMALE "TAMING OF THE SHREW." I PLAYED A GUY, THANK YOU.
Stephen: HAD YOU DONE SHAKESPEARE BEFORE THAT?
I HAD NEVER DONE SHAKESPEARE, AND THEY ASKED ME TO AUDITION FOR IT, AND I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT..." AND I GAVE UP A LOT OF MONEY TOURING. BUT IT WAS LIKE GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. I CAN'T TELL YOU. IT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. WE'RE IN CENTRAL PARK. THE RACCOONS WERE ON STAGE WITH US.
Stephen: OH, NO, THERE WERE LOTS OF ANIMALS.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS LIKE YOU WERE AT THE ZOO.
Stephen: YOU ARE IN A SCENE AND YOU COULD BE UPSTAGED BY A HERON FLYING BY YOU.
YOU'RE AT THE MOST SERIOUS PART, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE AUDIENCE IS CRACK UP. AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT'S GOING ON?" AND THERE IS A RACCOON RUNNING ACROSS THE STAGE. IT WAS REALLY FUN.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PODCAST WHICH IS CALLED "KILL ME NOW." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A MESSAGE OF HOME. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT IS PISSING YOU OFF NOW? WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KILL YOU NOW ABOUT?
WELL, THERE'S ONE THING THAT PISSES ME OFF CONSTANTLY, AND HIS NAME IS TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT-- I FIND REALLY ANNOYING ABOUT HIM? HE IS THE ONLY NATIVE NEW YORKER WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TO THERAPY. AND HE NEEDS THERAPY MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVER! SO HE REALLY-- I'M IN A CONSTANT STATE OF BEING PISSED OFF BECAUSE OF HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY HAS REALLY GOTTEN TO ME LATELY? THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS A FOOD ISSUE NOW. LIKE, I LOVE TO EAT. AND YOU CAN'T JUST MEET SOMEONE AND GO, "HEY LET'S MEET HERE AND WE'LL GO EAT." "OH, I DON'T EAT THAT. I DON'T EAT THAT." IT IS SO ANNOYING. IT STARTED-- THIS IS MY THEORY-- IT STARTEDLY IN THE 80s. REMEMBER WHEN EVERYONE WAS LACTOSE INTOLERANT. "I CAN'T EAT DAIRY. I CAN'T DRINK MILK. EVERYONE HAS EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA EVERY NOW AND THEN. YOU DON'T GIVE UP AN ENTIRE FOOD GROUP. NOW EVERYONE IS GLUTEN-- I CAN'T WITH THE GLUTEN FREE. I'M SORRY. I CANNOT. WE HAVE BEEN EATING WHEAT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEAR. IT'S IN THE BIBLE, MANNA, BREAD, BREAD, MANNA! AND NOW IT'S LIKE-- DID YOU EVER NOTICE, LIKE, EVERY TIME-- I'M NOT KIDDING. I HAVE A LOT OF GLUTEN-FREE FRIENDS AND THEY'RE ANNOYING AND OVERWEIGHT --
Stephen: YOU HAD GLUTEN-FREE FRIENDS.
I HAD GLUTEN --
Stephen: TILL JUST NOW.
TOUCHE. EVERY TIME I SEE A GLUTEN-FREE FRIEND THEY'RE ALWAYS EAT SOMETHING SORT OF CAKE OR BROWNIE. AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WAIT, I THOUGHT I WAS GLUTEN FREE." "OH, IT'S A GLIEWTSEN-FREE BROWNIE, JUDY. IT TASTES EXACTLY LIKE A BROWNIE." "WHAT'S IN IT?" "THERE'S NO EGGS, THERE'S NO DAIRY, THERE'S NO FLOUR. THERE'S NO CHOCOLATE. TRY IT, JUDY, IT TASTES EXACTLY-- IT TASTES LIKE A PIECE OF CARDBOARD WITH BLACK SHARPIE ON IT. THAT'S WHAT IT TASTES LIKE.
Stephen: BUT GLUTEN FREE.
BUT IT IS GLUTEN FREE, AND I'M NOT HAVING GLUTEN, GLUTEN, GLUTEN.
Stephen: ALSO, YOU'RE IN AN UPCOMING SERIES ON SHOWTIME CALLED "I'M DYING UP HERE." "KILL ME NOW," AND "I'M DYING UP HERE."
I SEE A THEME!
Stephen:  THIS IS A SERIES ABOUT STANDUP IN THE 1970s.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU PLAY A STANDUP IN THE 1970s.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHEN IS THIS? I I REMEMBER STANDUP IN THE 70s, BECAUSE THERE WAS A SHIFT. WHEN STEVE MARTIN CAME ALONG TCHANGED. SUDDENLY HE WAS SO HUGE, IT CHANGED WHAT YOU CAN DO ON STAGE. WHEN DOES THIS TAKE PLACE?
IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME. AND IT'S REALLY THE START OF-- REMEMBER, THE BOOM WAS REALLY IN THE 80s, YOU KNOW. AND WE WEE GOT SO MUCH STAGE TIME BECAUSE EVERY PLACE HAD A COMEDY CLUB, YOU KNOW. AND THIS TAKES PLACE AROUND THAT TIME. I ACTUALLY-- I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE SHOCK-- I PLAY AN OLDER COMEDIAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) WHO --
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, "COMEDY IS AN OLD MAN'S GAME."
THAT'S RIGHT. AND I'M AN OLD MAN.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DUMBEST NAME OF A COMEDY CLUB YOU PLAYED? I'LL TELL YOU MY DUMPEST. MY DUMPEST WAS IN BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA. IT WAS CALLED "THE GRIN ROOM." IT WAS THE DUMBEST PLACE.
THE GRIN ROOM?
Stephen: THE GRIN ROOM.
I MEAN-- OH, GOD BOMPT HAS TO BE "HA-HA'S." I'M NOT KIDDING, "HA-HA'S COMEDY CLUB." THAT'S LIKE NAMING A COMEDY CLUB L.O.L.s.
Stephen: OR RESTAURANT YUM-YUM. JUDY IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: HER PODCAST IS "KILL ME NOW." JUDY GOLD, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HEY! THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW."
