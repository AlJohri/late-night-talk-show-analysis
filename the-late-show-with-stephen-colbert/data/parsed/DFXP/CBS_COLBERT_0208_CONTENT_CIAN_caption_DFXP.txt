THERE'S NO NEED TO BE AFRAID. JUST STAY FOCUSED. IN HERE. ( DING ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER )

IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES. JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT. MILLIE BOBBY BROWN. AND MUSICAL GUEST THE HEAD AND THE HEART. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU!  ( CHEERS ) HEY, EVERYBODY! WHAT'S UP, MAN?
Stephen:
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANKS, EVERYBODY. I LIKE YOUR LITTLE DANCE. HEY, WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. WOW! IT HAS BEEN A ROUGH WEEK FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SHE HAS BEEN DROPPING IN THE POLLS, AND OVER THE WEEKEND, EVEN HER IMMUNE SYSTEM TURNED AGAINST HER. NO SURPRISE-- ALL THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) I'LL HAVE TO-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: HEY! WHOA!
Stephen: PROBABLY, PROBABLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES. THAT DESERVES IT. I'LL HAVE MORE ABOUT HILLARY'S HEALTH OVER THERE. BUT MOST DAMAGING OF ALL MAY HAVE BEEN A REMARK SHE MADE AT A FUNDRAISER ON FRIDAY WHEN DESCRIBING TRUMP'S VOTERS.
TO JUST BE GROSSLY GENERALISTIC, YOU COULD PUT HALF OF TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS INTO WHAT I CALL THE "BASKET OF DEPLORABLES." ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SORRY-- ( APPLAUSE ) THE "BASKET OF DEPLORABLES?" WOW. HILLARY SHOULD PUT HER INSULTS IN "THE HAMPER OF AWKWARDNESS." ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT IS-- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THAT PHRASE BEFORE?
Jon: I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.
Stephen: WHAT IS RAY BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, OKAY? IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WORST-SELLING ITEM AT EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS. OR MAYBE YOUR COUSIN'S SUBURBAN PUNK BAND. OR EVEN BETTER, MAYBE THE KOREAN TRANSLATIONS OF THE "MINION" MOVIE. I'D GO SEE THAT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN MOVIE "BASKET OF DEPLORABLES." I MIGHT TAKE FOUR FRIENDS AND GO AS THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES FOR HALLOWEEN.
Jon: OH, THAT'S A GOOD THING.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S CALLED AN INSIDE JOKE. THANKFULLY, SECRETARY CLINTON EXPLAINED JUST WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
THE BASKET OF DEPLORABLES. THE RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC, XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC-- YOU NAME IT.
Stephen: SECRETARY CLINTON, I KNOW YOU'RE THE CANDIDATE, BUT HERE'S A TIP. IF YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT, DON'T CALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NAMES. EVEN IF YOU'RE ELECTED NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, A QUARTER OF OUR UNION ARE DOUCHEBAGS. AND I THINK IT'S AN UNFAIR GENERALIZATION. DO TRUMP RALLIES ATTRACT SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY AWFUL, RACIST THINGS? OF COURSE. BUT THAT'S JUST THE GUY ON STAGE. THEERP THEERP YES, YES. WOOO! WOOO! WOO! AWFUL RACIST STATEMENTS! WOO! AND, APPARENTLY, SECRETARY CLINTON AGREES, BECAUSE OVER THE WEEKEND, SHE EMERGED FROM HER COMA LONG ENOUGH TO ISSUE A STATEMENT WALKING BACK HER COMMENT, WALKING BACK THUSLY: "LAST NIGHT, I WAS GROSSLY GENERALISTIC. I REGRET SAYING 'HALF'. THAT WAS WRONG."
Stephen: REALLY, YOU REGRET SAYING "HALF," BUT YOU'RE STILL COOL WITH "BASKET OF DEPLORABLES." WHAT IS IT WITH OLDER WOMEN AND THEIR LOVE OF BASKETS? THERE'S A BASKET FOR THE TV REMOTE, THERE'S ONE FOR THE MAIL, AND THE TOILET PAPER GETS A BASKET AND A LITTLE WOOL HAT. BIG FAN OF THE WOOL HAT ON THE TOILET PAPER OVER THERE. GOTTA KEEP IT WARM. AND, OF COURSE, AFTER ALL THIS, DONALD TRUMP JUMPED ALL OVER IT.
NEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO VICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN VOTER. SHE CALLED THEM RACIST, SEXIST, XENOPHOBIC, ISLAMAPHOBIC.
Stephen: YEAH, WHAT'S SHE GOING TO CALL THEM NEXT, MURDERERS AND RAPISTS? ( LAUGHTER ) OH, I'M SORRY, THOSE ARE TAKEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: IT HAPPENED.
Stephen: IT HAPPENED.
Jon: IT HAPPENED.
Stephen: IT HAPPENED. SAY HELLO TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON, YOU SPEND MUCH TIME IN CHICAGO?
Jon: YEAH, I'VE BEEN TO CHICAGO TO PLAY A FEW TIMES, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: YEAH, I WAS THERE THIS WEEKEND. FANTASTIC TOWN.
Jon: YES, INDEED.
Stephen: I LIVED THERE 11 YEARS.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I JUST LOVE IT THERE. I WAS THERE WITH MY SON. WE WENT TO A COUPLE OF RESTAURANT. CHICAGO'S MOTTO SHOULD BE, "MORE MEAT THAN YOU WANTED." IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT THE PITA? YOU TRY THAT?
Stephen: OH, FANTASTIC. MY 14-YEAR-OLD SAID, "I'VE HAD ENOUGH, THANKS." BECAUSE THE DEEP DISH PIZZA--
Jon: ENOUGH PIZZA.
Stephen: THE DEEP DISH PIZZAS ARE NOT REALLY PIZZAS. THEY'RE REALLY JUST A BABY POOL FILLED WITH CHEESE AND SAUCE.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AMAZING, AMAZING.
Stephen: AS I SAID OVER THERE WHEN I WAS NEAR TORE JON, THE BIG POLITICAL STORY THIS WEEK CONTINUES TO BE THE QUESTIONS SURROUNDING HILLARY CLINTON'S PNEUMONIA. OR AS SOME ARE CALLING IT LUNG-GHAZI. NOT MANY, NOT MANY PEOPLE. SO FAR, JUST ME. BUT SOME. HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR: ON SUNDAY, SECRETARY CLINTON FAINTED AND STUMBLED AFTER LEAVING A 9/11 MEMORIAL SERVICE. AND DOWN SHE GOES! AND AT FIRST, HER CAMPAIGN SAID SHE WAS OVERHEATED, BUT THEN LATER ADMITTED SHE HAD BEEN SECRETLY DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA TWO DAYS EARLIER. AND MAY I REMIND YOU-- THAT'S PNEUMONIA WITH A WITH A SILENT "P." WHY IS THAT "P" EVEN THERE? AND WHO SILENCED IT? ( LAUGHTER ) SOMEONE CHECK ON THAT. SOMEONE CHECK ON THAT. NOW, SOURCES SAY "THE REAL ISSUE IS CHRONIC DEHYDRATION, EXACERBATED BY HER RELUCTANCE TO DRINK WATER, WHICH HAS BECOME A SOURCE OF TENSION WITH HER STAFF. ADDING, "SHE WON'T DRINK WATER, AND YOU TRY TELLING HILLARY CLINTON SHE HAS TO DRINK WATER." ( LAUGHTER ) CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. SECRETARY CLINTON, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE YOU CAN GET FREE FROM ANY FAUCET, EVEN SOMETIMES FROM THE SKY? IT'S PACKED WITH OXYGEN, AND GET THIS-- TWICE AS MUCH HYDROGEN. AND IT'S DELICIOUS, LIKE A TALL GLASS OF UNFLAVORED GATORADE. AAAH! WATER. YOU NEED IT TO LIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I AM NOT A FAN. AND THIS WHOLE PNEUMONIA SAGA FEEDS RIGHT INTO THE NARRATIVE THAT CLINTON'S HIDING THINGS AND SHE'S TOO UNHEALTHY TO SERVE. EVEN DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND MAN WHOSE PORN NAME IS HIS REAL NAME, DAVID AXELROD, TWEETED: ( LAUGHTER ) CAN YOU IMAGINE? CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE DOOR OPENED AND HE'S THERE GOING, "PIZZA DELIVERY?" YEAH, WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) AXELROD TWEETED, "ANTIBIOTICS CAN TAKE CARE OF PNEUMONIA. WHAT'S THE CURE FOR AN UNHEALTHY PENCHANT FOR PRIVACY THAT REPEATEDLY CREATES UNNECESSARY PROBLEMS?" I'M NOT SURE, BUT IN A LOT OF FAMILIES, IT'S ALCOHOL. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE MAY BE NO CURE BECAUSE HIDING HER DIAGNOSIS MAKES ALL THOSE CLINTON CONSPIRACIES SEEM TRUE. WHAT ELSE COULD BE TRUE? IS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION REALLY A BIG SLUSH FUND? DID THEY COVER UP AN ILLICIT COCAINE RING? IS HILLARY A BLOOD-DRINKING EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIZARD IN DISGUISE? ( LAUGHTER ) IF SO, SHE NEEDS TO DRINK MORE BLOOD BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING DEHYDRATED. HILLARY CLINTON TOOK YESTERDAY OFF AND REASSURED SUPPORTERS THAT SHE'S FEELING FINE, TWEETING: "LIKE ANYONE WHO'S EVER BEEN HOME SICK FROM WORK, I'M JUST ANXIOUS TO GET BACK OUT THERE." OKAY, SHE'S AN ALIEN. SENATOR, IF I'M HOME SICK, THE ONLY THING I'M ANXIOUS TO DO IS WATCH MORE "PRICE IS RIGHT." "HONEY, GET ME A FRESH GINGER AIL, PLEASE. I FELL ASLEEP AND THE ICE MELTED IN THIS ONE AND NOW IT'S ALL WATERY. COULD I HAVE SOME TOAST OR SOME SAUSAL TEENS OR A BURGER." THAT'S ME BEING SICK. AND HILLARY EVEN GOT TO THE PHONE WITH TV'S HEALTHIEST HUMAN, ANDERSON COOPER.
WHY NOT JUST SAY ON FRIDAY, "YOU KNOW, I GOT PNEUMONIA, FOLKS. I'M GOING TO POWER THROUGH IT." WHY KEEP IT A SECRET?
WELL, I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT BIG A DEAL.
Stephen: YEAH, PNEUMONIA'S NO BIG DEAL WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. JUST ASK WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON. OH, WAIT. YOU CAN'T, HE DIED OF IF YOU KNOWNIA. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THIS LEVEL OF SECRECY FOR SOMETHING SO SEEMINGLY MINOR COMES OFF AS, FRANKLY, CARTOONISH. SO HERE TO REASSURE US ABOUT HER HEALTH SITUATION, PLEASE WELCOME CARTOON HILLARY CLINTON.

HI! THANK YOU. HELLO OVER THERE! HI! HI UP TOP.

THANK YOU, STEPHEN. I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE, SMILING, WAVING, BREATHING ON MY OWN.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. BUT TELL ME, WHY DID YOU HIDE YOUR PNEUMONIA DIAGNOSIS?
GREAT QUESTION, STEPHEN. LOOK, I'M JUST DOING WHAT HARDWORKING AMERICANS DO EVERY DAY: POWERING THROUGH A LITTLE ILLNESS TO-- (COUGHS) --DO MY JOB. (COUGHS)
Stephen: ARE-- ARE-- SECRETARY, ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M WONDERFUL, STEPHEN. (COUGHS) LET ME JUST GET MY INHALER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SECRETARY, THAT IS A BONG.
ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN. AND ASK YOURSELF, WOULD I BE USING RECREATIONAL DRUGS IF I WASN'T FEELING WELL? HI. HELLO, BERNIE VOTERS! I'M FEELING THE BERN!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WELL, IS THIS DIAGNOSIS GOING TO SLOW DOWN YOUR CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE?
NOT A BIT, STEPHEN. I'M GOING TO BE OUT THERE EVERY DAY-- (COUGHS MILDLY) LISTENING TO THE VOICES OF-- (COUGHS MORE SEVERELY) SORRY, STEPHEN, THAT'S JUST MY ALLERGIES. (COUGHS VIOLENTLY)
Stephen: OH, MY GOD! DID YOU JUST COUGH UP A CAT?
SURE DID. THIS IS MY CAT, ALLERGIES. SOMETIMES AT NIGHT, SHE CRAWLS INTO MY MOUTH AND NESTLES IN MY LUNGS, BECAUSE LIKE ALL HUMANS, STEPHEN, I AM WARM BLOODED.
Stephen: THIS IS INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY, DISTURBING.
Stephen: WELL, NOT AS DISTURBING AS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. HEY, UP THERE, DO YOU LIKE THAT?
Stephen: SECRETARY CLINTON, IT SEEMS LIKE THIS CAMPAIGN IS TAKING A REAL PHYSICAL TOLL ON YOU.
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. I AM FIRED UP AND ENERGIZED BY THE STORIES OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS EVERYDAY AMERICANS WHO-- (COUGHS) SORRY, FROG IN MY THROAT. AS I WAS SAYING, EVERYDAY AMERICANS WHO NEED SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR THEM.
Stephen: SECRETARY CARTOON CLINTON, I AM CLEARLY TALKED TO YOUR DIS EMBODIED SPIRIT RIGHT NOW.
WHAT, THIS? NO, STEPHEN. I'M JUST DISPLAYING TOTAL TRANSPARENCY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU! HELLO! THANK YOU! NOW, IF YOU EXCUSE ME, I THINK I HEAR MY CHILDHOOD DOG BARKING, SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO TOWARDS THAT LIGHT.

Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU.
GREAT TO BE HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THE LAST TIME-- JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT-- CAN I CALL YOU GORDON JEVIT LOUIS. YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCKS ON LAST TIME YOU SAW YOU.
YOU WERE VERY OBSERVANT.
Stephen: AND YOU DID IT AGAIN.
I KEPT IT A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE THIS TIME BUT THEY DO NOT MATCH.
Stephen: DO YOU DO THAT FOR SOME PERSONAL REASON YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH US?
I ACTUALLY DO. NO ONE'S EVER ASKED ME THAT ON TV BEFORE. YEAH. MY BROTHER DID THIS, AND IT WAS SORT-- MY BROTHER, WHEN HE GREW UP, WAS THIS REALLY SORT OF CONSERVATIVE, SHY GUY, AND OVER THE THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE-- UNFORTUNATELY, HE DIED, LIKE, SIX YEARS AGO-- BUT OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE, HE BECAME EXTREMELY EXTROVERTED. HE DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SHY ANYMORE. AND ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS TO NOT BEING SHY ANYMOREs WAS HE STARTED WEARING BRIGHT-COLORED, MISMATCHED SOCKS. AND IT WAS SORT OF LIKE HIM DIPPING HIS TOE, BECAUSE NO ONE COULD SEE HIS SOCKS, SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING EXTROVERTED AT FIRST.
Stephen: SO HE'S LITERALLY DIPPING HIS TOES INTO THE THE WATERS.
YES. AND I USED TO JUST WEAR BLACK SOCKS BUT THEN I INHERITED HIS SOCK COLLECTION, AND NOW I ALWAYS WEAR THEM.
Stephen: THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY.
YEAH, I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET ALL --
NO, NOT AT ALL. DID YOU MEET SNOWDEN?
I DID.
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU MEET HIM?
OLIVER STONE AND HIS COWRITER KAREN FITZGERALD TOOK A NUMBER OF TRIPS TO MOSCOW WITH HE LIVES --
DOES HE LIVE, LIKE, IN A NICE PLACE? IS HE UNDER-- DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE HIM UNDER GUARD?
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST MET HIM AT AN OFFICE. I DIDN'T GO TO WHERE HE LIVES. OLIVER BROUGHT ME ON ONE OF THE TRIPS. BECAUSE SNOWDEN WAS GIVING LOTS OF FEEDBACK ON THE SCRIPT BUT OLIVER WANTED ME TO MEET HIM. AND I JUST SPENT ABOUT FOUR HOURS TALKING WITH HIM, HIM AND HIS LONGTIME GIRLFRIEND, LINDSEY MILLS, WHO IS PLAYED IN THE MOVIE BY SHAILENE WOODLEY. IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OFF OF HIMSELF AND PUT THE ATTENTION ON THE ISSUES HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.
Stephen: TODAY HE TRIED TO PUT THE ATTENTION ON HIMSELF BECAUSE HE ASKED PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR A PARDON.
THAT'S TRUE. BUT HE WASN'T TALKIN TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE LIKED TO EAT FOR LUNCH AND HOW HE WALKED AND TALKED. THOSE ARE THINGS I WANTED TO PAY ATTENTION TO.
Stephen: OH, AS AN ACTOR. I SEE.
HIS PERSONAL THINGS.
Stephen: SO DID YOU GET ANYTHING FROM HIM?
OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT A PERSON BY JUST HOW THEY SHAKE YOUR HAND. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ( LAUGHTER ) WHOA. THAT WAS LIMP, DUDE.
Stephen: THAT'S THE BEST THING. YEAH. ( APPLAUSE )
HE'S ACTUALLY-- HE WAS REALLY, HE'S SORT OF OLD FASHIONED IN HIS GOOD MANNER S.
Stephen:  OH, REALLY?
YES, I DIDN'T EXPECT IT. FOR BETTER OR WORSE THERE'S A STEREOTYPE THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SORT OF FALLING INTO THIS PREJUDICE THAT GUYS THAT ARE GOOD AT COMPUTERS ARE SOCIALLY AWKWARD. SO EVIDENCE HALF EXPECTING HIM TO KIND OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW, GIVE THIS KIND OF HANDSHAKE.
Stephen: NO EYE CONTACT.
BUT HE REALLY DIDN'T AT ALL. HE WAS ACTUALLY SORT OF GENTLEMANLY, TO BE HONEST. AND I WANTED TO-- I DON'T KNOW I WANTED TO PUT THAT INTO THE PERFORMANCE.
Stephen: NOW, DOES HE WANT TO COME BACK? DID YOU TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT?
DEFINITELY, YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DOESN'T HE COME BACK-- DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD COME BACK AND STAND TRIAL?
I MEAN, LOOK, I'M NOT A LAWYER AS FAR AS HOW HE SHOULD OR SHIPMENT BE PUNISHED --
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE AN AMERICAN.
I AM AN AMERICAN.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN MURKINAN NAN.
I DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.
Stephen: DEEP DOWN WE'RE ALL AMERICANS.
I CAN'T SAY I'M AN AMERICAN. HERE'S THE THING-- I THINK ULTIMATELY WHAT HE DID IS-- IS-- IT'S, OF COURSE, COMPLICATED, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE CONSIDER HIM A CRIMINAL BECAUSE HE BROKE THE LAW. HE DID. WHEN HE TOOK CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND GAVE THEM TO JOURNALISTS, THAT WAS BREAKING THE LAW. BUT THE N.S.A. WAS ALSO BREAKING THE LAW A MILLION TIMES EVERY DAY AND LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT IT, AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, UNTIL EDWARD SNOWDEN PROVIDED THE EVIDENCE.
Stephen: TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT. TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ) JUST BEING THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, BEING THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.
HERE'S THE THING, I LAW THEY WERE BREAKING IS IN OUR BILL OF RIGHTS. THAT'S IN OUR CONSTITUTION THAT MAKES AMERICA SO GREAT. IF YOU WANT TO TALK. BEING AN AMERICAN, WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT IS WE HAVE THESE RIGHTS. THAT'S A PRIVILEGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN PLACES ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE RIGHTS, AND WHEN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY LIKE THE N.S.A. IS BREAKING THAT LAW AND LYING ABOUT IT. TO ME, THAT'S SCARY. THAT'S OUR DEMOCRACY SLIPPING AWAY, AND I'M HAPPY TO STAND UP AND SAY I'M NOT COOL WITH THIS. IT'S NOT OKAY.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M NOT CENSORING YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH, BUT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT, STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH THE YOUNG, HANDSOME AND TALENTED JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT. AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE THE BREAK YOU'RE IN THE NEW MOVIE "SNOWDEN," DIRECTED BY OLIVER STONE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: NOTICE, HE IS A BIT OF A CONSPIRACY THEORIST.
WELL, I MEAN --
TELL ME WHAT PART SNOWDEN PLAYED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF J.F.K. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
HE WAS THE HIDDEN GUY-- HE WAS NEGATIVE 23 YEARS OLD ON THE GRASSY KNOLL, MAN.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE HANGING OUT WITH OLIVER STONE? IS HE FUN OR IS HE CONSTANTLY SPINNING TALES? HE SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A DARK FIGURE.
I MEAN, I WOULD NOT DISAGREE WITH YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF HIM BEING A DARK FIGURE. LOOK, I ACTUALLY THINK OLIVER STONE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE MADE THIS MOVIE ABOUT EDWARD SNOWDEN BECAUSE IT'S TRUE. HE IS A SORT OF A CONTRARIAN. HE'S A PATRIOT MAN. FIRST OF ALL, HE HAS A PURPLE HEART. OLIVER STONE WENT TO VIETNAM AND FOUGHT AND SAVED SOME GUYS' LIVES AND HAS A PURPLE HEART.  HEART.  ( APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING-- OLIVER STONE'S MOVIES TEND TO BE CRITICAL OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, BUT, AGAIN, WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE'RE ALLOWED TO BE CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THAT'S A PATRIOTIC THING TO DO TO SAY, "I LOVE MY COUNTRY, BUT THIS THING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IS NOT RIGHT AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT." THAT'S WHAT OLIVER DOES IN HIS MOVIES.
Stephen: DID YOU DO ANYTHING OFF SET? DID YOU HANG OUT WITH HIM? I IMAGINE HE HAS A FUN SIDE. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN TO A PARTY OR TWO.
I THINK OLIVER STONE HAS HAD SOME FUN IN HIS LIFE, YEAH. HE LOVES MOVIES, OLIVER DOES. I MEAN, IT'S NOT SURPRISING, HE'S A GREAT FIL FILMMAKER. BUT HE KNOWS SO MUCH.
Stephen: DID YOU WATCH ANY FILMS TOGETHER?
WE WATCHED A MOVIE TOGETHER, A GREAT WAR MOVIE, ACTUALLY. THE FIRST TIME-- THE FIRST TIME THAT OLIVER AND I GOT STONED TOGETHER ( LAUGHTER ) WE WERE-- WE WERE-- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WAR STORIES. I ASKED HIM ABOUT VIETNAM, AND HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT IT, AND THEN WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WAR MOVIES AND WHAT WAR MOVIES HE LIKED. BY THE THE WAY, HE MADE ONE OF THE GREATEST WAR MOVIES "PLATOON," NOT TO MENTION "BORN ON THE 4th OF JULY." WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE DOING THE MOVIE IS EDWARD SNOWDEN ENLISTED IN THE U.S. ARMY IN 2004 RIGHT WHEN THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS, SNOWDEN ENLISTED. THE MOVIE BEGAN THERE, IN BASIC TRAINING. WE STARTED OUR PRODUCTION GOING OUT AND SHOOTING THESE MILITARY SCENES. I'M IN, LIKE, FATIGUES, IN FULL BATTLE GEAR DOING BASIC TRAINING DRILLS, SHOOTING THESE SEQUENCES WITH OLIVER STONE, THE GUY THAT MADE "PLATOON." I WAS LIKE, OKAY, THIS IS NO JOKE NOW. WE'RE REALLY DOING THIS.
Stephen: WAS SHOULD THOUGHT ON DIGITAL?
YES, THIS WAS HIS FIRST TIME SHOOTING ON DIGITAL.
Stephen: FOR HIM. THERE WERE ANY CONCERNS SOMEBODY MIGHT HACK YOUR FILES AND TAKE THE MOVIE BECAUSE?
THERE WAS A GUY ON SET, HIS NAME WAS RALPH, WHO WAS SORT OF OUR TECHNICAL CONSULTANT. HE ACTUALLY USED TO BE A HACKER. HE'S AN EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED HACKER. NOW HE WORKS ON THE OTHER SIDE. THEY CALL HIM A WHITE HAT HACKER, AND HIS JOB ON SET WAS TO PROTECT THE FOOTAGE COMING OFF OF THE DIGITAL CAMERAS AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE COULD, YOU KNOW, TAKE THE FOOTAGE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO TO PROTECT THE FOOTAGE, PUT IT IN A ZIP-LOCK BAG? WHAT DO YOU DO TO PROTECT THE FOOTAGE.
LOOK, I'M NOT A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER --
BUT YOU PLAY ONE ON TV.
YES, I DO, IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE. HERE'S THE FUNNY THING, TO TIE IT ALL BACK IN, RALPH ALSO HAPPENED TO HAVE THE BEST WEED. AND I DON'T EVEN THAT'S A COINCIDENCE --
MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER. MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER, I GUESS. SO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, MAN. NICE TO SEE YOU. "SNOWDEN" OPENS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MILLIE BOBBY BROWN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ).

Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO DO RESEARCH ON THE EARLY 80s? DID YOU ASK YOUR MOM AND DAD, LIKE, "WHO WAS-- WHO WAS MILLIE VANILLI? WHO WERE THESE--"
IT WASN'T WHO. IT WAS LIKE, WHAT, IS THAT?"
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A RECORD PLAYER WAS.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE RECORD PLAYERS?
NOW I DO. I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS. BUT I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. IT'S A SQUARE. IT'S GOT A CIRC EEL NO. AND THEN, THE CREW WAS LIKE, "JUST PLAY IT." AND I PLAYED IT. AND I WAS LIKE WHY HAS IT GOT THAT SICK-- WHAT.
Stephen: AND YOU CAN PUT THE NEEDLE DOWN ANYWHERE IN THE SONG YOU WANT, ISN'T THAT COOL?
AND THEN YOU CAN FLIP IT OVER!
Stephen: IT'S PRETTY GREAT.
I'M FED UP WITH TREES NOW, I WANT TO GO TO STUFF LIKE THIS.

NO.
Stephen: I WAS AN ORIGINAL DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS. I WAS ONE OF THOSE FOUR BOYS.
WHICH ONE, THOUGH? THAT'S THE THING.
Stephen: THE LEAST POPULAR ONE. YOU DON'T KNOW DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS?
NO.
Stephen: THERE IS A CREATURE IN YU SHOW, THAT'S A REFERENCE TO A CREATURE IN DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS AND I KNEW THE REFERENCE IMMEDIATELY.
I COULDN'T SAY IT THE AT FIRST. THEY WERE LIKE IT'S DEMO-- WHEN I STARTED READING THE SCRIPT AND REALIZED I HAD NO LINES IT WAS FUN BECAUSE I GOT TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S LINES. AND I WOULD BE LIKE, "NO, THAT'S YOUR LINE." AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE, "YOU HAVE NO LINES TO LEARN SO IT'S EASY FOR TO YOU SAY THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, YOU JUST SIT THERE.
I'M LIKE NO, PAP ANNAUD.

BUNGALOWS REALLY FREAK ME OUT.
Stephen: IS THAT AN ENGLISH WORD FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT?
IT'S A HOUSE WITH SNOW STAIRS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I DON'T EYE DON'T UNDERSTAND-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS IT, BECAUSE THE BAD CREATURES CAN'T GET UP THE STAIRS.
NO! YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO ESCAPE. YOU'RE ON ONE LEVEL. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT YOU CAN GO OUT WINDOW BECAUSE THE HOUSE WITH THE STAIRS, YOU GO UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR, THE CREATURE'S GOT YOU TRAPPED ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
NO! JUST NO! I JUST FEEL SAFE WITH STAIRS. I DON'T RUN UP STAIRS FAST. AS YOU CAN SEE, I FEEL LIKE I COULD TRIP. BUT DON'T-- I LIKE STAIRS BEING AROUND ME. YOU KNOW, LIKE IF I HAD A TANTRUM, I COULD JUST STOMP THE STAIRS, AND MY MOM AND DAD WOULD BE, "OH, SHE'S ANNOYED." YOU KNOW. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO, LIKE, STAIRS JUST COME IN HANDY.
