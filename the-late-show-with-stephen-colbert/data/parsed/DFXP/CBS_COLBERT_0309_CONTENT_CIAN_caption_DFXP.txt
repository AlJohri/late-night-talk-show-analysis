SO HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL ABOUT THE NEW G.O.P. HEALTHCARE BILL?
FEELS LIKE NUMBER EIGHT. ISN'T ANYBODY CONCERNED THEY DIDN'T OFFER AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST?
TRUMP SAID IT WOULD COVER EVERYBODY AND COSTLESS.
FAKE NEWS! I'LL NEVER GET MY SKIN REPLACED NOW.
YOU KNOW WHO THIS PLAN REALLY SCREWS? THE WORKING POOR.
THE HEIMLICH GUY. OO LATE! I'M GOING TO END IT NOW!
IT'S THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES KRISTEN STEWART! MAZ JOBRANI! AND MUSICAL GUEST DAWES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) â™ª
Stephen: HEY! ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN )
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOO! ( PIANO RIFF ) THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. WELL, THE G.O.P.'S NEW HEALTHCARE BILL CLEARED ITS FIRST HURDLE EARLY THIS MORNING, WHEN IT WAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, AFTER ROUGHLY 18 HOURS OF DEBATE. AND ANYONE WHO'S SPENT 18 HOURS TRYING TO PASS SOMETHING KNOWS -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- KNOWS WHAT YOU GET AT THE END.
Jon: OH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: VERY GENEROUS.
Jon: GENEROUS, GENEROUS.
Stephen: VERY GENEROUS WITH YOUR APPLAUSE. THANK YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) APPARENTLY, MEMBERS WERE UP UNTIL 4:00 A.M., WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THINGS GOT A LITTLE LOOPY. ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE THESE LATE NIGHT MUSINGS FROM REPRESENTATIVE JASON SMITH.
YOU COULD TAX A LOT OF DIFFERENT ITEMS IF YOU WANT TO STOP BEHAVIOR. YOU KNOW, I LOVE ICE CREAM. ICE CREAM IS PROBABLY NOT THE MOST HEALTHY THING TO EAT. WHY IS THERE NOT A TAX ON THAT? YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF SKIN CANCER, IT IS NOT TANNING BEDS. DO A GOOGLE SEARCH. IT IS THE SUN. WHY HAVE THEY NOT PROPOSED A TAX ON THE SUN? ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: SO IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING YOUR HEALTHCARE, DON'T WORRY! IT'S SAFELY IN THE HANDS OF THE GUY WHO'S UP ALL NIGHT GOOGLING "WHY DON'T WE TAX THE SUN?" ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: YOU GOT IT!
Stephen: OH!
Jon: I'M COOL! I'M CHILLIN'.
Stephen: WE WOULD NEVER GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO COLLECT THE TAXES. WE WOULD GO AT NIGHT. SUN WOULD NEVER SEE IT COMING WHILE IT'S ASLEEP. ( LAUGHTER ) THE LONG HOURS WERE THANKS TO SOME TROLLING BY THE DEMOCRATS. THEY KNEW DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO STOP THE BILL, SO THEY INTRODUCED A BUNCH OF AMENDMENTS -- YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE COMMITTEE -- YOU CAN INTRODUCE AMENDMENTS AND THEY SLOW THINGS DOWN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DEMOCRATS SUGGESTED CHANGING THE TITLE OF THE BILL FROM "AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT" TO THE "REPUBLICAN PAY MORE FOR LESS CARE ACT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A LITTLE JERKY. THAT'S A LITTLE JERKY. NEXT, THEY TRIED CHANGING THE NAME TO THE "DOUCHEBAG SAYS WHAT?" ACT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE CRAZIEST AMENDMENT OF ALL WAS A MEASURE THAT WOULD HAVE BLOCKED HEALTH CARE REFORM UNLESS IT ENSURED COVERAGE FOR EVERY TAXPAYER AND ALL THEIR DEPENDENTS. OKAY, HA HA, VERY FUNNY, DEMS-- LET'S GET BACK TO THE SERIOUS BUSINESS: WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD TAX THE SUN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS WHO ARE OPPOSED. CONSERVATIVE GROUPS HAVE LINED UP TO OPPOSE THE BILL, BECAUSE FOR THEM, IT'S STILL GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE. HOWEVER YOU PAINT IT UP. BUT TRUMP, THE MASTER DEALMAKER, HAS A PLAN TO WIN CONSERVATIVES OVER. HE'S INVITED THEM TO STRIKE A DEAL OVER A FEW FRAMES AT THE WHITE HOUSE BOWLING ALLEY. YEAH, YEAH. TRUMP WANTS TO BE THERE TO SEE IT, AS THE REPUBLICANS THROW THEIR BALLS AWAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WHAT?
Jon: THROW 'EM OUT.
Stephen: BUT DON'T WORRY, IF IT DOESN'T PASS, TRUMP'S GOT A PLAN -- ALLOW OBAMACARE TO FAIL AND LET DEMOCRATS TAKE THE BLAME. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) HOLD ON. YOU'RE IN CHARGE NOW. IF YOU LET HEALTHCARE COLLAPSE, I DON'T THINK WE'LL BLAME DEMOCRATS, WE'LL BLAME YOU. THAT'S LIKE A FIREFIGHTER LETTING THE HOUSE BURN DOWN TO MAKE THE SPACE HEATER LOOK BAD. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP WANTS TO SELL THIS THING SO MUCH, HE EVEN REACHED OUT TO HIS ARCH-ENEMIES. FOR INSTANCE, LAST NIGHT HE HOSTED TED CRUZ, HIS WIFE HEIDI, AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN FOR DINNER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HEY KIDS, HAVE FUN AT THE WHITE HOUSE, BECAUSE DADDY'S GOING TO BE CRYING ON THE WAY HOME. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HERE WE ARE. HERE WE ARE. OH, STARTED ALREADY! THERE YOU GO. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW AWKWARD WAS THAT? I REMEMBER THE CAMPAIGN. TRUMP SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT CRUZ AND THEY'RE STILL UP ON HIS TWITTER. LIKE ALL THE TIMES TRUMP CALLED HIM "LYIN TED." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT WORKED.
Jon: IT DID.
Stephen: HE ALSO ACCUSED CRUZ'S DAD OF BEING PART OF THE PLOT TO ASSASSINATE J.F.K., AND RE-TWEETED THIS UNFLATTERING PICTURE COMPARING HEIDI CRUZ AND MELANIA WITH THE CAPTION "A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS!" ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) TRUMP HAS A POINT, WHICH IS WHY I LIKE TO LOOK AT THESE PICTURES AS OFTEN AS I CAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Jon: A PICTURE'S WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS!
Stephen: IT IS A TWO-WAY STREET. BOTH OF THESE GUYS SAID SOME TERRIBLE STUFF. AND I'M GUESSING TED CRUZ DIDN'T REPEAT ANY OF THIS FROM THE CAMPAIGN --
THIS MAN IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. HE DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIES. THE MAN IS UTTERLY AMORAL. DONALD TRUMP IS A SERIAL PHILANDERER AND HE BOASTS ABOUT IT!
STEPHEN: "UH, MR. PRESIDENT, COULD YOU PASS THE BOWL OF PEAS, UNLESS YOU'RE CURRENTLY HAVING SEX WITH IT? ( LAUGHTER ) OR MAYBE IT WAS FINE. TED CRUZ SAID "IT IS PRINCIPALLY A SOCIAL DINNER." YOU KNOW, SOCIAL. WHERE YOU ASK ABOUT EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES, LIKE "HOW'S YOUR UGLY WIFE AND YOUR FATHER, THE PRESIDENT-KILLER?" STILL CALL HIM PRESIDENT? DON'T LET YOUR UGLY WIFE LOOK AT ME, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER DEAD PRESIDENT HERE.
Jon: WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING IT. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP. ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) EITHER WAY, I DOUBT TRUMP APOLOGIZED. NOT HIS STYLE. IN FACT, WE GOT A COPY OF THE INVITATION: "YOU AND YOUR WIFE-- WHO'S A THREE AT BEST-- ARE INVITED TO DINNER. COCKTAIL ATTIRE. PLEASE CHECK SPINE AT THE DOOR." ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO TRUMP IS PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS ON THIS HEALTHCARE BILL. EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO THE NAME BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE IS ASKING, DON'T CALL IT "TRUMPCARE." TRUMPCARE, TRUMPCARE, TRUMPCARE. HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO CALL IT TRUMPCARE. WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER YOU SHOULD CALL IT TRUMPCARE, THAT IS ONE THING ABOUT WHICH TRUMP CARES.
Jon: HE DO, HE DO, HE DO!
Stephen: INTER, ACCORDING TO ONE G.O.P. OPERATIVE, "PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING WITH THE PEJORATIVE SUFFIX ON IT, 'CARE,' IS GOING TO BE VIEWED UNFAVORABLY BY CONSERVATIVES." ( LAUGHTER ) YES, CONSERVATIVES DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATING WITH CARING. THAT'S WHY THE OFFICIAL MASCOT OF OBAMACARE REPEAL IS "SUCK-IT, THE DON'T-CARE BEAR." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO WE HAVE THOSE? DID WE GET THOSE T-SHIRTS?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: I WANT THAT T-SHIRT. I WOULD SELL THAT T-SHIRT. OR MAYBE TRUMP JUST DOESN'T WANT TO ATTACH HIS NAME TO SOMETHING THAT NO ONE LIKES. ALTHOUGH THAT NEVER STOPPED HIM BEFORE. AND TRUMP'S NOT THE ONLY ONE DEFENDING TRUMPCARE. THIS AFTERNOON AT A CAPITOL HILL PRESS CONFERENCE, SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, EVER THE SHOWMAN, DAZZLED THE DOUBTERS WITH A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION. HE WAS EITHER DEFENDING TRUMPCARE, OR SELLING REPORTERS A TIMESHARE. AND LIKE ANY SUBSTITUTE TEACHER HE USED THE A.V. EQUIPMENT TO SHOW OFF THE LESSON PLAN.
WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WITH A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH.
STEPHEN: ONE: REPEAL. TWO: REPLACE. THREE: LOOK, OVER THERE! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: ARE THEY GONE YET? ( LAUGHTER ) RYAN ALSO SLAMMED THE OBAMACARE MANDATE THAT EVERYONE HAVE INSURANCE.
THE MANDATES ARE ARROGANT AND PATERNALISTIC.
STEPHEN: YEAH, TELLING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO IS ARROGANT AND PATERNALISTIC. BY THE WAY, LADIES-- NO PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR YOU. AND PAUL RYAN EXPLAINED JUST WHERE OBAMACARE WENT WRONG.
THE WHOLE IDEA OF OBAMACARE IS THE PEOPLE IN THE BLUE SIDE PAY FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE RED SIDE. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HEALTHY PAY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.
STEPHEN: YOU JUST DESCRIBED HOW INSURANCE WORKS. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF INSURANCE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S HOW EVERYTHING WORKS! "THE PROBLEM WITH THIS CASINO IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOSING ARE FUNDING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WINNING. IT'S TIME TO HAVE A CASINO WHERE EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU PLAY THE SLOTS, IT'S A JACKPOT!" OF COURSE, ONE THING TRUMP IS WILLING TO PUT HIS NAME ON IS ACCUSATIONS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ILLEGALLY TAPPED HIS PHONES. TRUMP DEMANDED THAT CONGRESS INVESTIGATE HIS CHARGES, WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO GET TO RIGHT AFTER THEY FIND THOSE THREE MILLION ILLEGAL VOTERS, AND WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S RATINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED! SO, ON MARCH 20, CONGRESS WILL HOLD A RUSSIA HEARING-- A FITTING NAME BECAUSE, AS WE KNOW, RUSSIA IS LISTENING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND CONGRESS IS TAKING THE INVESTIGATION SERIOUSLY. THIS WEEK, MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES VISITED THE C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, WHERE SENATORS VIEWED "FOUR LARGE BINDERS FULL OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION." NO WORD YET ON WHAT'S IN THE BINDERS, BUT JUST FROM THE COVER, CONGRESS HAS LEARNED THAT "METALLICA RULES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! KRISTEN STEWART IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL SHARE SOME OF MY DEEPEST, DARKEST MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK! HOW ABOUT JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY? SAY HI TO THAT MAN OVER THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T THINK I'M GIVING ANYTHING AWAY RIGHT NOW WHEN I SAY, JON, DO YOU AGREE WITH ME -- THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY -- IT IS PARTICULARLY FROSTY TONIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S GOT A NICE CHILL TO IT --
Jon: IT'S GOT A NICE CHILL TO IT.
Stephen: I CANNOT FEEL MY TOES OUT THERE. ARE YOU COLD ENOUGH? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF YOU KEEP THE ROOM COLD, THEY'RE LIKE A CRISP CARROT.
Jon: COMEDY TEMPERATURE.
Stephen: COMEDY WEATHER. IF YOUR TEETH ARE CHATTERING, YOU'RE THAT CLOSE TO LAUGHING, ALREADY. A SURVIVAL MECHANISM, REALLY, MORE THAN ENTERTAINMENT.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: FOLKS, I CONFESS ALL THAT TO YOU. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW BY NOW, I'M A CATHOLIC. BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH LATELY BECAUSE I GAVE IT UP FOR LENT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I REALLY MISS MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITION -- CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
AUDIENCE: OF COURSE NOT!
STEPHEN: GREAT. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) â™ª ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, WAIT RIGHT THERE. BILL RIGHT BACK. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE -- ( ORGAN PLAYING SOFTLY ) WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "GOD ONLY GIVES YOU AS MUCH AS YOU CAN HANDLE," I WONDER IF THEY COULD HANDLE GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW THAT POLICY AT BASKIN ROBBINS WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR I.D. TO PROVE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TO GET A FREE CONE? THAT'S BECAUSE OF ME. ( LAUGHTER ) EVEN THOUGH I THINK IT'S STUPID, I KIND OF WANT TO TRY VAPING. ( LAUGHTER ) MMM, VANILLA CAR EXHAUST. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS DUMB. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVED THE MOVIE "MOONLIGHT," BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY WEREWOLVES. JUST ONE WOULDN'T HAVE HURT THE PLOT. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, I TELL PEOPLE I WISH MY SUPER-POWER WAS INVISIBILITY, BUT I REALLY JUST WISH I COULD EAT PIZZA ALL DAY WITHOUT GETTING FAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHENEVER MY MEDICINE SAYS TO TAKE IT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, I NEVER TAKE IT BECAUSE I NEVER HAVE AN EMPTY STOMACH. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN I GO THROUGH A DRIVE-THROUGH CAR WASH, I PRETEND I'M ON ANOTHER PLANET WHERE IT RAINS SOAP. ( LAUGHTER ) TO GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE, I READ KEROUAC'S "ON THE ROAD" WHILE DRIVING. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR TAX PURPOSES, THE "LATE SHOW" IS A WORKING RANCH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL REALLY DUMB. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, I'M A BIT OF A LITTER BUG. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO DUMP ALL MY DEAD BUGS. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, WHEN I'M IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WAITING ROOM AHEAD OF ME, A LITTLE PART OF ME WISHES THEY'D DIE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I SAID I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THESE. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT EATING A FAMILY-SIZE BAG OF DORITOS TAKES THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS A SPIN CLASS. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE?
AUDIENCE: WE FORGIVE YOU!
STEPHEN: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KRISTEN STEWART.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTRESS BEST KNOWN FOR THE BLOCKBUSTER "TWILIGHT" FRANCHISE. SHE NOW STARS IN THE NEW FILM "PERSONAL SHOPPER." PLEASE WELCOME KRISTEN STEWART! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: I LOVE THE NEW HAIR.
THANK YOU. IT'S NOT NEW. IT'S THE OLDEST HAIR.
Stephen: THE OLD HAIR IS THE LONG HAIR. THIS IS THE NEWEST HAIR.
TRUE.
Stephen: UNLESS YOU HAD A WIG MADE OF OLD HAIR AND PUT IT OVER A COMPLETELY SHAVED HEAD WHICH WOULD BE LOVELY.
YEAH, I MESSED THAT UP.
Stephen: THIS IS A NEW MOVE YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE JUST DOING IT FOR YOU?
THE DIRECTOR SUGGESTED I SHAVE IT ALL OFF BECAUSE THE FEMALE PROTAGONIST HAS TO BE BAD AS.
Stephen: THERE IS A NEW MOVIE CALLED "UNDERWATER" COMING UP WHICH IS AN UNDERWATER VERSION OF ARMAGEDDON?
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
Stephen: THIS IS STEP ONE TO BEING BRUCE WILLIS?
I GUESS SO. I HAVE TO PUT ON A LOT OF HELMETS SO IT WILL BE EASIER FOR MY HAIR DRESSER.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO ADJUST YOUR MIC AND WE'LL CUT THIS PART OUT BECAUSE IT'S TOO INTIMATE, BUT YOUR CHAIN WAS HITTING YOUR MIC AND WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU.
COOL.
Stephen: ARE WE GOOD NOW? DID YOU HAVE A LITTLE EAR PIECE?
Stephen: HE LOOKED AT ME, POINTED AT THE PROMPTER AND THE PROMPTER SAID "CHAIN ON MIC."
GOT IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NORMALLY WE HAVE A MAD MAN NAMED MIKE BACKSTAGE WE HAVE TO KEEP CHAINED UP. BUT THAT'S CALLED CONTINUITY. PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WHERE'S THE CHAIN? NOW THE CHAIN'S GONE. NOW THERE ARE GOING TO BE CONSPIRACY THEORIES. NOW THAT CHAIN'S HITTING IT.
SERIOUS?
Stephen: I AM SERIOUS. OKAY, THANKS VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS VERY MUCH. NOW THERE ARE REALLY GOING TO BE CONSPIRACY THEORIES. I DON'T CARE. LET 'EM WRITE!
CAN WE DO THE SHOW NOW? I CAN SYMPATHIZE FOR THE HEAD SHAVING BECAUSE I WANTED TO SHAVE MY HEAD FOR THE YEARS AND IN 2009 THE PRESIDENT ORDER #-RD GENERAL ORDE TO SHAVE MY HEAD ON SHOW. DO YOU LIKE IT?
I COULDN'T STOP TOUCHING IT.
Stephen: MY WIFE SAID IT WAS LIKE DATE AGO NEW GUY. SHE WOULD REACH OVER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND FEEL MY HEAD AND GO, WHO IS THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, LISTEN, YOU HAVE AN HONOR, IF I CAN CALL IT THAT, THAT SO FEW PEOPLE HAVE. YOU ARE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE ON TWITTER THAT OUR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ATTACKED REPEATEDLY. THIS WAS BACK IN 2012 WHEN YOU AND ROBERT PATTINSON WERE BREAKING UP. THIS IS THE FIRST TWEET. KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS THE MAN WHO'S NOW THE KEEPER OF THE LAUNCH CODES. HE TWEETED. ROBINSON SHOULD NOT TAKE BACK KRISTEN STEWART. SHE CHEATED ON HIM LIKE A DOG AND WILL DO IT AGAIN. JUST WATCH, HE COULD DO MUCH BETTER. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) OKAY?
WHATEVER. I'M MUCH BETTER.
Stephen: GOOD. GOOD. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW -- DID THIS TEACH YOU TO DEAL WITH BULLIES? BECAUSE THAT'S BULLY BEHAVIOR. WHY DO YOU THINK HE ATTACKED YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT?
HMHM-UM. I TRIED TO. HE DID IT PUBLICLY AND HE DIDN'T PUBLICLY RESPOND. WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT. THAT'S OKAY. CELEBRATE THE DIFFERENCES, WHATEVER.
Stephen: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, MAYBE NOT.
Stephen: WELL, I WILL SAY THIS, HE TWEETED AT YOU ELEVEN TIMES, OKAY?
I KNOW.
Stephen: HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE TWEETED AT MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT HAS CONDEMNED ANTISEMITISM?
OH, MY GOD -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE A PRETTY LAID-BACK PERSON. YOU USE THE WORD "DUDE" IN CASUAL CONVERSATION.
IT'S REALLY VERSATILE AND USEFUL.
Stephen: OKAY. TWHAR DIFFERENT WAYS ONE CAN USE "DUDE"? BECAUSE I ENJOY THE WORD DUDE BUT I MIGHT BE TOO OLD TO DUDE IT UP. WHY IS IT SO VERSATILE FOR YOU?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YOU CAN -- YOU CAN REALLY BE EMPATHETIC AND DEPENDING ON THE READING, SOMEONE'S HAVING A HARD TIME, YOU CAN GO, LIKE, DUDE, YOU KNOW, YOU OKAY? OR IF SOMEONE'S IN YOUR FACE, MESSING WITH YOU, DUDE! BACK IT UP! SAME WORD. ENTIRELY DIFFERENT EFFECTS, THOUGH.
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S THE ADJUSTABLE ALAN WRENCH OF WORDS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE NEW MOVIE, "PERSONAL SHOPPER," GETTING TREMENDOUS REVIEWS. IT'S A SCARY MOVIE. WOULD YOU CALL IT HORROR, SUSPENSE?
YEAH, I MEAN, I GUESS PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT, LIKE, A THRILLER. THERE ARE DEFINITELY ASPECTS OF IT THAT ARE UNNERVING FOR SURE AND UNCOMFORTABLE.
Stephen: YOU PLAY A TWIN IN THIS, I UNDERSTAND.
YEAH.
Stephen: TELL US WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR TWIN.
WHEN YOU MEET THE CHARACTER YOU REALLY KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT HER, OTHER THAN IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES THAT SHE HAS LOST HER TWIN BROTHER, AND SHE'S SUCH A FRAGMENTED VERSION OF HERSELF. HALF OF HER IS GONE, ESSENTIALLY, AND THIS TRAUMA SHE'S IN HAS SORT OF KICK STARTED THIS REALLY DEEP EXISTENTIAL CRISIS THAT'S LED HER TO QUESTIONS THAT ARE UNANSWERABLE AND SHE JUST WANTS ONE THING THAT'S FINITE SHE CAN HOLD ON TO THAT SHE CAN START THIS REBUILDING PROCESS OF WHO SHE IS SO SHE CAN GET PAST THE GRIEVE OF HER BROTHER. SO SHE STARTS QUESTIONING WHAT THE AFTERLIFE IS AND WHETHER THERE IS A TANGIBLE CONNECTION TO THAT THAT WE CAN HAVE OR TOUCH OR FEEL. SO IT GETS A LITTLE SPOOKY BECAUSE REALITY DOESN'T REALLY EXIST FOR HER. IT'S SORT OF LIKE AN EVE EVER-SHIFTING THING. IF YOU DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH YOU EXIST, QUESTIONING EXISTENCE AND HOW WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER IS A VERY DEBILITATING NOTION.
Stephen: WELL, WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP HERE. WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING TO IN THIS CLIP?
MY BOSS' BOYFRIEND.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. JIM?
WHEN YOU'RE A MEDIUM, YOU JUST ARE ATTUNED TO A SORT OF -- VIBE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "VIBE"? IT'S AN INTUITION THING. IT'S A FEELING. YOU SEE THIS DOOR, IT'S ONLY, LIKE, SLIGHTLY AJAR.
YOU THINK A SOUL CONTINUES TO EXIST AFTER DEATH?
I DON'T KNOW EVEN KNOW IF I BELIEVE IN THAT. LOUIS DID. I HAVE TO GIVE HIS SPIRIT -- WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT -- A CHANCE TO PROVE HIM RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS CHARACTER IS DEALING WITH GHOSTS. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS?
UM --
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE DO. A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH GHOSTS?
I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES THAT I HAVE BEEN, LIKE, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT AND NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT SOUND HAPPENED, BUT I'VE NEVER --
Stephen: PROBABLY A GHOST. PROBABLY A GHOST.
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER GETS GHOST TEXTS IN THIS MOVIE. DOES THAT MEAN IN THIS WORLD GHOSTS HAVE THUMBS OR GHOSTS GO TO THE BATHROOM? ( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE IS THIS KIND OF, LIKE, SHIFTING PROJECTION OF WHAT SHE SORT OF BELIEVES TO BE TRUE, WHICH IS, LIKE, IT'S A VERY EVOLVING THING THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. ULTIMATELY, I DO KNOW WHO THAT PERSON IS. IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE, IT BECOMES A MORE SOLID THING WARD THE END. IN THE BEGINNING, SHE COULD BE HAVING A DIALOGUE WITH HERSELF, SHE COULD BE MAYBE TALKING TO A GHOST OR SPIRIT OR BROTHER OR A MORE EVIL SPIRIT OR SOMETHING, BUT EVEN -- YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TEXTING YOUR FRIEND AND THEY SAY SOMETHING YOU MISINTERPRET, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU FLIP OUT AND FLY OFF THE HANDLE, YOU'RE BASICALLY TALKING TO YOURSELF ANYWAY, SO IT RIFFS ON THAT A LITTLE BIT, TOO.
Stephen: WELL, LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "PERSONAL SHOPPER" IN THEATERS TOMORROW! KRISTEN STEWART, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MAZ JOBRANI! STICK AROUND!
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS A COMEDIAN AND ACTOR WHO STARS IN THE NEW SITCOM "SUPERIOR DONUTS" RIGHT HERE ON CBS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, MAZ JOBRANI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
THANK YOU!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, MAN.
Stephen: NOW, LET ME SEE IF I GET THIS RIGHT -- HAPPY NOROOZ.
THE PERSIAN NEW YEAR, WHAT'S CURRENTLY GOING ON.
Stephen: HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?
THE FIRST MOMENT OF SPRING, NEXT TUESDAY. NOROOZ MEANS NEW DAY.
Stephen: ARE WE IN THE SEASON OF NOROOZ NOW?
IN THE SEASON. WOULD YOU MIND IF I TAUGHT YOU HOW TO SAY IT IN FARSI?
Stephen: SURE. WHAT AIM ACTUALLY SAYING?
I'M STEPHEN, HAPPY NEW YEAR IN PERSIAN.
Stephen: I'LL DO MY BEST. ( MAZ SPEAK IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE, STEPHEN TRYING TO REPEAT IT )
WHOO! YOU GOT IT, BABY! YOU GOT IT!
Stephen: GOT A LITTLE SWIMMY TOWARD THE END.
YOU GOT IT!
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS ON -- WHAT'S THE CELEBRATION?
SO, IT'S BASED ON ACTUALLY THE FIRST MONOTHEESTIC RELIGION.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE WE TALKING HERE?
A COUPLE THOUSAND YEARS.
Stephen: AT LEAST A COUPLE THOUSAND?
THREE TO FOUR.
Stephen: IT WAS FIRST? IT WAS FIRST, BEFORE CHRISTIANITY, BEFORE ISLAM, JUDAISM. AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT WAS FIRST. THAT'S WHAT WIKIPEDIA SAYS.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT THE NEW YEAR STARTS THE FIRST MOMENT OF SPRING BECAUSE IT'S A NEW YEAR, AND THEY CELEBRATE, WITHIN A TWO-WEEK PERIOD, WE CELEBRATE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WE CELEBRATE IN AMERICA OVER THE YEAR, WE DO IT ALL IN TWO WEEKS. IT NEW YEAR, SO IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE. WE GIVE GIFTS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS. WE COLOR EGGS, SO IT'S LIKE EASTER. WITH WE GO DOOR TO DOOR FOR TREATS, SO SORT OF LIKE HALLOWEEN.
Stephen: DO YOU GET IN COSTUME AND GO DOOR TO DOOR? THAT MIGHT FREAK PEOPLE UP IN MARCH.
NO, IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME TO DRESS UP IN COSTUME IF YOU'RE IRANIAN. I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPORTED YET. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ACTUALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU SEE -- LIKE THE WAY IN AMERICA, WE'VE TAKEN THESE TRADITIONS AND WE'VE PUT IT ON STEROIDS. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE GIFTS THAT WE GIVE IN THE PERSIAN NEW YEAR, MY FATHER, WHEN I WAS A KID, WOULD SIGN A $2 BILL AND GIVE IT TO ME AND SAY, HERE YOU GO, SON, HAPPY NEW YEAR. IN AMERICA YOU GET BIKES AND VIDEO GAMES AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF.
Stephen: NO CHRISTMAS FOR YOU?
WELL, WE DO CHRISTMAS, TOO, NOW.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S GOOD. I MIGHT THROW NOROOZ IN THERE SO I DON'T GET RIPPED OFF.
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY, DO NOROOZ WITH YOUR KIDS. GIVE THEM $2 BILLS, SIGN IT AND SAY, THAT'S ALL YOU GET. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF THE ZORASTERISM?
I WOULD THINK ZORASTER?
Stephen: IT'S YOUR HOLIDAY. I KNOW WHO FOUNDED CHRISTMAS. COCA-COLA. EXACTLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE ACTUAL RELIGION, GOOD WORDS, GOOD THOUGHTS, GOOD DEEDS, TEN YOU JUST LIVE YOUR LIFE.
Stephen: I COULD DO THAT. AS AN IRANIAN AMERICAN, WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN ELECTED? A NEW VIBE?
IT'S BEEN GREAT. RELATIVES CAN'T COME, YOU KNOW!
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, ONE OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES, SIX COUNTRIES, SO YOUR RELATIVES CAN'T VISIT FOR 120 DAYS AT LEAST AT THIS POINT. ( LAUGHTER )
AT FIRST THEY WERE TRYING TO SELL IT FOR THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS. BUT NONE OF THE COUNTRIES ON THE LIST EVER COMMITTED AN ACT OF TERRORISM IN AMERICA. THEN I SAW KELLYANNE CONWAY ON THE NEWS. SHE GOES, IT'S JUST A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE FOR THESE PEOPLE. SHE GOES, AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 WHEN I GOT FURTHER SCRUTINY IN THE AIRPORT, I WASN'T WORRIED. I WANTED TO SHAKE HER. I WANTED TO BE, LIKE, THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION WHO COULDN'T COME TO AMERICA BECAUSE OF IT. I GOT AN EMAIL FROM A NORWEGIAN-IRANIAN WHO WAS GOING TO COME VISIT HIS FATHER ON HIS DEATH BED AND THEY COULDN'T COME BECAUSE TO HAVE THE BAN, THEY TOOK AWAY HIS VISA. FAMILIES WERE BEING TORN APART AND IT WAS REALLY UPSETTING.
HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE? TWO, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON AND SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO THEM ABOUT WHY THE RELATIVES CAN'T VISIT?
IT'S INTERESTING. MY WIFE IS INDIAN SO THE KIDS ARE JUST COLORED UP. ( LAUGHTER ) IRAN YRN-INDIAN.
Stephen: NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE.
YEAH. SO MY DAUGHTER WAS SCARED AND SAID, DADDY IF TRUMP WINS, WILL WE GET KICKED OUT? I HAD TO TELL HER, NO, YOU WERE BORN IN AMERICA, YOU WON'T BE KICKED OUT. DADDY MIGHT HAVE TO GO, BUT WE'LL HAVE FACETIME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: ARE YOU A CITIZEN? I AM. DID YOU GO TO THE AIRPORT PROTESTS?
Stephen: I DID NOT. I GOT UPSET AND WENT TO THE AIRPORT PROTESTS. IF YOU HAVEN'T PROTESTED, IT'S REALLY FUN.
Stephen: I HAVE PROTESTED. I DIDN'T GO TO THAT ONE, BUT I HAVE.
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING. WHEN YOU GO TO THE PROTESTS, IT'S, LIKE, REAL.
Stephen: YOU'RE THERE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
YOU'RE THERE WITH YOUR FRIENDS. I WENT TO LAX TO PROTEST, AND I LEARNED THAT WHITE PEOPLE BORN IN AMERICA PROTEST DIFFERENTLY THAN PEOPLE OF COLOR OR PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT BORN IN AMERICA BECAUSE WE WENT DOWN, AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU. WE WENT DOWN AND WE'RE, LIKE, PROTESTING, AND I WAS, LIKE, HERE WE COME, HERE WE GO. I FELT GOOD. THEN THE RIOT POLICE CAME OUT AND I WAS, LIKE, OH, SNAP! ( LAUGHTER ) I WAS, LIKE, I'M JUST GOING TO GO PROTEST OVER HERE FOR A MINUTE. I'M NOT KIDDING. THE WHITE GUYS WERE, LIKE, GET OUT OF MY WAY, COPPER! HERE I COME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, ON THE SERIES "SUPERIOR DONUTS," YOU PLAY AN IRAQI, BUT YOU'RE IRANIAN. IS THAT RACIST?
NO, THAT'S THE BEST HOLLYWOOD COULD DO, MAN! ( LAUGHTER ) ONE MIDDLE EASTERNER AT A TIME, MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAVE AN IRAQI ACCENT ON THERE -- OR ARKANS AN ARAB ACCENT. THE DIFFERENCE IS SIMILAR. WHEN IRANIANS TALK, WE TALK VERY SLOWLY, HOW ARE YOU, STEPHEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. HI! I AM IRANIAN! GOOD TO BE HERE! ( IN IRANIAN ACCENT )
Stephen: MEANWHILE -- MEANWHILE, ARABS TALK VERY FAST -- ( SPEAKING VERY FAST )
Stephen: YOU SURE THIS ISN'T RACIST?
I'M TELLING YA! ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) SO ARABS ARE, LIKE, ON COCAINE AND IRANIS ARE ON HEROIN.
Stephen: COULDN'T BE NICER. YES.
