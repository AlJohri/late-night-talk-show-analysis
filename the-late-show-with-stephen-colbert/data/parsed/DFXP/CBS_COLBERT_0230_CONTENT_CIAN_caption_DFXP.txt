STEPHEN: ELIJAH WOOD!  SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW!
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE STEPHEN... AGAIN.
STEPHEN: YOU WERE ON THIS SHOW BEFORE?
YEP.
STEPHEN: YOU SURE?
THERE'S VIDEO TAPE OF IT.
Stephen: A LOT OF GUESTS COME THROUGH HERE.
IT WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO, STEPHEN.
Stephen: MMM -- YOU STOPPED BY TO TELL ME HOW GREAT IT WAS TO HAVE ME ON THE SHOW.
Stephen: DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME
WELL, I DON'T THINK I WANT TO SAY WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT A HOST WHO CAN'T REMEMBER HIS GUESTS.
STEPHEN: I SAY, I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO SAY WHAT IS SAYS, AND THEN I'LL SAY WHAT IS SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT A GUEST WHO ISN'T GOING TO SAY WHAT IT SAYS.
SAY IT!
Stephen: IT SAYS YOU'RE UNCOOL.
THIS IS A VINTAGE SWEATER. I CHALLENGE YOU TO SETTLE THIS LIKE GENTLEMEN! ♪ ♪ (SHOUTING)
STEPHEN: ELIJAH, GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW.
I'VE BEEN HERE A COUPLE TIMES, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: ARE YOU SURE?
REMEMBER I WAS ON THAT ONE TIME, AND THEN I CAME ON AGAIN AND WE ARGUED ABOUT YOU NOT REMEMBERING THE FIRST TIME?
Stephen: NO, SORRY.
AND THEN WE JOUSTED?
STEPHEN: UHHHH... NO.
YOU STILL HAVE A LANCE STICKING OUT OF YOUR GUT.
Stephen: THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES TIGER WOODS, ELIJAH WOOD AND JORGE RAMOS, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND, NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: JON BATISTE, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOOD TO SEE YOU! ( PIANO RIFF ) HI, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! AWFULLY NICE. AWFULLY NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. EVERYBODY FEELING ALL RIGHT? ( CHEERING )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ENERGY. WE HAVE A TRUMP HANGOVER. WE ARE ALL STILL RECOVERING FROM LAST NIGHT'S THIRD AND FINAL DEBATE, IF THERE IS A GOD. NOW, EVERYBODY'S WONDERING WHO WON. WELL, CNN NAMED THE WINNER HOURS BEFORE THE DEBATE BEGAN. THEY SAY IT WAS EXCEDRIN, FOR THEIR TWEET, "THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEBATE HEADACHE IS HIGH, BE PREPARED WITH EXCEDRIN." CUTE. OF COURSE, AFTER WATCHING THE DEBATE, WE KNOW THE REAL WINNER WAS: "NYQUIL-- SWEET DARKNESS OF SLEEP, IT'S YOUR ONLY ESCAPE." THE POLLS SAY CLINTON WON, BUT TRUMP IS NO LONGER ACCEPTING THE POLLS OR REALLY ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. LAST NIGHT, WHEN CHRIS WALLACE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT, I'LL TELL YOU AT THE TIME. I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE.
Stephen: YES, SUSPENSE. THAT'S PRESIDENTIAL. IT REMINDS ME OF FDR'S FIRST INAUGARAL --
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS... STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT! ( DRAMATIC MUSIC )
Stephen: YEAH! YEAH! GOT CHILLS. DIDN'T KNOW. DIDN'T KNOW. SPOILER ALERT. IT WAS NAZIS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY NOT PROMISING TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS DISQUALIFIES TRUMP FROM THE PRESIDENCY. SO, TODAY, TRUMP ASSURED VOTERS THAT HE BELIEVES IN THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO MAKE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO PROMISE AND PLEDGE TO ALL OF MY VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS AND TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES THAT I WILL TOTALLY ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THIS GREAT AND HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IF... I... WIN. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
STEPHEN: HA-HA! OH, COME ON! YOU GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM! YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY GOT ME FOR A SECOND THERE! I ACTUALLY BELIEVED YOU HAD A SHRED OF INTEGRITY. WHAT AN AMAZING PSYCH-OUT. IT'S LIKE THAT CLASSIC JOKE WHERE YOU OFFER TO SHAKE SOMEBODY'S HAND, BUT WHEN THEY GO TO SHAKE IT, YOU UNDERMINE OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, HOW DID WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE FATE OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT RESTS IN DONALD TRUMP'S TINY, WHINING, LOSER HANDS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRULY. TRULY, THE (BLEEP) HAS GRABBED US. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WATCH IT. AND UNDERMINING 250 YEARS OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY TO PROTECT HIS EGO WASN'T TRUMP'S ONLY CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS.
WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM OUT AND SECURE THE BORDER AND, ONCE THE BORDER IS SECURED, AT A LATER DATE, WE'LL MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO THE REST. BUT WE HAVE SOME BAD HOMBRES HERE, AND WE'RE GONNA GET THEM OUT.
STEPHEN: YEAH, BAD HOMBRES. I THINK HE THINKS HE'S RUNNING FOR SHERIFF. WE GOT HOMBRES, MU CHACHOS, COMPADRES, QUESADILLAS. ( LAUGHTER ) I AM ACTUALLY KIND OF SURPRISED THAT TRUMP DIDN'T DO BETTER BECAUSE HE PREPARED. TRUMP HELD PRACTICE DEBATES WITH CHRIS CHRISTIE PLAYING THE ROLE OF HILLARY CLINTON. SO TRUMP WAS READY, IF HILLARY STARTED WEEPING QUIETLY WHILE SHE HANDED HIM HIS MCDONALD'S ORDER. OF COURSE, HILLARY ALSO HAD HER MOMENTS. HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT HER TAX PLANS --
WE ARE GOING TO GO WHERE THE MONEY IS.
STEPHEN: AND SHE KNOWS WHERE THE MONEY IS. IT'S WHERE SHE GIVES HER SPEECHES. NOW, SAY HELLO TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH, WELL, IT'S BEEN AN UPSETTING CAMPAIGN, HASN'T IT, JON?
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, BUT IT'S ONLY FOUR YEARS.
Stephen: WE'RE JUST A FEW WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR EVERY AMERICAN TO PERFORM THEIR CIVIC DUTY, THREATENING TO MOVE TO CANADA IF THEIR CANDIDATE DOESN'T WIN. THIS HAPPENS EVERY FOUR YEARS. CANADA IS LIKE AMERICA'S SAFETY SCHOOL. I THOUGHT, WHAT WOULD IT TAKE IF YOU WANTED TO MOVE TO CANADA. JIM? I MET WITH TORONTO-BASED CANADIAN IMMIGRATION LAWYER, ANDREW CUMMING, TO FIND OUT HOW TO TURN OVER A NEW MAPLE LEAF. THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
STEPHEN: SO WHAT DO WE GOT HERE? ASK AWAY, ON BEHALF OF MY AUDIENCE.
SO, YOUR NAME, EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS ON YOUR PASSPORT.
STEPHEN: IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT. C-O-L-B-E-R-T.
STEPHEN, DO YOU HAVE ANY NICKNAMES?
STEPHEN: OH, LET'S SEE: STEVE, STEVE-A-RINO, EIGHTBALL, HAMBONE, BRANGELINA.
STEPHEN, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
STEPHEN: HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM? DON'T WORRY ABOUT MY FEELINGS. JUST SHOOT FROM THE HIP. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HURT. WHATEVER YOU WANT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?
52.
STEPHEN: OKAY, ( BLEEP ) YOU. ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, I APOLOGIZE. I MEAN, CORRECT. I MEAN, GOOD FOR YOU. GOOD FOR CANADA, YOU.
SEX?
STEPHEN: SURE, YEAH. LET'S DO IT.
I'LL TAKE THAT AS MALE.
STEPHEN: WHAT?
COLOR OF YOUR EYES?
STEPHEN: TELL ME WHAT COLOR THEY ARE. DO YOU REMEMBER?
DARK BROWN.
STEPHEN: OKAY, PRETTY GOOD. YOU ARE A VERY ATTENTIVE LOVER. YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFUL, THEY ARE LIKE JADE.
THANK YOU.
STEPHEN: LIKE POLISHED JADE, LIKE PRECIOUS STONES THAT I FOUND IN A TOMB IN A FORGOTTEN VALLEY SOMEWHERE IN MONGOLIA. AND AS I HELD THE GLISTENING STONES IN MY HANDS AND RUN THE FRESH SPRING WATER OVER THEM TO REVEAL THEIR AGATE GLORY...
THAT WILL NOT ASSIST YOU IN THE APPLICATION. LET'S MOVE ALONG.
STEPHEN: WILL NOT, OKAY. YOU DO HAVE BEAUTIFUL EYES.
THANK YOU. ANY CRIMINAL ISSUES WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF?
STEPHEN: NOT THAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF.
ANY CONCERNS WITH WAR CRIMES OR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY?
STEPHEN: I'M NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.
AND NO PREVISIONS CONVICTIONS?
STEPHEN: CONVICTIONS? YES.
Stephen: NO.
EXCELLENT. SO THEN, I NEED YOU TO SIGN THIS PAPER WORK. AND, DO YOU HAVE A PHOTO? WE NEED IMMIGRATION PICTURES.
STEPHEN: OKAY, I GOT ONE. I GOT ONE RIGHT HERE.
UM, STEPHEN YOUR EYES ARE NOT BROWN IN THAT PICTURE.
STEPHEN: NOPE, THEY'RE NOT. THE LIGHTING IS BAD IN HERE. BUT THIS IS WHAT I LOOK LIKE WHEN I AM PROPERLY LIT, IN CANADA.
SO, STEPHEN, LET'S ASSUME WE CAN GET YOU PERMANENT RESIDENCY IN CANADA. IF YOU WANT TO MOVE TO CANADA, I HAVE TO WARN YOU THAT THERE WILL EVENTUALLY BE A CITIZENSHIP TEST IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BECOME A CANADIAN CITIZEN.
STEPHEN: OKAY.
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS, FOR YOU TO GET A BIT OF THE FLAVOR FOR WHAT IS INVOLVED. ARE YOU READY FOR THAT?
STEPHEN: I AM IN.
HOW ARE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT CHOSEN?
STEPHEN: OH, UMM-- LUMBERJACK COMPETITION? THE OCTAGON? THE CANADIAN OCTAGON?
NO.
STEPHEN: TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN APOLOGIZES?
NO! ( LAUGHS )
STEPHEN: NO? SORRY.
LET'S MOVE ON. LET'S TRY THIS ONE. NAME TWO CANADIAN SYMBOLS.
STEPHEN: THE MAPLE LEAF, AND THE BARENAKED LADY.
( BREATHS IN ) I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU HALF A CHECK FOR THAT.
STEPHEN: OKAY, GREAT, ALL RIGHT. THINGS ARE TURNING AROUND NOW.
AHHH-- WHAT ARE THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT?
WHAT ARE THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT?
STEPHEN: UMM, THE N.H.L., TIM HORTONS AND ALAN THICKE.
I WILL HAVE TO GIVE X, X AND X TO THAT.
STEPHEN, WHAT ARE THE THREE RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIZENSHIP?
STEPHEN: TO DEFEND THE QUEEN, FOR SOME REASON. UM, PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM WANDERING POLAR BEARS; ADDING UNNECESSARY "U"S TO WORDS LIKE FLAVOR AND COLOR; AND YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SING AT LEAST ONE GORDON LIGHTFOOT SONG AT KARAOKE.
CAN YOU DO THAT?
STEPHEN: NAME ONE!

NOT QUITE A CITIZEN. IN FACT, NOT EVEN A PERMANENT RESIDENT. BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.
STEPHEN: WELL, ANDREW, I WOULD LOVE TO BE HAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. CANADA, HERE I COME! MAYBE. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON NOVEMBER 8.
GOOD LUCK!
Stephen: THANK YOU, CANADA! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TIGER WOODS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A GOLF LEGEND AND  POP CULTURE ICON. HE HAS 14 MAJORS, 11 P.G.A. PLAYER OF THE YEAR AWARDS AND 20 YEARS OF THE TIGER WOODS FOUNDATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, PLEASE WELCOME TIGER WOODS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: EVERYBODY'S EXCITED TO SEE TIGER WOODS. NOT A LOT OF TIMES TO FRIENDS CALL ME UP AND SAY, CAN I COME TO THE SHOW. ALLOT OF THE TIME IT'S A BIG BAND AND TIGER WOODS. YOU ARE AN EVENT.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: NO, YOU ARE IF SOMEONE CARES ABOUT GOLF.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
Stephen: OTHERWISE, PEOPLE GO, SEEMS LIKE A NICE ENOUGH GUY, WHY IS EVERYBODY SO EXCITED.
YEAH.
Stephen: 14 MAJORS, 79 PGA TOUR WINS, ONLY MISSED 15 CUTS IN OVER 300 PGA TOUR EVENTS. THAT'S A 95% RATIO OF MAKING THE KURT THERE. JORDAN SPEEF IS ONLY 22. HE MISSED MORE CUTS THAN YOU HAVE. DID YOU CALL HIM UP AND TALK TO HIM?
NO, THAT'S 15 TOO MANY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. SO WHEN ARE YOU GETTING BACK TO GOLF? BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN TEASING US HERE WITH THE IDEA --
YEAH, I HEAR YA.
Stephen: YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PLAY THE SAFEWAY OPEN.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU SAID YOU'RE HEALTHY BUT YOUR GAME'S NOT THERE. WHERE'S YOUR GAME?
MY GAME IS COMING. IT'S GETTING THERE. I'M NOT QUITE THERE WHERE I CAN SHOOT. I FEEL LIKE I CAN SHOOT 63s AND 64s IN TOURNAMENTS. I'M SHOOTING LOW ROUNDS AT HOME BUT I DON'T FEEL I'M READY TO SHOOT THOSE TYPES SCORES IN TOURNAMENT CONDITIONS.
Stephen: YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY TURKISH AIRLINES, NOT GOING TO DO THAT. NEXT ONE THE HERO WORLD CHALLENGE WHICH YOU'RE HOSTING.
YES.
Stephen: I'M BUYING MY AIRLINE TICKETS. YOU WILL ACTUALLY PLAY?
I'LL BE THERE PLAYING.
Stephen: OKAY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT WE'VE GOT UPEVERYBODY EXCITED FOR YOU COMING BACK, WHY COME BACK? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE DONE IT ALL! YOU'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO PROVE.
I LOVE COMPETING. I LOVE PLAYING.
Stephen: REEL LIE? I LOVE TRYING TO BEAT THESE BOYS, IT'S FUN.
Stephen: AND THEY ARE KIND OF BOYS COMPARED TO YOU BECAUSE IT WILL BE 20 YEARS SINCE YOU ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED EVERYBODY AT THE MASTERS.
I WAS GIVING JORDAN PRETTY GOOD GRIEF AT THE RYDER CUP BECAUSE WHEN I WON THE MASTERS, HE WAS STILL IN DIAPERS.
Stephen: NOT A METAPHOR. NO. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE, BUT I LOVE BEING OUT THERE AND COMPETING, I LOVE TRYING TO WIN GOLF TOURNAMENTS AND COMPETING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.
Stephen: ARE YOU EVER TEMPTED TO RETIRE TO YOU CAN DO WHAT RETIREES DO AND PLAY GOLF? ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THAT'S WIN-WIN, TIGER WOODS.
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL, GOLF, WHEN WE WANT TO RELAX TO GO FISHING, WHAT DO FISHERMEN DO TO RELAX?
Stephen: STOP FISHING. TOP FISHING. OKAY.
Stephen: SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU PLAYED IN A PGA TOURNAMENT?
IT'S BEEN AUGUST, OVER A YEAR.
Stephen: SO ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR TIME OFF, HAS IT BEEN HUMBLING TO YOU ABOUT YOUR TIME NOT PLAYING?
YEAH, I'VE HAD TWO BACK SURGERIES SINCE THEN AND, YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO PRACTICE AND COMPETE ALL DAY. THAT'S ONE OF MY THINGS. I LIKE TO DPRIEND IT OUT, BUT THE THING IS I WASN'T ABLE TO DO THAT ON THE GOLF COURSE. SO I APPLIED MY SAME INTENSITY IN MY CRAFT, MY FOCUS TO CALL OF DUTY. ( LAUGHTER ) DON'T LAUGH. ( APPLAUSE ) LY SPEND EIGHT -- I WILL SPEND EIGHT HOURS A DAY, GET A 30 MINUTE LUNCH BREAK, BE IN MY RECLINING GRANDPA CHAIR PLAYING. I THOUGHT I WAS GOOD BECAUSE I GOT THROUGH THE CAMPAIGNS, NO BIG DEAL, AND WENT ONLINE. WHEN 7-YEAR-OLDS ARE BEATING YOU FROM AROUND THE WORLD, HUMBLING.
Stephen: TIME TO STOP. BY THE WAY, I LIKE THE BEARD.
TALK ABOUT THREE -- TOOK ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MONTHS TO GROW.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU LOOK LIKE TIGER WOODS' EVIL TWIN RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN PSYCH OUT YOUR OPPONENT WITH THAT.
I'M HALF ASIAN, SO IT DOESN'T QUITE FILL IN THROUGH HERE. BUT I CAN GET THIS THING GOING.
Stephen: OKAY. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
GET A LITTLE TWIRL TO IT, YEAH.
Stephen: I HAVE TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION ABOUT YOUR EX-WIFE. YOU TOLD "TIME MAGAZINE," LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, THAT SHE IS ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? KEEPING YOUR EX-WIFE YOUR BEST FRIEND, GIVEN HOW THAT ENDED, MY TREND --
RIGHT.
Stephen: -- THAT'S MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN BEING 11 TIME PGA PLAYER OF THE YEAR. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ♪
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD, HOW DID YOU GUYS WORK IT OUT?
YOU KNOW, IT BECOMES TWO SIMPLE THINGS, OKAY, IS THAT WE HAVE SAM AND WE HAVE CHARLIE, AND WE LOVE THEM SO MUCH, WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE THAT WORK. ( APPLAUSE ) >THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED, AND SHE'S BEEN ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS. I'VE TALKED TO HER ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND SHE DOES A DOES SAME THING WITH ME, WE GO BACK AND FORTH. WE COMMUNICATE SO MUCH BETTER NOW, IT'S INCREDIBLE. I WISH WE HAD DONE THAT EARLIER ON, BUT IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO HAVE A BEST FRIEND LIKE THAT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FOUNDATION. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LILT BREAK BUT BACK WITH MORE TIGER WOODS. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WE'RE BACK WITH TIGER  WOODS. TIGER, YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREAT GOLFERS OF ALL TIME BUT ALSO A GREAT POPULARIZER OF GOLF. ANOTHER MAN WHO IS KNOWN FOR THAT IS, OF COURSE, ARNOLD PALMER. HERE'S A PHOTO OF YOU AND ARNOLD TOGETHER ( APPLAUSE ) ARNOLD PALMER JUST PASSED AWAY. WAS HE AN IMPORTANT FIGURE FOR YOU? DID YOU LEARN MUCH FROM HIM?
HE WAS ONE OF MY HEROS. WE BECAME GREAT FRIENDS. GOT A CHANCE TO WIN HIS GOLF TOURNAMENT A FEW TIMES. AS I COME OFF THE GREEN, HAVE HIM GIVE ME A GREAT BEAR HUG IS SOMETHING THAT WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIAL TO SEE THAT PHOTO ON THE GREEN OF US CHITCHATTING. WE WERE ALWAYS NEEDING EACH OTHER PRETTY HARD, WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU WERE AN AMATEUR, HE ACTUALLY TOOK YOU TO LUNCH ONCE.
WHEN I WAS AT STANFORD HE INVITED ME TO COME TO THE SILVERADO WHICH IS WHERE THE SAFEWAY WAS TO HAVE DINNER. I GO AND I PICK HIS BRAIN A LITTLE AND I LEAVE. MY COACH FINDS OUT, SAYS DID YOU PICK UP THE TAB IF IT'S ARNOLD PALMER. I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT. IT'S ARNOLD PALMER. SO HE SAYS, WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. SO HE CALLS NC TWO As, THREE DEEM ME INELIGIBLE. I HAD TO WRITE A CHECK TO ARNOLD PALMER FOR $25. I WAS AT EL PASO FOR THE ALL AMERICAN. HE HAD TO CASH THE CHECK, SEND IN A COPY AND I WAS ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN THE ALL AMERICAN.
Stephen: WOW. IT'S NOT THAT STRICT ANYMORE, RIGHT SNMPLEGHT IT CHANGED A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: 20th ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIGER WOODS FOUNDATION.
YES.
Stephen: HOW HAS IT GROWN SNOW.
THE EMPHASIS WAS TO GET MORE PARTICIPATION IN GOLF. WE DID THAT WITH JUNIOR GOLF CLINICS AROUND THE COUNTRY. WHEN 9/11 HAPPENED AND I DROVE HOME ON THE 13th FROM ST. LOUIS, IF I DIED IF THAT TRAGIC DAY, WHAT WOULD THE FOUNDATION LOOK LIKE? WELL, WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BRICKS AND MORTARS, NOTHING TANGIBLE, IT WAS JUST A TRAVELING CIRCUS OF JUNIOR GOLF CLINICS. I WENT TO MY DAD AND SAID WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS. HE SAID WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? I SAID WE NEED TO CREATE SOMETHING TANGIBLE, SOMETHING KIDS CAN CALL THEIR OWN. A WEEK LATER, I SAID WHY DON'T WE COME UP WITH A LEARNING CENTER. I SAID OKAY. I GAVE MY DAD THE DIRECTIVE. HE COMES BACK TEN DAYS LATER AND SAYS WHY DON'T WE CREATE A LEARNING CENTER WHERE I PLAYED HIGH SCHOOL GOLF AT AND WE CREATE A LEARNING CENTER OF 50,000 SQUARE FEET, AND MY DAD GOT A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY SEE IT, BE A PART OF IT AND FEEL IT WHILE THERE WERE KIDS IN IT -- WELL, KIDS WITH RESPECT IN IT AND THEN IN IT. I WAS WHEELCHAIRING THEM AROUND. HE PASSES ABOUT A YEAR LATER. THEN I, ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, I BRING MY SON CHARLIE TO IT. SO TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF FAMILY ATMOSPHERE, TO HAVE MY DAD THERE AND NOW MY SON THERE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: I KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER WAS AN ENORMOUS MENTOR AND INFLUENCE FOR YOU AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN FATHERS PASS, WE LOSE THEIR VOICE. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO RE-CREATE THAT VOICE INTERIMLY FOR YOURSELF TO HAVE THAT GUIDANCE EVEN THOUGH HE'S GONE?
I DO. HE SAYS GET OUT OF IT WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT. IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU GET RESULTS. IF YOU DON'T, YOU WON'T GET THEM, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU DON'T DESERVE IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T EARN IT. THAT'S WHY I PRACTICE SO HARD. EACH AND EVERY DAY, I THINK ABOUT MY OLD MAN. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF GOLFING WITH QUITE A FEW PRESIDENTS. CAN I DO RAPID FIRE HERE? I'LL NAME PRESIDENTS YOU PLAYED WITH AND YOU GIVE ME YOUR IMPRESSION AS A GOLFER. GEORGE H.W. BUSH.
FAST.
Stephen: FAST? FAST GOLFER? GOOD GOLFER.
YES, WE PLAY IN ABOUT UNDER TWO HOURS.
Stephen: CLINTON? LOTS OF CUTS.
Stephen: LOT OF CUTS AT THE BALL OR CUTTING CORNERS? ( LAUGHTER )
CUTS.
Stephen: CUTS. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET YOU A LAWYER PRESENT BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT AGAIN. W.W. BUSH?
NO.
Stephen: OBAMA? TRAIGHT.
Stephen: STRAIGHT? VERY COMPETITIVE, RIGHT?
EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE, HITS IT STRAIGHT.
Stephen: HARD, LONG? HARD, HIT IT CROOKED, NOT LONGISH.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT TRUMP? YOU SAID PRESIDENTS.
Stephen: THE TIGER WOODS FOUNDATION CELEBRATING ITS 20th ANNIVERSARY! BACK, EVERYBODY WITH ELIJAH WOOD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY, FOLKS! WELCOME BACK! WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S BROADCAST NOT LIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) MY NEXT GUEST IS A GREAT ACTOR, WHO'S BEEN IN SOME OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. PLEASE WELCOME ELIJAH WOOD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
WHAT A BAND!
Stephen: AMAZING, AREN'T THEY?
YOU'RE FROM NEW ORLEANS, AREN'T YOU?
THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS THERE TWO WEEKS AGO.
Stephen: YOU GUYS JUST CHAT. FINE WITH ME. LIKE A VACATION. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE IN "DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY," A GREAT BOOK BY DOUGLAS ADAMS WHO DID HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY ON HBO AMERICA.
YES.
Stephen: YOU CAME BACK FROM FANTASTIC FEST.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT? A GENRE FILM FESTIVAL THAT HAPPENS IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.
Stephen: MEANING. ANYTHING FROM HORROR FILMS, SCI-FI, ACTION FILMS. THIS YEAR I THINK THE SPOTLIGHT WAS ON INDIAN CINEMAS. THEY HAD A LOT OF HOLLYWOOD FILMS THERE SO ANYTHING ENCAPSULATED BY GENRE.
Stephen: CAN YOU WALK AROUND THAT OR DO YOU GET MOBBED BY EVERYBODY BECAUSE THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLES. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE NOT ONLY A FAN OF IT BUT YOU'RE ALSO A DARLING. YOU'RE IN THESE MOVIES.
THIS IS TRUE. IT HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THESE FAST VALSE THAT DOESN'T SEPARATE THE FAN FROM THE FILMMAKERS AND THE ACTORS IN THEM AND THERE IS A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THAT. EVERYBODY INTERMENG ALSO AND THEY'RE ALL THERE FOR THE SAME REASON, WHICH IS TO WATCH THE MOVIES AND CELEBRATE CINEMA.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE GIVE OUT FREE TATTOOS THERE?
YES, FOUR YEARS AGO THEY STARTED GIVING OUT FREE TATTOOS AT THE CLOSING NIGHT PARTY. I MISSED THAT YEAR BUT EVERY YEAR, CONSEQUENTLY, I'VE GOTTEN THE TATTOO.
Stephen: YOU GET THE FREETA TOO.
I HAVE A TATTOO BAND AROUND MY ARM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE?
Stephen: SURE. THANK YOU, SIR. >
Stephen: WOW.  OH, THANK YOU. SO THAT'S FOUR YEARS AGO. UH GOT A FIRE CRACK, A RAY GUN, RUBBER CHICKEN, AND THAT'S A KIJU. CAN WE SEE THAT CLEARLY?
Stephen: CAN YOU MAKE THE KIJU DANCE?
A LITTLE FLEX TO HAV OF THE M
Stephen: LOOK AT THE GUNS ON ELIJAH WOOD, MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO, SIR.
THANK YOU SO, YEAH, I HAVE --
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S VERY BRAVE OF YOU TO GO FOR THE FREE TATTOO, BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR "FREE TATTOO" I THINK "HEPATITIS." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU ALSO DEEJAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU DO IT, LIKE, PROFESSIONALLY?
YEAH, I MEAN, SEMIPROFESSIONALLY. IT'S A HOBBY. I MEAN, I PLAY IN MUSIC VENUES. IN NOVEMBER I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO EUROPE WITH MY FRIEND ZACH.
Stephen: YOU ARE WOODEN WISDOM.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOUR DEEJAY -- DO YOU HAVE DEEJAY MOVES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? ARE YOU ONE OF THESE GUYS? OR YOU HIT THE iPod AND SIT BACK?
IT'S ALL FINAL, SO ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND GO WRONG.
Stephen: DANCE? YEAH. PUT ON A SONG AND CROSS IT OVER AND THEN WE'LL DANCE. SINCE THERE IS TWO OF US, IT GIVES US MORE LICENSE. IF I WAS JUST STANDING BEHIND THE THING BY MYSELF, IT WOULD FEEL WEIRD TO DANCE. BUT SINCE THERE ARE TWO OF US, WE HAVE THAT INTERPLAY. SO IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
Stephen: NO DOUBT. EEING AN AUDIENCE RESPONDING TO WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING. I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
Stephen: VERY SIMILAR. YOU GET A RESPONSE.
Stephen: I'M A JOKE DEEJAY. SO THE SHOW IS CALLED "DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY."
CORRECT.
Stephen: AGAIN, WRITTEN BY DOUGLAS ADAMS WHO DID HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE. AND YOU PLAY A ROCK GUY, RIGHT? WHO'S YOUR CHARACTER?
HIS NAME IS TODD BRATSMAN. HE USED TO HAVE A PUNK BAND CALLED MEXICAN FUNERAL. HE PLAYS GUITAR.
Stephen: AND DIRK WANTS YOUR HELP TO SOLVE --
SO DIRK GENTLY, IF ANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR, DIRK IS A DETECTIVE BUT HE'S NOT A DETECTIVE THAT USES ANYTHING TRADITIONAL IN REGARDS TO HOW DETECTIVES SOLVE CASES. SO HE DOESN'T LOOK FOR CLUES, NO FINGERPRINT EVIDENCE, NO WITNESSES. IT'S ALL INTUITION AND A FEELING THAT HE WILL BE LED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HE COMES INTO TODD'S LIFE BY BREAKING INTO HIS APARTMENT AND SAYING TODD IS HIS ASSISTANT, NEVER HAVING MET HIM. HE ULTIMATELY GETS THRUST INTO THIS SERIOUSLY MAD CASE.
Stephen: YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO BRING A CLIP. JIM.
HI! WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? LIVE HERE. RIGHT, BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING? DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU LOST YOUR JOB.
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT ACTUALLY.
I'M ON A DETECTIVE. A CASE. YOU WORKED AT THE HOTEL WHERE THE MURDERS TOOK PLACE. IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS FOR PEOPLE WHO STILL WATCH IT, OLD PEOPLE MANED OCCASIONALLY.
WAS I ON TV? OULD BIT BAD FOR YOU IF YOU WERE.
MAYBE IT ISN'T. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. MAYBE I'M A CAB DRIVER. YOU SAID YOU WERE ON A CASE. MAYBE I HAVE TWO JOBS. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S A PART OF A MYSTERY. HE'S NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT HE'S DOING.
NOT AT ALL.
Stephen: THE MODEL OF THE BOOK IS EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED? DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?
I DO. BUT I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN GO ABOUT BELIEVING THAT. THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THE NOTION OF FATE. I THINK I BELIEVE IN FATE WITH WILL POWER, WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR OWN LIFE.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT FATE THEN. BECAUSE WILL, LIKE WILL TO POWER, WILL IN THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT THAN FATE.
IT ERADICATES FATE.
Stephen: YEAH. I BELIEVE THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON. I BELIEVE WE MEET PEOPLE WE'RE MEANT TO MEET. TO A CERTAIN DEGREE I FEEL A SENSE OF A PATH BUT ALSO AGREE IN FREE WILL.
Stephen: I TOTALLY BELIEVE THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON. AS A MATTER OF FACT, TWO YEARS AGO, AT THE CLOSING PARTY FOR THE COLBERT REPORT, I ACTUALLY SAID TO ONE OF MY PRODUCERS WHO'S A BIG FAN OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS, I SAID TO HIM AT THE PARTY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE WITH ME, MATT, HERE AT THE END OF ALL THINGS.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND I TURNED AROUND AND YOU WERE RIGHT THERE! ( LAUGHTER ) THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON!
THEY DO INDEED!

Stephen: DON'T SAY BAD HOMBRE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. PEOPLE WERE SURPRISE HEAD SAID BAD HOMBRE. IS THAT BAD TO SAY?
IT'S A STEREOTYPE.
Stephen: JUST MEANS BAD MAN.
THE COMMUNITY IS FULL OF BUENOS HOMBRES, NOT BAD HOMBRES. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE HAVE A LOCAL HOMBRE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YOU SAID IT.
Stephen: YOU CAN SAY STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A JOURNALIST.
BUT I CAN CONFRONT TRUMP.
Stephen: YOU DID CONFRONT TRUMP AUGUST 15 LAST YEAR. YOU GOT TOSSED OUT OF A PRESS CONFERENCE. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT DID YOU DO?
I SENT HIM A HALF-WRITTEN NOTE WITH MY CELL PHONE NUMBER ASKING FOR AN INTERVIEW, THEN I LEARNED MY FIRST LESSON WHICH IS YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER GIVE YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER TO DONALD TRUMP.
Stephen: DID HE ANNOUNCE IT?
HE PUBLISHED IT ON THE INTERNET. SO I SAID, OKAY, MR. TRUMP, GIVE ME A MOMENT. SO TWO MONTHS LATER HE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND WE HAD ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO ASK HIM. HE WANTS TO DEPORT 11 MILLION. I RAISED MY HAND, I ASKED A QUESTION, HE DIDN'T LIKE IT. HE MOVED HIS MOUTH IN A STRANGE WAY -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YES. HE CALLED HIS BODY GUARD AND EJECTED ME FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE. THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING A QUESTION WITH A BODY GUARD WAS FIDEL CASTRO A FEW YEARS BEFORE.
Stephen: DO YOU SEE ANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM?
CAN YES, OF COURSE. WELL, THEY DON'T LIKE THE PRESS.
Stephen: YEAH. THEY USE A BODY GUARD TO THROW YOU OUT OF PLACES.
Stephen: ANY RELIEF, LIKE, I GOT TO LEAVE THE PRESS CONFERENCE?
NO BECAUSE AFTER THAT HE REALIZED HE MADE A MISTAKE AND ALLOWED ME TO GO BACK. HE WIE HAD A BACK AND FORTH ON WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. HE WANTS TO DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE. THAT'S A HORROR. CAN YOU IMAGINE? THAT'S DEPORTING 11 MILLION IN TWO YEARS. THAT'S DEPORTING 15,000 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY, FILLING UP 30 747s IN 24 HOURS. HE COULD START A NEW AIRLINE WITH THAT.
Stephen: HE STARTED THAT. TRUMP AIRLINES, WE'LL SEND YOU BACK. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS AN ANOMALY WITH WHAT MANY ARE CALLING RACIST LANGUAGE OR DO YOU THINK HE'S EXPRESSING SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING.
I THINK IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW BUT HE HAS ALLOWED WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS AND NEO-NAZIS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS AND PREJUDICES THAT BEFORE THEY WERE ONLY SAYING TO THEMSELVES IN THEIR PARTIES OR IN THEIR BEDROOMS. NOW IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.
Stephen: YOUR NEW DOCUMENTARY IS CALLED "HATE RISING," AND WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF YOU TALKING TO I BELIEVE A MEMBER OF THE KLAN.
IMPERIAL WIZARD, YEAH.
Stephen: JIM. WHITE IS SO MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER RACE.
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? BASED ON WHAT?
I JUST SAID IT. THAT'S HOW I CAN SAY IT.
BASED ON WHAT? GOD. WE'RE GOD'S PEOPLE.
ISN'T THAT RACISM? THAT'S NOT RACISM. THAT'S FACT.
Stephen: WHERE DOES ONE GO TO FIND THE KLAN?
JUST AN HOUR AWAY FROM DALLAS-FORT WORTH. THIS ROWDY --
Stephen: THAT'S HIS NAME? WELL, NOT HIS REAL NAME, BUT ROWDY -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH ME. HE TOLD ME, AS YOU SAW THAT, JUST BECAUSE HE'S WHITE AND I'M LATINO THAT HE WAS SUPERIOR TO ME.
Stephen: YOU'RE WHITER THAN HE IS. ( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T THINK HE'S --
Stephen: HE DOESN'T ACCEPT THAT?
NO.
Stephen: YOU MAKE ANDERSON COOPER LOOK SUNTANNED ( LAUGHTER )
TALKING ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS, I ALSO WENT TO OHIO AND THERE WERE ABOUT 30 NEO-NAZIS AND THEY WERE BURNING A SWASTIKA. I COULDN'T TALK FOR THREE HOURS. THE PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR, THEY DIDN'T LET ME TALK FOR THREE HOURS.
Stephen: WHY WOULDN'T THE PRODUCER LET YOU TALK?
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SAFE. FIRST OF ALL, YOU DON'T MAKE SMALL TALK WITH WHITE PRESENTLY CYSTS. YOU DON'T HAVE THEM WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.
Stephen: I THINK WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) EXACTLY.
AND THEN I HAVE AN ACCENT. EVERY TIME I CALL AN 800 NUMBER, I GET TRANSFERRED TO THE WRONG EXTENSION OR DISCONNECTED.
Stephen: YES. YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH ONE FOR ENGLISH, YOU KNOW THAT.
RIGHT. SO IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR ME TO BE THERE AND FOR THEM TO NOTICE THAT I HAVE AN ACCENT. SO I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER WORLD.
Stephen: STAY SAFE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: JORGE RAMOS. "HATE RISING" AIRS THIS SUNDAY, OCTOBER 23 ON FUSION AND UNIVISION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
THANKS, MAN! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE MATT LEBLANC, AND MUSICAL GUEST, WYCLEF JEAN. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, CHER AND GAL GADOT. GOOD NIGHT!      Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captio ned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
