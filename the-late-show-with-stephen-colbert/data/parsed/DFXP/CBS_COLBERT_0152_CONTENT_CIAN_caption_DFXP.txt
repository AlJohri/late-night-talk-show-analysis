Stephen: HEY! HEY! THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, JON. THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU UP THERE. THANK YOU DOWN THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW" "EVERYBODY. HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY, EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. DID YOU WATCH THE SHOW LAST NIGHT? I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT FROM THE THE FETAL POSITION DOWN THERE, DONALD TRUMP HIT THE MAGIC NUMBER OF DELEGATES REQUIRED TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. AND TO CELEBRATE, TRUMP REALLY LET HIS HAIR DOWN FROM THE COMPLEX SERIES OF CLAMPS THAT SECURE IT TO THE DONOR SKULL BECAUSE YESTERDAY HE INSTAGRAMMED THIS PHOTO OF HIMSELF EATING McDONALD'S AND THE CAPTION,"CELEBRATING 1,237," WHICH IS EITHER THE NUMBER OF DELEGATES OR THE NUMBER OF CALORIES HE CONSUMED. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOW OFFICIALLY TURNED INTO WHAT EVERY TEENAGER IMAGINES BEING A BILLIONAIRE IS LIKE. "OH, I'M TOTALLY GOING TO GET A PRIVATE JET AND EAT McDONALD'S ON IT AND I'M GOING TO BUILD A TOWER OUT OF GOLD, AND I'M GOING TO BUY A BEAUTY PAGEANT SO MUSS UNIVERSE HAS TO KISS ME. MODELS. AND IF THAT GETS BORING, I'LL JUST BECOME PRESIDENT. THAT WILL BE SO ( BLEEP ) COOL. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? THAT'S MY LIFE. HEY, YOU GUYS INTO UPLIFTING STORIES? MAYBE WE'LL HAVE ONE OF THOSE LATER, NOT NOW. THIS ISN'T IT. THIS WEEK, IN THAILAND, A MAN WAS BITTEN ON THE PENIS BY A TEN-FOOT PYTHON IN HIS TOILET. BY THE WAY, A PYTHON BITING YOUR PENIS IS KNOWN AS A NUMBER FIVE IN A BANGKOK SEX CLUB. ( LAUGHTER ) OBVIOUSLY, I WOULD LIKE TO HELP KEEP THE REST OF THE WORLD'S MEN SAFE FROM SNAKE-ON ON-PENIS VIOLENCE. DO WHAT I DO. WHEN I TRAVEL, I ALWAYS TRAVEL WITH A TOILET MONGOOG GOOS. I RELEASE HIM INTO THE BATHROOM. THE DANGER, OF COURSE, IS LATER HE'LL THINK YOUR PENIS IS A SNAKE AND ATTACK YOU. IT'S REALLY A COMPLEMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT REALLY IS. IT'S A COMPLEMENT. OF COURSE, IT'S NOT JUST PENIS SNAKEBITE SEASON. IT'S ALSO GRADUATION SEASON, AND THIS YEAR THERE'S ONE HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR NAMED MIKE SENATORE, WHOSE TALENT SHOW PERFORMANCE IS CURRENTLY OWNING THE INTERNET. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: wHAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! IT'S AMAZING! IT'S LIKE DANCE MIXED WITH POETRY MIXED WITH WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE STONED AND BORED AT YOUR MALL JOB. AND I HAVE TO TRY THIS KID'S TRICK. I'M GOING TO TRY IT RIGHT NOW. LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. IS THIS A GOOD SPOT FOR IT? IS THIS A GOOD SPOT FOR IT? JON, COULD I HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC, PLEASE. ( 300 VIOLIN ORCHESTRA BY JORGE QUINTERO ) YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST HAVE HIM DO IT. MIKE SENATORE, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. COME ON OUT HERE, MIKE. ALL RIGHT, MIKE, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON ABSOLUTELY JUST BURNING UP THE INTER-WEBS. HOW MUCH TIME WENT INTO YOU LEARNING TO DO THAT FOR THE TALENT SHOW?
MAYBE TWO HOURS THE NIGHT BEFORE.
Stephen: HOW LONG DID YOU STUDY FOR YOUR FINAL?
NOT ENOUGH.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN FOR THE GOOD PEOPLE HERE?
I THINK SO.
Stephen: AND IF HE DOES IT, WE'RE GOING TO GO NUTS, RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MIKE, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. LET'S MAKE HISTORY.  ( CHEERS ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) > MIKE SENATORE, EVERYBODY. CONGRATULATIONS! NOW SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE, UNBELIEVABLE. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. OH! I WAS TALKING OVER THERE EARLIER ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. AND I HOPE YOU'RE ALL HERE FOR AN INTERVENTION. RIGHT NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT CAN STOP TRUMP: WOMEN. NO PRESSURE, LADIES. CNN/O.R.C./DAIRY QUEEN POLL FOUND THAT TRUMP IS VIEWED UNFAVORABLY BY 73% OF REGISTERED FEMALE VOTERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW, WOW. NICE, NICE. YEAH. CLEARLY, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT LEARNED HOW TO PANDER TO WOMEN. LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT LADIES HERE TONIGHT, RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S NOT HARD. AND NOW THAT HE'S HEADED TO THE GENERAL ELECTION, TRUMP IS RATCHETING UP HIS ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED. SHE'S HIS LIKELY OPPONENT IN NOVEMBER, AND THEY DISAGREE ON ALL SORTS OF SUBSTANTIVE POLICY ISSUES, SO HE'S SAYING SHE TALKS FUNNY.
I WILL NEVER SAY THIS, BUT SHE SCREAMS. IT DRIVES ME CRAZY, I DIDN'T SAY IT. I CAN'T LISTEN. SHE GOES, "AND DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRIBLE PERSON!"
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD HILLARY. THOUGH SHOUTING, "DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRIBLE PERSON" IS A PRETTY GOOD IMPRESSION OF JUST ABOUT ANY WOMAN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP HAS TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE TRUMP HAS GOTTEN A REPUTATION FOR, SHALL WE SAY, QUESTIONABLE ATTACKS AGAINST WOMEN, LIKE WHEN HE SAID MEGYN KELLY HAD "BLOOD COMING OUT OF HER WHEREVER." OR THESE COMMENTS AFTER HILLARY CLINTON TOOK A BATHROOM BREAK DURING A DEBATE.
I KNOW WHERE SHE WENT. IT'S DISGUSTING. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S TOO DISGUSTING. ( IN TRUMP VOICE )
Stephen: I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY DO IN THERE. I'VE SEEN THE COMMERCIALS. THEY POUR BLUE LIQUID ONTO A COTTON SPONGE. IT'S DISGUSTING. FRANKLY, HIS ATTACKS ON HILLARY CLINTON HAVE JUST GOTTEN CHILDISH. HERE TO EXPLAIN THIS CAMPAIGN STRATEGY IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S SENIOR JUNIOR STRATEGIST, TIMMY JENKINS. TIMMY, COME ON OUT. HAVE A SEAT HERE. TIMMY, ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, HOW HAVE YOU GONE BN?
I'VE BEEN GREAT. YOU'RE THE GENIUS BEHIND ALL THE NICKNAMES TRUMP USES.
THAT'S RIGHT. I CAME UP WITH "CROOKED HILLARY," AND IT'S FOLLOWING HER AROUND LIKE BERNIE SANDERS. I MEAN, "BUTTFACE BERNIE." UP TOP?
Stephen: I DON'T THINK SO. AND I UNDERSTAND NOW YOU'RE THE HEAD OF FEMALE OUTREACH.
I'M TRUMP'S GO-TO FEMALE INSULT STRATEGIST. I WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD HIM TO TALK ABOUT CARLY FIORINA'S FACE AND WHAT BOOBS REALLY DO. I DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: NO, NO, NO, IT'S AN UGLY BUSINESS. OKAY, WELL, TIMMY, WHAT ARE YOUR QUALIFICATIONS FOR THIS JOB? FOR MYSELF LAST SUMMER WHEN I SNAPPED THE BACK OF NICOLE DiSTEPHANO'S BRA. SHE CRIED. HILARIOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I ALSO HAVE PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH MY OLDER SISTER, HANNAH. SHE'S ALWAYS IN THE BATHROOM. WHY? STOP HOGGING THE BATHROOM, HANNAH! YOU CAN'T WASH UGLY OFF YOUR FACE.
Stephen: HANNAH, HANNAH, YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. TIMMY, DO YOU REALLY THINK THESE ATTACKS ON WOMEN ARE A WINNING STRATEGY?
ABSOLUTELY! WE SPENT MONTHS FOCUS-GROUPING TRUMP'S CORE DEMOGRAPHIC, AND THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR: "BOYS RULE, GIRLS DROOL." THAT'S WHY, ON DAY ONE OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WE'RE HANG THIS ON THE FRONT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: TIMMY, MOCKING SOMEONE'S VOICE IS ONE THING, BUT THIS IS JUST DISCRIMINATION. ( MOCKING )
"THIS IS JUST DISCRIMINATION."
Stephen: I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. ( MOCKING )
"I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT." WRD YOU LEARN TO SPEAK LIKE, THIS YOUR MOMMY?
Stephen: YOU SHUT UP. ( MOCKING )
"YOU SHUT UP!"
Stephen: LISTEN, YOU CAN'T TURN THE WHITE HOUSE INTO A BOYS-ONLY CLUB.
YOU'RE RIGHT, STEPHEN. BUT THERE'S AN EVEN COOLER CLUB, AND I WANT YOU TO JOIN IT.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT'S THE CLUB?
ONLY SUPER-AWESOME PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED IN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO JOIN IS WRITE THE NAME OF THE CLUB ON YOUR HAND.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY THAT. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE CLUB.
IT'S THE PEN 15 CLUB.
Stephen: 15.
15, YEAH, 1-5. NOW, SHOW EVERYBODY.
HA-HA! YOU DUMMY. YOU JUST WROTE "PENIS" ON YOUR HAND!
Stephen: YOU JERK!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, FART-FACES.
TIMMY JENKINS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH RASHIDA JONES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, NOT ONLY IS THIS MEMORIAL DAY BUT IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW IT IS FLEET WEEK AND WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE MEMBERS OF THE SERVICE IN OUR AUDIENCE TONIGHT, MARINES AND SAILORS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YUP. PLEASE. THEY ARE WEARING WHITE. IF YOU ARE SITTING NEXT TO THEM DO NOT EAT CHOCOLATE FOR THE REST THE SHOW. NOW, FOLKS, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM "THE OFFICE" AND "PARKS AND RECREATION." SHE NOW STARS IN THE VERY FUNNY SHOW "ANGIE TRIBECA." PLEASE WELCOME RASHIDA JONES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HELLO!
Stephen: SO NICE TO HAVE YOU ON.
IT'S REALLY NICE TO BE HERE. I'M A FAN.
Stephen: LISTEN I-- I CANNOT ENJOY YOUR FATHER'S COMPANY MORE. YOUR FATHER IS QUINCY JONES.
YEAH, HE IS.
Stephen: AS PEOPLE OUT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW.
YEAH, HE'S THE BEST.
Stephen: I'VE INTERVIEWED HIM A FEW TIMES AND THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO HIM IN THAT CHAIR IT WAS 10 MINUTES OF ONE OF THE GREATEST STORIES I'VE EVER HEARD INYI LIFE. DID YOU GET TO SEE THE SHOW?
I SAW IT. YOU ASKED HIM A QUESTION AND HE TOLD YOU A STORY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ANSWER.
Stephen: I ASKED HIM, "HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN MUSIC?" AND 10 MINUTES LATER WE'RE IN SOME FACTORY IN THE 1930s IN CHICAGO WITH A GUY NAMED KNUCKLES AND MUGSY.
THE JONES BOYS.
Stephen: YOU GREW UP IN HOLLYWOOD, HE GREW UP IN KIND OF STREET CHICAGO IN 1930s. WHAT IS THAT LIKE HAVING A DAG LIKE THAT? DOES HE GROUND YOU?
YEAH, I MEAN, HE IS THE GREATEST PERSON, THE MOST POSITIVE PERSON OF ALL TIME. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE GREW UP BEING VERY AWARE OF WHAT HE WENT THROUGH AND WHAT HE WENT THROUGH TO-- FOR US TO HAVE WHAT WE HAVE. SO, YEAH, THERE'S NEVER-- YOU KNOW, WE WEREN'T SPOILED. HE WAS ALWAYS VERY, VERY CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, "I BROUGHT YOU IN THIS WORLD. I'LL TAKE YOU OUT." NO, HE WASN'T STRICT. HE'S A REALIST.
Stephen: NOT STRICT AT ALL, REALLY?
HE WAS STRICT IN THE SENSE, THEY DIDN'T OVERLY SPOIL US. "HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT. I WORKED HARD SO YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT." IT WAS, "I WORKED HARD SO YOU CAN WORK HARD."
Stephen: YOU DO WORK HARD. YOU DEDICATED YOURSELF, EVEN AS A STUDENT, YOU WENT TO HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
DI?
AND YOU GOT TO BE THE CLASS DAY SPEAKER AT THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IS IT LIKE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER?
IT'S COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER FOR HARVARD COLLEGE SO NOT THE WHOLE UNIVERSITY BUT THE HARVARD UNDERGRADS. SO NOT THE TOP OF THE LINE. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. IT WAS GREAT. SORT OF, LIKE THE MORE ENTERTAINING SPEAKER, LIKE THE ONES THAT THE STUDENT PICK.
Stephen: I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS A FEW TIME. I'VE BEEN HONORED TO DO THIS AT A FEW COLLEGES. WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE? IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL THEM.
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR OVER LIFE AND WHAT'S IN IMPORTANT.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU-- YOU WENT TO HARVARD. WHAT DID YOU TELL THESE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF HARVARD?
I TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE IDIOT S.
Stephen:  REALLY?
I DID. IT WAS HALF A JOKE. BUT, ONE, I TOLD THEM --
HALF A JOKE?
WELL, THEY'RE, OBVIOUSLY, SMART. THEY WENT TO HARVARD. BUT, ONE, THEY'RE THOUGHT UNDERDOGS, BECAUSE THEY WENT TO HARVARD. THEY'RE OVER-DOGS, AND NOW NOBODY WILL BE ROOTING FOR THEIR SUCCESS SO THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN SUCCESS. AND OTHER REASON I SAID THEY WERE IDIOTS IS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GO TO SANFORD BECAUSE THE WEATHER IS BETTER AND THEY COULD DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND MAKE AN APP.
Stephen: THAT SEEMS TO BE THE SUCCESS AT HARVARD, GUTO HARVARD--
YOU DROP OUT.
Stephen: BILL GATE.
BILL GATES, MARK ZUCKERBERG, MATT DAMON. YOU GUYS BLEW IT BECAUSE YOU GRADUATED. INSPIRING. INSPIRING STUFF.
Stephen: HOW DID THEY RECEIVE THAT?
THEY WERE A LITTLE SHOCKED. IT WAS IN A JOCULAR TONE.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU STUDY?
I STUDIED THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELIGION.
Stephen: AND HAS THAT HELPED?
NO! ( LAUGHTER ) NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.
Stephen: YOU'RE A COMEDIAN. WHAT RELIGIONS DID YOU LIKE TO COMPARE MOST? I'M INTERESTED IN THAT.
I STUDIED MAINLY HINDUISM.
Stephen: REALLY?
AND TANTRA, WHICH ARE VERSIONS OF HINDUISM.
Stephen: SURE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.  OF COURSE, I KNEW THAT.
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE IS REALLY ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING SO YOU CEEND OF APPLY THAT TO WHATEVER YOU'RE STUDYING.
Stephen: I CAN'T IMAGINE THE CRITICAL THINKING YOU'RE APPLYING TO THE NEW PROJECT BECAUSE "ANGIE TRIBECA" IS-- AND I MEAN THISAISE COMPLIMENT-- IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: AND THE STUPID MIND OF STEVE AND NANCY CARELL. AND PEOPLE KNOW WHO STEVE CARELL IS, AND NANCY WAS ON "S.N.L." SECOND CITY WHEN I WAS THERE.
YOU ARE BUDDIES, RIGHT.
Stephen: I THINK SHE'S FUNNIER THAN STEVE.
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT. THEY'RE BOTH MY BOSSES. THEY'RE BOTH REALLY FUNNY. SHE'S REALLY, REALLY FUN DISPLE WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF ONE OF THE STUPIDER SCENES I HAVE SEEN ON THE SHOW.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THIS IS FROM THE NEW SEASON AND THIS IS YOU IN A HOSPITAL BED. AND YOU'RE WAKING UP OUT OF A COMA. JIM.
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN OUT?
ABOUT NINE MONTHS.
DID SOMEONE LEAVE A BABY IN THE HALLWAY?
YEAH, SORRY, IT'S ME.
IS IT MINE?
IT'S OURS.
I NEED A MINUTE TO PROCESS THIS.
WHY DON'T I TAKE LITTLE ANGY DOWN TO THE CAFETERIA AND YOU GUYS TALK?
YOU NAMED HER ANGIE AFTER ME.
HIM? I NAMED HIM AFTER YOU.
YOU TAKE IT EASY, GIRL, ALL RIGHT?
HEY, WHERE'S HOFFMAN?
HE KNOT INTO THE EVIDENCE LOCKER ROOM, AND ATE SOME DRUG MONEY. HE'LL BE SUSPENDED UNTIL HE POOPS IT OUT. UNTIL THEN I'LL BE WORKING WITH DETECTIVE SMALL.
SMALL?
VERY.
HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT ELSE DID I MISS? NEXT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME YOU'RE SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.
GIRLS! TRIBECA! GET THE UNTIL HERE.
COMING, LIEUTENANT.
Stephen: YEAH, COMPARATIVE RELIGION! I SEE IT TOTALLY.
THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED MY HARVARD DEGREE FOR.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
YUP, YUP, THAT'S WHAT IT HAS ALL AMOUNTED TO. BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS CLEAR, BUT I HAD A BABY WHILE I WAS IN A COMA.
Stephen: NO, NO, IT'S CLEAR.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.
Stephen: IT MAKES SENSE.
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE PREGNANT.
NO, I WAS IN A COMA, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: SO IT'S FUNNY AND DISTURBING AT THE SAME TIME.
YEAH, IT IS.
Stephen: YOU SHOT THIS ON THE SAME LOT WHERE YOUR MOM, PEGGY LIPTON, SHOT "THE MOD SQUAD." HOW DID THAT FEEL?
IT'S SO CRAZY. SHE CAME TO VISIT ME AND WE WENT TO THE SOUND STAGE WHERE SHE SHOT IT, AND SHE SHOT THERE 48 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: I WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE WHO DON'T REMEMBER. THIS IS WHAT "THE MOD SQUAD" WAS.
YEAH!
AND THAT WAS-- ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THIS IS MIKE, THIS IS MIKE, THIS IS YOUR MOM PLAYING JULIE. AND THIS IS CLARENCE WILLIAMS PLAYING LINK.
UH-HUH. THIS WAS A VERY PROGRESSIVE THING AT THE TIME YOU KNOW.
Stephen: YEAH.
THERE WAS A LOT OF-- THEY WERE HIPPIES AND THEY WERE UNDERCOVER COPS AND THEY WERE COOL.
Stephen: AND NOW YOU'RE PLAYING THE COP ON THE SAME LOT.
YEAH, IT'S JUST FULL CIRCLE, MAN, YEAH.
Stephen: AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNED. YOU IS THAT YOU DON'T MIND DROPPING THE "F" WORD, WHICH IS FEMINIST.
YEAH, NO, I DON'T MIND.
Stephen: THAT HAS BECOME, IN SOME CIRCLES, A FEMINIST HAS BECOME A BAD WORD. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
I THINK PEOPLE EQUATE IT WITH BEING A MAN HATER, WHICH IT'S NOT WHAT. IT'S JUST-- IT'S JUST ABOUT GENDER EQUALITY, AND I THINK THE WORD EXISTS, AND UNTIL WE HAVE ACTUAL EQUALITY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN, IT'S GOING TO EXIST.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IN THESE INTERVIEWS-- ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IN THESE INTERVIEWS THEMSELVES--
AND BE PROUD TO BE A FEMINIST.
Stephen: YEAH, I'M A FEMINIST.
YOU'RE A FEMINIST.
Stephen: I'VE BEEN INFORPED THAT I'M A FEMINIST AND I ACCEPT THAT.
GREAT, YOU SHOULD.
Stephen: THAT IDENTITY.
YOU SHOULD, THAT'S GREAT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO TO BE A FEMINIST?
Stephen: NO, I HAVE NO IDEA. IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD BE DOING?
WELL, YOU JUST HAVE TO STAY EDUCATED AND STAY SENSITIVE.
Stephen: IS THERE A CLUB I HAVE TO JOIN? BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY PUT PENIS ON MY HAND.
THAT'S NOT IN THE CLUB.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT IN THE CLUB. NO, YOU CAN.
Stephen: I CAN DO THAT? I CAN GET IN? WILL YOU GIVE ME A PASS TO GET IN.
YEAH, SURE. I THINK YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE GO THROUGH.
Stephen: WHEN DO YOU MEAN WHAT, DO WOMEN GO THROUGH?
A LOT OF THINGS. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF KIND OF INHERENT SEXISM, WHEN YOU'RE AN ACTRESS AND YOU'RE INTERVIEWED ON A RED CARPET OR ABOUT A MOVIE.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW, HAVE I CONDITION ANYTHING SEXIST?
YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD.
Stephen:
YOU'VE BEEN A FEMINIST.
Stephen: IMAGINE I'M THE GUEST AND YOU'RE THE HOST RIGHT NOW.
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS THEY WOULD BE ASKED.
Stephen: GREAT, THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT ONLY GET ASKED OF WOMEN.
YES.
Stephen: BUT I WILL ANSWER AS A MAN.
OKAY. "WHO ARE YOU WEARING?"
Stephen: ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S NO LABEL.
SEE, SEE! THAT'S SEXIST.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. WHOEVER IT IS, THEY'RE SMALLER THAN I AM.
RIGHT. OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR BEAUTY REGIMEN?
Stephen: WHAT'S MY BEAUTY REGIMEN?
HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR SKIN LOOKING THAT SOFT?
Stephen: I GET IN THE SHOWER AND I SHAVE WITH DIAL SOAP. IS THAT REET?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I MOISTURIZE WITH WHATEVER IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF BUFFALO WINGS.
BUFFALO SAUCE?
Stephen: BUFFALO SAUCE, SURE. BLEU CHEESE DRESSING SAY NATURAL MOISTURER.
THIS IS IMPORTANT, WITH THREE KIDS AT ALL, HOW DO YOU DO IT ALL? WOMEN WANT TO KNOW.
Stephen: AERKZ I DON'T.
THAT'S A FEMINIST ANSWER.
Stephen: REALLY.
THAT'S A FEMINIST ANSWER.
Stephen: I JUST DON'T DO IT. I DON'T DO ALMOST ANY OF IT.
AS A MAN IN COMDIERK HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET YOUR VOICE HEARD?
UH, UH, THEY GAVE ME A LATE NIGHT SHOW.
"GAVE "IS OPERATIVE.
Stephen: "GAVE" IS OPERATIVE. EXACTLY. I SHOWED UP AND THEY SAID, "HOW ABOUT YOU IN?
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TOO GOOD LOOKING TO BE A LATE NIGHT HOST?
Stephen: NO, I DON'T. I DON'T THINK I AM. I THINK I'M BARELY GOOD LOOKING ENOUGH TO BE A LATE NIGHT HOST.
YOU ANSWERED ALL THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
UNLIKE A WOMAN. THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER FOR A WOMAN. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
Stephen: I HAVE THE WORST QUESTION OF ALL, "IS IT HARD BEING A WOMAN IN COMEDY?"
YEAH-- OH, NO, WHAT, NO. IT'S HARD BEING A WOMAN FOR EVERY WOMAN.
Stephen: REALLY? IT'S HARD TO BE A MAN, TOO. REQUEST BE GET SUPER HEM 50 ON YOU. IT'S HARD BEING A MAN, TOO.
NO, IT'S NOT.
Stephen: NO, IT IS, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER. I CAN'T EVEN TELL WHAT SEX YOU ARE. THAT'S AS FEMINIST AS I CAN BE RIGHT NOW,. SO DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT SEX YOU ARE, THAT I DON'T CARE THAT YOU'RE A WOMAN. I CAN'T TELL THAT YOU'RE A WOMAN. THAT WOULD BE THE MOST FEMINIST THING I COULD DO.
OH, WOW, I SEE.
Stephen: IS THAT THE MOST FEMINIST THING I CAN DO?
IT IS, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET MORE SENSITIVE BEFORE YOU GET --
LESS SENSITIVE.
LET'S START THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S NUMBER SIX IN THE BANGKOK SEX CLUB. IS THAT SEXIST WHAT I DID, TALKING ABOUT THE BANG COX SEX CLUB?
IT GETS TRICK GLE DOES IT REALLY? THEN YOU GET INTO SEX WORKER EMPOWERMENT?
RIGHT, INTERSEXUAL FEMINISM, THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT. THAT'S WHEN YOU GET INTO SEX WORK AND CLASSISM AND RACISM, AND THE FACT THAT ALL TYPES OF OPPRESSION ARE INTERRELATED. SO YOU HAVE BE SENSITIVE TO ALL TYPES OF WOMEN. ASK.
Stephen: AND I WISH TO BE, BUT I WILL POINT OUT ONE WAY IN WHICH BEING A MAN IS HARDER THAN A WOMAN, OKAY? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PYTHON TO BITE A WOMAN'S PENIS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE!
Stephen: THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE SECOND SEASON OF "ANGIE TRIBECA"
Stephen: THE SECOND SEASON OF STARTS JUNE 6 ON TEEBS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH "HAMILTON'S" DAVEED DIGGS. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A TALENTED ACTOR WHO IS NOMINATED FOR A TONY AWARD FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN "HAMILTON." ♪ THERE IS NO MORE STATUS QUO PUT THE SUN COMES UP AND THE WORLD STILL SPINS ♪ I HAVE LAFAYETTE DRAFT A DECLARATION NEN I SAY I GOTTA GO ♪ GOT TO BE IN MONTICELLO NOW THE WORK AT HOME BEGINS ♪ SO WHAT DID I MISS WHAT DID I MISS ♪ VIRGINIA, MY HOME SWEET HOME, I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CIZ ♪
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME DAVEED DIGGS! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Stephen: HOW IS IT IT FEEL TO BE PART OF SOMETHING THAT HAS BECOME A CULTURAL MILESTONE?
I --
NO PRESSURE.
I KNOW, I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT PART OF IT. I JUST GO TO WORK EVERY DAY.
Stephen: YOU PLAY BOTH JEFFERSON AND LAFAYETTE.
YES.
Stephen: IN "HAMILTON," THE MUSICAL. AND THAT WAS JEFFERSON JUST THEN. WHAT I LOVE. THAT SONG, THE MOMENT WHEN YOU TURN AROUND AND SAY, "WHAT DID I MISS?" IS A HUGE LAUGH IN THE MUSICAL BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY WHILE HAMILTON AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN BACK HERE FIGHTING THE REVOLUTION.
THOMAS JEFFERSON MISSED EVERYTHING BEING A ROCK STAR IN FRANCE. HE WAS A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY SO HE WAS LITERALLY LIKE ROCK STAR LIFESTYLE, AND SHOWS BACK UP IN THE U.S. AND IS GIVEN THE THE JOB OF SECRETARY OF STATE JUST SIGHT UNSEEN. JUST SHOWS UP, "HERE, YOU'RE SECRETARY OF STATE, COOL." THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THOMAS JEFFERSON'S WHOLE LIFE.
Stephen: THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE. HE DID A LITTLE BIT OF WORK.
AND HAD A LOT OF LEISURE TIME AND INVENTED THINGS.
Stephen: EXACTLY. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE PLANTED ALL THOSE CROPS BY HIMSELF.
I KNOW.
Stephen: HOW DID HE HAVE ALL THAT LEISURE TIME?
HE WAS SO BUSY.
Stephen: AMAZING, AMAZING.
JUST PUSHING A PLOW.
Stephen: AND BOTH JEFFERSON AND LAFAYETTE, IS THERE ONE-- LAFAYETTE, OF COURSE, PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, A FRENCHMAN WHO FOUGHT WITH THE UNITED STATES AGAINST ENGLAND, IS THERE ONE YOU LIKE DOING MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH FANTASTIC PART?
I REALLY LOVE THAT I GET TO DO THEM BOTH BECAUSE THEY FUNCTION REALLY DIFFERENTLY IN CONTEXT OF THE PLAY. LAFAYETTE'S ARCH, IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET THROUGH. HE'S NOT ON STAGE A TON AND HE HAS TO GO FROM SOMEBODY WHEN WE MEET HIM IS BARELY COMPETENT IN ENGLISH TO WE SEE HIM BECOME A GREAT GENERAL AND DOING A REALLY FAST RAP PIECE. SO I'M VERY FOCUSED AND I'M VERY SORT OF INSIDE OF IT. AND JEFFERSON THE FIRST THING I DO IS WAVE AT EVERYBODY AND BLOW THEM KISSES. YOU SAW THE THING. THAT'S-- IT'S RARE THAT YOU GET TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IN ONE SHOW, HAVE THESE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE S.
Stephen:  ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT, FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN "HAMILTON," IS JEFFERSON IS ALWAYS PORTRAYED AS SORT OF A GENIUS HERO IN AMERICAN HISTORY. HE IS NOT THE HERO OF THIS PLAY.
NO, NO IT'S HAMILTON'S STORY.
Stephen: IT'S HAMILTON'S STORY BUT HAMILTON HAS HIS OWN FAULTS HERE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THIS PLAY-- BESIDES THERE'S BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCES, A REALLY COMPELLING STORY, BUT WHY COW THINK IT IS SO TRANSFORMATIVE? BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING DIFFERENT HAPPEN ON STAGE?
I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THAT WE, THE PERFORMERS ARE, SORT OF ASKED TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE AUDIENCE, RIGHT. SO THAT'S CULTURALLY, AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE. SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S HIP-HOP IN THE PLAY. HIP-HOP IS A VERY CONTEMPORARY STYLE OF MUSIC. AND THAT MAKES THESE CHARACTERS FEEL CONTEMPORARY AND FEEL LIKE PEOPLE YOU WOULD KNOW AND MEET.
Stephen: IT DOES REMOVE THE BETWEEN NOT ONLY YOU AND THE AUDIENCE BUT ALSO BETWEEN THE AUDIENCE AND THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
I THINK THAT'S THE THING. IF THAT I EVER-- WE'RE USED TO LEARNING ABOUT THEM AS STATUES OR PAINTs.
Stephen: VERY WHITE STATUES.
VERY WHITE STATUE S.
Stephen:  HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT?
I-- I-- I'M PART OF THIS GROUP FREESTYLE LOVE SUPREME THAT IS LIN FOUNDED WITH TOMMY KALE, OUR DIRECTOR, AND CHRIS JACKSON IS ALSO A PART OF THIS GROUP. AND WE WERE ASKED TO PERFORM-- IT'S AN IMPROVISED RAP PROJECT, AND WE WERE ASKED TO PERFORM AT THE SUPER BOWL IN NEW ORLEANS RAPPING LIVE ABOUT SPORTS CELEBRITIES ON SPORTS NATION AS THEY WERE BRINGING PEOPLE OUT. YEAH, YEAH. IT WAS A TOTALLY CRAZY TIME. AND WE'RE THERE, AND TOMMY KALE, COMES UP TO ME SORT OF AFTER ALL THIS IS DONE AND SAYS, "HEY, LIN, IS WORKING ON A NEW THING. WE'RE GOING TO DO A READING, IT'S A RAP MUSICAL ABOUT ALEXANDER HAMILTON. WILL YOU COME AND BE A PART OF IT?"
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION, A RAP MUSICAL ABOUT THE FOUNDER OF THE FEDERAL BANKING SYSTEM?
IT IMMEDIATELY MADE PERFECT SENSE AND I KNEW EXACTLY-- I ACTUALLY TOLD TOMMY TO HIS FACE IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA. AND THEN TOLD HIM TO SEND ME THE SCRIPT BECAUSE I WAS FOR SURE MOTT-- MY FRIEND'S WRITING A PLAY AND THEY WANT TO PAY ME? YEAH. AS SOON AS THEY SENT ME THE MUSIC, IT WAS-- ALL OF A SUDDEN IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. THAT'S THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THIS SHOW, THE PITCH IS NOT GREAT, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: MY REACTION-- I HEARD ABOUT IT, AND EVERYBODY SAID, "YOU HAVE TO GO SEE IT." I THINK YOU GUYS WERE STILL IN PREVIEWS-- YOU HAD MOVED TO BROADWAY BUT HADN'T OPENED YET, AND MY REACTION IS WHAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE'S REACTION IS. THE FIRST 15 MINUTE YOU GO, "THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS GOOD. I WONDER HOW LONG THEY CAN SUSTAIN THIS?" BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFERENT. YOU'RE NOT USED TO SEEING CERTAINLY HISTORY OR MUSICAL PRESENTED THIS WAY ON PRAUD WAY. AND THE NEXT 15 MINUTE THEY GO, "WOW, THAT IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY." AND 15 MINUTES LATER YOU'VE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN IT'S A NEW FORM AND TWO HOURS LATER YOU'RE SAYING, "WHY AM I CRYING OVER ALEXANDER HAMILTON?" WHY AM I CRYING OVER ALEXANDER HAMILTON, DAVEED DIGGS?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT 500 TIMES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU'RE LOOK, "ALEXANDER HAMILTON, ENOUGH, ENOUGH! "
Stephen: WELL, I WOULD SEE IT 500 TIMES.
PLEASE DO.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD LUCK WITH THE TONIES ON JUNE 12 RIGHT HERE ON CBS. DAVEED DIGGS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WITH A PERFORMANCE FROM COMEDIAN MARINA FRANKLIN. ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: MY NEXT GUEST IS A VERY FUNNY LADY, WHO'S BEEN FEATURED ON LOUIS C.K.'S "HORACE AND PETE," AND THE MOVIE "TRAINWRECK." PLEASE WELCOME MARINA FRANKLIN! ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
HI! OH, HEY, EVERYBODY! IT'S REALLY GOOD TO BE HERE. YEAH? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, THANKS. YEAH, YOU KNOW. I'M SINGLE, SO IT'S GOOD TO BE OUT AND LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YEAH, I AM SINGLE. AND I'M VERY-- VERY ANGRY ABOUT THAT ONE. TRUST ME BECAUSE I JUST-- I MADE SOME MISTAKES, YOU KNOW. LIKE I USED TO DATE YOUNG. I DON'T MEAN TO DATE YOUNG. IT'S JUST I AGED WELL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEY COME AT ME. SERIOUSLY. I'LL JUST BE HANGING OUT AT THE GAME STOP, AND THEY JUST COME INTO MY LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHERE I HANG OUT. I'M LIKE, "YOU WANT THIS? COME AND GET IT." ( LAUGHTER ) HE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR ME, THOUGH. IT WAS EXHAUSTING. BEING A COUGAR, BY THE WAY, IS NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE, OKAY. THIS GUY OF ALWAYS WEAK. AWAKE, JUST LOOKING AT ME LIKE, "WHAT NEXT?" I'M LIKE, "NOTHING. TAKE A NAP." HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTY OF A NAP. HE HAD A REALLY NICE APARTMENT, THOUGH. THAT'S IMPORTANT. IN NEW YORK CITY, IF YOU GET A GUY WITH A NICE APARTMENT, YOU GOT TO HOLD ON TO THAT. OKAY. I'M A FEMINIST. I AM. BUT I TAP OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE, I BELIEVE IN EQUAL PAY, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN HIS PAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. YEAH! LET'S FIGHT FOR BOTH! HIS PAY, MY PAY, BUT MORE HIS PAY. HIS APARTMENT WAS REALLY NICE, BUT I REMEMBER ONE TIME WE GOT IN A FIGHT THERE BECAUSE OF HIS HORMONES, YOU KNOW. HE WAS ALWAYS ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING. AND HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE, "I'M GOING TO SLEEP IN THE OTHER ROOM." I WAS LIKE, "YOU HAVE ANOTHER ROOM? THAT IS HOT. THIS IS GOING TO WORK OUT." BECAUSE MY APARTMENT IS VERY SMALL. IT'S A TRUE NEW YORK APARTMENT. IF I GET ANGRY IN MY APARTMENT, I ANGLE MYSELF LIKE THIS. IT'S NOT RIGHT. IT'S NOT RIGHT. HE WAS WHITE, BY THE WAY. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE DOING. ( LAUGHTER ) I DATE THE BROTHERS, TOO, YOU KNOW. THE ECONOMY'S GETTING BETTER SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M GOING BACK! I ACTUALLY WENT ON A DATE WITH A BROTHER, BLACK GUY, JUST IN CASE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I WAS OFF. IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME, AND I SHOULD HAVE SEGUED BACK, YOU KNOW. MAYBE DATED A BROTHER ON A SKATEBOARD, YOU KNOW. MAYBE A BROTHER THAT LISTENS TO NPR, SOMETHING LIGHT. BECAUSE THIS BROTHER WAS ROUGH. AND ON THE DATE, I FELT LIKE A WHITE GIRL DATING A BLACK GUY. LIKE, I CALLED HIM TO COME PICK ME UP ON A DATE. HE GOT UPSET. HE'S LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ENH? I'M GONNA COME PICK YOU UP? YOU TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE. YOU GOT TO BE SPECIFIC, ENH. I GOT A NICE CAR. POLICE COULD PULL ME OVER. OR YOU COULD WALK." ( LAUGHTER ) IVE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS?" WALK? LIKE, WHY WOULD I DO THAT?" "LIKE, JUST AS AN F.Y.I., NOT A WALKER. AND, LIKE, WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY? LIKE, WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?" AND POLICE ARE HERE TO PROTECT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, OKAY. SOME OF YOU ARE LAUGHING, AND SOME OF OF YOU ARE LIKE, "YES, THE POLICE ARE HERE TO PROTECT YOU. WHERE WAS THE JOKE IN THAT? I DIDN'T HEAR IT. I DIDN'T HEAR THAT JOKE." I HAD A GIRL GET MAD AT ME ABOUT THAT JOKE BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT I WAS MOCKING THE VOICE TOO MUCH. SHE WAS LIKE, "WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT." "YES, YOU DO." IT'S ACTUALLY MY VOICE. I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS, WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M BILINGUAL, I CAN DO BOTH. YOU GUYS ARE GREAT! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
