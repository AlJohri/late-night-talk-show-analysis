AND NOW "THE LATE SHOW"" PRESENTS "GREAT MOMENTS IN BLACK HISTORY."
Jon: DONALD TRUMP IS NOT BLACK. ( LAUGHTER ).
THIS HAS BEEN "GREAT MOMENTS IN BLACK HISTORY."
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ROBERT DENIRO. JAKE TAPPER. AND EZRA EDLEMAN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SURE YOU GUYS KEEP UP ON WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU SEEM LIKE AN INTELLIGENT CROWD. THE BIG NEWS SINCE LAST WE WERE TOGETHER AND TALKING HAS BEEN FROM THE SENATE, WHERE THEY'VE BEEN DEBATING THE NOMINATION OF TRUMP'S ATTORNEY GENERAL AND BABY GRANDPA HYBRID, JEFF SESSIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, THEY CAN DO AMAZING THINGS WITH GENETICS NOW. WELL, DURING LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE, ELIZABETH WARREN KICKED OFF HER 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: FANS IN THE HOUSE.
Stephen: THEY'RE NOT JOKING. THEY'RE NOT JOKING. SHE DID IT, SHE DID IT BY GETTING UP TO READ A 1986 LETTER BY CORETTA SCOTT KING CRITICIZING SESSIONS'  RECORD ON CIVIL AND VOTING RIGHTS. THIS DAMNING LETTER WAS CRITICAL IN DENYING SESSIONS A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP 30 YEARS AGO. IT WAS THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED TO SESSIONS IN THE 80s, OTHER THAN HIS FLOCK OF SEAGULLS HAIRCUT. ( LAUGHTER ) REPUBLICANS, FACES WITH THIS, HANDLED THE SITUATION LIKE ADULTS BY VOTING TO SILENCE ELIZABETH WARREN ( AUDIENCE BOOING ).
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. THEY STOPPED HER FROM READING A LETTER FROM CORETTA SCOTT KING. IT'S ALL PART OF THE G.O.P.'S FEBRUARY MESSAGE "HAPPY BLACK HISTORY MONTH. NOW SHUT UP ABOUT THE BAD STUFF." KEEP IT LIGHT. SENATOR ORRIN HATCH CALLED WARREN'S READING OF THE LETTER "OFFENSIVE" AND TOLD WARREN TO "THINK OF HIS WIFE." THANK YOU, SENATOR HAMP, THANK YOU, FOR PROTECTING THE REAL VICTIM OF RACISM, JEFF SESSIONS' WIFE. SHE DIDN'T KNOW. AND SHUSH-MOB LEADER MITCH McCONNELL DEFENDED SILENCING WARREN.
SHE WAS WARNED. SHE WAS GIVEN AN EXPLANATION. NEVERTHELESS, SHE PERSISTED.
Stephen: ADDING, "WOULD IT KILL HER TO SMILE? SHE'S SO MUCH PRETTIER WHEN SHE SMILES." ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, TO STOP WARREN, REPUBLICANS INVOKED SOMETHING CALLED RULE 19, WHICH PROHIBITS A SENATOR FROM IMPUGNING THE CHARACTER OF ANOTHER SITTING SENATOR. IT'S LIKE THE SAYING, "IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE, YOU'RE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT JEFF SESSIONS." ( LAUGHTER ) SO TO RECAP: A BLACK PERSON CAN'T GET THEIR MESSAGE HEARD EVEN WHEN A WHITE PERSON IS SAYING IT, UNLESS THAT WHITE PERSON IS A GUY, BECAUSE THIS MORNING, A BUNCH OF WHITE SENATORS WERE ALLOWED TO READ EXCERPTS FROM KING'S LETTER ON THE SENATE FLOOR. OF COURSE, THE MEN WEREN'T SILENCED. THAT WOULD VIOLATE SENATE RULE 18 "BROS BEFORE HOES." THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CONSTITUTION. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. HERE'S SOME NEWS. LAST WEEK, THE DEPARTMENT STORE NORDSTROM DROPPED THE IVANKA TRUMP BRAND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OVER POOR SALES. EVIDENTLY, NOT A LOT OF WOMEN WANTED TO BUY CLOTHES THAT MADE THEM ATTRACTIVE TO THEIR FATHERS. THEY'RE LOVELY, IT'S A LOVELY LINE OF CLOTHING. IT'S A LOVELY LINE OF CLOTHING. APPARENTLY, THE CLOTHES WERE NOT SELLING WELL, AND DROPPING AN UNDERPERFORMING BRAND IS A DECISION ANY BUSINESS PERSON WOULD UNDERSTAND-- EXCEPT ONE, WHO TWEETED: "MY DAUGHTER IVANKA HAS BEEN TREATED SO UNFAIRLY BY @NORDSTROM. SHE IS A GREAT PERSON-- ALWAYS PUSHING ME TO DO THE RIGHT THING!" SO, EVIDENTLY, SHE DOESN'T PUSH THAT HARD. NOW, NORDSTROM'S. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) NORDSTROM'S STOCK TOOK A HIT RIGHT AFTER THE TWEET, WHICH WAS RETWEETED FROM THE OFFICIAL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNT. SEAN SPICER THEN DEFENDED THE TWEET FROM THE PODIUM IN THE PRESS ROOM, NOT IN AN ILL-FITTING SUIT, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW. IN A RAVISHING SLEEVELESS IVANKA ORIGINAL. LOOKS AMAZING, AMAZING. HE LOOKED FANTASTIC!
Jon: I LIKED THE HAND.
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, MELISSA McCARTHY WOULD NEVER LOOK THAT GOOD IN THAT DRESS. THIS IS CRAZY! THIS IS INSANE. YOU CAN'T USE THE POWER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO PROTECT A FAMILY BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT IS THAT LIKE? WHAT IS THAT LIKE? THAT WOULD BE LIKE JIMMY CARTER MAKING ALL OF US DRINK BILLY BEER. OR THAT WOULD BE LIKE GEORGE BUSH INVADING A COUNTRY THAT HAD OIL. YOU CAN'T DO IT.
Jon: WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: AND, YESTERDAY, TRUMP MET WITH UTAH CONGRESSMAN AND SEDUCTIVE BEAVER, JASON CHAFFETZ. CHAFFETZ IS AN OLD FRIEND OF THE SHOW. CHAFFETZ IS CHAIR OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HOLDING A PRESIDENT ACCOUNTABLE AND INVESTIGATING ANY PRESIDENT IF NECESSARY. CHAFFETZ SAID, "BEFORE MY BUM EVEN HIT THE CHAIR, THE PRESIDENT SAID, 'NO OVERSIGHT. YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH OVERSIGHT.'" AND THEN DESCRIBED A CHITTY-CHATTY PRESIDENT EAGER TO LEARN ABOUT POSTAL SERVICE REFORMS. NATURALLY, TRUMP WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT POSTAL SERVICE REFORMS. HE NEEDS TO KNOW HOW MANY STAMPS TO PUT ON CHAFFETZ' BALLS WHEN HE MAILS THEM BACK TO HIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT ELSE? OH, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN WAS IN COURT YESTERDAY, AND AS OF THIS TAPING, WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULING IS. I'M TIVO-ING DEMOCRACY. SO DON'T TELL ME HOW IT ENDS. AND EARLIER TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ON TWITTER AGAIN, PRESSURING THE JUDGES TO UPHOLD HIS BAN, TWEETING: "BIG INCREASE IN TRAFFIC INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM CERTAIN AREAS, WHILE OUR PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE VULNERABLE, AS WE WAIT FOR WHAT SHOULD BE EASY D!" THAT'S RIGHT, "EASY D!" "EASY D." WHICH I THINK USED TO BE TRUMP'S RAPPER NAME BACK IN THE 80s. HE AND JEFF SESSIONS.
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: HE AND JEFF SESSIONS HAD A RAPPER NEW WAVE BAND TOGETHER I THINK FAIR WHILE. "D" COULD STAND FOR SOMETHING LIKE "DEFENSE," OR PROBABLY "DECISION." BUT ALL I KNOW IS ALL THESE TWEETS MAKE TRUMP LOOK LIKE A REAL D-BAG. A DECISION BAG. A DECISION BAG. A BAG OF SO MANY DECISION HE HAS TO KEEP NEM A BAG. HE HAS TO KEEP THEM IN A BAG RIGHT OVER HERE. NOW, THE TRAVEL BAN, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET. SO YESTERDAY, SEAN SPICER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO CALM EVERYONE DOWN.
THE REASON THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTING IN SO MANY OF THE WAYS THAT HE HAS WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND OTHERWISE ARE BECAUSE HE CARES ABOUT MAKING SURE WE DON'T HAVE ATTACKS IN THIS COUNTRY. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE EARTH IS A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE THESE DAYS.
Stephen: "THE EARTH"? ( LAUGHTER ) THE EARTH, SEAN. YOU CAN'T BE ANY MORE SPECIFIC THAN "THE EARTH?" SO HERE IS THE MESSAGE OF CALM THE ADMINISTRATION IS SENDING. IF YOU'RE TRAVELING ANYWHERE IN THIS AREA, JUST BE CAREFUL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST ANYWHERE-- ANYWHERE HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK-- I THINK-- I THINK-- I THINK I BROKE THE WORLD JUST NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. HEY, GUYS EVER WATCH THE CNN, THE CABLE NEWS NETWORK? YOU GUYS EVER WATCH THAT SHOW? ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A GOOD SHOW, THE CNN. LAST NIGHT, JAKE TAPPER-- WHO'S ONE OF OUR GUESTS TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S BACKSTAGE RIGHT NOW IN HIS GREEN ROOM, JUST ABSOLUTELY-- JUST BALLS DEEP IN A CHEESE PLATE PLATE I THINK RIGHT NOW. I'M SURE I CAN SAY THAT ON CNN, CAN'T I-- I'M SORRY, ON CNN, YES. ON CBS PROBABLY NOT. WE MIGHT BE OFF THE AIR AT THIS POINT. LAST NIGHT, JAKE HAD ON TRUMP ADVISER AND CRUELLA DEVILLE'S LESS-POPULAR SISTER, KELLYANNE CONWAY. AND, SHE-- REMEMBER, SHE'S THE ONE WHO FAMOUSLY COINED THE TERM "ALTERNATIVE FACTS." WELL, LAST NIGHT'S INTERVIEW WENT "ALTERNATIVE GOOD." ( LAUGHTER ) AT FIRST, KELLYANNE TRIED TO PLAY NICE.
ARE WE FAKE NEWS, KELLYANNE? IS CNN FAKE NEWS?
NO, I DON'T THINK CNN IS FAKE NEWS.
Stephen: OKAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOUR SENIOR ADVISER SAID CNN ISN'T FAKE NEWS. THEN AGAIN, SHE SAID IT ON CNN, AND WE KNOW THAT'S FAKE NEWS, SO CAN'T REALLY TRUST IT. SO CLOSE. THEN JAKE ASKED CONWAY ABOUT TRUMP'S ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN LOVE AFFAIR WITH MAKING STUFF UP.
HOW ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENTS THAT ARE FALSE, LIKE THE MURDER RATE IS THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN IN ALMOST HALF A CENTURY. FALSE! I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYING THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE. DEMONSTRABLY NOT TRUE. THAT IS IMPORTANT.
WELL, ARE THEY-- ARE THEY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MANY THINGS THAT HE SAYS THAT ARE TRUE THAT ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES?
Stephen: YOU GO, GIRL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU TELL HIM. "JAKE, HE SAYS MANY THINGS THAT AREN'T LIES, OKAY? WHY DOESN'T HE GET CREDIT FOR THOSE?" IT'S LIKE, "EXCUSE ME, OFFICER. THERE ARE MANY TIMES I DRIVE WHEN I'M NOT DRUNK. WHY DON'T YOU PULL ME OVER THEN?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ROBERT DE NIRO IS HERE. JAKE TAPPER IS HERE.

I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: THE LAST WE SAW EACH OTHER ABOUT A YEAR AGO, AND THEN I SAW YOU BRIEFLY, YOU KNOW, RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION.
YES.
Stephen: HIGHWAY ARE-- HIGHWAY ARE YOU FEELING?
UH... ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S-- IT'S LIKE A PALL. IT'S KIND OF LIKE-- IT'S JUST-- FOR ME, IT'S LIKE-- IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT'S GNAWING AT YOU, LIKE SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. WOULD YOU LIKE-- WOULD YOU LIKE A COCKTAIL?
UH, YEAH.
Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE WE HAD MARTINIS.
OH, WE DID.
Stephen: SAKE MARTINI.
IF YOU HAVE ONE RILE TAKE IT.
Stephen: I DON'T. I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER. LAST TIME WE SERVED THEM IN GLASS, MARTINI GLASSES. AND I FOUND OUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DRINK YOUR SAKE.
NO.
Stephen: YOU DRINK YOUR SAKE IN THESE. THEY'RE WOODEN BOXES. A LITTLE SALT IN THEM. WHAT ARE THESE BOXES CALLED HERE?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CALLED.
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE CALLED, BOB. THEY'RE CALLED "A MASU BOX." YOU DON'T DO THE SALT?
I DO, BUT NOT TOO MUCH. I'LL HAVE A HEART ATTACK.
Stephen: THIS IS-- THEY GAVE ME THESE GLOVES BECAUSE THE SAKE IS IN DRY ICE BACK HERE. AND THEY GAVE ME GLOVES--
OH, GREAT.
Stephen: IN CASE WE HAVE A BREECH BIRTH COW, I CAN GO IN AND GET THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY, HERE IS THE SAKE RIGHT THERE. AND BOY--
YOU DON'T WANT THAT MUCH SALT, TOO. WE'LL BOTH HAVE A STROKE.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT THAT MUCH SALT? OKAY, FINE. YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ME WITH ANY SALT THERE, MR. DE NIRO. BOSSY! IS THAT ENOUGH? IS THIS ENOUGH?
YOU CAN BRING IT A LITTLE HIGHER.

WELL, IT'S NOTHAT STRONG.
Stephen: IT'S NOTHAT STRONG? IT'S NOT LIKE DRINKING WHISKEY.
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. I CAN GO AFTER THIS. AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
Stephen: I HAVE TO TALK TO JAKE TAPPER AFTER THIS. NOW, THE MOVIE "THE COMEDIAN," YOU PLAY A GUY WHO-- WHO WAS A STAND-UP AND ALSO A SITCOM STAR.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND THEN HE-- HE STOPS AND HE TRIES TO MAKE A COMEBACK HERE. YOU'VE ALSO PLAYED A COMEDIAN IN THE "CAN THE I THINK OF COMEDY." JACKULA MOTTA TRIES STAND-UP IN "THE RAGING BULL."
I LOVE COMEDIANS. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I DON'T LOVE. ( APPLAUSE ) NO, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE GREAT. YOU'RE REALLY-- YOUR MONOLOGUE WAS TERRIFIC JUST BEFORE, TOO.
Stephen: THIS IS THE PART OF THE INTERVIEW WE'LL SAVE. THIS IS THE PART-- THIS IS THE PART OF THE INTERVIEW WE WILL NOT-- WE WILL NOT CUT OUT, CUT OUT, YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ).
I ON LOVE COMEDIANS AND THOSE THINGS I WOUND UP DOING. "THE KING OF COMEDY" IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN "THE COMEDIAN." IT'S ABOUT A GUY WHO REALLY WANTS TO BE A COMMAND I CAN GOES ABOUT IT IN A STRANGE WAY, AND THE WHOLE THING, FANTASIES AND THIS AND THAT. THIS IS A DIFFERENT THING. THIS IS MORE LIKE A GUY WHO WOULD BE, SAY, LIKE AN ARCHIE BUNKER CHARACTER, HAD THAT KIND OF PART ON A SITCOM FOR MANY YEARS, AND IT STOPPED, AND MAYBE PART OF IT WAS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HOW HE WAS. AND SO THEN HE WAS STUCK WITH THIS THING THAT-- THE ONLY THING IS I DON'T KNOW IF COMEDIANS, IF THEY HAVE AS MUCH-- IT'S PARTIALLY AN ACTOR'S PERSPECTIVE ON GETTING STUCK WITH A ROLE, AND THEN YOU'RE ALWAYS KNOWN IN THAT ROLE.
Stephen: YEAH, I WOULD HATE TO BE KNOWN AS STEPHEN COLBERT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THAT WOULD BE-- LAST TIME WE HAD A LOT OF FUN DOING NOTHING TOGETHER.

Stephen: IN THIS CASE CODIRECTOR.

NO, MY WHOLE THING IS NO DRAMA, NOTHING LIKE THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO-- THINGS, IF YOU DISAGREE, YOU WORK IT OUT AND MOVE FORWARD. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE SHOW GETS DONE AND THAT THERE'S NO-- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CALL IT?

Stephen: NORMALLY I DON'T ASK WHAT PEOPLE ARE CARRYING OUT WITH THEM.
IT'S A DARTMOUTH SWEATSHIRT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A SOUVENIR FOR ME.
THE REASON IS BECAUSE YOUR CHARACTER FROM "THE COLBERT REPORT" WAS A DARTMOUTH ALUMNUS.
Stephen: I WENT TO NORTHWESTERN.
I ACTUALLY DID GO TO DARTMOUTH.
Stephen: AS FAR AS WE KNOW.
FAKE NEWS.
Stephen: FAKE NEWS, JAKE. YOU LIE. YOU LIE. YOU LIE.
YOU ENDED UP ON THE COVER OF "THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE BEFORE I DID.
Stephen: YES.
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE NEVER SET FOOT IN HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE.
BUT IN ANY CASE, DARTMOUTH FINALLY INVITED ME TO GIVE THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.
Stephen: OH, CONGRATULATIONS.
THIS COMING JUNE.
Stephen: I'M VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THIS. IT'S HIGH QUALITY.
CHAMPION.
Stephen: THAT IS HIGH COTTON RIGHT THERE. SPEAKING OF YOU AND CNN AND FAKE NEWS, OUR PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMANDER IN CHIEF, HAS CALLED YOUR NETWORK FAKE NEWS, FRAUD, THE WORST, SO BIASED, FAILING, UNWATCHABLE AIR, DISGRACE TO THE BROADCASTING INDUSTRY, DISGUSTING PHONY REPORTING, UNPROFESSIONAL, BAD TELEVISION, AND CNN CAN GO TO HELL. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW--
HE CERTAINLY WATCHES US A LOT.
Stephen: YEAH. SURE, SURE. SO WHY-- WHY-- WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN TO HIM, JAKE? IF YOU GUYS JUST DIDN'T FACT CHECK HIM ANYMORE, HE WOULDN'T BE SAYING THESE THINGS ABOUT YOU.
IT'S A GOOD POINT.
Stephen: ARE YOU-- WHAT'S IT LIKE IN THE HALLS OVER THERE KNOWING THAT YOU, THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTIVELY DOESN'T LIKE YOUR NETWORK. HOW DO PEOPLE FEEL OVER THERE?
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CARES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, I MEAN --
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT COMPARING THE TWO, BECAUSE THEY'RE QUITE DIFFERENT, BUT I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS A PARTICULAR FAN OF MINE. I MEAN, THE JOB IS TO NOT BE LIKED. THAT'S YOUR JOB, TO BE LIKED.
Stephen: YES.
MY JOB-- MY JOB IS NOT TO BE LIKED. MY JOB IS TO TELL THE TRUTH AND DELIVER THE FACTS AND HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOT ME.
NOT YOU. I HAVE KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME I WOULD NEVER HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE.
Stephen: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER 13 YEARS. WE MET ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN IOWA.
SOME SCHOOL OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: IT WAS A SCHOOL OR A BARN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND I WAS TRYING TO INTERVIEW HOWARD DEAN.
YEAH.
Stephen: HE WOULDN'T-- HE WOULD ONLY ANSWER ONE QUESTION, AND--
YOU ASKED HIM WHAT SOUND DOES A COW MAKE?
Stephen: I SAID, WHAT DOES THE COW SAY?" AND HE SAID, "WELL, THE COW KNOWS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THE TAXES ON THE FARMERS..." AND HE DID THIS TWO-MINUTE ANSWER.
IT WAS AWFUL, IT WAS AWFUL.
Stephen: AND I SAID, "I'M SORRY, THE ANSWER IS MOO." THAT'S IT. I WENT THERE FOR TWO DAYS AND THAT'S THE ONLY ANSWER I GOT. I'M BANGING MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL. I'M GOING WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO DAYS, WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL JON STEWART AND FROM DOWN THE HALLWAY I HEARD, "WELL, YOU GOT MORE THAN I "D."
AND WE WERE BOTH TWO HUNGRY CORRESPONDENTS DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET ON AIR.
Stephen: ANY AIR TIME AT ALL. I WAS WITH YOU AT THE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER IN 2005, THE YEAR BEFORE I DID IT, WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS GOING TO DO THE "COLBERT REPORT.
HE'S MY DATE, AND HE GOT UP HALF AN HOUR, 40 MINUTES LATER AND SAID, "I JUST SIGNED A DEAL FOR MY OWN SHOW."
Stephen: AND I TOLD YOU WHAT THE IDEAL WAS.
HE WAS GOING TO DO THE STEPHEN COLBERT CHARACTER.
Stephen: AND YOU SAID...
"YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR HALF AN HOUR?"
Stephen: YEAH, I REMEMBER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I'M SORRY, THAT'S JUST HOW I'M WIRED. I APOLOGIZE. BUT TO BE FAIR, NOW THAT AMERICA HAS GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
THE REAL YOU AND NOT THE CHARACTER, I JUST MEANT I PREFERRED THIS ONE.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S VERY NICE. YOU'RE VERY KIND. YOU'RE VERY KIND.
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING IN ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, YOU INTERVIEWED KELLYANNE CONWAY JUST LAST NIGHT. OKAY. AND SHE BESEECHED YOU, BESEECHED-- SHE USED THE WORD "BESEECHED." SHE BESEECHED TO USE A MORE RESPECTFUL TONE AND SHOULD COVERAGE CHANGE OF DONALD TRUMP ONCE HE'S THE PRESIDENT? SHOULD IT CHANGE ITS TONE?
I THINK THAT OUR COVERAGE FOLLOWS HIS LEAD. AND I THINK THAT IF HE PIVOTED, AS HE CLAIMED HE WOULD --
Stephen: BE PRESIDENTIAL.
WAS MORE PRESIDENTIAL.
Stephen: MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANYBODY HAS BEEN PRESIDENTIAL.
HE DIDN'T SEND OUT NASTY TWEETS ABOUT NORDSTROM'S OR JUDGES OR GO TO THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST AND TALK ABOUT HOW BAD ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S RATINGS ARE.
Stephen: PRETTY BAD.
THEY'RE PRETTY BAD? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF HE DIDN'T DO THAT SORT OF THING, THEN I WOULD BE DELIGHTED, FRANKLY, TO COVER THE POLICIES MORE. I MEAN, NOT THAT WE'RE NOT COVERING THEM. WE ARE COVERING THE CABINET NOMINEES AND THE TRAVEL BAN. BUT THERE'S THIS WHOLE OTHER THING GOING ON WITH HIS WHITE HOUSE --
Stephen: IT'S A VERY LEAKY WHITE HOUSE.
MANY LEAKS.
Stephen: IS IT LEAKIER--
PLEASE DON'T GO WHERE I THINK YOU'RE GOING --
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I'M NOT GOING NOWHERE NEAR MOSCOW. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. WHAT-- IS IT-- YOU'VE COVERED A LOT OF WHITE HOUSES AND A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIONS. IS THIS LEAKIER THAN THEY NORMALLY ARE?
I THINK SO.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
I THINK-- THERE ARE A FEW REASONS. I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT WHO ARE-- WHEN ARE NOT TRUMP POLITICAL APPOINTEES BUT THEY'RE JUST-- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALARMED OR CONFUSED AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON. AND THEN I THINK THERE ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT LITTLE TURFS WITHIN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, AND THEY'RE ALL COMPETING FOR HIS ATTENTION AND HIS IDEAS. AND THEY KIND OF TRASH TALK EACH OTHER TO DIFFERENT REPORTER S.
Stephen:  TO POSITION THEMSELVES AS THE POWER BROKER IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
YEAH, THERE ARE COMPETING INTERESTS. THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. BUT USUALLY IT TAKES A FEW YEARS, AND USUALLY THEY'RE NOT THIS BLATANT.
Stephen: DOESN'T TAKE TWO WEEKS FOR THE KNIVES TO COME OUT.
OR TWO HOURS. YEAR, IT WAS PRETTY QUICK.
Stephen: WELL WL, YOU'VE GOT A NEW SHOW COMING UP ON CNN. IT'S A SERIES. HOW MANY PARTS.
ABILITY-PART SERIES, I BELIEVE. "THE HISTORY OF COMEDY."
Stephen: "THE HISTORY OF COMEDY." WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF COMDIERK JAKE TAPPER. DO INFORM ME?
I AM MERELY AN EMISSARY. I'M MERELY AN AMBASSADOR FROM CNN ABOUT THIS. I'M IN ONE EPISODE BUT I'M NOT RAWL RALE --
Stephen: YOU'RE IN ONE EPISODE. WHAT DO YOU DO?
POLITICAL COMEDY.
Stephen: AND YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT CALLING ME OR ANYTHING LIKE, THAT DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU, "STEPHEN IS A FRIEND OF MINE."
YOU'RE A CHIT I ONLY USE.
Stephen: YOU NEVER CHITTED ME.
I DID. WHEN THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER FIRST STARTED YOU WERE ONE OF MY FIRST INTERVIEWS, AND YOU SHAMED ME FROM EVER DRINKING JACK AND COKE FROM EVER AGAIN. WE WERE DHOOG INTERVIEW IN A BAR, AND I HAD A JACK AND COKE WHICH IS WHAT I HAD BEEN DRINKING FOR 20 YEARS AND HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR IT, AND I'VE NEVER HAD ONE SINCE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I APOLOGIZE.
IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE.
IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: JAKE, IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Stepehn: "THE HISTORY OF COMEDY" PREMIERES TOMORROW ON CNN. JAKE TAPPER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF "O.J.: MADE IN AMERICA," EZRA EDELMAN. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) MY NEXT GUEST IS AN EMMY AND PEABODY WINNER WHOSE DOCUMENTARY, "OJ: MADE IN AMERICA," IS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR.
WHEN I ASKED HIM, I SAID WE ARE TRYING TO GET BLACK ATHLETES TO UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE A ROLE IN THE CURRENT CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. HIS RESPONSE WAS, "I'M NOT BLACK. I'M O.J.."
WHAT THEY THINK IS RIGHT, I GUESS, THEY MUST FOLLOW THEIR BELIEFS. RIGHT NOW I DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN IT BECAUSE I'M NOT IN TRACK, YOU KNOW. I'M RUNNING TRACK, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OLYMPIC TIME I WILL BE IN FOOTBALL SO I HAVE NO COMMENT ON THE MATTER.
O.J. WAS SAYING, "I WANT TO BE JUDGED NOT BY THE COLOR OF MY SKIN. I WANT TO BE JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF MY CHARACTER, AND MOST OF ALL, THE CALIBER OF MY COMPETENCE. I THINK I'M THE GREATEST FOOTBALL PLAYER THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN."
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME EZRA EDELMAN! ♪ IS THE WORD IS THE WORD THAT YOU HEARD ♪ IT'S GOT GROOVE IT'S GOT MEANING ♪
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NOMINATION FOR THE OSCAR FOR "O.J.: MADE IN AMERICA."
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DOCUMENTARY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: INCREDIBLY GRIPPING DOCUMENTARY.  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU'RE A DOCUMENTARIAN, WHICH YOU DOCUMENT REALITY. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO GO TO OSCAR EVENTS FOR YOU? BECAUSE THAT'S GLITZ AND GLAMOUR. THAT'S THE ULTIMATE NOT REAL.
I WAS GOING TO SAY IT'S LIKE STEPPING OUT OF REALITY.
Stephen: YEAH?
I MEAN, WE HAD A-- I GOT TO GO TO THE ACADEMY LUNCH THAT THEY HAVE FOR THE NOMINEES MONDAY.
Stephen: WAS IT NICE?
OH, YEAH, IT'S NICE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SANDWICHES? LIKE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
A LITTLE SEA BASS.
Stephen: OH NICE.
YOU KNOW, SALAD --
Stephen: DID YOU GET TO SIT NEAR ANY, LIKE, GLAMOROUS PEOPLE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
I MEAN, YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND MY ROOM AT MY TABLE, MEL GIBSON, TO MY RIGHT, DENZEL, AND ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE, TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO MAKE DOCUMENTARIES TO PEOPLE WHO DO SOUND MIXING, TO VISUAL EFFECTS. YOU ALL FEEL ON AN EQUAL PLANE FOR A FEW HOURS. THEN I LOOK OVER AT DENZEL AND I KIND OF KNOW I'M NOT ON AN EQUAL PLANE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT STILL.
Stephen: WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE BRONCO CHASE HAPPENED?
I WAS AT MY PARENTS OPEN HOUSE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. I WAS IN COLLEGE. AND I WAS HOME FOR THE SUMMER, AND A FEW FRIENDS OF MINE WERE COMING OVER TO WATCH GAME FIVE OF THE N.B.A. TIMES, THE KNICKS AND THE ROCKETS, AND WE TURN ON THE TV AND THERE WAS O.J. IN THE BRONCO.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT WE FORGET, IT WAS SUCH A BIG STORY, NETWORKS CUT INTO THE FINALS.
THAT'S RIGHT. IN FACT, IT WAS SURREAL FOR ME AS SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP WATCHING O.J., AND LOVED O.J.--
Stephen: JUICE "N." >.
HE WAS THE GUY I USED TO IMITATE RUNNING THROUGH AIRPORTS IN THE HERTZ COMMERCIALS. HE WAS O.J.
Stephen: YOU'RE KNOWN FOR YOUR DOCUMENTARIES ON SPORTS OR SPORTS STORIES. WHAT FIRST INTERESTED YOU IN SPORTS? WERE YOU AN ATHLETE AS A KID? DID YOU PLAY?
YEAH, I WAS IN BASEBALL WHEN I WAS A KID. I GREW UP IN A HOUSE WITH OLDER BROTHERS. I STILL HAVE THIS MEMORY-- IT'S FUNNY-- OF MY BROTHERS -- WE WERE HUGE STEELERS FANS WHEN WE WERE KIDS, AND THAT WAS THE TERRY BRADSHAW TEAMS. AND ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, AND MY MOTHER DECIDED TO TAKE ME TO "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF" IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON --
Stephen: ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY?
ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY. I THINK I WAS HIP TO IT. I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, THE SUPER BOWL IS GOING ON." AND I CONSCIOUSLY REMEMBER WALKING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES, I DON'T KNOW WHO WAS SINGING WHAT, THINKING LIKE... YOU KNOW. APPARENTLY, MY MOTHER DIDN'T QUITE GET HOW INVOLVED I WAS, EVEN THEN, AS A KID.
Stephen: WERE YOUR BROTHERS WATCHING IT?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU FELT RIPPED OFF THAT YOU COULDN'T BE WATCHING IT?
PRETTY MUCH.
Stephen: WAS IT BECAUSE SUPER BOWL SUNDAY WAS THE ONLY DAY SHE COULD GET TICKETS TO "THE FIDDLER."
MY MOTHER PREFERRED TO WATCH "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF" THAN WATCHING THE STEELERS AND THE EXPRAMS I WAS THE PERSON WHO GOT DRAGGED ALONG WITH HER.
Stephen: EZRA, IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
YOU, TOO, STEPHEN.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK AT THE HONORS. HAVE A GREAT TIME, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. IT'S A WONDERFUL HONOR. THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE DAVID OYELOWO, TARAN KILLAM, AND MUSICAL GUEST RAY SHREM-URD. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT!
