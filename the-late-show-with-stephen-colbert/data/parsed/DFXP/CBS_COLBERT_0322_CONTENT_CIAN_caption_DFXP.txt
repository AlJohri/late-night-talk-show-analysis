HEY, COME ON GUYS. I'M NOT WEARING A CUP. ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES JASON SUDEIKIS, JENNIFER ESPOSITO AND JOEY BADA$$, JON BATISTE AND BANNE"STAY HUMAN." FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER, IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME! THANKS, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I JUST WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITYOV SOUTH CAROLINA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM, WHO LAST NIGHT WON THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. GOOD FOR YOU, GIVE IT UP FOR THE FEMALE GAMECOCKS, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SO PROUD OF THE FEMALE GAMECOCKS, OR AS I HOPE NO ONE CALLS THEM, THE LADY COCKS -- 'CAUSE I GOOGLED IT AND THOSE WERE NOT BASKETBALL PLAYERS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: HEY, HEY, HEY!
Stephen: I WILL SAY, THERE WAS SOME IMPRESSIVE BALL HANDLING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, WHERE WERE WE? OH, WE TAPED THIS SHOW AT 5:30, SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO WON THE MEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP. AS A CELEBRITY, I DON'T FIND OUT UNTIL 7:30. BUT STILL I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS. SO GREAT JOB, TEAM NAME HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU EARNED IT! YOU WANTED IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRULY A CINDERELLA OR TOTALLY EXPECTED STORY. ( LAUGHTER ) SUPER DRAMATIC GAME TONIGHT. WISH I WOULD HAVE SEEN IT. THERE'S DRAMA BREWING IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE THE SENATE IS ABOUT TO VOTE ON NOMINEE AND BANKER GETTING STONED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON VACATION, NEIL GORSUCH. BUT DEMOCRATS AREN'T GOING TO LET GORSUCH GET CONFIRMED WITHOUT A FIGHT. SURE, IT'S A FIGHT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE-- BUT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF FIGHTS DEMOCRATS LOVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH! I'M NOT SURE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WERE CLAPPING FOR JUST THEN. WHEN YOU GET HOME TONIGHT, WATCH THE JOKE. I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID. TODAY, SENATE DEMOCRATS ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO FILIBUSTER GORSUCH'S NOMINATION. IF THEY DO, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THREATENED TO USE WHAT'S CALLED "THE NUCLEAR OPTION." WHICH WOULD UPSET DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE FIRST TO USE THE NUCLEAR OPTION ( LAUGHTER ) POSSIBLY AGAINST NORTH KOREA OR MAYBE JAKE TAPPER. SO THIS IS GOING TO ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS, LIKE "ARE THE DEMOCRATS GOING TO FILIBUSTER?" "WILL REPUBLICANS GO NUCLEAR?" AND "WILL GORSUCH GO WITH ONE OF THOSE GINSBURG NECK DOILIES?" ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY NICE. SOAKS UP THE GRAVY WHEN YOU EAT BARBECUE. I WOULD EAT A LOT OF BARBEQUE IF I WAS ON THE BENCH. ( LAUGHTER ) SOME ARE SAYING THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY VOTE ON A TRUMP NOMINEE UNTIL WE FIND OUT IF TRUMP COLLUDED WITH THE RUSSKIES. NOW, WE THOUGHT WE KNEW EVERYTHING RUSSIA DID TO HELP TRUMP -- HACKED THE DNC, GAVE THAT MATERIAL TO WIKILEAKS, SMUGGLED DOLLS INTO OUR COUNTRY -- INSIDE LARGER DOLLS. DIABOLICAL. ( LAUGHTER ) DIABOLICAL. TURNS OUT, THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING THEY DID WAS CHANGE PUBLIC OPINION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE SENATE HEARINGS REVEALED THAT RUSSIA HIRED 1,000 PEOPLE TO CREATE ANTI-CLINTON 'FAKE NEWS' IN KEY STATES DURING THE ELECTION. AND WHEN I SAY FAKE NEWS, THIS IS REAL FAKE NEWS, NOT FAKE FAKE NEWS THAT IS REAL NEWS THAT DONALD TRUMP JUST DOESN'T LIKE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. SEE, THE RUSSIANS HAVE AN INTERNET TROLL OPERATION THAT CREATED FAKE NEWS STORIES, THEN SPREAD THOSE STORIES USING A NETWORK OF HIJACKED PC'S IN ORDER TO "FOOL USERS INTO BELIEVING MISINFORMATION BY ARTIFICIALLY INCREASING SHARES AND RETWEETS." BECAUSE IF ENOUGH PEOPLE SAY SOMETHING IS POPULAR, I MIGHT TRUST THAT IT'S GOOD. IT'S LIKE HOW IF ONE PERSON TELLS ME "TRANSFORMERS" IS A GOOD MOVIE, I MIGHT NOT SEE IT, BUT IF EVERYONE ON FACEBOOK IS RAVING ABOUT IT, I'LL GO. AND BY THE TIME I REALIZE I WAS LIED TO, MEGATRON IS PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DO NOT VOTE FOR THE DESEPTACON.
Jon: OH, I WOULDN'T.
Stephen: AND ACCORDING TO ONE FORMER F.B.I. AGENT, THE RUSSIANS REALIZED TRUMP HIMSELF IS REALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FAKE NEWS. SO THESE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TROLLS "TWEET AT PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING HIGH VOLUMES WHEN THEY KNOW HE'S ONLINE, AND THEY PUSH CONSPIRACY THEORIES." THAT'S ALMOST AS DEVIOUS AS WHEN PUTIN PUT ON A BLOND WIG AND GUEST HOSTED FOX AND FRIENDS. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH.
Jon: I REMEMBER THAT STORY. I LIKED THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS BUT I LIKE HER -- ( LAUGHTER ) PLUS, THERE'S BIG NEWS FROM NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND DAD WHO TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH HIS MODEL AIRPLANES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TOYS, MICHAEL FLYNN. ON THURSDAY, FLYNN OFFERED TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS IN EXCHANGE FOR IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION. THIS LOOKS BAD FOR TRUMP. NOT AS BAD AS MAKING MIKE FLYNN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR BUT, STILL, PRETTY BAD. 'CAUSE THE QUESTION IS: "WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?" AND HOW COULD IT BE ANY WORSE THAN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? AND I THINK THE PRESSURE IS STARTING TO GET TO TRUMP BECAUSE HERE HE IS AT THE BEGINNING OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNING CEREMONY. IT'S FRIDAY.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME VERY, VERY STRONG RESULTS, VERY, VERY QUICKLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MR. PRESIDENT, TODAY WITH YOUR TWEET, WERE YOU TRYING TO TELL THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO GRANT IMMUNITY TO MICHAEL FLYNN? WERE YOU TRYING TO DO THAT, MR. PRESIDENT? WAS THAT YOUR INTENTION, MR. PRESIDENT, SIR? WAS THAT YOUR INTENTION MR. PRESIDENT? WAS THAT YOUR INTENTION, SIR? ( LAUGHTER ) SO HE DIDN'T SIGN THEM?
HE DID NOT SIGN THEM.
HE DIDN'T SIGN THEM, RIGHT?
STEPHEN: HE FORGOT TO SIGN THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNING! ( APPLAUSE ) OH! HE FORGOT TO SIGN THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNING! THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THERE! IT'S LIKE GOING OUT TO DINNER AND ORDERING JUST THE CHECK.
Jon: I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT THE FOOD.
Stephen: BUT IT'S BEEN A BUSY FEW WEEKS FOR THE PRESIDENT. EVERY DAY, HE GETS TO WORK, ROLLS UP HIS SLEEVES AND GIVES A NEW JOB TO JARED KUSHNER. ( LAUGHTER ) SO FAR, KUSHNER IS IN CHARGE OF BROKERING MIDEAST PEACE, NEGOTIATING THE WALL WITH MEXICO, TACKLING AMERICA'S OPIOID EPIDEMIC, FIXING THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN'S AFFAIRS, HANDLING DIPLOMACY WITH CHINA, AND DYEING THE EGGS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG HUNT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M WORRIED THIS MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR ONE GUY.
Jon: HE HAS A LOT.
Stephen: HE MIGHT NEED SOME HELP. YOU KNOW, A BACKUP SON-IN-LAW. SO, TIFFANY, NO PRESSURE, BUT TIC-TOCK. AND THIS WEEKEND, JARED KUSHNER'S TO-DO LIST GOT EVEN LONGER, WHEN HE MADE A SURPRISE VISIT TO IRAQ. HE WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE WITH LESS SECTARIAN VIOLENCE THAN THE WHITE HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ) KUSHNER HAD TO MAKE THE TRIP BECAUSE THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS A MESS. THEY HAVEN'T EVEN HIRED A SPOKESPERSON YET, SO THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD TO CANCEL THEIR DAILY PRESS BRIEFINGS, WHICH HAVE BEEN A FIXTURE SINCE THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) OF COURSE, BACK THEN THE SPOKESMAN WAS HOWDY DOODY. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY DO HAVE SOME PEOPLE WORKING FOR THEM BECAUSE, ON FRIDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE MADE PUBLIC THE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS OF ABOUT 180 STAFFERS. WANT TO GUESS WHICH WHITE HOUSE STAFFER'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES WERE NOT INCLUDED? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT: HE'S THE FATHER-IN-LAW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN IN GOVERNMENT. THE DOCUMENTS REVEALED THAT TRUMP ADVISER OMAROSA RECEIVED A $25,000 WEDDING DRESS FOR APPEARING ON THE TLC SHOW "SAY YES TO THE DRESS." NO WORD YET ON THE MONEY SEAN SPICER HAD TO REPORT FOR HIS APPEARANCE ON "TODDLERS AND TIARAS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) A CROWD PLEASER. THE DISCLOSURES ALSO SHOW THAT SPICER OWNS SEVERAL RENTAL PROPERTIES. AND YOU THINK "YOUR" LANDLORD IS A LIAR. ( LAUGHTER ) "HEY, SEAN, OUR WATER HEATER IS BROKEN." "NO IT'S NOT, AND, FRANKLY, IT'S APPALLING THAT YOU WOULD EVEN QUESTION THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER. THE WATER HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING. IT IS THE HOTTEST WATER IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. PERIOD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) STOP SHAKING YOUR HEAD. STOP SHAKING YOUR HEAD. A JUDGE JUST RULED TRUMP CAN BE SUED FOR INCITING VIOLENCE AGAINST PROTESTERS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALTHOUGH, I'M REALLY MORE UPSET THAT HE INCITED VOTING. ( LAUGHTER ) THE CASE CENTERS ON A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN KENTUCKY, WHEN PROTESTORS WERE THROWN OUT AFTER TRUMP YELLED THIS -- GET 'EM OUT, GET 'EM OUT! GET 'EM OUT. GET OUTTA HERE. GET OUT! GET OUT. GET 'EM OUTTA HERE. GET 'EM THE HELL OUT. GET HIM OUT. GET OUT! GET OUT. GET OUT! GET 'EM OUTTA HERE! OH, GET OUTTA HERE. GET OUTTA HERE. GET OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT!
Stephen: IT SOUNDS BAD THOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE HE WAS JUST DESCRIBING HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN. GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT! ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WELL, AFTER THE RALLY, THE PROTESTORS FILED A LAWSUIT "CLAIMING THAT TRUMP ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE AND THAT THEY WERE THE TARGETS OF RACIAL AND SEXIST SLURS." OR, AS TRUMP CALLS THEM, "CAMPAIGN PROMISES." ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! JASON SUDEIKIS IS HERE! AND I'LL DO A SPECIAL BONUS PERFORMANCE WITH GREEN DAY. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT OVER THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, YOU EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: THESE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME DON'T REALIZE THEY'RE IN FOR A HUGE TREAT BECAUSE YOU AND I AND GREEN DAY --
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: -- PLAYED A SPECIAL SONG TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN THEY WERE HERE. WE DID "GOOD RIDDANCE, TIME OF YOUR LIFE." WE'LL DO A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE OF THAT LATER IN THE SHOW. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW -- MY FIRST GUEST IS MAKING HIS SOPHOMORE APPEARANCE ON THE LATE SHOW. HIS CAREER STATS INCLUDE "HORRIBLE BOSSES," "HALL PASS" AND "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." PLEASE WELCOME, FROM OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, JASON SUDEIKIS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: THERE IT IS. THE BIG MAN.
THAT'S A GOOD FEELING.
Stephen: THE BIG MAN FROM DOWNTOWN.
THAT'S A GOOD FEELING.
Stephen: YOU SHOWED ADMIRABLE HUSTLE OUT THERE. OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE TAPING AT 5:30 TONIGHT AND DON'T KNOW WHO WON THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.
NOT REALLY.
Stephen: NO, WE DON'T LIKELY KNOW. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE TEAM WHO WON BEFORE KNOWING WHO SNIFTS.
I MEAN, JUST GREATLY JOB. GREAT JOB. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HEART. THEY HAD HEART. THEY DIDN'T LET THEIR BRAINS GET IN THE WAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NO, NO THEY DID NOT.
I THINK IT'S ODD FOR US GROWNUPS TO GUESS WHAT A BUNCH OF TEENAGE BOYS ARE GOING TO DO FOR A HALF HOUR BEFORE THEY DO IT, THEN THEY DO IT FOR 40 MINUTES, AND THEN FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR WE'RE SAYING WHY DIDN'T THEY DO WHAT WE WANTED THTHOUGHTTHEY WERE GOING TO DO?
Stephen: YOU THINK ABOUT TEENAGE BOYS A LOT. ( LAUGHTER )
I THINK ABOUT A 3-YEAR-OLD BOY A LOT RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: OH, YOU'VE GOT A 3-YEAR-OLD!
NO, WHY? ( LAUGHTER ) > I'M SORRY FOR THE NORTHWESTERN -- WHAT DO THEY CALL THEM? WILDCATS?
Stephen: THE VICTORS PURPLE CATS! PURPLE AND GREY.
Stephen: WHY WOULD YOU THINK TO HAVE THE JAY HAWK.
DEPENDS ON THE SIGN.
Stephen: HOW BIG DO THEY GET?
IF YOU FEED THEM WELL, NINE, TEN FEET.
Stephen: SORT OF THAT STEVE ROGERS SUPER SOLDIER --
SOME OF THAT GOOD STUFF. THAT AND THE ICE CREAM.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY ABOUT JENNIFER ESPOSITO.
WHY DO YOU LET HER STEAL YOUR THUNDER ABOUT A WESTERN GRAB.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT HIM? H HE'S A WALK-ON.
Stephen: YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? SHE'S THE ALL TIME GREATEST. I HAVE NO BEEF WITH HER. HE COULD PROBABLY AS WALK-ON IN NORTHWESTERN KICK YOUR AS.
Stephen: EVEN AFTER ALL THAT HUSTLE OUT THERE.
ABSOLUTELY MIX BEST GUEST. THE BEST GUEST IS TO LATHER UP, MAKE THE FLOOR SWEATY AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO KEEP HIS FOOTING ON. THAT'S MY ONLY STRATEGY.
Stephen: LET'S GET BACK TO YOUR 3-YEAR-OLD.
PLEASE. I SHOULD BE BACK THERE NOW.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD. YEAH.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED WITH YOU AND YOUR LOVELY WIFE OLIVIA WILDE. ( CHEERING ) YOU GUYS SEEM REALLY COOL, AND YOU'RE FUNNY AND ONE OF YOU IS SO ATTRACTIVE --
YEAH, YEAH. WILL HAVE ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY AND A REASONABLY GOOD LOOKING MAN, BUT SHE'S A DIFFERENT SPECIES.
IT'S A DIFFERENT THING. BONE STRUCTURE, EYE COLOR, LITERALLY JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. I WOULD SAY MY PENIS IS BETTER. I'LL GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT.
Stephen: I'LL BET YOU FIVE BUCKS.
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE BUCKS YOU'RE WRONG!
Stephen: I BET YOU'RE TIED. AT BEST WE'RE TIED. SHE WOULD WIN BECAUSE LOOK AT EVERYTHING ELSE.
Stephen: I'M LEFT WITH WHAT YOU GIVE ME.
TRUE.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU MEET HERE? HOW DID YOU, NO OFFENSE, SCHMO AND GET HER?
NICE THING ABOUT WORKING AT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" PEOPLE SHOW UP AND GET IF YOUR CIRCLE. I HIT HER AT A PARTY FOR "SNL." WE HIT IT OFF THAT NIGHT. WE SORT OF RECONVENED OR, YOU KNOW, REINTRODUCED OURSELVES LATER IN THE FALL.
Stephen: RECONVENED. LET'S RECONVENE.
Stephen: WHY DON'T WE TABLE THIS RELATIONSHIP.
CAN'T DO LATE SPRING, SUMMER'S A MESS, WHAT ABOUT FALL. YEAH, SO THE UNIVERSE HAD MORE PLANNED FOR US IN THE FALL. I ACTUALLY CAME OFF LOOKING A LOT COOLER THAN I REALLY AM BECAUSE I HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE, MUTUAL FRIENDS, ONE OF HER GOOD GIRLFRIENDS WHO WOULD REPORT BACK SAID I THINK SHE'S DATING SOMEWHERE SO I DIDN'T MAKE ANY MOVES.
Stephen: IS THAT THE TRICK, SHOW NO INTEREST? ( LAUGHTER )
NO, JUST DON'T -- I THINK SO. YOU HEAR THAT SOMETIMES. BUT ALL I DID WAS I WAS JUST VERY, VERY BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WHEN I STOPPED BEING BUSY, SHE STOPPED DATING SOMEONE, AND THEN IT WAS OFF TO THE RACES.
Stephen: THE TRICK IS TO SEEM BUSY.
OH, SURE. IN THIS DAY AND AGE, I WOULD SAY, YES. JUST FILL UP YOUR ICALENDAR WITH GOBBLEDY GOOK, DOESN'T MATTER. IF SHE GETS SPECIFIC, THEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. OLIVIA IS NOT AS NOSEY IN THAT REGARD. THEN JUST BE, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL JUST GET RID OF IT. YEAH, LET'S GO OUT. THEN, YEAH.
Stephen: OH, SO LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE CLEARING YOUR SCHEDULE FOR HER.
YEAH, SO YOU'RE NOT LYING.
Stephen: YOU ARE LYING. LITTLE BIT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY. WE CAN --
Stephen: THE TRICK IS LYING.
I LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU GOT THE NEW FILM "COLOSSAL."
I DID.
Stephen: WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED ANNE HATHAWAY.
I DID.
Stephen: WE SET UP A CLIP. THAT WOULD BE TELEVISION. A COUPLE OF PROS, I GUESS, MAKE IT LOOK EASY. I HAD A HARD TIME EXPLAINING. I HAD TO EXPLAIN THREE OR FOUR MINUTES, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? AND I ASKED THE DIRECTOR, NACHO IS HIS NAME.
Stephen: NACHO? YEAH. NACHO VIGALANDO.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUST MADE UP A RACIST NICKNAME FOR HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY?
IT'S IN MY ICALENDAR, I CAN SHOW YOU, IT'S REAL. ( LAUGHTER ) I ASKED, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO PEOPLE? AND HE GOES -- AND I DO A HORRIBLE NACHO ACCENT -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IT'S CALLED SPANISH, BUT GO AHEAD.
BUT NOT TOO SPECIFIC. HE'S JUST, OH, I JUST TELL THE PEOPLE IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO GOES HOME SHE DRINKS AND EVERY TIME SHE DRINKS A MONSTER ATTACKS SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. SO I START TELLING PEOPLE THAT AND I SAY THE WOMAN IS PLAYED BY ANNE HATHAWAY AND PEOPLE SAY, OH, YOU'RE (BLEEP) NUTS.
Stephen: SO SHE'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE MONSTER.
A LITTLE BIT. YOU DON'T FIND OUT HOW BUT YOU FIND OUT THAT.
Stephen: JIM, TRY TO CLEAR THINGS UP HERE.
YEAH, HERE WE GO. HOLY (BLEEP). IT'S BACK. YOU SEE IT?
YOU THERE? A GIANT MONSTER, YEAH. HOLY (BLEEP)! YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS!
WHAT'S IT DOING? IT'S DANCING.  LIKE -- HOLY (BLEEP). IT STOPPED. ( LAUGHTER ) (BLEEP) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >
Stephen: THIS ISN'T A METAPHOR THAT WOMEN ARE MONSTERS THAT DESTROY THINGS, IS IT?
WELL, THAT'S THE THING ABOUT ART, YOU CAN WATCH WHAT YOU SEE -- YOU CAN NEED WHAT YOU NEED TO SEE INTO IT TO MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR YOU. WHEN I LOOK AT IT I JUST THINK IT'S A GREAT LOOKING GUY IN A JEAN JACKET.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. ALSO MYSELF.
Stephen: LISTEN, YOU'RE FROM KANSAS CITY AND YOU GUYS ARE KNOWN FOR YOUR BARBECUE AND YOU LOVE YOUR HOMETOWN'S BARBECUE.
YES.
Stephen: I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, HOME OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAMECOCKS, AND I LOVE MY STATE'S BARBECUE AND I UNDERSTAND MY STATE IS BETTER THAN YOURS BUT YOU PROBABLY FEEL DIFFERENTLY THAN THAT.
MARKEDLY SO.
Stephen: SO WE WENT TO THE TROUBLE --
I'M TALKING ABOUT A CITY, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ENTIRE STATE. BUT HERE WE GO, THIS IS FAIR. ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING SOME OF MY HOME STATE'S BARBECUE RIGHT HERE. THAT'S PULLED PORK. A LOT OF GREAT BARBECUE PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I LIKE BLACK JACK BARBECUE. THIS IS RODNEY SCOTT BARBECUE.
GOTCHA.
Stephen: OKAY, DOWN FROM CHARLESTON.
YEP.
Stephen: NOW, RIGHT HERE, WHO DO WE HAVE HERE, WE GOT THIS BY KANSAS CITY. BY YOUR INSTRUCTIONS, WHO AND WHAT IS THIS.
KANSAS CITY JOE'S BURNED ENDS. KANSAS CITY JOE'S IS IN A GAS STATION. USUALLY THE GAS COMES AFTERWARD, BUT --
Stephen: I'M EATING BURNT ENDS YOU'RE EATING PULLED PORK BARBECUE WITH CAROLINA SAUCE.
LET'S SEE WHAT THIS IS. OH --
Stephen: OH! THAT SUCKS!
AWFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY ABOUT KICKING YOUR TASTE BUDS' BUNS WITH OUR BARBECUE BUT THIS IS -- AH -- YOU KNOW, YOU JUST SLATHER THIS WITH SOME KANSAS CITY BARBECUE, SOME SAUCE, WE CAN SAVED THIS. YOU KNOW?
Stephen: I'M SORRY TO HAVE SCHOOLED YOU BUT I'M GLAD YOU WERE HERE. WE'RE GOING TO ROLL THIS INTERVIEW. SHALL WE USE THIS TONIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE'RE DOING IT! LOOK AT ME, MOM! >
STEPHEN: "COLOSSAL" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. JASON SUDEIKIS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JENNIFER ESPOSITO.  EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US MY NEXT GUEST STARS IN "THE AFFAIR" ON SHOWTIME, AND THIS SEASON JOINED THE CAST OF "NCIS" RIGHT HERE ON CBS.
HEY, HOW'S MOM? OH, UM, MOM'S MOM. SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.
SORRY FOR WHAT? SHE WAS COOL.
YEAH, SHE'S COOL. AND NUTS.
EVERYONE THINKS THEIR MOM IS NUTS.
NOT LIKE MARIE. WHY DO YOU CALL HER THAT? UH, WELL, WHY NOT? I'M BASICALLY THE MOTHER IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, WHY? ? WELL, SHE TOLD ME THE TO. SHE THOUGHT MOM MADE HER SOUND TOO OLD, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY FRIENDS AND I WERE TEENAGERS.
Stephen: OH, AN ORIGINAL COUGAR.
I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A YOUTHFUL QUALITY.
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER ESPOSITO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
HI!
Stephen: HELLO! YOU ARE PHENOMENAL, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: OH! YOU'RE PRETTY GREAT YOURSELF.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOUR BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP.
THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY BIG PLANS? DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, A BIG EVENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
I'M EXCITED FOR THIS BIRTHDAY BECAUSE, LAST BIRTHDAY WAS A BIG TRICKY, GETTING OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP, AND I HAVE A BAKERY. I THINK YOU KNOW I OWN A BAKERY IN THE LOWER EAST SIDE, AND I'M THERE ALL THE TIME, AND JUST GETTING OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE.
Stephen: RIGHT BEFORE YOUR LAST BIRTHDAY.
YES, AND SOMEONE FROM MY PAST THAT I DON'T KNOW SO WELL JUST HAPPENED TO GIVE ME A TEXT AND SAID, I KNOW YOUR BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER.
Stephen: A GUY? IT WAS A GUY. HE SAID, WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER, I KNOW YOU'RE SINGLE NOW. I WAS, LIKE, OH, THAT'S SCARY, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNEW. I MEANT TO SAY, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT, COME ON BY THE BAKERY.
Stephen: YEP. AND YOU KNOW YOUR PHONE, HOW FRIENDLY IT IS SOMETIMES.
Stephen: THE AUTO CORRECT. WITH THE AUTO CORRECT.
Stephen: YEAH. AND I LOOKED DOWN RIGHT AFTER I SENT AND IT SAID, "COME ON MY BACK." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. SO THAT WAS FUN.
Stephen: OKAY. O MY BIRTHDAY CAKE FROM MY FRIEND SAID "HAPPY COME ON MY BACK DAY."
Stephen: DID THE GUY COME BY THE BAKERY?
NO, THANKFULLY.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU HAVE A BAKERY? YOU WERE A SUCCESSFUL, BUSY ACTRESS IS MULTIPLE PROJECTS. HOW DO YOU HAVE TIME FOR A BAKERY?
BECAUSE I'M INSANE. NO, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CILIAC'S DISEASE.
Stephen: WHERE YOU CAN'T PROCESS GLUTEN.
I'M AN ITALIAN GIRL FROM BROOKLYN, I NEED MY BREAD. I NEED MY BREAD OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE HURT PEOPLE ON THE STREET. SO PEOPLE THINK IT'S SUCH A WONDERFUL THING I DID FOR ALL THE COMMUNITY, AND IT WAS, BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE SO I DON'T HARM ANYBODY. I LOVE BREAD SO MUCH, SO I CREATED THESE RECIPES AND I OPENED MY OWN BAKERY.
Stephen: I IS IT BREAD IF THERE IS NO GLUTEN?
I GO ONE STEP FURTHER. THERE'S NO GLUTEN, THERE'S NO GRAIN. IT'S VEGAN AND IT'S ALSO NUT-FREE.
Stephen: OKAY. IT'S FOR ALL OF US PEOPLE WHO WANT TO EAT AND HAVE SOMETHING GOOD, AND I BROUGHT BREAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TASTE IT.
Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE IS NO GRAIN IN IT. CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THAT? ( APPLAUSE )
IT'S PHENOMENAL.
Stephen: SMELLS FANTASTIC. BUT I THINK I CAN SEE GRAIN IN THERE.
NO.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE LITTLE BLACK CHINGS?
CHIA.
Stephen: CHIA? CHIA SEEDS. NOT THE CHI CHI CHIA. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I SEE ROSE MAIR. WHAT'S THE BROWN STUFF THAT MAKES THE LOAF?
A CASAVA, CHIA SEEDS, OLIVE OIL --
Stephen: MAY ANY. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. YEAH, SO I HAVE BEEN MAKING BREAD, AND I'M IN THERE.
Stephen: IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF BREAD.
IT LOOKS LIKE A PIECE OF BREAD. I HAD TO DO THIS. OTHERWISE, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN TROUBLE IN THE STREETS. USUALLY I LIKE TO DIP IT IN SOME OLIVE OIL WITH SOME WINE.
Stephen: DAMN GIRL! RIGHT?!
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GOOD ON THAT?
NO, NO!
Stephen: A LITTLE BARBECUE. ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, GET THAT GOING. MMM, MMM... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! THAT'S GOOD! THE INCREDIBLE THING IS MOSTLY BREAD THAT DOESN'T HAVE GRAIN OR FLOUR TASTES LIKE A HOCKEY PUCK. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WE EVEN HAVE IT IN A MIX YOU MAKE AT HOME.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THIS?
IT WAS NEED. PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK. IT REALLY WAS NEED. MY FRIENDS WOULD BE TORTURED THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS BECAUSE I WOULD BE MAKING THINGS CONSTANTLY IN MY HOUSE AND I WOULD START OUT LIKE FRENCH BREAD AND IT WOULD COME OUT OF THE OVEN AND I'M, LIKE, PIZZA.
Stephen: BUT JUST TRIAL AND ERROR?
I READ EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO READ ABOUT BREAD BAKING AND I LITERALLY KEPT GOING. YEAH, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: YOU MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF, OBVIOUSLY. ( APPLAUSE ) FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'VE ALSO MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF ON INSTAGRAM.
OH.
Stephen: THERE IS A HASHTAG OUT THERE, DAMN IT JENNIFER.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE ORIGIN OF THAT? WHY ARE PEOPLE YELLING AT YOU? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, YOU KNOW, LET'S SEE -- IT'S BECAUSE I STARTED NCIS, IT'S WONDERFUL, EVERYONE IS GREAT, BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN THERE 14 YEARS SAID TO ME, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE. YOU NEED TO SUSTAIN YOUR ENERGY BECAUSE IT'S A LONG ROAD.
Stephen: YEAH. WE DO SOMETHING LIKE 890 EPISODES CURRENT SEASON, THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. WE'RE THERE VERY LONG HOURS AND I START TO GO A LITTLE STIR CRAZY SO I JUST LIKE TO PLAY JOKES ON MY CAST MEMBERS.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU IN THE BACK OF SOMEONE'S TAR.
EMILY'S CAR.
Stephen: YOU STOLE HER KEYS AND ARE WAITING FOR HER TO GET?
SO WE'RE HERE IN THE BACK OF HER CAR AND STOLE HER KEYS. (BLEEP). (BLEEP).
Stephen: I WANT TO POINT OUT YOU GOT A PHOTO OF HER THE MOMENT SHE GOT INTO THE CAR AND JUMPED OUT OF THE BACK SEAT. THIS IS AN UNDOCKETED PHOTO OF THAT MOMENT. ( APPLAUSE ) AND I THINK FOR EVERYONE WHEN I SAY, DAMN IT, JENNIFER!
DAMN IT, JENNIFER.
