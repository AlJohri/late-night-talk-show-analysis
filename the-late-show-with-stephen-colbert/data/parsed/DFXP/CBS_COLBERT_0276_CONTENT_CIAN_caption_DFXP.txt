THIS IS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE IT'S IN POOR TASTE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. 25% IS IN POOR TASTE. COME IN TODAY AND SAVE 35%.
NO, I MEAN EXPLOITING A CIVIL RIGHTS ICON TO SELL MATTRESSES. THAT'S THE PART THAT SEEMS IN POOR TASTE, IS IT JUST ME?
ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT 35% OFF MALL MATTRESSES AND 40% FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
NO, LOOK, MAYBE IT WOULD BE MORE RESPECTFUL TO DR. KING TO NOT SELL MATTRESSES TODAY. BESIDES, THE TWO DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT MUCH IN COMMON, ANYWAY.
DUALLY NOTED BUT CAN WE STILL HAVE A MATTRESS SALE ON COLUMBUS DAY.
OH YEAH, THAT GUY WAS A MONSTER.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, HE WELCOMES SARAH PAUL SEN, COREY STOLL, MISS KAL GUEST NICK GRANTED AND JAN BATISTEMENT NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHOOO!
Stephen: HEY. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE) CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THE DOME? IS IT POSSIBLE? (APPLAUSE) THAT'S UP THERE ALL THE TIME. IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE FITTING TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) FOR ANYONE WHO HAD TODAY OFF, I HOPE YOU SELL BRAITED IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY BY SLEEPING IN SO YOU TOO COULD HAVE A DREAM. (LAUGHTER) DONALD TRUMP OBSERVED THE HOLIDAY BY VISITING THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY, OR MORE ACCURATELY, CANCELING HIS VISIT TO THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY. ALTHOUGH I GUESS IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE GOOD. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS TRUMP LEARNING MORE ABOUT  SEGREGATION.  TRUMP'S BEEN VERY BUSY, VERY BUSY GUY. VERY BUSY GUY. (APPLAUSE) THAT ONE'S FOR YOU, SIR. TRUMP SPENT THE WEEKEND ATTACKING CIVIL RIGHTS ICON JOHN LEWIS ON TWITTER. NOW TO BE FAIR, CONGRESSMAN LEWIS KIND OF STARTED STARTED IT WHEN HE APPEARED ON THE GOATEE REPORT WITH CHUCK TODD AND SAID THIS.
I DON'T SEE PRESIDENT-ELECT AS A LEGITIMATED PRESIDENT.
YOU DO NOT CONSIDER HIM A LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. WHY IS THAT?
I THINK THE RUSSIANS PARTICIPATED IN HELPING THIS MAN GET ELECTED.
Stephen: STRONG WORDS, STRONG, ACCURATE WORDS. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: IN RESPONSE TO THIS OPINION, TRUMP TWEETED, CONGRESSMAN LEWIS SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME ON FIXING AND HELPING HIS DISTRICT WHICH IS IN HORRIBLE SHAPE AND FALLING PART. NOT TO MENTION CRIME INFESTED, RATHER THAN FALSELY COMPLAIN BEING THE ELECTION RESULT. ALL TALK TALK TALK, NO ACTION OR RESULTS. SAD. YES. WELL SAID. JOHN LEWIS IS ALL TALK, TALK, TALK. UNLIKE A REAL LEADER LIKE TRUMP WHO IS ALL TWEET, TWEET, TWEET. SO (APPLAUSE).
Jon: TBEET TWEET, TWEET, TWEET.
Stephen: SO TRUMP SPENT THE MARTIN LUTHER KING WEEKEND ATTACKING A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER WHO MARCHED AND WAS BEATEN WITH DR. KING. WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO ON EASTER, LOSER JESUS DEAD FOR THREE DAYS, THEN WAKES UP, FAKE NEWS, I LIKE GODS WHO DON'T DIE, WHERE IS THE REBIRTH CERTIFICATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Z I DON'T GET IT I GET T I GET.
Stephen: BUDDA YOU'RE FAT. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP HAS BEEN LASHING OUT AT A LOT OF PEOPLE LATELY. HE'S EVEN LASHED OUT AT HIS FRIEND WITH BENEFITS, THE MEDIA. THERE IS A RUMOR GOING AROUND, JUST STARTED THIS LAST WEEK THAT TRUMP MAY EVICT THE PRESS FROM THEIR OFFICES IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HAS GOT TO HE'S GOT TO MAKE ROOM-- HE'S GOT TO MAKE ROOM FOR PUTIN'S D O.J. O IN CASE ARE YOU WONDERING, THIS IS NOT NORMAL. REPORTERS HAVE HAD A WORKSPACE IN THE WHITE HOUSE SINCE TEDDY ROOSEVELT. FUN FACT, BACK THEN THE ROOSEVELT ROOM WAS JUST CALLED THE ROOM. (LAUGHTER) NOW WHY WOULD TRUMP KICK THE PRESS OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE? ACCORDING TO AN ANONYMOUS MEMBER OF THE TRANSITION TEAM THE PRESS IS QUOTE THE OPPOSITION PARTY. I WANT THEM OUT OF THE BUILDING. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE FREE PRESS JOINS TRUMP AND-- ALONG WITH INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS, MERYL STREEP, AND NONABSORB ABT HOTEL MAT-- ABSORBENT HOTEL MATTRESSES. (APPLAUSE) BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, I HOPE THAT RUSSIAN MATTRESS WASN'T A MEMORY FOAM OR-- OR THAT MATTRESS IS GOING TO WAKE UP SCREAMING SOME DAY. BUT MIKE PENCE, REMEMBER MIKE PENCE? MIKE PENCE WANTS YOU TO KNOW IT'S SOMETHING SINNISTER HERE.
ESQUIRE HAS A REPORT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING OF MOVING THE PRESS OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IS THAT A LOGISTICAL MOVE OR PEUN TIFF MOVE.
NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE ON THAT YET. THE WHITE HOUSE IS ACTUALLY 18 ACRES. THEY'RE GIVING SOME CONSIDERATION TO FINDING A LARGER VENUE ON THE 18 ACRES.
Stephen: YEAH, AND IF THEY CAN'T FIND ROOM FOR THEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY WILL JUST SEND THE PRESS TO THAT FARM UPSTATE. YOU KNOW, THEY WILL BE HAPPIER RUNNING AROUND CHASING RABBITS AND ETHIC VIOLATIONS WITH YOUR CHILDHOOD DOG. BUT IF THE PRESS IS BEING KICKED OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ENEMY, THEN WHY DO THEY ALSO WANT THEM TO HAVE MORE ROOM. ACCORDING TO TRUMP PRESS SECRETARY, THIS IS ABOUT GREATER ACCESSIBILITY, MORE PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS. OH, OKAY SO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE PRESS, BUT MAKE ROOM FOR MORE REPORTERS WHO AREN'T THE OPPOSITION. I WONDER WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, WE'VE OBTAINED THIS EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE OF MY IMAGINATION. HMMMM.
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT, SARAH MILLER, TRUE PATRIOT.POWER FLAG, PLEASE REPORT ON THE TOTALLY REAL NEWS THAT NANCY PELOSI IS RUNNING A SEX RING IN THE PIZZA BASEMENT.
WE BUNK THE NEWS, YOU CAN PLEASE EXEXPLAIN WHY ARE YOU SO GREAT.
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT.
FRANK DEWIT FROM FRANK DEWIT'S FACIALBOOK PAGE. WHAT CAN I SAY TO MY MEF U BRIAN AT DIN TORE MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE A REAL SISSY IN FRONT OF HIS GIRLFRIEND.
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT, MR. PRESIDENT.
FROM THE BURGER KING KINGS MENU. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MENU ITEM.
MR. PRESIDENT.
CNN, MR. PRESIDENT THE SCANDALS CONTINUE TO AMALGAMATE-- .
Stephen: I HOPE HE'S OKAY. (APPLAUSE) WOW, MY IMAGINATION TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET INTO AND WHICH GET OUT OF IT REALLY FAST. HERE'S SOME THINGS HE MIGHT HAVE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FAIRLY SOON. THERE HAS BEEN SOME TROUBLE WITH THE INAUGURATION WE STYED-- BESIDES WHO IS BEEN INAUGURATED. THIS PAST WEEKEND AFTER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD DEFINITELY BE PERFORMING FOR TRUMP, BROADWAY STORE JENNIFER HOLLIDAY HAS PULLED OUT OF THE EVENT. (APPLAUSE) SO TALENTED. SUCH A TALENTED, LOVERLY LADY. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE FOOTAGE OF HER OFFICIAL STATEMENT TO THE INAUGURAL COMMITTEE. ♪ I'M NOT GOING.
Stephen: THAT'S FAIR. THAT'S FAIR. BUT AS WE TALKED ON FRIDAY, I TOLD YOU THIS ON FRIDAY, ONE OF TRUMP'S BIG GUESTS WAS SPRINGSTEEN COVER ACT THE B STREET BAND. BUT NOW THEY'VE ALSO WITHDRAWN FROM THE INAUGURAL. (APPLAUSE) THEY'RE OUT.
THE B STREET BAND.
Jon: GET THE C STREET BAND.
Stephen: THISSIVE GOES TRUMPS NO CHOICE NOW BUT TO BOOK MY MUSICAL ACT, THE G STREET BAND, NEW JERSEY BEST B STREET BAND COVER BAND THE SONGS YOU LOVE COVERED AND THEN THOSE COVERS ARE COVERED AGAIN BY US. NOW-- (APPLAUSE) HERE'S SOME SHOCKING NEWS. RINGLING BROTHERS AND BARNUM AND BAILEY IS OFFICIALLY SUTTING DOWN. YEAH. APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY-- APPARENTLY THE CIRCUS DOESN'T THINK THEY COULD COMPETE AGAINST A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. (LAUGHTER) MAKES SENSE. PLUS, WHAT WITH ALL-- WHAT WITH ALL THE MARRIAGES, HE DOES HAVE THREE RINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY KIND. EXACTLY WHAT THAT DESERVED, THANK YOU, JOE. IT'S TOO BAD THE CIRCUS EMPLOYS 500 PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW SADLY PACKING THEIR THINGS AND ALL GETTING TOO A SINGLE CLOWN CAR. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS SAD NEWS FOR EVERY KID THREATENING TO RUN AWAY AND JOIN THE CIRCUS. AND ALSO SAD NEWS FOR EVERY PARENT WITH A CREEPY OLD-FASHIONED KID WHO STILL SAYS STUFF LIKE THAT. THIS REALLY IS, I BELIEVE, THE END OF AN ERA. SINCE THE RINGLING BROTHERS CIRCUS HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR 146 YEARS. WHICH IT MAKES IT THE SECOND LONGEST RUNNING SHOW IN HISTORY RIGHT AFTER THE SAMPSONS. (LAUGHTER) -- SIMPSONS. NOW THE CIRCUS WON'T OFFICIALLY CLOSE UNTIL MAY, SO IF YOU DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT, YOU HAD 150 YEARS. NO ONE FEELS BAD FOR YOU. BUT THE CIRCUS TRADITION, THE CIRCUS TRADITION MAY LIVE ON WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION. AFTER ALL PT BARNUM WAS A FAMOUS SHOWMAN AND SELF-PROMOTER WHO ENDED UP GOING INTO POLITICS LATE IN LIFE. AND WHILE TRUMP WROTE THE ART OF THE 2K50E8, BARNUM ACTUALLY WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE ART OF MONEY GETTING. IT'S AN AWKWARD TITLE BUT HE HADN'T READ THE ART OF WORD USING YET. AND OF COURSE, THOUGH PT BARNUM IS FAMOUS FOR SAYING THERE IS A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE, DONALD TRUMP IS FAMOUS FOR PROVING IT IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT OBAMACARE. TONIGHT'S WERD. STICK AROUND. ♪
Stephen: HAPPY BIRTHDAY. OH MY GOD. THAT'S NICE. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SAY I HAD TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JON, WHAT YEAR WERE YOU BORN?
Jon: I'M BORN IN 1986.
Stephen: YOU WEREN'T EVEN BORN WHEN THAT SONG CAME OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT ALBUM THAT IS FROM?
Jon: IS IT HOTTER THAN JULY.
Stephen: EXACTLY RIGHT. I THOUGHT I COULD TV STUMP YOU BUT I COULD NOT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO.
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE FOR EVEN ATTEMPTING. IT'S NOT ONLY MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY STVMENT ALSO OBAMA'S LAST WEEK IN OFFICE. AND OF COURSE-- OBAMA IS DETERMINED TO PROTECT HIS ENTIRE LEGACY. AND REPUBLICANS ARE JUST AS DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE HIS ENTIRE LEGACY WAS THAT TIME HE WORE MOM JEANS. (LAUGHTER) THEY ARE GOING TO GET RID OF EVERYTHING HE'S DONE STARTING WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY VOTED TO KILL MORE THAN 60 TIMES. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING F AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, TIE TRY TRY TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY, TRY TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY, TRY, TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY, TRY TRY TRY TRY AGAIN. AND THIS TIME-- IS THAT RIGHT? IS THAT RIGHT.
Jon: THAT WAS RIGHT.
Stephen: LET ME DO MY MATH. NOW THIS TIME THE REPUBLICANS MEAN IT. REPUBLICAN SENATOR MIKE ENZI-OF-WYOMING SAID THE OBAMACARE BRIDGE IS COLLAPSING AND WE'RE ENDING IN A RESCUE TEAM. ONE OF THOSE RESCUE TEAMS THAT TEARS DOWN BRIDGES AND GOES HOME. YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO ASSURE PEOPLE CURRENTLY COVERED BY THE LAW THAT HE HAS A PLAN. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THEIR PLAN. IT WILL BE ANOTHER PLAN. BUT THEY WILL BE BEAUTIFULFULLY COVERED.
Stephen: OH, DON'T WORRY, IF YOU ARE LOSING YOUR OBAMACARE YOU WILL BE BEAUTIFULFULLY COVERED. EITHER BY INSURANCE OR SIX FEET OF DIRT. EITHER WAY, JUST BEAUTIFUL. SO NICE. SO BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE GOING TO TRAMP THE DIRT DOWN, WE'LL TRAMP IT DOWN ALL SMOOTH. IT'S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL. SO WE KNOW REPUBLICANS, WE KNOW REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO REPLACE IT. AND THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US WITH WHAT. BUT I THINK THEY'VE GIVEN US A HINTED. AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WERD. REPEAL AND ERASE. EVERYONE IN THE GOP IS ON BOARD WITH KILL OG BAMACARE. AND PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP KNOWS HOW IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN.
IT WILL BE REPEAL AND REPLACE. IT IT WILL BE ESSENTIALLY SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT WILL BE VARIOUS SEGMENTS, YOU UNDERSTAND, BUT WILL MOST LIKELY BE ON THE SAME DAY OR THE SAME WEEK BUT PROBABLY THE SAME DAY. COULD BE THE SAME HOUR.
Stephen: YEAH. SAME HOUR, SAME MINUTE, MAYBE THE SAME SECOND, HELL, ALL THINGS IN HISTORY MAY HAPPEN AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME IF CONGRESS CAN JUST GET THE DELOREAN TO GENERATE 1.21 JIGGAWATTS.
THANK YOU, SENATOR SANDERS. JUST ONE PROBLEM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THEIR PLAN TO REPEAL AND REPLACE. IT'S THE REPLACE PART. JUST ASK REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND MOM'S FIRST BOYFRIEND AFTER THE TORS-- DIVORCE TOM COTTON. HE SAID QUOTE WE HAVEN'T COALESCED AROUND A SOLUTION FOR SIX YEARS IN PART BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPLICATED. YEAH, IT'S JUST SO DARN COMPLICATED. REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE A DOG THAT FINALLY CATCHES THE CAR HE'S BEEN CHASING FOR SIX YEARS. HE CRASHES INTO IT, THEN CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE VET BECAUSE THEY REPEALED FIDO-CARE. AND HERE'S THE THING. REPEAL WITHOUT REPLACE COULD CAUSE POLITICAL BACKLASH BECAUSE UNDER OBAMACARE 20 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN HEALTH INSURANCE. OVER 6 MILLION OF WHOM ARE TRUMP'S CORE SUPPORTERS. THEY ARE WHITE, WHITE, WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS. AND REPEALING OBAMACARE WITHOUT REPLACING IT WOULD COST 3 MILLION JOBS. WHAT ARE THOSE PEOPLE GOING TO DO FOR WORK. AND IT'S ESTIMATED, IT'S ESTIMATED THE REPEAL WOULD COST $1.5 TRILLION. NOW 1.5 TRILLION MIGHT SOUND LIKE A LOT, BUT FOR THAT MUCH MONEY, YOU ALSO DON'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE. OF COURSE WE WON'T KNOW THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS UNTIL THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE RELEASES ITS REPORT WHICH BY LAW IT MUST DO FOR ANY BILL OVER $5 BILLION. WITH ONE, THIS IS KIND OF FUNNY EXCEPTION, THANKS TO NEW RULES PASSED BY THE REPUBLICANS, THIS LAW SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THAT'S RIGHT. THE GOP IS SO CONFIDENT THE REPEAL WILL SAVE MONEY, THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE. AND IF CONGRESS CAN MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR US TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE, I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE STUMBLED ON THE REPLACEMENT. JUST MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR YOUR DOCTOR TO TELL YOU YOUR DIAGNOSIS. THAT WAY, THAT WAY YOU'LL NEVER NEED INSURANCE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW. WELL, MR. JOHNSTON, HAVE I YOUR CHART RIGHT HERE. LET'S SEE. AND I CAN'T LEGALLY TELL YOU HOW YOU ARE. U H, JUST MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR DAY. AND HERE'S A HINT, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE EXPIRATION DATES ON YOUR FOOD. YOUR MILK'S GOING TO BE FINE. SO REPUBLICANS, SOO REPUBLICANS ARE RIGHT TO KEEP NEWS THE DARK. I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS SCREWING ME, I LIKE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS OFF. AND THAT'S THE WERD.
