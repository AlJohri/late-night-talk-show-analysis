PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST TWEETED-- AND IT IS ALMOST LITERALLY A BOMBSHELL-- RESPONDING TO KIM JONG-UN, THE PRESIDENT TWEETED-- AND I QUOTE, "NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN JUST STATED THAT THE NUCLEAR BUTTON IS ON HIS DESK AT ALL TIMES. I, TOO, HAVE A NUCLEAR BUTTON BUT IT IS A BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL ONE THAN HIS, AND MY BUTTON WORKS."
SO, GUYS, IT'S JUST YOU AND YOUR BUTTON, AND THE MOOD IS RIGHT FOR TOTAL ANNIHILATION. BUT THEN BUTTON DYSFUNCTION GETS IN THE WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? PLENTY OF WORLD LEADERS HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THANKFULLY, THERE'S VIAGRA-GEDON. VIAGRA-GEDON HELPS LEADERS WITH B.D. INCREASE THE SIZE OF THEIR NUCLEAR BUTTONS SO THEY CAN FEEL BIG AND IMPORTANT.
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IS YOUR HEART IS HEALTHY ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE WORLD. DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA-GETON IF YOU ARE SANE.
VIAGRA-GEDON-- DO WE ALL HAVE TO DIE BECAUSE YOUR PENIS IS SMALL?
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TINY HANDS, BIG BUTTON. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES AMERICA FERRARA DAVID HARBOUR AND MUSICAL GUEST JULIEN BAKER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: ANNIVERSARY NICE. LOVELY. INVIGORATING. HEY, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH. PLEASE SIT DOWN, FOLKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELCOME, WELCOME--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE JUST-- THEY'RE JUST-- THEY'RE JUST SCREAMING TO KEEP WARM, YOU REALIZE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. AND IT IS GREAT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BACK AT YOU. NO, BACK AT YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, ALL OF YOU HERE, TOGETHER, PHYSICALLY INTABLGHT, SKIN STILL FIRMLY ON OUR FACES. BECAUSE I BRING IT UP, ONLY BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL STORY-- YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF IT-- TONIGHT WE'RE CLOSER TO THERMONUCLEAR THAN LAST NIGHT, WHICH IS A FUN FACT. AND IT ALL STARTED ON-- NEW YEAR'S DAY? NEW YEAR'S DAY. WHEN NORTH KOREAN LEADER AND STACKABLE DICTATOR, KIM JONG-UN, BRAGGED, "IT'S NOT A MERE THREAT BUT A REALITY THAT I HAVE A NUCLEAR BUTTON ON THE DESK IN MY OFFICE." YES, IT'S TRUE-- ANALYSTS DIDN'T THINK NORTH KOREA WOULD EVER ACHIEVE THE TECHNOLOGY NECESSARY TO CREATE A DESK.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND IT WAS TERRIFYING. IT WAS A TERRIFYING THREAT FROM A DESPERATE NATION LED BY AN UNSTABLE MADMAN, SO OUR PRESIDENT MET WITH HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DE-ESCALATE THIS POTENTIALLY CATACLYSMIC CONFRONTATION.  (  LAUGHTER  ) I'M JUST KIDDING. HE TWEETED: "NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN JUST STATED THAT THE 'NUCLEAR BUTTON IS ON HIS DESK AT ALL TIMES.' WILL SOMEONE FROM HIS DEPLETED AND FOOD-STARVED REGIME PLEASE INFORM HIM THAT I, TOO, HAVE A NUCLEAR BUTTON, BUT IT IS A MUCH BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL ONE THAN HIS, AND MY BUTTON WORKS!" FIRST OF ALL, MR. TRUMP, YOU SHOULD BE BRAGGING ABOUT THE SIZE OF YOUR MISSILES. OKAY? BUTTONS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW IF HE KNOWS THIS-- TRADITIONALLY, BUTTONS ARE KIND OF A LADY PART.  ( LAUGHTER ) AS IN, "I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS WHERE TO FIND THE BUTTON."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLUS-- I HOPE. I HOPE NOT. DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. PLUS, INTERESTING FACT ABOUT THE NUCLEAR BUTTON:  THERE IS NO BUTTON. IT IS NOT REAL. IT'S A METAPHOR. UNLESS THEY PUT A PHONY BUTTON ON TRUMP'S DESK. RIGHT BETWEEN THE ONE THAT ORDERS HIM A COKE AND THE ONE HE PRESSES TO HEAR WHAT THE COW SAYS. "STUPID COW, FAKE MOOS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) OBVIOUSLY-- MY FAVORITE JOKE. OBVIOUSLY--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE KIDDING, AND WE KID BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DIE. AT LEAST I DON'T WANT TO DIE THIS STUPID, YOU KNOW. I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING WITH MORE DIGNITY, LIKE SLIPPING ON A ROLLER SKATE INTO THE MOUTH OF A YAWNING POLAR BEAR. OR CHOKING ON GUM WHILE DANCING IN MY UNDERWEAR TO HUEY LEWIS AND THE NEWS. OR BEING STRUCK BY THE OSCAR MEYER WIENER MOBILE, SURVIVING, ONLY TO BE RUN OVER BY ITS COMPETITOR, THE HEBREW NATIONAL BEEFWAGON.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MEANWHILE-- THAT WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO DIE. MEANWHILE, REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SILENT ABOUT THIS. NOTHING ABOUT THE RISK OF THERMONUCLEAR RESPONSE-- OH, OBVIOUSLY, OTHER THAN MITCH McCONNELL. ♪ DUCK AND COVER ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: BUT, REMEMBER, KIDS, UNDER THE DESK. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A WAY, THOUGH, I REALLY DO THINK THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO CALM TRUMP DOWN ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIS BUTTON. THIS IS A MESSAGE FOR THE PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT OBAMA.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SIR, YOU'VE GIVEN A LOT FOR THIS COUNTRY, BUT WE NEED ONE MORE THING. WE NEED YOU TO GO ON NATIONAL TV AND SAY TRUMP'S PENIS IS BIGGER THAN YOURS. NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU, BUT ONLY ONE PERSON HAS TO. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SIR, WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN THE MEANTIME-- THINK HE'LL DO IT? DO YOU THINK HE'LL DO IT? I THINK HE WILL. HE'S A GOOD MAN. IN THE MEANTIME, IF I'M GONNA DIE, I'M GONNA DIE DOING WHAT I LOVE. HIT IT ♪ IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE ♪ IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE ♪ BUT TODAY--  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT TODAY, WE LEARNED WHY TRUMP MAY BE ACTING LIKE THIS. ACCORDING TO A NEW BOOK CALLED "FIRE AND FURY," DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. HE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO WIN. THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT: THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN VOTERS.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRUMP--  ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP WAS PLANNING ON FAILING AND WALKING AWAY WITH THE FAME AND THE MONEY. OR, AS THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES IT, "THIS WAS A REAL-LIFE VERSION OF MEL BROOKS' 'THE PRODUCERS.'" IN SOME WAYS, IT STILL IS. JUST LOOK AT ALL THE HAPPY NAZIS!
Jon: OOOOH.
Stephen: WHAT? AM I BEING TOO HARD ON NAZIS? I DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAD SO MANY NAZI FANS HERE TONIGHT.  ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A BRILLIANT PLAN. BUT THEN TRAGEDY STRUCK: HE WON. DONALD JR. TOLD A FRIEND THAT, ON ELECTION NIGHT, "HIS FATHER LOOKED AS IF HE HAD SEEN A GHOST. MELANIA WAS IN TEARS-- AND NOT OF JOY." REALLY, MELANIA CRIED ON ELECTION NIGHT. THAT IS THE FIRST THING WE HAVE IN COMMON.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OTHER THAN, OF COURSE, OUR SMOKY EYES.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS ) THANK YOU. NO, THANK YOU. THE CAMPAIGN WAS IN SUCH DISARRAY THAT HIS CLOSEST ADVISORS HAD NO FAITH IN HIM, LIKE TRUMP STRATEGIST AND VINCENT D'ONOFRIO FROM "MEN IN BLACK," STEVE BANNON. "GOT ANY SUGAR WATER?" WHEN HE CAME ON BOARD IN AUGUST, BANNON THOUGHT THE CAMPAIGN WAS DONE FOR. HE DESCRIBED IT AS "THE BROKE DICK CAMPAIGN." OUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENT WAS A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. BUT IN TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN EARLY ON, "A CAMPAIGN STAFFER WAS SENT TO EXPLAIN THE CONSTITUTION TO THE CANDIDATE." YOU CAN'T HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE CONSTITUTION IS. THAT'S LIKE A PILOT SAYING, "ATTENTION, PASSENGERS, WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS HOUSTON SO JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE FLIGHT. ONE QUICK THING, IF ANYONE BACK THERE KNOWS HOW TO GET TO HOUSTON AND LAND A PLANE, PLEASE, JUST PUSH YOUR CALL BUTTON. AND I'M NOT SURE WHICH BUTTON THAT ONE STHOUGH."  (  LAUGHTER  )
AND NOBODY IN TRUMP'S CIRCLE SEEMED TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. DURING THE TRANSITION TRUMP CALLED MURDOCH TO FLOAT A PLAN THAT MURDOCH THOUGHT WOULD ALIENATE HIS BASE. WHEN HE GOT OFF THE PHONE, MURDOCH REPORTEDLY SHRUGGED AND SAID, "WHAT A (BLEEP) IDIOT." TWO THINGS, MR. MURDOCH, ONE, YOU'RE AN AUSTRALIAN. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT THAT WAY. AND, 2, IS AUSTRALIA CURRENT ACCEPTS APPLICATION? BECAUSE I'VE HEARD OUR PRESIDENT IS A (BLEEP) IDIOT. EVEN TRUMP--  ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, MR. MURDOCH. ALL OF THIS PROVES ONCE AGAIN, WHICH IT COMES TO MR. TRUMP EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS. HIS ENTIRE SCHTICK IS JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU YOU'RE CRAZY FOR SEEING WHAT'S OBVIOUS WHICH MAKES SENSE. THAT'S BASICALLY HOW YOU SELL LUXURY REAL ESTATE. WAIT, WHY IS THIS SO EXPENSIVE? AND WHY IS YOUR NAME ON THE BUILDING YOU?  DIDN'T EVEN BUILD IT? "I'LL TELL YOU, BECAUSE IT'S GOT GOLD LEAF AND FAUX MARBLE FLOORS AND LOTS OF FANCY FRENCH STUFF LIKE A BIDET AND A FOYER. BY THE WAY, DON'T GET THOSE TWO CONFUSED." TRUST ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS EXACTLY HOW YOU THINK IT IS? TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA. ONCE AGAIN, LET'S GO TO ANOTHER BOMBSHELL FROM FORMER TRUMP ADVISER AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR SYPHILIS GETS HERPES, STEVE BANNON.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN HIS BOOK-- IN THIS BOOK--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN THIS SAME BOOK, BANNON UNLOADED ON DON JR. FOR HIS INFAMOUS TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH RUSSIANS, SAYING, "EVEN IF YOU THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS NOT TREASONOUS OR UNPATRIOTIC OR BAD (BLEEP)-- AND I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S ALL OF THAT-- YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE F.B.I. IMMEDIATELY." SO HE THINKS MANAFORT, DON JR., AND KUSHNER DID SOMETHING "TREASONOUS, UNPATRIOTIC, AND BAD (BLEEP)." COINCIDENTALLY, THOSE ARE ALSO THEIR  SECRET SERVICE CODE NAMES. (BLEEP) BEST OF ALL-- YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE WELCOME. WORST OF ALL, BANNON THINKS THEY DID IT WRONG. "THE THREE SENIOR GUYS IN THE CAMPAIGN THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO MEET WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INSIDE TRUMP TOWER," WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT AT "A HOLIDAY INN IN MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE." SO HE'S BASICALLY SAYING "IT WAS UNPATRIOTIC TREASON! HERE'S HOW I WOULD HAVE DONE IT."  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND BANNON THINKS THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THEIR LAWYERS THERE SO ANY INFORMATION COULD THEN BE DUMPED DOWN TO BREITBART, OR MAYBE SOME OTHER, MORE-LEGITIMATE PUBLICATION. MORE LEGITIMATE THAN BREITBART? SO BAZOOKA JOE COMICS. AND AND THE PLACEMAT AT LONG JOHN SILVERS. FIND THE MAIZE. GO THROUGH THE MAZE. THE COLLUSION IS AT THE CENTER OF THE MAZE. AND BANNON IS NOT CONFIDENT THAT DON JR. CAN HANDLE THE PRESSURE OF TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS, SAYING, "THEY'RE GOING TO CRACK DON JR. LIKE AN EGG ON NATIONAL TV." THEY SURE ARE. CNN IS ALREADY RUNNING A PROMO.
THIS IS THE SENATE. THIS IS DON JR. TESTIFYING BEFORE THE SENATE. ANY QUESTIONS?
Stephen: YEAH, I HAVE A QUESTION. HOW SOON CAN THAT HAPPEN? THIS AFTERNOON--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SUPERBOWL RATINGS. SUPERBOWL RATE.  RATINGS. THIS AFTERNOON, TRUMP FIRED BACK HARD. "STEVE BANNON HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME OR MY PRESIDENCY. WHEN HE WAS FIRED, HE NOT ONLY LOST HIS JOB. HE LOST HIS MIND." NOW ALL HE HAS TO DO IS LOSE HIS DOG, AND HE'S GONNA HAVE AN AWESOME COUNTRY SONG.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STILL--  ( APPLAUSE ) STILL, "LOST HIS MIND"? THAT'S HARSH. WHAT KIND OF STUFF HAS BANNON BEEN SAYING SINCE HE WAS FIRED?
EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD GET DOWN EVERY NIGHT AND THANK GOD DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
Stephen: CLEARLY INSANE.  ( APPLAUSE ) DONALD TRUMP EVEN DOWNPLAYED BANNON'S ROLE ON THE CAMPAIGN, SAYING, "STEVE WAS A STAFFER WHO WORKED FOR ME AFTER I HAD ALREADY WON THE NOMINATION" YEAH, BANNON WAS JUST A STAFFER. OR AS SOME PEOPLE PRONOUNCE IT "CAMPAIGN C.E.O."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THOUGH, TRUMP ARGUED, "STEVE HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH OUR HISTORIC VICTORY." I DO AGREE WITH TRUMP THERE. THAT VICTORY WAS THE SELFLESS, UNCREDITED WORK OF ONE EAGER YOUNG STAFFER. TRUMP, TRUMP-- NEVER-- NEVER LEARNED HIS NAME. DON'T KNOW WHO THAT KID IS. THAT KID'S GOING PLACES.
Jon: I NEVER MET HIM, YEAH.
Stephen: TRUMPED WRAPPED IT ALL UP BY SAYING THAT WHILE HE AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE TRYING TO BUILD THE COUNTRY BACK UP, BANNON IS "SIMPLY SEEKING TO BURN IT ALL DOWN." THIS GUY'S CRAZY. I MEAN, HE GOT ME ELECTED. EVEN I DIDN'T WANT THAT." WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. AMERICA FERRARA IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, DONALD TRUMP WANTS HIS OWN AWARD SHOW. STICK AROUND.

Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE!
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IT'S AWARD SEASON. SUNDAY IS THE GOLDEN GLOBES. I'M NOT NOMINATED, SO DON'T WATCH. BUT ON MONDAY, THERE'S AN AWARD SHOW EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE GLUED TO, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, IN BETWEEN THREATENING NUCLEAR WAR AND GOING TO SLEEP WITH HIS BED-CHEESEBURGER, DONALD TRUMP TWEETED, "I WILL BE ANNOUNCING THE MOST DISHONEST AND CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR ON MONDAY AT 5:00. SUBJECTS WILL COVER DISHONESTY AND BAD REPORTING IN VARIOUS CATEGORIES FROM THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. STAY TUNED!" OH, I WILL BE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF ANY PART OF YOUR PRESIDENCY. IT'S LIKE WATCHING A SNAKE SWALLOW DEMOCRACY. PERSONALLY, I'M EXCITED FOR "THE MOST DISHONEST AND CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR," OR AS WE CALL THEM IN THE BIZ, "THE FAKIES." BECAUSE NOTHING GIVES YOU MORE CREDIBILITY THAN DONALD TRUMP CALLING YOU A LIAR. AND I, OF COURSE, DON'T WANT TO GET SNUBBED. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- I HAVE PLACED A BILLBOARD IN TIMES SQUARE-- "THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES SQUARE"-- AN  (  LAUGHTER  ) PURCHASED A FULL-PAGE AD ON MY TWITTER FEED WITH A "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION" AD.

THANK YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S JUST GREAT. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
I FEEL GOOD! I FEEL REALLY GOOD. YOU KNOW, ASIDE FROM A COMPLETELY SOBER NEW YEAR'S EVE, IT'S GOING WELL.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T HIT THE CLUBS OR THE PHONE PIT OR BOTTLE SERVICE OR ANY OF THAT STUFF.
I DID NOT HIT THE CLUBS BOF, BUT MY DEAR HUSBAND BUILT ME A CLUB IN THE APARTMENT-- WHICH MEANS HE GOT LIGHTS AND A FOG MACHINE.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY, HE BUILT YOU A CLUB?
HE DID.
Stephen: HOLD ON TO THIS ONE.
I THINK I WILL. I WAS STONE-COALED SOBER SO IT SORT OF FELT LIKE A JUNIOR HIGH PARTY EVERYONE ELSE WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME.
Stephen: HOW QUICKLY DID YOU GET THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE AFTER MIDNIGHT?
RIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. IT WAS, "HAPPY NEW, I'M PREGNANT, GOOD-BYE."
Stephen: FIRST CHILD. PREGNANCY IS SUPER EASY. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT  (  LAUGHTER  ).
THANK YOU.
Stephen: MY WIFE SAID IT'S JUST GREAT.
I HEARD.
Stephen: NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. EXCEPT THE VERY LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES.  ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, YOU DID SOMETHING-- OH, I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. I ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK THIS. YOU ARE ABOUT TO BE A MOTHER, AND YOU'VE GOT TO NAME YOUR CHILD. YOU'RE NAMED AMERICA YOURSELF. ARE YOU THINKING OF NAMING YOUR CHILD-- WOULD YOU RECOMMEND NAMING YOUR CHILD AFTER A LAND MASS OR IDEA. WOULD YOU WANT TO NAME YOUR CHILD SOMETHING LIKE AMERICA?
I'M GOING TO GO WITH NO. I'M GOING TO GO WITH --
Stephen: HAS IT BEEN A BURDEN BEING CALLED AMERICA?
LOOK, I LOVE MY NAME NOW. BUT GROWING UP WITH THE NAME AMERICA IS NOT EASY. AND I JUST-- I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT ON MY CHILD. BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE. SO I'M GOING TO GO WITH SOMETHING THAT IS MORE OF, LIKE, A NAME.
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
YEAH.
Stephen: STEPHEN'S A NICE NAME.
STEVE SEN A NICE NAME.
Stephen: VERY PRETTY NAME. GOOD ON A GIRL. THIS IS A VERY, VERY SWEET PICTURE. HERE ARE YOU WITH SOME FRIENDS. YOU PEEFTED THIS ON INSTAGRAM YESTERDAY. THERE IT IS. THERE'S YOUR BABIA MALE OR FEMALE-- BEING INDUCTED INTO SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Stephen: THOSE ARE MAGICAL PANTS, RIGHT?
BLAKE'S WEARING THE MAGIC PANTS.
Stephen: SHE'S WEARING THE MAGIC PANTS?
YES.
Stephen: AND I'M NOT UP ON THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS AS I SHOULD BE. THEY FIT ALL OF YOU--
MAGICALLY.
Stephen: MAGICALLY. WOULD THE TRAVELING PANTS FIT YOU THROUGH ALL NINE MONTHS OF YOUR PREGNANCY?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD "MAGIC" MEANS, STEPHEN? YES. THEY'RE MAGIC! THEY WOULD FIT ME ALL TIMES.
Stephen: SPEAK OF MAGIC, WHO WOULD WIN ARAGORN OR-- THAT GUY WANTS TO KNOW. HE'S ABOUT--
ARE THOSE --
Stephen: IN A FIGHT WOULD WILLINGLESS OR ARAGORN WIN.
ARE THOSE DRAG GLONS OKAY, OKAY! YES, THEY ARE. YOU'RE A GUEST SO I WILL SAY YES, THEY ARE. HAVE YOU SEEN "LORD OF THE RINGSES?"
I'VE SEEN "GAME OF THRONES."
Stephen: OKAY! IT'S LIKE THAT.
IT'S LIKE THAT.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE THAT, BUT LESS, YOU KNOW, (BLEEP).
WHICH IS WHY I HAVEN'T SEEN TI GUESS.
Stephen: THAT'S PROBABLY WHY, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY. I FORGOT WHERE WE WERE. I APOLOGIZE. YOU WERE PART OF THE METOO CAMPAIGN. AND I HELPED START SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN CALLED "TIME'S UP." ON MONDAY, YOU AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD LAUNCHED THIS CAMPAIGN. TELL ME WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
IT'S CALLED "TIME'S UP," AND IT'S A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS STARTED BY, AS YOU SAY, HUNDREDS OF WOMEN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY WHO CAME TOGETHER TO SAY WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE OUR RESOURCES, OUR ACCESS, OUR PLATFORM TO BETTER-- CONDITIONS FOR WOMEN ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES IN THE WORKPLACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IT'S-- AND WE'RE STAYING, YOU KNOW-- WE'RE SAYING TIME'S UP ON SILENCE, TIME'S UP ON WAITING FOR THINGS TO CHANGE, TIME'S UP ON ANY BEHAVIOR OR CULTURE THAT MAKES WOMEN LESS SAFE IN THE WORKPLACE. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND L.G.B.T.Q. PEOPLE AND DISABLED PEOPLE AND ANYONE ELSE. IT STANDS FOR ALL OF US.
Stephen: WELL, I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A VERY PRACTICAL ASPECT TO IT, TOO. YOU HAVE RAISED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
WE ANNOUNCED THE TIME'S UP LEGAL DEFENSE FUND AND IT'S TO HELP MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES FIGHT THEIR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES AND WE'VE RAISED OVER $14 MILLION.
Stephen: SO IF IT WAS A WOMAN-- SO IF THERE WAS A WOMAN IN, SAY, NOT QUITE AS A HIGH-PROFILE INDUSTRY OF YOURS WHO WAS FACING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE WORKPLACE, SHE COULD GO TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THIS FUND SO SHE COULD HAVE PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATIONS?
YES, SHE WOULD GO TO THE TIMESUPNOW.COM WEBSITE AND SEARCH FOR THE RESIEWRSZ WOMEN AND MEN, IT REPRESENTS WOMEN AND MEN-- AND SUBSIDIZES THEIR LEGAL DEFENSE.
Stephen: NOW, WE'RE COMING UP ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE WOMEN'S MARCH, THE LARGEST SINGLE MARCH EVER IN THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
YES.
Stephen: AND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, YOU WERE THE OPENING SPEAKER.
I WAS, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT AN AMAZING THING TO HAVE DONE. WHAT AN HONOR.
IT WAS.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE, TIME'S UP, THAT THERE WOULD BE THE HARVE ME TOO MOVEMENT IN RESPONSE TO DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS A-- BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT HIMSELF TO RAISE AWARENESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AND ACTIVATE PEOPLE TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE MARGINALIZATION AND NEEDS AND THE ABUSE AGAINST WOMEN.
METOO WAS STARTED BY TERON-A BURKE IN 2006, BEFORE THERE WERE HASHTAGS, THE WORK WHETHER ME TOO OR THE WOMEN'S MARCH OR WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS CUMULATIVE. IT'S A CONVERGENCE OF SO MANY MOVEMENMOVEMENTS AND SO MUCH WOR BUILDS A FOUNDATION, AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE CULTURE IS RIPE FOR SHIFTING. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THAT THING IS GOING TO TOPPLE THAT ALLOWS FOR A WATERSHED OF WOMEN AND PEOPLE TO FIND THEIR VOICES AND SAY, "NO MORE," CALL B.S. ON THE SILENCE AND THE ACCEPTING OF THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS MOMENT IS AND FEELS LIKE. AND SO IT'S ALL CREDITED. AND IT'S ALL-- IT ALL BUILDS ON ITSELF. AND THIS IS A TRUE EXAMPLE OF US STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF SO MANY WHO HAVE COME BEFORE US. AND THE GOAL OF TIME'S UP IS NOT TO RECREATE OR EVEN BEGIN THE WORK. WE DIDN'T BEGIN THE WORK. WE'RE HERE TO AMPLIFY THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE FOR GENERATIONS TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE EQUAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: NO, NO, DO YOU HAVE YOUR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH READY?
AH, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I LOVE GIVING SPEECHES. LIKE, I GAVE A SORT OF BIG, ROWDY, PASSIONATE ONE AT THE SAGA, WARDS THAT PEOPLE KIND OF SAW. AND I DON'T-- I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD I SAY TO, LIKE, TOP THAT? VERBALLY, I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT I COULD TOP THAT. I FEEL LIKE THE ONLY WAY THAT I COULD WOULD BE THROUGH THE POWER OF DANCE.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY-- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN MIND?
I KNOW THAT YOU-- I MEAN, YOU EXEMPLIFIED SOME OF YOUR SKILLS TONIGHT WHICH WERE EXTRAORDINARY.
Stephen: THANK YOU.

Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.
NOVICES.

Stephen: IT'S A FAMILY SHOW.
OH! OWWWW!

IT'S A FAMILY SHOW. LET'S KEEP IT CLEAN, KIDS.
Stephen: THIS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. I KNOW WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT PROJECTS BUT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. MIRIAM WEBSTER DICTIONARY-- THIS IS A GREAT HONOR-- UNDER THE ENTRY FOR "BAD BOD" IN MIRIAM WEBSTER, THEY PUT YOUR PICTURE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNDER "DAD BOD." CONGRATULATIONS NO, CONGRATULATIONS.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WIN EMMYS.
Stephen: YEAH, NOT US.
SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: YEAH. A QUICK QUESTION:  DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?
I DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: YOU TECHNICALLY CAN'T HAVE A DAD BOD. YOU JUST HAVE A BOD.
OR YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING ACTOR, THAT IT GOES BEYOND EVEN HAVING CHILDREN TO THIS PLACE WHERE WHEREYOU HAVE STUDIED DADS SO INTENSELY AND THEIR BODS, THAT YOU'VE JUST INCORPORATED ONE, YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT. SO IT ACTUALLY-- YOU JUST-- JUMPS OVER THE CHILDREN PART.
Stephen: YEAH. HOW DO YOU KNOW-- IF YOU'RE NOT-- HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE ACHIEVED DAD BOD?
I DID HAVE A MOMENT, LIKE, YEARS AGO. I REMEMBER AN AUDITION. I-- I GOT CALLED TO AUDITION FOR A CHARACTER IN THE "X" MEN SERIES CALLED "THE BLOB" RIGHT WHICH IS A CHARACTER WHO CONTROLS GRAVITATIONAL FORCES WITH THE STOMACH, BASICALLY.
Stephen: HIS MASS.
YEAH, HE'S A BIG DUDE. AND I REMEMBER AT THE END OF THE AUDITION I MADE A TAPE AND AT THE END OF THE AUDITION I KIND OF PULLED UP MY SHIRT A LITTLE BIT AND SQUEEZED MY BODY AND SAID, "I HAVE YOUR BLOB RIGHT HERE." THE DIRECTOR WAS VERY INTERESTED IN ME, AND I MET WITH HIM, AND HE SAID, DAVID, WE LOVE YOU. WE THINK YOU'RE WONDERFUL. YOU'RE A WONDERFUL ACTOR. WE'RE JUST A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR-- ABOUT SOMETHING." I WAS LIKE, "THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS. LET'S DO THIS."
