DEAR SANTA, MEET ME AT TRUMP TOWER. BRING DIRT ON HILLARY AND A LIVE RHINO, TO SHOOT. DONNIE JR. "SANTA, YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR TOYS MADE BY CHILDREN IN BANGLADESH. MUCH CHEAPER THAN ELVES! IVANKA." "DEAR SANTA, PLEASE DON'T LET MY FATHER RETURN ME TO THE ISLAND OF MISFIT SONS. ERIC." HE MISSPELLED "FATHER" AND "ERIC." "DEAR SANTA, IF I HAVE TO LIVE WITH A FAT WHITE GUY WITH RIDICULOUS HAIR, CAN IT BE YOU? MELANIA."
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT IT'S MORE MOORE. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES MARK HAMILL AND BOBBY FLAY FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU! ALL GOOD? EXCELLENT. HEY, EVERYBODY! JON BATISTE! AS I LIVE AND BREATHE. HOW'S ITIN IT GOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, SIT DOWN! YOU'RE VERY KIND. SIT DOWN! PLEASE, ENJOY THE SEATS! WHAT DO I HAVE THERE? THANK YOU, SIT DOWN. PLEASE. SIT, SIT, SIT! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IS IT OFF? DID I GET IT OFF? I CAME TO THE STATION TONIGHT CRAWLING THROUGH THE STEAM TUNNEL. I GOT DUST ON ME. IT'S FRIDAY, A BIG WEEKEND AHEAD. EVERYBODY IS EXCITED. EVERYONE IS GEARING UP FOR TUESDAY'S SPECIAL ELECTION IN ALABAMA TO DECIDE THE FATE OF SENATE CANDIDATE AND BILLY-THE-LIKES-KIDS, ROY MOORE. EIGHT WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED MOORE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WHILE THEY WERE YOUNG TEENAGERS, BUT DONALD TRUMP STILL SUPPORTS HIM, SO TONIGHT, TRUMP'S HOLDING A GIANT RALLY, IN A DIFFERENT STATE-- FLORIDA. PENSACOLA, IN FACT, BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT, PENSACOLA IS IN THE SAME MEDIA MARKET AS AREAS SUCH MOBILE, ALABAMA. SO TO CAMPAIGN FOR MOORE, TRUMP IS CROSSING STATE LINES, SOMETHING MOORE LEGALLY CAN'T DO WITH HIS DATES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND IF YOU HAD ANY DOUBT ABOUT TRUMP'S INTENTIONS, TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, LARA RECORDED A ROBOCALL FOR MOORE SUPPORTERS INVITING THEM TO THE PRESIDENT'S APPEARANCE IN PENSACOLA. THEY ALSO GOT A HANDWRITTEN LETTER FROM HER HUSBAND, ERIC. "COME SEE MY DADDY, HA-HA PENIS." TRUE STORY. WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT PICTURE UP. THAT'S A REAL PICTURE.  ( LAUGHTER ) BUT MY FAVORITE PART OF THE RALLY IS THE VIDEO THAT CAME WITH TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT. JIM? ♪ MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! ♪ LIFT THE TORCH OF FREEDOM ALL ACROSS THE LAND ♪
Stephen: BY THE WAY, I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO THAT SONG.  ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, ON SATURDAY, TRUMP WILL BE IN MISSISSIPPI, ATTENDING THE OPENING OF THE STATE'S CIVIL RIGHTS MUSEUM. AWKWARD! IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE N.A.A.C.P. CALLED TRUMP'S APPEARANCE "AN AFFRONT TO THE VETERANS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT." WELL, AN AFFRONT--  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Jon: YEAH, UH-HUH.
Stephen: NOW, PEOPLE IN MISSISSIPPI ARE DREADING THAT TRUMP WILL SPEAK AT THE MUSEUM OPENING WITH ONE EDITORIAL SAYING, "IF TRUMP IS HANDED A MICROPHONE, HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FUMBLE A TROTTED OUT SPEECH, EMBARRASSING AND INFURIATING MISSISSIPPIIANS EVERYWHERE." "LOOK, LOOK, THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT LUNCH COUNTER, OKAY?" HEY, FUN FACT:  DID YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO A VICE PRESIDENT? IT'S FORMER INDIANA GOVERNOR AND MAN WHO THINKS SELTZER WATER IS "TOO SPICY," MIKE PENCE. LAUGH WELL, THE ATLANTIC JUST PUBLISHED AN IN-DEPTH PROFILE ON PENCE, AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF JUICY NUGGETS IN THERE. FOR INSTANCE, PENCE WAS "A FAT LITTLE KID"-- OR, AS HE PUT IT, "THE REAL PUMPKIN IN THE PICKLE PATCH." THAT IS THE FOLKSIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE CHILDHOOD SADNESS I'VE EVER HEARD. "YEP, I WAS A PUMPKIN IN A PICKLE PATCH, A LEMON IN THE OL' MELLON BOWL, A REAL WEEPING LONER AT THE FRESHMAN FORMAL. WHOOPS, THAT WASN'T A METAPHOR."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THEY ALSO INCLUDE SOME OF MIKE PENCE'S CRAZY COLLEGE SHENANIGANS. SIGH ARE SUE, BATION THULG,-- SEE, BACK THEN, HIS COLLEGE FRATERNITY THREW A KEG PARTY, WHICH ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE DEANS. SO HIS FRAT BROTHERS SCRAMBLED TO HIDE THE KEGS AND PLASTIC CUPS, BUT THEN PENCE MET THE ADMINISTRATOR AT THE DOOR, AND LED THE DEAN STRAIGHT TO THE KEGS AND ADMITTED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE FRATERNITY. THE  RESULTING PUNISHMENT WAS SEVERE. YES, THE FRAT WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO HOLD ANOTHER FRAT PARTY... IS WHAT THEY TOLD MIKE PENCE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) CAN'T DO IT, MIKE. SORRY. NO. WE'RE GOING TO STAY IN AND STUDY, TOO THE PIECE ALSO PROFILES PENCE'S TERM IN CONGRESS, WHERE PENCE DIDN'T HAVE A REPUTATION FOR LEGISLATIVE ACUMEN, AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES CALLED HIM A NICKNAME BEHIND HIS BACK: "MIKE DENSE." HA-HA! HA! AND I HOPE SOON HE'LL BE "PRESIDENT DENSE." BUT WHAT REALLY COMES THROUGH IN THIS PIECE IS PENCE'S BELIEF THAT HE'S DOING THE LORD'S WORK. AS THE ARTICLE PUTS IT, "WHAT CRITICS SHOULD WORRY ABOUT IS NOT THAT PENCE BELIEVES IN GOD, BUT THAT HE SEEMS SO CERTAIN GOD BELIEVES IN HIM." AND I,  FOR ONE, CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF GOD REALLY DOES BELIEVE IN PENCE.
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM, YOU DINGUS?
Stephen: HEY! IT'S GOD, EVERYBODY!
HEY, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: I GOTTA SAY I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, LORD.
OH, YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO SHOW UP-- SOMETIMES IN A SUNSET, SOMETIMES ON A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH. NOT ANYMORE, THOUGH. I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHERE THUNDER COMES FROM.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: SO, LORD, I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING, IS IT TRUE-- DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIKE PENCE?
OF COURSE I DO. HE TALKS TO ME EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY, IT'S "GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH TO BE A GOOD MAN AND NOT LUST AFTER THE HARLOTS IN THE L.L. BEAN CATALOGUE." SOME OF THOSE KHAKI PANTS ARE PRETTY FLATTERING.
Stephen: SO, HAVE YOU ALWAYS HAD FAITH IN MIKE SENSE?
YEAH, THOUGH I HAD A PHASE IN COLLEGE. SOMETIMES I'D STAY UP LATE WITH MY DORM BUDDIES AND DEBATE THE EXISTENCE OF MIKE PENCE. I MEAN, AN OLD GUY WITH WHITE HAIR SILENTLY JUDGING EVERYONE? KINDA FAR-FETCHED.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: HOW ABOUT NOW? I MEAN, DO YOU THINK MIKE PENCE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT?
NONE OF MY BUSINESS. MY VOTE DOESN'T COUNT. I'M REGISTERED IN HEAVEN, NOT OHIO. ALSO, I'M A CONVICTED FELON.
Stephen: WHAT?  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHAT!
YEAH, I TOLD A GUY TO STAB HIS SON. TURNS OUT, THAT'S ILLEGAL. WHO KNEW? SORRY, ISAAC.
Stephen: GOD, EVERYONE! THANK YOU. STOP BY ANY TIME.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MARK HAMILL IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'VE GOT AN EXCLUSIVE NEW SCENE FROM A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE! WOOO! OH, MY GOODNESS! JON, I'M SO EXCITED. IT'S THE WEEKEND. I'M GOING TO GET THE FINAL SHOPPING DONE. IT'S ALL GOING TO BE GREAT.
Jon: FRIDAY!
Stephen: EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET NEW PILLOWS FROM THAT "MY PILLOW" GUY. EVERYBODY IN MY LIFE. THEY'REALLY GUTTING PILLOWS. WE'RE ALL SLEEPY THESE DAYS.
Jon: WE NEED TO LAY DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YOU CANITAL I'M A LIT CANDLE RIGHT NOW, AND THE REASON I'M SO EXCITED IS WE HAVE MARK HAMILL HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT "THE LAST JEDI." LUKE SKYWALKER, HIMSELF! I'VE BEEN A FAN OF HIS FOR SO LONG. BECAUSE UNLIKE MOST PEOPLE, I DIDN'T JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON WHEN HE BECAME A JEDI. I WAS INTO HIM WAY BACK WHEN HE WAS JUST A MOISTURE FARMER, IN FACT, BEFORE IT WAS COOL. OBVIOUSLY, THE ORIGINAL MOVIES ARE CLASSICS, AND I'M LOVING THE NEW TRILOGY JUST AS MUCH. BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A 30-YEAR GAP BETWEEN THEM, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LUKE WAS UP TO DURING THAT TIME. WE MISSED OUT ON SO MANY EXCITING ADVENTURES BECAUSE THOSE MOVIES WERE NEVER MADE. BUT, FORTUNATELY, WE DO HAVE A CLIP TONIGHT FROM THOSE NON-EXISTANT FILMS. JIM? ♪ ♪ ♪  (  LAUGHTER  ) ( SNIFFS )
Stephen: EMILIO, A BANTHA, CRAPPED IN THE PARKING LOT, I'LL CALL YOU BACK. IS THAT BLASTER LOADED? GO ON IN. REMEMBER OUR POLICY. ALWAYS SHOOT FIRST!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
EXCUSE ME.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EXCUSE ME, SIR, SIR.
Stephen: AH-AH! YES?
I'M BEING FOLLOWED BY SOLDIERS OF THE FIRST ORDER. I NEED GET INTO THE CANTINA!
Stephen: WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE, SIR.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT'S A BIG GALAXY. LOTS OF THINGS ARE FAR, FAR AWAY. OKAY? JUST A MOMENT. I'M COMING OFF MY BREAK. WELCOME TO THE MOS EISLEY CANTINA, A WRETCHED HIVE OF SCUM AND VILLAINY, LIVE MUSIC NIGHTLY. HOW I CAN HELP YOU?
FINALLY. WILL YOU LET ME IN NOW?
Stephen: IN YOUR JAMMIES? OKAY. LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE ON THE LIST. LAST NAME?
SKYWALKER.
Stephen: LET'S SEE. HMMM. I DON'T SEE A "SKY WALTER." NO.
SKY WALKER. LUKE SKYWALKER.
Stephen: LUKE, LUKE, LUKE, OKAY. I'VE GOT A "LUKE STAR-KILLER." IS THAT CLOSE?
WELL, THAT'S A DUMB NAME. LET ME SEE THAT LIST. THESE ARE ALL FAKE NAMES! "GENERAL GRIEVOUS?" "COUNT DOOKU"? "JAR-JAR BINKS"? NOW THAT ONE'S GOT TO BE A MISTAKE. LAUGH
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK, OKAY.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU ARE ONE TO TALK, MR. SPACE JOGGER.  ( LAUGHTER )
I SAID IT'S SKYWALKER! SERIOUSLY, YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF ME? I BLEW UP THE DEATH STAR-- TWICE!
Stephen: I'M NOT REALLY INTO SCI-FI.  (  LAUGHTER  )
WELL, IT'S NOT "FI!" IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. AND IT'S NOT REALLY "SCI" IT'S MORE LIKE KIND OF A SPACE WESTERN.
Stephen: THAT WILL NEVER WORK. I DID NOT WANT TO DO THIS, BUT, YOU WILL LET ME INTO THE CANTINA.
Stephen: NO, I WON'T. I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT. I JUST SAID THAT A SECOND AGO.
YOU WILL LET ME IN THE CANTINA.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU WEAVING AT? ARE YOU TRING TO DO THIS THING? NA-NU, NA-NU.
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS?  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: I'M GONNA GUESS DAVE SKYWALKER? LAUGH
IT'S... (WHISPERS) DARTH VADER. SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE IMPERIAL FORCES.
Stephen: WELL, MY DAD IS REGIONAL MANAGER OF RAYMOUR & FLANAGANS, BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME THROWING THAT AROUND. RIGHT THIS WAY. GO ON IN. GO ON IN. GOOD TO SEE YOU, DOIKK.
OH, COME ON! YOU'RE LETTING THEM IN!?
Stephen: HE'S WITH THE BAND. I HOPE THEY PLAY MY FAVORITE SONG! BOP-BOP, DODDELY-DAAAAAH-DOO BOP-BOP
PLEASE, STOP! THAT'S THEIR ONLY SONG. ♪ DOO-DOO-DOO, DOO-DO-BAT GO AHEAD.
LOOK! I'M BEING CHASED BY STORMTROOPERS AND I KNOW THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO HEAR IS SOMEBODY WHINING ABOUT THEIR DAY, BUT I HAVE TO PICK UP SOME POWER CONVERTERS. AND I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK IN TWELVE PARSECS--
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A UNIT OF TIME.
YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME IN TO THE CANTINA, YOU STUCK-UP, HALF-WITTED, SCRUFFY-LOOKING NERF HERDER!
Stephen: WHOA! LOOK WHO DROPPED THE "N-H WORD."
OH, COME ON. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF SIGHT. THE STORMTROOPERS ARE GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE!
Stephen: I'M SORRY. YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY THE CANTINA ACROSS THE STREET.
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I GUESS I'LL JUST GO OVER TO "THE DARK SIDE."
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD LUCK. TRY THE FRIED PORG. IT'S AMAZING.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MARK HAMILL!
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM-- I AM LITERALLY GIDDY MY FIRST GUEST IS AN ICONIC ACTOR WHOSE CAREER SPANS OVER FOUR DECADES AND IS THE GUEST I'M LOOKING FOR. PLEASE WELCOME MARK HAMILL! ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LOOK AT THAT! YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.
OH, MY GOSH. I'M OUT HERE PROMOTING A MOVIE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT, IF YOU DON'T WANT. WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF YOU AS LUKE SKYWALKER. BUT TO ME YOU WILL ALWAYS BE GORDON MILLER FROM "ROOM SERVICE.
YOU SAW THAT!
Stephen: IN 1986, YOU WERE ON BROADWAY--
IT WAS IN THE ROUNDABOUT THEATER, DIRECT BY ALAN ARKIN. HE HAD ALL HIS SECOND CITY BUDDIES I IDOLIZED FOR YEARS. I JUST DON'T WANT TO START IN. THEY WERE ALL FANTASTIC.
Stephen: I WAS A SENIOR IN COLLEGE AND I HAD COME TO NEW YORK TO ACTUALLY INTERVIEW TO BE AN INTERN ON DAVID LETTERMAN'S SHOW, AND A FRIEND OF MINE SAID, "I CAN GET US A JOB AS USHERS FOR ONE NIGHT TO SEE THIS PLAY." AND I SAID, SURE, THAT WILL BE FUN. AND I WALKED IN, AND YOU WERE ON THE STAGE DOING THE GROUCHO MARK.
THE CRITICS CAME IN THINKING I WOULD PLAY THE INNOCENT MIDWESTERN PLAYWRIGHT-- "GOLEE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THE CITY BEFORE." AND INSTEAD WAS A SLEAZY GORDON MILLER. THEY WERE SHOCKED. PLUT OF PLUS IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE ME. I HAD PANTS UP TO HERE, A HALF JAR OF POMAID AND THE BRILLIANTINE MISTASH, AND PEOPLE SAID THAT'S NOT MARK. THAT'S GORDON MILLER. THAT'S WHY WHATI LIKE ABOUT CHARACTER ACTORS. IF IN VOICEOVERS THEY CAST WITH THE EARS AND NOT THE EYES AND YOU GET A LOT OF PARTS YOU WOULDN'T GET ON CAMERA.
Stephen: MANY HAVE SAID OF ALL THE JOCKERS, YOURSELF IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THERE WAS A RECENT RANKING. THERE WAS A RECENT RANKING. YOU COME IN NUMBER ONE.
I HAVE FUN. I LOVE THE JOKER! BECAUSE, I MEAN, TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THAT CRAZY CAR. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT IN EVERY EPISODE, BUT WHEN YOU SHOW UP, YOU JUST CREATE CHAOS, AND IT'S A FANTASTIC CAST. KEVIN CONROY'S BEEN MY BATMAN SINCE '92. WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR 25th YEAR. AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY BATMAN FAMILY, I HAVE MY "STAR WARS" FAMILY. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH FUN I'M ZG ALL THIS. YOU GUYS, I'M TELLING YOU, I NEVER EXPECTED THAT WE'D COME BACK. IF THEY DID ANOTHER TRILOGY THAT THEY WOULD BRING BACK OUR CHARACTERS. AND IT WAS REALLY INTIMIDATING AND SCARY. BUT I'M REALLY APPRECIATING IT NOW BECAUSE IN YOUR 20s YOU SORT OF TAKE IT FOR GRANTED, AND IT'S SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE NOW THAT I'M IN MY EARLY 80s.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S A TIP, BY THE WAY-- IF YOU'RE GOING TO FUDGE YOUR AGE, LIE UP, BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL SAY, "BOY, HE REALLY LOOKS GOOD FOR 83!"
Stephen: YOU DO.
"HE REALLY TOOK CARE OF HIMSELF."
Stephen: YOU REALLY LOOK GREAT FOR 83.
I DO. THANK YOU.
Stephen: I CAN BE IN YOUR "STAR WARS" FAMILY? >>, OF COURSE,.
Stephen: THE 13-YEAR-OLD IN ME IS GOING INSANE RIGHT NOW. AND PLEASE FORGIVE-- THIS IS 40 YEARS COMING THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU, BECAUSE-- AND I'VE TOLD PEOPLE SOME OF THIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS-- BUT THREE WEEKS BEFORE THIS MOVIE WAS RELEASED ANYWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY, FOR WHATEVER REASON, MY OWN STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA WAS A TEST MARKET, AND I WON TICKETS FROM WTMA--
AND SAW IT BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE.
Stephen: THREE WEEKS BEFORE ANY OF MY FRIENDS AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT NOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU GUYS WHO WERE MAKING THE FILM, DID YOU KNOW IT WAS REALLY GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING?
OH, OF COURSE, NOT. I THOUGHT IT WAS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAD GREAT HUMOR. AND IT HAD SUCH-- AS FANTASTIC AS ALL THE SITUATIONS AND CHARACTERS WERE, IT WAS SO RELATABLE. I MEAN, HERE WE RISK OUR LIVES TO SAVE THE PRINCESS, THE FIRST THING SHE COMPLAINS ABOUT IS, "YOU CAME IN THAT?"
Stephen: "AREN'T YOU KIND OF SHORT FOR A STORMTROOPER." EXACTLY.
ALL OF THAT STUFF. THAT WAS JUST SO RELATABLE AND HUMAN. AND, YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT WASN'T SCIENCE FICTION. I GOT THE PART FROM A SCREEN TEST. I DIDN'T READ THE WHOLE SCRIPT UNTIL THEY SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE LUKE." AND WHEN I-- I STILL REMEMBER THE CHAIR I WAS SITTING IN AND WHERE I WAS WHEN I STARTED READING THIS THING. I GO, "OH, MY GOSH. THIS IS MORE LIKE 'WIZARD OF OZ' WITH A GENDER SWITCH, WHERE LUKE GETS SWEPT OFF INTO THIS FANTASTIC ADVENTURE. BUT I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES. BECAUSE I WAS A FAN AS A KID. I READ "FAMOUS MONSTERS" MAGAZINES AND BUILT THE MONSTER MODEL KITS. I WAS THE BIGGEST ENTHUSIAST. I REMEMBER I WOULD GET REALLY EXCITED AND GO, "HARRISON! WE'RE A PEZ DISPENSER NOW." AND HE'S LIKE, "WHATEVER FLOAS FLOETS YOUR BOAT."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S JUST LIKE HIM. I'VE INTERVIEWED HIM.
YEAH, YOU KNOW. THAT'S THE PERFECT SORT OF-- I DON'T KNOW, WE JUST HAD A --
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL?
WELL, LISTEN, IT WAS SO INTERESTING, BECAUSE WE WENT OFF IT'S THREE OF US-- I CALL THEM CARISON AND HARRY-- ANDY WE WOULD GET ON THE PLANE INGE VAN TIEWFER, FIRST. AND THE MOVIE OPENED WHEN WE WERE ON TOUR, AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO, WHICH I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AS WE LANDED AND THERE WERE MOBS OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: AT THE AIRPORT?
AT THE AIRPORT! I SAID, "HEY, YOU GUYS, I THINK THERE'S SOMEBODY FAMOUS ON THE PLANE." AND I'M LOOKING AROUND FAIR CELEBRITY. AND AS WE GOT CLOSER, I WENT, "CARRIE, THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL OUT THERE WITH YOUR FURRY HEADPHONES. AND HARRISON, THERE'S A GUY WITH YOUR VEST." THERE WERE KIDS OUT THERE WITH SIGNS "MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU." THEY WERE DRESSED LIKE US. AND WE WERE LIKE --
Stephen: IT WAS ME.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS-- IT WAS KIND OF ME. I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS-- I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS WHO, LIKE, AT NIGHT, WHEN NO ONE WAS AROUND WOULD DO THIS... THINKING IF I COULD JUST CONCENTRATE ENOUGH.
I STILL DO IT AT SUPERMARKETS.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, WHEN THE DOORS OPEN.  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OH REALLY!
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I MEAN, I'M ENJOYING-- LIKE I SAY, IT'S JUST SO WONDERFUL TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE SO HAPPY. THIS COP STOPPED ME TO SAY, "DO YOU KNOW HOW FAST YOU WERE GOING?" I'M SO SCARED OF THE COPS YOU KNOW, LIKE THE MIRRORED GLASSES IN "PSYCHO." I SAID, "NO, OFFICER." I'M ALWAYS REALLY POLITE. "I'M SORRY." YOU TRY TO TALK YEARS OUT. "I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO WITH A WARNING. WHEN LIGHT CYBER DO YOU USE IN THE MOVIE, GREEN OR BLUE." AND YOU SEE THIS 40-YEAR-OLD GUY TURN INTO AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD RIGHT BEFORE YOUR PIPES WHAT A TREAT IT'S BEEN.
Stephen: WHICH COLOR LIGHTSABER. I KNOW YOU CAN'T TELL US ANYTHING SO TELL US EVERYTHING! IN "THE FORCE AWAKENS" YOU SHOW UP AT THE LAST MINUTE IN THERE.
THE MOST ELABORATE ENTRANCE IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT'S A TWO-AND-A-HALF-HOUR FORPLAY.
AND EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT ME FOR TWO HOURS.
Stephen: YEAH.
"THE SWORD OF SKYWALKER IS TOO POWERFUL. SKYWALKER MUST BE STOPPED." I'M GOING, "OH, GOOD." I'M WRITING ALL THIS STUFF DOWN. I REMEMBER THINKING WHEN I GOT TO THE SCENE-- I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS SEEN IT-- WHEN THE LIGHT SABER JIGGLES IN THE FOREST AND FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, I'M LIKE, "OH, BABY, HERE I AM!" IT GOES TO REY. I SAID SHE DIDN'T GONE FN DO ANY TRAINING. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
Stephen: WHAT IS GOING ON. SHE DIDN'T DO TRAINING. HOW CAN SHE STAND UP.
FANS POINT OUT, "YOU QUIT YOUR TRAINING, YOUNG MAN. DON'T GET SO MOUTHY." THERE WAS THE ORIGINAL, THERE WAS THE PREQUEL, AND THIS IS THE NEXT GENERATION. LUKE IS NO LONGER THE PROTAGONIST, IT'S REY, AND IT'S NOT MY STORY ANYMORE. IT'S JUST SO FUN TO BE INVITED BACK TO THE PARTY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU CAN'T CLEAR MUCH UP FOR US. BUT CAN WE-- WHAT CAN WE INFER FROM THE PHOTO I'M ABOUT TO SHOW? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS AT ALL. OKAY, SO, "STAR WARS--" YOU CAN SELL ANYTHING WITH "STAR WARS," INCLUDING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AND IF YOU LOOK ON THIS PHOTO OF DOLE PRODUCTS, YOU'VE GOT DARTH VADER ON APPLES, YODA ON GRAPES-- NATURALLY, GREEN. YOU'VE GOT R2-D2 ON A HEAD OF CAULIFLOWER, AND LUKE IS ON A BAG OF ICEBERG LETTUCE.  ( LAUGHTER ) DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THE ICE PLANET OF HOFF? WHAT CAN WE DISCERN FROM YOU BEING ON ICEBERG LETTUCE?
WELL, IF YOU GO TO @HAMILL-- SHAMELESSLY PANDERING FOR MORE FOLLOW EARS YOU CAN SEE MY TWEETS ON THAT. I SAID WE LOVE "STAR WARS" FRUITS AND VEGGIIES. BUT YODA AND VADER HAD IT MUCH EASIER BECAUSE WHO DOESN'T LIKE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. LUKE HAD IT HARDER. POOR R2-D2, NO MATTER HOW ADORABLE HE IS ON THAT COVER, IT'S STILL CAULIFLOWER! NO KID IS GOING TO BE FOOLED BY THAT. THEY WANT IT TO BE M&Ms.
Stephen: I THINK THIS MEANS YOUR CHARACTER DIES AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE IF YOU EAT ONLY ICEBERG LETTUCE, YOU WILL DIE OF MALNUTRITION.
I GOT A LOT OF BACKLASH FROM PEOPLE WHO LOVE CAULIFLOWER, SO, PLEASE, NO MORE HATE TWEETS.
Stephen: THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HATE TWEET OVER CAULIFLOWER?
YES. NO, I'M NOT KIDDING. THEY SAID, "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT ROASTED WITH GARLIC?" I MEAN, IT'S ONLY A JOKE, YOU KNOW. DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY. I'M JUST ANOTHER CRANK ON TWITTER.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) LISTEN, IF YOU'VE PLAYED THE TRICKSTER AND THE JOKER, AS I HAVE, FOR SO MANY YEARS, THE UPSIDE IS NOBODY TAKES ANYTHING YOU SAY SERIOUSLY, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING, BECAUSE IT'S LIBERATING, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE JUST-- YOU'RE A JESTER. YOU'RE THERE FOR FUN. I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN, AND TO ME, THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, YOU KNOW. I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF ESCAPISM. AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO TO HOGWARTS OR MIDDLE EARTH, OR WHEREVER-- OZ, THE LAND OF OZ, OR TO A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY-- BECAUSE IT'S THERAPEUTIC. REAL LIFE IS REALLY UNPLEASANT AT TIMES. AND THIS IS A GOOD WAY FOR YOU TO, YOU KNOW, FORGET ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS FOR TWO HOURS. OH, IN THIS CASE, THIS IS THE LONGEST "STAR WARS" FILM. THIS IS TWO AND A HALF HOURS, WHICH YOU'LL FIND OUT IN ABOUT A WEEK.  ( APPLAUSE ) I KNOW, I KNOW.
Stephen: QUICK QUESTION ABOUT ESCAPING. DO YOU EVER WISH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN "STAR WARS"?
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN I KNEW IT WAS GEORGE LUKAS WHO HAD DONE "AMERICAN GRAFFITI" AND EVEN FROM THAT ONE SCENE I SAID, "I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS. I WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FIRST DAY, FIRST SHOW, REGARDLESS OF --
Stephen: AGAIN, LITTLE ME.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: TOTALLY CHANGED MY-- WHAT I WANTED FOR MY ENTERTAINMENT.
SO MANY PEOPLE COME TO ME AND SAY, "I BECAME THIS OR THAT BECAUSE OF THE FILM." PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS, LIGHTING PEOPLE, MAKEUP PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN FILMS THAT JUST INSPIRE PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN.
Stephen: HAS THE FILM DOES DONE THAT FOR YOU?
WELL, WHAT I FIND MORE INSPIRING IS THE REACTION OF THE FANS, THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE IT. I MEAN, I-- I---- STIPULATE THAT IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY. NOT EVERYBODY LOVES "STAR WARS." BUT THE PEOPLE WHO DO, I CALL U.P.F.s-- ULTRAPASSIONATE FANS. AND THEY LOVE THIS THING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY RELATE STORIES OF HOW IT GOT THEM THROUGH THEIR MOTHER'S ILLNESS OR THEY MET THEIR LIFE ONLINE OR THEY-- IT JUST-- IT'S BECOME SUCH A FABRIC OF THEIR LIVES. IT'S TRULY MOVING. I DON'T SEE IT ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, BUT WHEN GIOUT IN PUBLIC OR TO THESE CELEBRATIONS AND SO FORTH, IT'S JUST ASTONISHING HOW PASSIONATE THEY REALLY ARE. AND I DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND, YOU KNOW, IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FANS, I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE TALKING TO STEPHEN COLBERT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: FOR YOUR MOVIES. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO DO THIS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: MARK HAMILL, EVERYBODY. "THE LAST JEDI" IS IN THEATERS DECEMBER 15. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN CHEFS IN AMERICA. BOBBY FLAY, EVERYBODY! I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A NEW COOKBOOK. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS THING?
IT'S CALLED "BOBBY FLAY FIT."
Stephen: BECAUSE THE RECIPES ARE ALL FOODS YOU CAN FIT IN YOUR MOUTH, CORRECT?
EXACT HE RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY "FIT?"
BECAUSE AS A CHEF A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME, ," HOW DO YOU STAY IN SHAPE WHEN YOU'RE AROUND FOOD SO MUCH?" SO I WROTE THE BOOK. PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW SO I WROTE IT.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL US. YOU HAVE TO BATE BOOK.
EXACTLY. IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON --
Stephen: FITNESS AND THE HOLIDAY SEASON, THAT'S AN OXYMORON, THEY DON'T GO TOGETHER AT ALL.
THIS IS A TOTALLY BAD IDEA RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: ARE THESE RECIPES FROM THE BOOK?
YES, THEY'RE FROM THE BOOK, AND WE HAVE LIQUOR.
Stephen: OH, WELL, THAT'S MY DIET.  ( LAUGHTER ) SHOULD YOU TRUST A FIT CHEF? YES, YOU SHOULD.
Stephen: COME ON!
YOU HAVE TO TRUST THIS ONE. LISTEN, IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO STAY FIT. YOU JUST HAVE TO-- YOU HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU EAT.
Stephen: OKAY.
THE KIND OF THINGS YOU EAT, THE TYPE YOU EAT IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, BUT YOU STILL GET TO EAT.
Stephen: WHEN SHOULD YOU EAT FOOD? WHAT TIME?
NOT AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING, LIKE I USED TO DO.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS WAY MORE FUN, THOUGH.
Stephen: WHAT ARE WE MAKING TODAY.
Stephen: OKAY, SO LET'S HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE.
Stephen: OH, SURE.
LET'S HAVE A GLASS OF-- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A COCKTAIL. TANGERINE JUICE, BECAUSE CITRUS IS IN SEASON, BLOOD ORANGE, POMEGRANATES. WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE, SIR? ( POP )  ( APPLAUSE ) POMEGRANATE, WHY NOT.
I'LL PORIT FIRST. AND FINISH IT THERE. I'LL TAKE TANGERINE JUICE.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TANGERINE AND ORANGE OR IS IT A FANCY ORANGE.
THERE'S DEFINITELY A DIFFERENCE. TANGERINE IS A LITTLE MORE TART. HERE'S A TRICK. OKAY UPON. DON'T START DRINKING YET, SIR.
Stephen: OKAY.
WE'RE GOING TO GET POMEGRANATE SEEDS OUT. YOU CUT THE POMEGRANATE IN HALF, SQUEEZE IT, AND WHACK IT WITH THE-- YOU JUST WHACK IT WITH THE WOODEN SPOON AND THE POMEGRANATE SEEDS COME RIGHT OUT AND HERE'S YOUR GARNISH.
Stephen: AND DO YOU RECOMMEND SPANKING YOUR POMEGRANATE?
YES, SIR, EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE TO WAIT.
HAPPY HOLIDAY S.
Stephen:  HAPPY HOLIDAYS, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S REALLY TASTY.
AND THAT'S IT.
Stephen: THAT'S IT?
THAT'S THE WHOLE BOOK RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: SO WHAT WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU START OFF WITH THIS?
YOU START OFF WITH A COCKTAIL BECAUSE FOR THE HOLIDAYS YOU WANT EVERYBODY IN THE MOOD.
Stephen: THIS IS AN APERTEEF TO GET EVERYBODY READY FOR THE DRINKING LATER ON?
EXACTLY. WE HAVE SPICED NUTS.
Stephen: OH! BOBBY FLAY SPICED NUTS.
MAPLE SYRUP. A LITTLE BIT THE BROWN SUGAR, AND SOME SPICES. WE JUST PUT THAT IN THERE. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE-- WE HAVE A EXWING OF DIFFERENT NUTS-- PECANS, ALMONDS,ICA SHOES. YOU WANT TO GIVE THAT A TOSS. IT WILL HURT YOU IF YOU GET IT ON YOU.
Stephen: DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
ALL RIGHT!
Stephen: I GOT THAT. I GOT THAT.
MR. COLBERT.
Stephen: COME ON, FEEL ME! DO YOU COOK FOR YOUR FAMILY? DO YOU HAVE TO COOK FOR THE HOLIDAYS?
WHEN YOU'RE THE CHEF OF THE FAMILY, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE COOKING. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EATING. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
Stephen: THAT LOOKS FLAMING HOT. I SHOULDN'T EAT THAT?
HAVE SOME OF THESE. A LITTLE SPICY, A LITTLE SWEET.
Stephen: IS IT A PROBLEM IF I HAVE A NUT ALLERGY?
NOPE, YOU'LL BE TOTALLY FINE.  ( LAUGHTER ).

ANYWAY, LET'S TAKE A FOND LOOK BACK AT THE BEST OF THIS WEEK'S "LATE SHOW." WELL, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IS HERE, COURTESY OF ROBERT MUELLER COMING DOWN THE CHIMNEY WITH A SACK FULL OF SUBPOENAS.

FLYNN COULD AVOID JAIL TIME BY PARTICIPATING IN COVERT LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS WEARING A WIRE. "MICHAEL FLYNN, A VERY GOOD GUY, GREAT LISTENER. SOMETIMES--  (  LAUGHTER  ) SOMETIMES HE ASKS ME TO SAY THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES DIRECTLY INTO HIS CORSAGE. VERY NICE. SO THOUGHT."
THERE'S SO MUCH SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENING OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF CENTURIES  (  LAUGHTER  ) JUST ALL THESE BRAND-NEW ALLEGATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME. I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE BIBLE. THEY WERE LIKE, "AND ON THE THIRD DAY, GOD WAS LIKE 'HEY, SUGAR (BLEEP)! '."
KIRSTEN JILLEN BRAND IS CALLING ON SENATOR AL FRANKEN TO RESIGN.

IT IS TIME TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.
Stephen: YES. HE RECOGNIZED IT IN A SPEECH, BUT I'M STILL PRETTY SURE HE COULDN'T TROIZ ON A MAP  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "WHICH ONE IS IT? IS IT THE LITTLE ONE?"
I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE-- HE HAS LIKE A PEANUT ALLERGY TO FACTS AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. SO, LITERALLY, IF YOU JUST SAY THINGS THAT ARE TRUE, HE GETS MAD.
Stephen: CNN SHOULD HAVE A LABEL BEFORE EVERY SHOW THAT SAYS, "PROCESSED IN A FACTORY THAT ALSO PROCESSES INFORMATION."
I ADORED "LADY BIRD. "T" HAS EVERYTHING US ARTISTIC TYPES LOVE-- SMOKING, DRINKING, AND AN ACTRESS WITH AN UNPRONOUNCABLE NAME.
I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN THE AIRPORT AND BEING PICKED UP BY SOMEONE AND THEY HAVE YOUR NAMES ON THE BOARD AND I WAS SCANNING THROUGH AND I THOUGHT I CAN'T FIND MY NAME ANYWHERE. IT'S AS YOU MISSPELLED AND I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS MASSIVE TYPO. AND I LOOKED THROUGH, AND I SCANNED AGAIN, AND I SAW A BOARD THAT JUST SAID, "SHELLY RONAN." AND I SAID, "THAT'S ME. SHELLY IT IS."
I MISS GOING INTO A ROOM AND BEGGING THEM TO HIRE ME.
