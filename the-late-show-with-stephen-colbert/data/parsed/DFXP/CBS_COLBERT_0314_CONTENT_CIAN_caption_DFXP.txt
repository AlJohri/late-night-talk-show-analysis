I PREFER BROWN MINIMALIST. OH, GEE. I BELIEVE THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE OF 1906 WAS AN INSIDE JOB TO PROMOTE THE GAY AGENDA.
BEHAVE! IRTH CONTROL TURNS WOMEN INTO WEREWOLVES.
MMM! LITTLE KNOWN FACT, THE WORDS CORPORATE MEDIA, GLOBALIST AND PANCAKES ARE ALL JUST DIFFERENT WAYS TO SAY JEWISH.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES BRYAN CRANSTON! AUDRA McDONALD! AND COMEDIAN GREER BARNES, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! HOW'S IT GOING? THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANKS, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE TOO KIND! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT! HAPPY FIRST DAY OF SPRING! THE BIRDS ARE CHIRPING, THE BROOKS ARE BABBLING, AND THE NEIGHBORS ARE YELLING FOR ME TO TURN DOWN MY NATURE SOUNDS C.D. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU'RE IN THE NORTHEAST, IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE SPRING, SINCE IT'S STILL PRETTY CHILLY -- THOUGH, JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, IT WAS IN THE 60S. GOD, I WISH IT WAS WINTER AGAIN SO I COULD WEAR SHORTS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU CAN'T TELL.
Jon: YEAH, YOU NEVER KNOW. OF COURSE, LAST WEEK TRUMP RELEASED HIS FIRST BUDGET. THEY'RE CALLING IT A HARD POWER BUDGET BECAUSE IT FEATURES A $54-BILLION-INCREASE IN MILITARY SPENDING, WHILE CUTTING THE STATE DEPARTMENT BY 28%. MAKES SENSE. PBS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: I KNOW. LOOK,  TRUMP'S A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE PUT UP CONDOS ON "SESAME STREET." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET ♪ ♪ HOW TO GET TO "SESAME STREET" ♪ YOU CAN'T. IT'S GONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ IF ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER ♪ ♪ ONE OF THESE THINGS WAS CUT FROM THE BUDGET ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP'S ALSO ELIMINATING THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS AND THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES. I'M NOT SURPRISED. HE'S JEALOUS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL-ENDOWED. ( APPLAUSE ) PLUS, TRUMP'S SLASHING THE E.P.A.'S BUDGET BY 31%, AND "THE GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE, WHICH FIGHTS INVASIVE SPECIES LIKE THE SEA LAMPREY, COULD SEE ITS FUNDING SLASHED BY 97%." IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SEA LAMPREY, YOU MIGHT KNOW IT AS THE VICIOUS, FLESH-EATING HELL BEAST FROM YOUR WORST NIGHTMARES. ( LAUGHTER ) OR AS STEVE BANNON CALLS IT, "MY MENTOR." ( APPLAUSE )
Jon THIS BUDGET IS SO RUTHLESS, IT'S CUTTING FUNDING FOR "MEALS ON WHEELS." REALLY? ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) CUTTING MEALS ON WHEELS? THAT ISN'T JUST HEARTLESS, IT'S BAD MARKETING. YOU STICK WITH THINGS THAT RHYME. MEALS ON WHEELS! CRACK IS WACK! HOP ON POP! TWO BUCK CHUCK! AVOID THE NOID! BE KIND, REWIND! THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES ELDERLY SHUT-INS MINIMAL NUTRITION AND A SCRAP OF HUMAN DIGNITY. WHAT KIND OF HEARTLESS MONSTER COULD BE AGAINST THAT?
COLBERT: DID SOMEONE SAY "FISCAL CONSERVATIVE?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: OH, SAY HELLO, TO MY CONSERVATIVE PUNDIT COLLEAGUE, STEPHEN COLBERT. HEY, STEPHEN, HOW ARE YOU?
COLBERT: HELLO, NATION. STAY STRONG. BE BRAVE.
STEPHEN: NOW, JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU ARE NOT THE CHARACTER FROM MY OTHER SHOW. ARE YOU? BECAUSE I REALLY WOULDN'T WANT --
COLBERT: ABSOLUTELY NOT. I COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT HIS FAVORITE SANDWICH IS A B.L.T. I LIKE A T.L.B. AND THE "B" STANDS FOR BALLS. DELICIOUS, PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: GOOD TO KNOW. SO WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT  YOU HAD BREAK INTO MY SHOW? I WAS DOING A MONOLOGUE.
COLBERT: BELIEVE ME, I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO OUT HERE IN THE WOODS. I'VE BEEN OUT HUNTING THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME.
STEPHEN: YOU'RE HUNTING HUMANS? WITH
COLBERT: NO, GRIZZLY BEARS, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SO SOON? THEY ARE GODLESS KILLING MACHINES. BESIDES -- HUMANS ARE OUT OF SEASON. I'M HERE BECAUSE AMERICA NEEDS ME, STEPHEN. PLUS, I WANTED TO STOP YOU FROM MAKING AN ASS OF YOURSELF ON NETWORK TV WITH YOUR MISGUIDED ANALYSIS OF TRUMP'S BUDGET.
STEPHEN: OH, YOU THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER?
COLBERT:  DO BETTER? MY MIDDLE NAME IS DO.
STEPHEN: OKAY, WELL, THEN. THE STAGE IS YOURS. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ THESE WERE.
Stephen: THANK YOU! YOU'RE A GOOD MAN!
Jon: YES, INDEED! ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, NATION. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, TRUMP'S BUDGET IS GETTING HEAT BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSEDLY CRUEL TO OLD PEOPLE FOR NO REASON. WHEN, IN FACT, THEY'VE GOT A VERY GOOD REASON. AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S "WERD:" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SCREW UNTO OTHERS. NOW, YOU HEARD THE GUY WHO NORMALLY SITS HERE MOANING ABOUT THESE CUTS TO MEALS ON WHEELS, BUT THAT GUY'S A WELL-KNOWN GRANDMA HUGGER. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS BUDGET LACKS COMPASSION, BUT WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR AND 49-YEAR-OLD TEMP MICK MULVANEY KNOWS IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COMPASSIONATE THINGS WE CAN DO TO--
CUTTING PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE ELDERLY--
YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON HALF THE EQUATION, RIGHT? YOU'RE FOCUSING ON RECIPIENTS OF THE MONEY. WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON BOTH THE RECIPIENTS OF THE MONEY AND THE FOLKS WHO GIVE US THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE.
COLBERT: YES, YOU CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON HELPING THE NEEDY AND FORGET THE PEOPLE WHOSE TAXES PAY FOR IT. THAT'S LIKE PRAYING FOR THE ACCIDENT VICTIM WHO NEEDED A TRANSFUSION AND FORGETTING ABOUT THE GUY WHO'S WALKING AROUND A PINT LIGHT. GIVE THE GUY A COOKIE. ( LAUGHTER ) MULVANEY HAD TO CUT MEALS ON WHEELS BECAUSE THEY "FAILED TO MEET THEIR OBJECTIVES." YEAH, IT'S CALLED "MEALS ON WHEELS," BUT HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE A HAMBURGER DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING: "THEY DID MEET THEIR OBJECTIVE. THEY BROUGHT FOOD TO THE ELDERLY." TECHNICALLY, YES, GREG. AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO FOOD AFTER WE EAT IT. WE ARE LITERALLY THROWING MONEY DOWN THE TOILET. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MEALS ON WHEELS STARTED IN 1972. I HAVEN'T CHECKED THE STATS, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE DEAD NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDES, MULVANEY SAID, THE PRIMARY GOAL OF TRUMP'S BUDGET IS NOT DRIVING CHEETOS TO GRANDPA AFTER HE GETS THE MUNCHIES FROM HIS GLAUCOMA POT, IT'S DEFENDING AMERICA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THESE FOOD-ADDICTED SENIORS HAVEN'T KILLED ANY MEMBERS OF ISIS. IF WE WANT TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, WHY WASTE MONEY ON MEALS ON WHEELS THAT COULD BE USED ON WEAPONS SYSTEMS? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY MULVANEY IS BEING CRUEL TO OLD PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT FAIR. HE'S ALSO BEING CRUEL TO YOUNG PEOPLE. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL -- THIS BUDGET ALSO CUTS AFTER SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS FOR POOR KIDS, BUT AGAIN, FOR A GOOD REASON.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP KIDS WHO CAN'T-- WHO DON'T GET FED AT HOME, GET FED SO THEY GET BETTER IN SCHOOL. GUESS WHAT? THERE'S NO DEMONSTRABLE EVIDENCE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THAT. THERE'S NO DEMONSTRABLE EVIDENCE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY HELPING RESULTS, HELPING KIDS DO BETTER IN SCHOOL.
COLBERT: YES, WHY FEED CHILDREN IF THEY AREN'T DOING BETTER IN SCHOOL? TAKE THE FOOD AWAY, AND MAYBE THEY'LL BE HUNGRY FOR KNOWLEDGE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND REMEMBER, MULVANEY'S NOT DOING THIS TO BE MEAN, HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR TAXPAYERS.
I THINK IT'S FAIRLY COMPASSIONATE TO GO TO THEM AND SAY, LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY, ANYMORE. SINGLE MOM OF TWO IN DETROIT, KAY?
COLBERT: GOOD POINT, MICK. I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE TO HAVE TO TELL A SINGLE MOM OF TWO IN DETROIT, "I'M SORRY, MA'AM, BUT I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO FEED YOUR CHILDREN." ( LAUGHTER ) THE ONLY THING THAT WORRIES ME IS THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY A BUDGET. THIS IS JUST THE PRESIDENT'S WISH LIST. AND MICK MULVANEY IS JUST TRUMP'S MAGICAL MONKEY'S PAW. ( LAUGHTER ) CONGRESS ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN MAKE A BUDGET. SO MY WORRY IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT GO TO HOUSE.GOV AND FIND OUT HOW TO CALL THEIR CONGRESSMAN AND TELL THEM TO PROTECT KIDS AND OLD PEOPLE, AND THAT COULD DERAIL ALL OF DONALD -- ( APPLAUSE ) THEY DO THAT. IF THEY CALLED CONGRESS AND DID THAT, THAT COULD DERAIL ALL DONALD TRUMP'S COMPASSION. AND THAT MIGHT UPSET THAT LONELY OLD MAN SO MUCH THAT HE JUST BECOMES A SHUT-IN. STAYS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO BRING HIM A MEAL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S "THE WERD." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT OTHER GUY'S GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. BRYAN CRANSTON IS HERE. AND AFTER THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, THERE'S GOING TO BE PUPPIES. SO STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: YEAH! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT NOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ OH, OH! FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, NO MISTAKING A MONDAY CROWD. THAT'S IT RIGHT HERE, THEY'RE ON THE PLANET. FOLKS, I'M A BIG ANIMAL LOVER. THAT'S WHY I DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP OUT ALL THE WORLD'S CREATURES THAT I DON'T WANT TO EAT. WE RECENTLY DID AN IMMENSELY POPULAR SEGMENT HERE, WHERE AUBREY PLAZA AND I TRIED TO HELP FIND SOME ADORABLE RESCUE DOGS A HOME BY TELLING YOU, THE AUDIENCE, SOME ENTICING LIES ABOUT THEM. AND HERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A LIE-- EVERY SINGLE PUPPY FEATURED IN THAT SEGMENT ENDED UP SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL OF THEM! THAT'S IT! WELL, I'D SURE LOVE TO DO THAT AGAIN SOMETIME... IF ONLY THERE WAS ANOTHER BELOVED CELEBRITY WHO WANTED TO HELP RESCUE A BUNCH OF PUPPIES BY LYING ABOUT THEM.
DID SOMEBODY SAY BRYAN CRANSTON? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DID YOU SAY BRYAN CRANSTON?
Stephen: I CAN'T TELL AT THIS POINT. YEAH, BRYAN. BRYAN. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE COMING OUT HERE.
REALLY? IT'S BEEN BOOKED FOR WEEKS.
Stephen: NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER EPISODE OF "RESCUE DOG RESCUE"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ WELCOME TO "RESCUE DOG RESCUE." QUICK REMINDER -- ALL THE PUPPIES WE HAVE HERE TONIGHT ARE ACTUAL ADOPTABLE DOGS FROM NORTH SHORE ANIMAL LEAGUE AMERICA. BRYAN, ARE YOU READY TO GET THESE GUYS A GOOD HOME?
NO, STEPHEN... I'M READY TO GET THESE GUYS A GREAT HOME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S BEGIN. FIRST PUPPY? EXCELLENT! OH! ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) HERE WE GO -- OH! THIS IS GRACE. IF YOU HAVE KIDS, GRACE IS THE PUPPY FOR YOU. SHE HAS THE ABILITY TO SING THE ENTIRE SOUNDTRACK TO THE 2010 DISNEY MOVIE "TANGLED." ALSO KNOWS ALL THE LYRICS TO "LET IT GO" FROM THE MOVIE "FROZEN"-- BUT WON'T SING IT. OH, THAT'S SWEET. THIS IS STERLING. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YEAH. YOU SAY, OH, NOW, BUT STERLING IS GETTING HIS LIFE BACK TOGETHER. HE'S SOBER NOW. BUT DON'T WORRY-- HE STILL LOVES TO PARTY, WHICH MEANS YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE A DESIGNATED DRIVER. PLUS, BECAUSE OF HIS CLUB DAYS, HE CAN GET YOU ANYTHING YOU NEED. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT NONE FOR YOU, RIGHT? THAT'S THE OLD STERLING. RIGHT? STAY STRONG.
STEPHEN: THIS IS COLUMBUS. HE'S A VERY GOOD-- WAIT A MINUTE, THIS IS A CAT! GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF HERE! DOGS ONLY, NO LOVING HOME FOR YOU, CAT! NO! MAYBE CONAN WILL HELP YOU, NOT ME! ANOTHER ONE. DOG. DOG. YOU'VE GOT TO BE FIRM. THERE ARE RULES. IT'S "RESCUE DOG RESCUE," BRYAN. THERE ARE RULES.
OKAY.
Stephen: THIS IS SCOUT. SCOUT IS A HOUND MIX WHO LOVES FRENCH CINEMA -- BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, ISN'T A TOTAL DICK ABOUT IT. SCOUT CAN ACTUALLY OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE VALUE OF GODARD'S WORK WITHOUT MAKING YOU FEEL SMALL. ALSO, FOUR LEGS-- PERFECT NUMBER FOR A DOG. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO DO WE HAVE HERE? OKAY, THIS IS GINGER. GINGER HAS "BENJAMIN BUTTON" DISEASE AND "MEMENTO" DISEASE. SO EVERY TIME YOU SEE HER, SHE'LL BE EVEN CUTER, AND MORE EXCITED TO MEET YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: BRYAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.
NICE TO BE BACK.
Stephen: EVEN JUST READING THE INTRODUCTION THERE, I'M JUST STRUCK BY WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY -- UM -- WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY ROSTER OF WORK YOU'VE PUT UP THERE. I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS APPROACH EVERYTHING WITH JUST SUCH TREMENDOUS HEART AND EMOTIONAL HONESTY AND A TRUE -- A TRUE CORE OF TRUTH.
WELL, THANK YOU -- THANK YOU, STEPHEN. I DO TRY TO PROVE EACH CHARACTER WITH A LEVEL OF DIGNITY -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BRYAN, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE HELMET. DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THE HELMET OFF?
I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.
Stephen: LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE LATCH RIGHT HERE. JUST A SECOND. HOLD ON.
OW, OW, OW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: NOW, THIS TAKES ME TO MY FIRST QUESTION, WHICH IS NUR -- IS IT "SABAN'S POWER RANGERS."
YES, "SABAN'S POWER RANGERS."
Stephen: WHICH POWER RANGER?
WHAT MAKES YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?
Stephen: I SAW AN AD. OH, YEAH YEAH.
Stephen: VERY PROUD OF YOU. IT'S LOOKING VERY GOOD.
Stephen: WHICH POWER RANGER ARE YOU PLAYING?
WELL, I'M NOT A POWER RANGER PER SE. I PLAY A CHARGED NAMED ZORDON, WHICH IS A DISEMBODIED HEAD IN THE WALLS OF A SHIP, WHICH, YOU KNOW, IS VERY COMMON.
Stephen: I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE RED POWER RANGER OUTFIT, THEN? WELL, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A RANGER.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU AS ZORDON HERE.
YOU DO?
Stephen: DO WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CLIB?
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S WHEN I FIRST MEET THESE NEW RANGERS.
Stephen: OKAY. WHO ARE NOT YET WORKING AS A TEAM AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO SAVE THE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: LET'S FIND OUT. YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE IS PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THESE CHILDREN?
THEY'RE TEENAGERS, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN INFANCY AND FULL MATURITY. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN REALLY.
SHOW ME THE COINS. THE MORPHINE GRID IS NEVER WRONG. IF THE POWER COINS RETURNED TO THE SHIP WITH THESE TEENAGERS, THEN THESE TEENAGERS ARE THE POWER RANGERS.
OKAY, QUICK QUESTION. DID I JUST HEAR YOU SAY WE'RE POWER RANGERS?
YES, YES, YOU ARE THE POWER RANGERS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
NO, I THINK I'M GOOD. GOOD.
Stephen: WOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW. SO YOU ARE A FLOATING HEAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE A METHOD ACTOR. HOW DO YOU PREPARE TO PLAY A FLOATING HEAD INSIDE A SPACE SHIP?
I FIRST SEVERED A HEAD --
Stephen: NOT YOUR OWN. NOT MY OWN. YOU KNOW, YOU APPROACH A CHARACTER THE SAME WAY, WHETHER YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN A FANTASY SEQUENCE, OR HISTORICAL CONTEXT OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: BUT I'M GUESSING THAT IN THIS ONE YOU MOSTLY DID VOICEOVER AND WERE ALLOWED TO KEEP YOUR SWEAT PANTS ON THE ENTIRE TIME.
THAT'S NOT THE REASON I TOOK THE JOB, STEPHEN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE --
Stephen: I'M PROBABLY SAYING, YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR PANTS WHEN YOU DID THIS ONE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. WHEN I DID JUST THE HEAD, I WAS NUDE. I HAVE A NUDITY CLAUSE IN EVERY CONTRACT. BUT IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU THINK. I HAVE TO BE NAKED ALL THE TIME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE NOT NEW TO THE UNIVERSE OF POWER RANGERS, I UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE, BACK IN THE '90s, BEFORE YOU WERE THE GREAT BRYAN CRANSTON, YOU WERE WORKING ACTOR BRYAN CRANSTON, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF YOU AS ONE OF THE MONSTERS IN THE 1990s. YOU'RE PLAYING SNIZZARD. JIM, DO WE NEED TO SET UP THE SCENE?
IT'S NOTING TO SNIZZER AT.
Stephen: JIM? THE FULL POWER! MMM! YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT! GOODBYE, POWER RANGER! AHHH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU WERE THE MONSTER THERE?
I PLAYED A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MONSTERS WHEN THE SHOW FIRST CAME OVER TO THE STATES FROM JAPAN. THEY NEEDED TO DUB IT INTO ENGLISH, AND I PLAYED A LOT OF MONSTERS, BECAUSE EVEN AT 23, WHEN I DID IT, MY VOICE WAS THER LOW, SO I WOULD SAY (LOW ICE BRE) YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME! HE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE SOME KIND OF RHYME. I'LL SLICE OFF YOUR TOE!
Stephen: CAN I FEEL YOUR HANDS. ARE YOU SWEATY IN THERE?
NO, I'M ACTUALLY VERY COMFORTABLE.
Stephen: REALLY? I CAN CONTROL MY OWN BODY TEMPERATURE JUST THROUGH A THOUGHT PROCESS.
Stephen: INCREDIBLE. I'M GOING TO DROP IT FIVE DEGREES.
Stephen: CAN YOU STOP YOUR HEART, TOO?
I CAN STOP MY HEART, AND SO CAN MY WIFE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: OKAY. THE REASON I ASK, YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN THE OUTFIT.
I AM COMFORTABLE.
Stephen: YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN OUTFITS A LOT BECAUSE WE FOUND ANOTHER CLIP FROM WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER. THE ONE THING I LOVE YOU IS YOU ALWAYS APPROACH ALL YOUR PARTS WITH TREMENDOUS DIGNITY.
WELL, I'VE KEPT THAT AS A PROMISE TO MYSELF. ONCE I GET IN, I'LL APPROACH EVERYTHING I DO FROM THAT DIGNIFIED POINT OF VIEW. I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT COULD EMBARRASS ME.
Stephen: JIM? HE HAD A PROBLEM. PEOPLE NOTED. ONE DAY HE NOTED. THAT'S WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT SHIELD DEODORANT SOAP. SHIELD KEEPS YOU FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN ALL THE DAY LONG. YOU'RE A CHANGED MAN!
SHIELD WORKS LONG AFTER ORDINARY SOAPS DON'T.
DAMN YOU, COLBERT! DAMN YOU!
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY SEXY SKUNK!
THAT'S A PUNGENT SKUNK!
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WERE DOING THAT?
I WAS, LIKE, 25.
Stephen: ISN'T IT AMAZING WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER HOW EXCITED -- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO EXCITED TO GET THAT PART.
I WAS ABSOLUTELY BESIDE MYSELF.
Stephen: I COULDN'T GET ARRESTED TO MAKE COMMERCIALS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. I WOULD HAVE KILLED FOR THAT COMMERCIAL!
YEAH, I KNOW.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY RENT! YOU'RE SHOOTING SOMETHING WITH KEVIN HART CALLED "THE UNTOUCHABLES" HERE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU --
Stephen: WE CAN SHOW THIS. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS PHOTO RIGHT HERE?
WELL --
Stephen: THE NAME OF THE FILM IS "UNTOUCHABLE." ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT'S GOING ON?
AND CAREER.
Stephen: THE DIGNITY PARADE CONTINUES.
OUT THE WINDOW! WELL, YOU KNOW, FROM TIME TO TIME THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO ON THE SET TO ENERGIZE THE CREW OR JUST BEING BY ENERGIZED.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER SPRUNG THIS ON MY CREW YET. ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! AND KEVIN HART IS A GOOD SPORT. HE TOOK IT THE WRONG WAY. SO -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING AN ADAPTATION -- A STAGE ADAPTATION OF NETWORK IN LONDON.
YES.
Stephen: WHO ARE YOU PLAYING? IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, IT'S A PROPHETIC FILM FROM 1974 ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO NETWORK NEWS AND AMERICAN CULTURE.
AND PATTY CHIEFRSKI WROTE IT AS A SATIRE BACK IN THE DAY AND NOW DOESN'T SEEM SOSA TIRRICLE.
Stephen: I WATCHED IT THREE WEEKS AGO WITH MY IS A-YEAR-OLD SON AND HE SAID, I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS IS A COMEDY. HE SAID, SERIOUSLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE JOKE, IT'S WHAT TV IS LIKE.
IT'S VERY POTENT AND WILL RES RES -- RESONATE WITH TODAY'S AUDIENCES. I'M DOING IT IN LONDON. I PLAY HOWARD BEHL, I'M MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Stephen: I CAN PEOPLE ARE READY TO YELL IT AGAIN. YOU GUYS READY? ONE, TWO, THREE!

( LAUGHTER ) THEN THERE'S THE CAB DRIVER -- ( ( HONKING )  ). GET OUT OF THE STREET, BROTHER! I'M, LIKE, THERE IS WHITE WOMEN ALL OVER THE PLACE. ( IN MIDDLE EASTERN ACCENT ) HOLY CRAP, GET IN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HE DRIVES ME TO SAFETY. AND HE'S, LIKE, BROTHER, WHEN WALKING AT NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. THESE POLICEMEN AND WHITE WOMEN ARE VERY DANGEROUS, BROTHER. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, DENZEL. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT MY NAME. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW A LOT OF YOU WHITE WOMEN ARE LOOKING AT ME, LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS FELT THAT WAY! ( LAUGHTER ) SO I'M SEEING WHITE WOMEN TALKING TO BLACK GUYS ON THE STREET, LIKE, IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN WALK BEHIND ME. THIS IS AMERICA, YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL THAT WAY. RARE! I'M KIDDING. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? ( LAUGHTER ) IF I WAS A WHITE WOMAN, I WOULD ROB BLACK DUDES. ( LAUGHTER ) I'D WALK UP TO THE BLACK GUY AND, LIKE, HI, MY NAME IS RAZA, GIVE ME YOUR WALLET. SARAH? THAT'S MY GRAND-MOMMA'S NAME. GIVE ME YOUR WALLET OR I'M GONNA SCREAM. WAIT A MINUTE! HERE, SARAH! ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S A COUPLE WHITE WOMEN IN HERE WHO ARE, LIKE, WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT. I MEAN, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE HIM? ( LAUGHTER ) I'LL BE EXPLAINING IT TO AN OFFICER -- YEAH, SHE WAS ABOUT THIS TALL, HAD BROWN HAIR, BROWN EYES, I THINK SHE DID YOGA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SHE RAN IN THAT DIRECTION. AND YOU MEAN TO TELL ME A MAN OF YOUR STATURE COULDN'T CATCH HER.
Stephen: WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE CHASING A WHITE -- NO, NO, I COULDN'T CATCH HER. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WOULD BE AN EPIDEMIC OF WHITE WOMEN ROBBING BLACK DUDES. WHITE WOMEN WOULD BE WAITING OUTSIDE OF BLACK CLUBS, LIKE, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT SOME TIME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
