CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CLASS OF 2017.
LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH AT LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, KIM JONG-UN ALSO GAVE A COMMENCEMENT STREET AT PYONGYANG STATE.
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF MY LIFE. NOTHING WORTH DOING IS EASY UNLESS YOU HAVE A WEALTHY AND POWERFUL FATHER. THEN IT'S REAL EASY. JUST LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS STADIUM. I THOUGHT, "HOW AM I GOING TO FILL IT UP?" THEN I THOUGHT, MANDATORY ATTENDANCE, PUNISHISHABLE BY DEATH, AND, WOW, WHAT A TURNOUT. YOUR FUTURES ARE BRIGHT WHETHER IT'S TOILG IN THE MUSHROOM CAVES OR LABORING IN THE LUBE MINES. POINT IS, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DANCE LIKE NO ONE IS WATCHING. THOUGH, FOR THE RECORD, WE ARE. TO CELEBRATE THIS MOST GLORIOUS DAY IN YOUR YOUNG LIVES, I WILL NOW BLOW UP THE WORLD. MAZEL TOV.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JULIE CHEN MATT WALSH AND DAVID ORTIZ. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY WEDNESDAY, EVERYBODY. TO START IT OFF, HAPPY WEDNESDAY. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A WEDNESDAY CROWD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUMP DAY! HUMP DAY! HUMP DAY, OF COURSE, BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST DAY TO MAKE LOVE. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, IT IS. IT'S GREAT. YOU'VE GOT WORK TOGETHER, YOU'RE TIRED. ULTIMATE NIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, LET'S SEE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND IT. THERE'S A HUGE SCANDAL OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. NO, NOT THAT SCANDAL. OR THE ONE BEFORE THAT, OR THE ONE TOMORROW. ALTHOUGH, TECHNICALLY, THEY'RE ALL PART OF ONE BIG SCANDAL STROGANOFF. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS REPORTING THAT BACK IN FEBRUARY, PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED F.B.I. DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY, TO SHUT DOWN THE F.B.I. INVESTIGATION INTO NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR MIKE FLYNN. THAT IS.
-- YEAH, YEAH. THAT IS DEFINITELY OBSTRUCTION OF SOMETHING. I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON WHAT IT'S OBSTRUCTION OF. IT'S OBSTRUCTION OF-- OH, IT'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUST... A SECOND. I'LL THINK OF IT. WHAT IS-- ANYWAY. APPARENTLY DONALD TRUMP TOLD COMEY, "I HOPE YOU CAN SEE YOUR WAY CLEAR OF LETTING THIS GO, TO LETTING FLYNN GO, HE'S A GOOD GUY." YEAH, HE'S A GOOD GUY, ASK ANYBODY, RUSSIA, TURKEY, ANYBODY. TRUMP TOLD COMEY REPEATEDLY TO LET IT GO. HE EVEN GOT IVANKA TO HELP ♪ LET IT GO LET IT GO ♪
Stephen: SO BEAUTIFUL, SO BEAUTIFUL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TALENTED, LOVELY. I HEAR IF SHE WASN'T A CARTOON, HE'D DATE HER. WE ALL THEN, BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, COMEY WROTE ABOUT THE CONVERSATION IN F.B.I. MEMOS, AND ALLEGEDLY, HE CREATED SIMILAR MOMEAUS ABOUT EVERY PHONE CALL AND MEETING HE HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT.  ( APPLAUSE ) TO PARAPHRASE HIMSELF-- TRUMP BETTER HOPE THERE ARE TAIMS OF THEIR CONVERSATION. OR, REALLY, ANYTHING HE NEEDS TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION TO SOMETHING SHALL OF, SHALL WE SAY, LESS INDICTING. MAYBE NOW'S THE TIME TO RELEASE YOUR TAX RETURNS, SIR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S SEE-- THAT WOULD BE FUN. OH, OH! WHAT WOULD BE LESS DAMAGING? GOT ANY MORE TAPES OF AND YOU BILLY BUSH. AND, BESIDES BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD, LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, IS PART OF THE TITLE. LATER THIS MONTH, TRUMP IS SCHEDULED TO ATTEND THE NATO SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE DURING THE CAMPAIGN, TRUMP REPEATEDLY SAYS SADE THINGS LIKE THIS--
NATO IS OBSOLETE.
Stephen: THING IS, THE U.S. IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBER OF NATO. IT'S LIKE THE BEST MAN AT A WEDDING STANDING UP AND SAYING, "CONGRATULATIONS TO THE HAPPY COUPLE. MONOGAMY IS OBSOLETE. EVERYBODY INTO THE FLESH PILE!" LET'S GO! HUMP DAY! AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WORRY NATO HAS THIS WEEK. RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE FRANTICALLY TRYING TO TRUMP-PROOF THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST VISIT. NOW, "TRUMP-PROOFING" TRADITIONALLY MEANS LOCKING THE DOOR TO THE MISS U.S.A. DRESSING ROOM. BUT JUST IN CASE, JUST IN CASE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT IN THIS CASE, IT ALSO MEANS COMPENSATING FOR TRUMP'S NOTORIOUSLY SHORT ATTENTION SPAN, BY TELLING HEADS OF STATE TO LIMIT THEIR TALKS TO TWO TO FOUR MINUTES AT A TIME. "ALL RIGHT, TELL ME HOW TO SOLVE THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS. YOU HAVE UNTIL MY BURRITO IS HOT." ( LAUGHTER ) IF THIS IS TRUE, TRUMP HAS GOT SUCH A SHORT ATTENTION SPAN, HE HAS TO USE A BOOKMARK FOR GREEGHT CARDS. IT WOULD BE FUN TO WATCH TRUMP READ A BOOK, "IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES. I LOVE A HAPPY ENDING." ( LAUGHTER ) ( DING ) OH, MY BURRITO IS DONE. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. AS ONE ANONYMOUS SOURCE PUT IT, "IT'S LIKE THEY'RE PREPARING TO DEAL WITH A CHILD." YEAH, WITH TRUMP AROUND, YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE HOOK OGHTZ CABINETS, BUMPERS ON THE COFFEE TABLE, AND PUT ONE OF ONE OF THOSE TWISTY CAPS TO CHILD-PROOF THE NUCLEAR BUTTON. AND JUST TO BE SAFE, PUT A MR. YUCK ON THERE. AND AT THE AGE OF 70-- IS HE 70 NOW? THEY GROW UP SO FAST. AT THE AGE OF 70, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ENERGY OF A CHILD, IN PART BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN EXERCISE. ACCORDING TO THE "WASHINGTON POST," DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES THE HUMAN BODY IS LIKE A BATTERY, WITH A FINITE AMOUNT OF ENERGY, WHICH EXERCISE DELET'S. GOOD NEWS, KIDS, THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW PRESIDENTIAL PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST. SEE THAT ROPE? DON'T TOUCH IT. OKAY, YOU PASSED. HERE'S YOUR STICKER. RUN ALONG. IN CASE YOU ALSO GET YOUR MEDICAL ADVICE FROM A MEDIEVAL BARBER, THE ARTICLE HELPFULLY EXPLAINS, "THE HUMAN BODY ACTUALLY BECOMES STRONGER WITH EXCERCISE." THAT'S ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY BY THE "NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF NO DUH." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT, OF COURSE, IS NOT HOW DONALD TRUMP SEES IT. APPARENTLY, HE THINKS THAT A PERSON IS BORN WITH A FINITE AMOUNT OF ENERGY, WHICH MAY I POINT OUT, BY THAT LOGIC, WOULD MEAN THE STRONGEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE BABIES. THEY'VE GOT THE MOST-- ONCE THAT FONTANEL CLOSES, THEY'RE KILLING MACHINES! THEY HAVE NO OBJECT PERMANENCE, SO THEY WON'T MISS YOU WHEN YOU'RE GONE. MAKE DELTA FORCE OUT OF THEM AND TOSS THEM OUT OF PLANES AT PEOPLE. I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS ANTI-EXERCISE THING COMING. AFTER ALL, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TRUMP DID WAS REPLACE MICHELLE OBAMA'S "LET'S MOVE" CAMPAIGN WITH HIS OWN, "LETS' NOT." ♪ ♪ ♪ THANK YOU. SPEAKING OF NOT EXERCISING, ANYONE RIDE THE SUBWAY HERE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE WAYS TO GET AROUND NEW YORK CITY, RIGHT AFTER GURNEY AND BEING KIDNAPPED. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT GOOD NEWS FOR SUBWAY FANS: THE RIDE'S ABOUT TO GET A LITTLE MORE POLITE, BECAUSE STARTING THIS WEEK, THE "NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY IS GIVING 'BABY ON BOARD' BUTTONS TO PREGNANT WOMEN." THAT'S A LOT BETTER THAN THE M.T.A.'S FIRST DRAFT, "INSEMINATED AND NAUSEOUS." ( LAUGHTER ) , OF COURSE, THEY'RE NOT HANDING THAT ONE OUT. THAT WAS A FIRST DRAFT. YOUR REACTION IS WHY THERE WAS NOT A SECOND DRAFT OF THAT. OF COURSE, THERE ARE PROS AND CONS HERE. ON THE PRO SIDE, THESE BUTTONS COULD FINALLY REMOVE EVERY SUBWAY RIDER'S GREATEST FEAR-- THAT YOU WILL ACCIDENTALLY OFFER YOUR SEAT TO A WOMAN YOU THINK IS PREGNANT BUT IS NOT. THAT'S WHY, TO COVER ALL THEIR BASES, THE M.T.A. IS ALSO OFFERING BUTTONS THAT SAY, "NOT PREGNANT, JUST CHIPOTLE". ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OH. OH. OH. SPEAKING OF BABIES, THE SOCIAL -- WE WERE SPEAKING OF BABIES PURPOSE WE WERE SPEAKING OF BABIES. THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION JUST RELEASED ITS 2016 BABY NAME DATA AND THE FASTEST GROWING NAME IN THE U.S. IS KYLO, AS IN KYLO REN FROM "STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS." THIS IS SURPRISING, SINCE NEWBORN BABIES LOOK WAY MORE LIKE YODA. "POOP MY PANTS I DID." ACCORDING TO THE DATA, 238 PARENTS NAMED THEIR SONS AFTER THE NEW "STAR WARS" VILLAIN LAST YEAR. BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED NAMING YOUR SON KYLO IS A GOOD IDEA. FOR ONE THING, KYLO REN KILLS HIS DAD! WHICH IS A HUGE SPOILER FOR YOUR SON'S TEENAGE YEARS-- "I TOLD YOU TO STAY OUT OF MY ROOM, OLD MAN!" "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO ME, AFTER YOUR BROTHER OEDIPUS RAN OFF WITH YOUR MOTHER!" ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JULIE CHEN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL SHARE SOME OF MY MOST SECRET CONFESSIONS.
Stephen: HEY, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I'M A CATHOLIC BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE MY CHURCH, I DON'T ALWAYS GO TO MASS AS OFTEN AS I SHOULD, BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON, ON SUNDAYS, THE CHURCH PARKING LOT IS JUST PACKED. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE DEAL, MY CHURCH HAS SO MANY WONDERFUL TRADITIONS, AND I MISONE OF MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITIONS, AND THAT'S COB FEGZ. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience: OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: FORGIVE ME AUDIENCE, WHEN I GO FISHING, I NAME THE WORMS AFTER MY ENEMIES. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I GET AS MANY FREE SUBS AS I WANT BECAUSE I SPENT $2 ON MY OWN HOLE PUNCHER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) YOU SCREAM, I SCREAM, WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM. BUT SOMETIMES I ALSO STAB PEOPLE FOR IT. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE< SOMETIMES AT PARTIES, I'M A BIT OF A NAME DROPPER, AND A BABY DROPPER. ( LAUGHTER ) ONCE I WAS THE TENTH CALLER TO A RADIO STATION JUST SO I COULD TELL THEM THAT I HAD NO INTEREST IN TWO TICKETS TO SEE LINKIN PARK. ( LAUGHTER ) UNTIL I'M TOLD OTHERWISE, EVERY BEACH IS A NUDE BEACH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IF A COP PULLS ME OVER FOR SPEEDING, I SAY, "DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?" AND IF HE SAYS, "NO," I SAY, "JOHN OLIVER." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THEN HE SAYS, "THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOU WERE DRIVING ON THE OTHER SIDE." ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW COSMOS ARE A "GIRLIE" DRINK, BUT I START ACTING PRETTY TOUGH ONCE I'VE HAD SIX OR SEVEN OF THEM. ( APPLAUSE ) "YOU WANNA GO, BRO? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT." ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T GO TO MUSEUMS TO APPRECIATE THE ART SO MUCH AS TO APPRECIATE MYSELF FOR GOING TO A MUSEUM. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. I REALLY WENT TO THIS ONE. MY FAVORITE NACHO TOPPING IS A SECOND ORDER OF NACHOS. ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVE A BUNCH OF OLD NEW YORKERS IN MY APARTMENT THAT I'LL NEVER GET AROUND TO, WHICH IS A SHAME, BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING HUNGRY AND SCARED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW HOW GAS STATIONS TIE BIG STUFF TO BATHROOM KEYS SO PEOPLE WON'T DRIVE OFF WITH THEM? I COLLECT THOSE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I MAKE FUN OF SEAN SPICER, BUT IF I HAD TO DO HIS JOB FOR FIVE MINUTES, I WOULD SET MYSELF ON FIRE.  ( APPLAUSE ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE!
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JULIE CHEN.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. MY FIRST GUEST IS THE EMMY AWARD-WINNING HOST OF "THE TALK" AND THE FACE OF "BIG BROTHER." PLEASE WELCOME JULIE CHEN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
THAT WAS NICE.
Stephen: YEAH. THAT'S A LOVELY DRESS.
THANK YOU! IT'S FUNNY, I HAD TO DESCRIBE TO SOMEONE WHAT I WAS WEARING. AND I REALIZED WHEN YOU DESCRIBE THIS DRESS, IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE. I SAID, "IT'S LIKE--" I SAID, "OKAY, IT'S LIKE BLACK. IT'S KIND OF WHICH I FONY, PICTURE A MOTH, LIKE MOTHY, AND I SILVER AND GOLDULA MAY ALL OVER IT. AND I REALIZED IT SOUNDS LEAK A DISASTER. WHEN YOU DON'T SEE IT AND HEAR IT.
Stephen: IT'S IRIDESCENT SPRING FLOWERS FALLING OVER A MIDNIGHT SKY.  ( APPLAUSE )
NO, NOT-- YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.
Stephen: COME ON. HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE WE HANG OUT OR ANYTHING, BUT WE DID HANG OUT A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO AT THE LINCOLN CENTER-- WHAT WAS IT CALLED "THE AMERICAN SONGBOOK THING?"
YES, THEY WERE HONORING MY HUSBAND.
Stephen: LES MOONVES.
RUNS THIS GREAT COMPANY, AND, OF COURSE, ALL THE GREAT STARS ON CBS CAME OUT. IT WAS A STAR-STUDDED NIGHT.
Stephen: AND I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET YOUR SON, CHARLIE.
YES, BUT I HAVE TO BE-- I HAVE A CONFESSION --
Stephen: I'LL GET THE CONFESSIONAL BACK OUT HERE.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, THAT NIGHT, EVERYONE WAS LINING UP. THEY ALL WANT THEIR FACE TIME WITH YOU. AND, LIKE, I'M VERY RESPECTFUL OF, LIKE, NOT, LIKE, TRYING TO DOMINATE SOMEONE THAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO TALK TO. AND I THOUGHT, I'M GOING TO SAVE MY MOMENT WITH STEPHEN COLBERT TO GET A PICTURE OF MY SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SON, CHARLIE, WITH YOU.
Stephen: I WOULD SO MUCH RATHER HAVE MY PICTURE WITH A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD. WE HAVE THE SAME-- WE HAVE THE SAME READING LEVEL.
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S A BIG STEPHEN COLBERT FAN. YOU REMEMBER YOU CAME TO OUR HOUSE FOR A MEETING.
Stephen: YEAH, SURE.
SHORTLY AFTER WE SAW ALL YOUR BILLBOARDS AND HE SAID, "THAT'S COLBERT! THAT'S COLBERT! PULL OVER." I SAID, I KNOW, I KNOW." I SAID I'M GOING TO GO OVER FOR MY SON-- PARENTS DO ANYTHING FOR THEIR KID-- AND FOR THE BRIEF MOMENT I HAD YOUR ATTENTION-- NOT BECAUSE OF YOU, BUT EVERYONE WAS LINED UP-- I SAID, "OKAY, CAN I PLEASE, I HATE DOING THIS." AND YOU WERE SO GRACIOUS. AND I WAS HITTING THE VIDEO INSTEAD OF-- AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DID. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD." I SAID, "I'M SORRY, I WAS HITTING VIDEO." AND YOU ENDED UP PUTTING YOUR HEAD DOWN LAUGHING.
Stephen: I JUST GOT THIS. SOMEBODY HANDED ME THE PHOTO AS IT TURNED OUT RIGHT THERE. THERE I AM. ( LAUGHTER ) SO THERE'S CHARLIE AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE BIG FOOT FLEEING A PHOTOGRAPHER. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT HERE. HOLD ON A SECOND. "CHARLIE, I PROMISE THIS IS ME." THERE YOU GO. ( LAUGHTER ).
BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE PART OF THE STORY SISOON REALIZE, I'M THE ONLY ASIAN WHO CANNOT READ A CAMERA. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I THINK THAT IS A JOKE ONLY YOU CAN TELL.
YES. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DON'T EVEN GET THAT JOKE!
OH, AREN'T YOU SO GRAND.
Stephen: NOW, AS I SAID, YOUR LOVELY HUSBAND, LESLIE MOONVES, IS THE BOSS AROUND HERE OF THE CBS CORPORATION. DO YOU EVER TALK ABOUT ME? DOES HE EVER, LIKE, MY NAME EVERY COME UP OR ANYTHING.
EVERY NIGHT. EVERY NIGHT. YOU'RE IN BED WITH US EVERY NIGHT AT 11:35. I CAN'T GATE GETAWAY FROM YOU. HE TALKS ABOUT YOU IN THE MORNING-- ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: WE HAVE A PET NAME FOR HIM, YOU KNOW, AT CBS. IT'S MR. MOONVES. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU HAVE-- DO YOU HAVE ANY PET NAMES FOR LES MOONVES.
I DO BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS THIS TOUGH, GRUFF GUY. HE'S LIKE A MAN'S MAN. AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE SHOWS HIS SQUEAMISH SIDE.
Stephen: SQUEAM ITCH, HOW SO?
OH, NO, PLEASE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO BE, "JEWELS, OH!" AND IT'S THINGS THAT YOU WOULD BE LIKE, "REALLY? I SAID I'M GOING TO GO BREAST FEED THE BABY." AND HE'S LIKE "OH!" YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THIS IS-- SO ANY TIME HE GETS THAT WAY, I'M LIKE, "WHAT'S WRONG, MY LITTLE PETUNIA?" HE'S MY LITTLE PETUNIA.
Stephen: OKAY, I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.
AND IT ALWAYS MAKES HIM LAUGH. HE'S MY PETUNIA.
Stephen: I CALL HIM "BIG DOG." ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT WILL --
Stephen: LL COOL LES. MR. CHEN."
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE CALLED HIM THAT ONCE?
Stephen: REALLY? THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
THANK YOU! WHEN I USED TO WORK IN NEWS, EVERY NIGHT THEY WOULD SEND THE HOMEWORK TO THE DOOR, AND ONE DAY HE OPENS THE DOOR, AND IT WAS AN ASIAN GUY, AND HE GOES, LOOKS AT HIM VERY SUSPICIOUS AND GOES, "MR. CHEN?" AND MY HUSBAND GOES, WHAT, DO YOU THINK?" AND HE GRABBED THE HOMEWORK. AND I WAS LIKE, "YES, MR. CHEN."
Stephen: YOU STARTED OFF-- YOU STARTED IN CBS LOS ANGELES ORIGINALLY?
NO, I STARTED OUT IN DAYTON, OHIO. AT THE ABC AFFILIATE.
Stephen: PAYING YOUR DUES.
PAYING MY DUES. AND IT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW. IF YOU WANT TO WORK IN NEWS, YOU GO TO A SMALLER MARKET, AND YOU LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YOU GO TO, LIKE, SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS, CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS, EVERYTHING, AND THAT'S WHY WHEREI-- THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY START. BUT I WAS AN INTERN IN 1989 AT CBS NETWORK NEWS WHERE 10 YEARS LATTER, I WAS ANCHORING THE SHOW.
Stephen: HERE IN NEW YORK.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ) SO THAT WAS --
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU LEARN? BECAUSE WE HAVE INTERNS HERE, WE HAVE INTERNS HERE, I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS WHAT ARE THEY REALLY LEARNING? I WANT THEM-- BECAUSE THEY DO HELP TO DO THE SHOW. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE LEARNING SOMETHING. WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY I DIDN'T TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF MY INTERNSHIP BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M FROM QUEENS. I GREW UP IN QUEENS. AND ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR QUEENS.
Stephen: PEOPLE IN QUEENS NOT WORK HARD? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE'RE NOT GETTING PAID?"
Stephen: THAT WAS BACK IN THE DARK DAYS BEFORE INTERNS GOT PAID.
RIGHT BEFORE THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. BUT I MADE A LIFELONG FRIEND AT THAT INTERNSHIP.
Stephen: WHO?
BEFORE I TELL YOU WHO IT IS, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW HIM, I WAS 19. AND I HAD A CRUSH ON ONE OF MY FELLOW INTERNS. THIS GUY WALKS IN, AND HE HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL WAVY DARK HAIR THAT HE WORE IN A LOW PONYTAIL, AND HE HAD THESE PLASTIC RIMMED GLASSES, LIKE ELVIS COSTELLO. AND HE WORE, LIKE, DOC MARTINS AND, LIKE, A HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDSTOOTH JACKET. AND I WAS LIKE, WOW, THIS GUY IS SO COOL. THEN FAST FORWARD. YOU KNOW WHO ANDY COHEN IS?
Stephen: YES, I'M FAMILIAR WITH MR. COHEN.
HE WAS ANDREW COHEN THEN. AND I HAD A BOYFRIEND IN COLLEGE. AND I GUESS I WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT ANDREW COHEN, ANDREW COHEN. AND ONE DAY MY BOYFRIEND SAYS TO ME, "HEY, JEWELS, YOU KNOW, YOUR INTERN FRIEND ANDREW COHEN--" HE WAS A WAITER, MY BOYFRIEND. "HE CAME INTO THE RESTAURANT, AND I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT HE WAS HITTING ON ME." I WAS THE LAST PERSON TO FIND OUT THAT HE WAS GAY, APPARENTLY.
Stephen: I GOT ONE OTHER THING FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ON "BIG BROTHER" THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD BUN THE ELECTION. THEY WERE SEQUESTERED WHILE DONALD TRUMP-- YOU KNOW, GOT THE VICTORY. WERE YOU TEMPTED AT ALL TO LIE TO THEM? ( LAUGHTER ) TO SAY, LIKE, "GUESS WHAT? GARY JOHNSON HAD A GREAT NIGHT." ANYTHING. "WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A PRESIDENT FOR A WHILE." LIKE, DID IT OCCUR TO YOU AT ALL?
YOU KNOW, THE RULES BASICALLY OF "BIG BROTHER" IF YOU'RE LOCKED IN THAT HOUSE, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY NEWS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD SO I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO TELL THEM WHO WON THE ELECTION. BUT THE PRODUCERS CAME TO ME AND SAID, "WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU BREAK THE NEWS TO THEM." I'M LIKE, "WE'RE BREAKING THAT FOURTH WALL. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE OUTSIDE INFORMATION OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD." BUT THEN I THOUGHT WHAT A MOMENT, OKAY. I'M GOING TO GO-- SO I GO IN, "HELLO HOUSEGUESTS," THE WHOLE THING. AND THE DRUM-UP. I'M LIKE "HOW MANY PEOPLE-- RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON WON THE ELECTION?" AND I THINK EVERYBODY BUT ONE-- I THINK THERE WERE EIGHT PEOPLE LEFT-- RAISED THEIR HANDS. AND I'M LIKE, OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD REACTION. AND I LAID IT OUT THERE. AND IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO SEE EVERYONE, "A," JAWS DROPPED. AND THEN, "B," THEY ALL LOOKED AROUND AT EACH OTHER LIKE OH. ARE THEY GOING TO JUDGE ME IF MY JAW IS OPEN. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, POLITICS, ONCE YOU SAY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ANY ISSUE OR ANY CANDIDATE, YOU AUTOMATICALLY PISSED OFF HALF THE COUNTRY. SO THEY WERE LIKE... "OH. OH. BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE CAMERAS ARE ON. IT WAS FASCINATING TO WATCH.
Stephen: SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT-- WHEN YOU'RE IN THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE NEWS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS?
ZERO.
Stephen: IF THINGS KEEP GOING THE WAY THEY ARE, ARE THERE ANY OPENINGS? BECAUSE I'M IN. I'M SO IN.  ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. "THE TALK" AIRS WEEKDAYS RIGHT HERE ON CBS, AND "BIG BROTHER" RETURNS FOR ITS 19th SEASON THIS SUMMER. JULIE CHEN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "VEEP" WHERE HE PLAYS THE SECOND MOST-INCOMPETENT PRESS SECRETARY ON TELEVISION.
WHOA, MIKE, WHAT HAPPENED? YOU LOOK LIKE THE BUSINESS END OF A BABOON.
MY EAR TOPS BURNED THE WORST, TOO. BUT THEY'RE STARTING TO PEEL SO THEY WON'T BE AS RED-- BE AS RED. WHEN I TALK I HEAR MY SKIN CRUNCH.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO OUT ON A LIMB.
THEY SAY GUITARS ARE GOOD AT INSERTING THEMSELVES.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
HE IS RED.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MATT WALSH. THE THREE-PIECE SUIT. SO DISTINGUISHED.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: FANTASTIC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU!
Stephen: ISN'T THAT NICE?
HEAVEN, RIGHT? GOD IS THERE.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I WANT TO THANK YOU AND EVERYBODY ON THAT SHOW, BECAUSE THIS PAST WEEKEND, SICK AS A DOG, LAID OUT ON THE COUCH, SHIVERING UNDER BLANKETS AND BECAUSE IT'S MY BIRTHDAY WEEKEND, MY WIFE SAID, "YOU CAN WATCH ANYTHING ULTIMATE." FOR THREE DAYS, I WATCHED EVERY SHOW OF "VEEP."
IT DIDN'T HEEL YOU, DID IT?
Stephen: NO.
IT MIGHT HAVE MADE YOU SICKIR.
Stephen: IT MIGHT HAVE. I'M GOING TO PRETEND FOR PURPOSES OF OUR INTERVIEW IT'S A CBS PROPERTY. IT'S THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION.
IT'S THE BEST SHOW ON CBS, "VEEP." THIS SHOW IS PRETTY GOOD. I GET ALL MY NEWS FROM THIS SHOW.
Stephen: I'M SO SORRY. THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET OUR NEWS HERE?
Stephen: NO, I GET MY NEWS FROM "VEEP" BECAUSE IT'S A HAPPIER VIEW OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.
IT IS, ISN'T IT? IT'S ESCAPISM.
Stephen: YOU MUST FEEL WHEN YOU DO THIS, "WE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE PORTRAYING SOMETHING WORSE THAN OUR PRESENT GOVERNMENT." OR RATHER, YOU MUST FEEL LIKE, "OUR PRESENT GOVERNMENT MUST BE BETTER THAN THIS." BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT IS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT YEAR. RIGHT NOW SHE'S NOT PRESIDENT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER BEING PRESIDENT, BUT NEXT YEAR ANYTHING MIGHT HAPPEN.
Stephen: SHE MIGHT RUN AGAIN?
I'M SAYING IF WE HAVE TO GO BACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: ARE YOU TO RUN AGAIN TO GET BACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. I DON'T WANT TO TEACH YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION DURING THIS CONVERSATION.
I'M SAYING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN POLITICS, NOT NECESSARILY IF SHE'S PRESIDENT, BUT BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A GARBAGE PLACE RIGHT NOW, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE NEXT YEAR.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
Stephen: DUMPSTER FIRE.
I'M NOT SAYING SHE'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AGAIN. I'M MAKING SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
Stephen: THIS IS NOT A SPOILER.
NOT A SPOILER AT ALL. I'M GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO SAY YOU JUST DID.
I'M GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: NEXT YEAR SHE IS PRESIDENT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT!
Stephen: SEASON TO SEASON YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GUYS ARE GOING.
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW FROM EPISODE TO EPISODE?
WE GET SCRIPTS A FEW WEEKS IN ADVANCE. WE GET A ROUGH OUTLINE. THIS YEAR WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO EXPLORE THE POST-PRESIDENCY, CLINTON AND OBAMA--
Stephen:  THE LIBRARY.
THE LIBRARY, FOUNDATIONS, MONITORING ELECTIONS. THERE ARE TROPES IN THAT WORLD, SO THEY FOUND THAT INTERESTING. NEXT YEAR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: HOW MUCH IS IMPROVISED?
WE USE IMPROV IN THE REHEARSAL PROCESS. WE TAKE THE SCRIPTS AND READ THEM AND IF THERE ARE SCENES THAT AREN'T WORKING WE WORKSHOP THEM. BUT IT'S NOT AN IMPROVISED SHOW IN ANY WAY. 95% OF IT IS ALL WRITTEN.
Stephen: BUT I KNOW YOU STARTED THROUGH IMPROVIVATION.
IN THE GROUP UPRIGHT CITIZENS BRIGADE. I GREW UP WATCHING YOU ON SECOND CITY STAGE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT PURPOSE WE WERE BOTH IN CHICAGO AT THE SAME TIME.
YOU WERE LIKE A SENIOR WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN CHICAGO. YOU WERE A BIG DEAL WHEN I STARTED.
Stephen: THAT'S A WAY OF SAYING YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN I AM.
BY ONE YEAR MAYBE.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
52.
Stephen: ONE YEAR.
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
Stephen: IMPROV HAS SIMPLE RULES-- AGREE.
LESS THAN.
Stephen: DID THAT GET YOU IN TROUBLE? IT GOT ME IN THE TROUBLE BACK IN THE DAY?
IT DID. IMPROVISERS THINK THEY DON'T HAVE TO PLAN ANYTHING. I WENT TO A WEDDING. A GOOD FRIEND WAS GETTING MARRIED, I HAD A GIFT AND A SUIT-- WHICH WAS A BIG DEAL. THERE WAS MUSIC, MEXICAN MUSIC, AND THERE WERE MEXICAN PEOPLE, AND MY BUDDY WASN'T MEXICAN AND I CALLED MY ROOMMATE AND SAID, "YOU CAN CHECK THE THING ON THE REFRIGERATOR?" AND HE SAID, "THE WEDDING IS NEXT WEEK, YOU'RE AN IDIOT." I WENT TO THE BAR AND MADE FRIENDS. THE IMPROV GAVE ME FREE DRINKS BUT MADE ME TOO EARLY FOR THE WEDDING.
Stephen:  NO ONE NOTICED?
THEY WERE NICE. I TALKED TO A FEW PEOPLE --
Stephen: DID YOU TELL THEM?
I DID. I TALKED TO ONE GUY AND HE SAID, "STICK AROUND. HAVE A DRINK." HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY.
Stephen: THAT'S A REALLY GREAT WAY TO CRASH A WEDDING AND NOT GET IN TROUBLE GEE, I HAD A LEGIT GIFT. IT WASN'T A CON.
Stephen: DID YOU GIVE THEM THE GIFT?
I COULDN'T. BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE MONEY TO BUY ONE FOR THE NEXT WEEK. I SHOULD HAVE. IF I WAS A CLASS ACT, I SHOULD HAVE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR THE DRINK, HERE'S A GIFT."
Stephen: IMPROVISERS DON'T MAKE REALLY ANY MONEY.
ZERO DOLLAR S.
Stephen:  SOMETIMES YOU'LL SPLIT THE HOUSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, MAYBE IF YOU'RE LUCKY. WHAT DID YOU DO FOR SCRATCH? WHAT DID YOU DO TO KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE?
WORST JOB I EVER HAD WAS SINGING TELEGRAMS AND I GOT SO BORED WITH IT --
Stephen: SINGING TELEGRAMS?
YOU WOULD GO DOOR TO DOOR AND BRING A BALLOON. IT'S CALLED BALLOONY TUNES. I JUST PLUGGED IT. YOU SINGLE A SONG IN A CRAZY COSTUME.
Stephen: YOU JUST SAID YOU PLUGGED IT. YOU OWE THEM. I'LL GIVE YOU $20 IF THEY STILL EXIST.
I BET THEY DON'T. YOU SHOW UP AS ZORO THE KISSING BANDIT, OR CUPID, OR NINJA TURTLES WERE POPULAR. I WAS SO BORED I BROUGHT FRIENDS. I HAD ONE GIG WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONATELLO AND WE MADE A FAKE HERO OUT OF MY FRIEND AND CRAZY ZORO --
Stephen: ADAM McKAY.
ADAM McKAY. I CALLED HIM MOGAR. WE GOT IN. WE HAD A FAKE BATTLE, I WIN AS MICHELANGELO AND SENT HIM OUT TO GET THE BALLOONS. I SAID ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGHT, I'LL SEND YOU TO GET BALLOONS, SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR TONY AND WE LEAVE. WE GO ♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ♪ AND I REALIZED I FORGOT THE KID'S NAME. WE GET TO THE NAME AND I WAS SILENT AND ADAM GOES ♪ DEAR TONY ♪ AND IT WASN'T TONE GLE WE HAVE TO GO. CAN I ASK YOU ONE THING? WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? WHAT'S IN THIS PHOTO?
WHAT'S HERE? OH, YOU FOUND THAT.
Stephen: SOMEONE-- I PAID SOMEONE TO FOUND THIS.
THAT IS CALLED NBA 2 "K." I PLAY AN ASSISTANT COACH. WHEN YOU PLAY THAT GAME, ON YOUR WAY TO THE PROS, YOU GET TO MEET ME AND I SAY THINGS LIKE, "COME ON, KID. THERE ARE A LOT OF AGENTS OUT THERE. LIGHT IT UP! SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT!" ( APPLAUSE ) I DO A LOT OF THAT MOTION WHERE YOU'RE SORT OF --
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT VIDEO GAMES. I DON'T LIKE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES BUT I LIKE THE BUFFERING MOTION. DO YOU WANT TO DO IT WITH ME. WHEN WE'RE NOT-- YOU DO THIS. ... THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS WITH BVIDEO GAMES.
BUCKLE THE KNEE A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: KEEPING THE HANDS LOOSE ALL THE TIME.
YUP.
Stephen: WELL, MATT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "VEEP" AIRS SUNDAYS ON HBO. MATT WALSH, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DAVID ORTIZ. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
