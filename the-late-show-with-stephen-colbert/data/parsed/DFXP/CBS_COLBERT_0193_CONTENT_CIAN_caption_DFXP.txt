Stephen: RYAN, THANK YOU FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME. WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE FOR YOU SINCE THIS SCANDAL ABOUT YOUR ALLEGED ROBBERY IN RIO BROKE?
WELL, SINCE EVERYTHING HAPPENED, I KIND OF BEEN LAYING LOW.
Stephen: IF YOU WANT TO LAY LOW, TELEVISION IS THE BEST PLACE TO DO THAT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLEAR UP THINGS. YOU GAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH BILLY BUSH WHERE YOU CLAIMED AT A GAS STATION IN RIO A GUN WAS PUT TO YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE SAYING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?
I OVER-EXAGGERATED THAT PART.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING, THAT PART IS WHEELLY THE WHOLE PART. WITHOUT A GUN COCKED AT YOUR FOREHEAD, IT'S REALLY ABOUT SOME GUYS URINATING ON A GAS STATION. HOW DID YOU GET THAT SO WRONG?
I WAS INTOCKS DATED.
Stephen: BUT SUNDAY, WHEN YOU TOLD THAT STORY TO BILLY BUSH, IT WAS HOURS AFTER THE INCIDENT.
I WAS STILL INTOXICATED.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT THEN ON WEDNESDAY, YOU TOLD MATT LAUER AGAIN YOU WERE ROBBED. THAT WAS ANOTHER THREE DAYS LATER.
I WAS VERY INTOCKS DATED.
Stephen: RYAN, ARE YOU INTOXICATED RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER) ANY REACTION AT ALL? LET ME ASK YOU THIS, RYAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT A GUN IS?
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.
Stephen: IS THIS A GUN TO YOU?
I DON'T KNOW AT ALL.
Stephen: NOW, THERE IS TALK ABOUT BANNING YOU FROM SWIMMING OVER THIS. LET'S SAY YOU'RE GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE. DESCRIBE FOR ME, DESCRIBE FOR THE AUDIENCE THE RYAN LOCHTE WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE AT THE OLYMPICS IN TOKYO IN 2020.
INTOCKINTOXICATED.
Stephen: FAIR ENOUGH. IT'S THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT, AMY SCHUMER, OMARI HARDWICK, MICHAELA WATKINS, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, "THE LATE SHOW" IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY! WHOA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ THANK YOU! WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN) NICE TO SEE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (APPLAUSE) OH, WHAT A LOVELY CROWD. I GOT TO TELL YOU, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK, AND I JUST WANT TO START OUT TONIGHT BY SAYING, U.S.A. NUMBER ONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) U.SU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! MY FAVORITE MOB, MINDLESS. WHY ARE WE CHANTING? BECAUSE AMERICA JUST DOMINATED THE 2016 OLYMPICS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT, WE KILLED IT. THE OLYMPICS ARE A TIME THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COMES TOGETHER AND COMPETES IN THE SPIRIT OF BROTHERHOOD AND GOODWILL, SO LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY: SUCK IT, WORLD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SUCK IT IN RECORD TIME! WE GOT 121 MEDALS! AND I'M NOT SURPRISED. I WATCHED THE GAMES HERE IN THE STATES, CAN'T REMEMBER THE CHANNEL, AND FROM WHAT I SAW, APPARENTLY, ONLY AMERICANS COMPETED. AMERICANS, AND USAIN BOLT. OF COURSE. HE'S AN HONORARY AMERICAN, BECAUSE JAMAICA IS BASICALLY TROPICAL COLORADO. NOT ONLY DID AMERICA LEAD THE OVERALL MEDAL COUNT, WE WON THE MOST GOLD MEDALS, THE MOST SILVER MEDALS, AND THE MOST BRONZE MEDALS. WHICH MEANS WE'RE NOT ONLY NUMBER ONE, WE'RE ALSO NUMBER ONE AT BEING TWO AND THREE! LAUG(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE NUMBER SIX! I THINK. I THINK THAT'S MATH. AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE AMERICAN MEDALS WERE WON BY FEMALE ATHLETES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE. SO, BOYS, NEXT TIME SOMEBODY ON THE PLAYGROUND SAYS YOU THROW LIKE A GIRL, SAY "THANK YOU." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OVER TWO DOZEN OF THOSE MEDALS WERE WON BY AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN, AND ON TWITTER PEOPLE CELEBRATED THAT WITH THE HASHTAG #BLACKGIRLMAGIC. WHICH I GUESS WAS EASIER TO TYPE THAN HASHTAG #BLACKGIRLHARDWORKANDDEDICATION. I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE BIG STORY WAS RYAN LOCHTE, HASHTAG #FRATBOYTRAGIC, -- HE'S FUN -- (LAUGHTER) AND HIS MADE-UP STORY ABOUT HE AND THREE OTHER SWIMMERS BEING ROBBED AT GUNPOINT IN BRAZIL. TURNS OUT THEY WEREN'T ROBBED, THEY JUST HAD A CONFRONTATION WITH SECURITY GUARDS AFTER THEY DRUNKENLY STOPPED AT A GAS STATION, BROKE SOME STUFF, AND URINATED ON THE BUILDING. I JUST WANT TO SAY -- GUYS, YOU STOPPED AT A GAS STATION FOR A PEE BREAK? C'MON, YOU'RE OLYMPIC SWIMMERS, YOU SPEND 90% OF YOUR LIVES IN PUBLIC POOLS. THAT'S WHAT THE CHLORINE'S FOR. COME ON. WE'RE ALL ADULTS. BUT LOCHTE SAID HE DIDN'T LIE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. HE HAS A SIMPLE AND REPEATABLE EXPLANATION.
I OVER-EXAGGERATED THE STORY. I OVER-EXAGGERATED. I OVER-EXAGGERATED SOME PARTS. MY MISTAKE WAS OVER-EXAGGERATING. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
YOU WEREN'T LYING?
I WASN'T LYING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. I OVERE-EXAGGERATED WHAT WAS HAPPENED.
STEPHEN: HE "OVER-EXAGGERATED." EXAMPLE: IF HE SAID HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE WORD "LIE" MEANS, THAT WOULD BE A BIT OF AN OVER-EXAGGERATION. (APPLAUSE) I THINK WE'RE APPLAUDING LYING. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE. (LAUGHTER) AND, NOW, THE WHOLE WORLD THINKS OF RYAN LOCHTE AS THAT CRAZY AMERICAN WITH WEIRD HAIR WHO KEEPS ON MAKING STUFF UP AND CAUSING AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT, WHICH IS NOT HOW AN OLYMPIAN ACTS, THAT'S HOW A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ACTS. (LAUGHTER) GET IT STRAIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I GOT, LIKE, HALF A SUPERMAN GOING ON TONIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. DON'T TELL ANYBODY. (LAUGHTER) AND, TODAY, LOCHTE LOST ALL FOUR OF HIS SPONSORS, INCLUDING SPEEDO. YEAH. AND THAT'S GOT TO HURT, BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN HIS BIGGEST SUPPORTER-- WELL, NOT BIGGEST, BUT CRUCIAL. (LAUGHTER) SPEAKING OF, SHALL WE SAY... THE BATHING SUIT AREA, CHECK OUT JAPANESE POLE VAULTER HIROKI OGITA'S FAILED ATTEMPT AT QUALIFYING. HE GOES UP, HITS THE BAR WITH HIS LEG, SHOULD BE FINE, COMING DOWN AND... BOOM! HE KNOCKS THE BAR OFF WITH A CLUNK OF HIS JUNK! THERE IT IS. OH, THAT POOR MAN. CAN YOU IMAGINE IN JUST THINK, FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, HE'LL HAVE TO TELL EVERYONE, "YEAH, I WENT TO THE OLYMPICS, BUT I DIDN'T WIN GOLD BECAUSE MY (BLEEP) IS TOO BIG. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? (LAUGHTER) YOU WIN SOME, YOU WIN -- YOU WIN. (LAUGHTER) ANOTHER OLYMPIC OOPSY DAISY WAS BULGARIAN RHYTHMIC GYMNAST NEVIANA VLADINOVA, WHO DANCED HER HOOP ROUTINE TO THE THEME FROM "SCHINDLER'S LIST." COME ON, RHYTHMIC GYMNASTS, DON'T DRAG "SCHINDLER'S LIST" INTO THIS. GROWN ADULTS PLAYING WITH RIBBONS AND HOOPS IS SAD ENOUGH. (LAUGHTER) LITERALLY ANY OTHER SONG WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER CHOICE. LIKE SHE COULD HAVE USED TITANIC. NOT THE MUSIC, JUST THE SOUND OF THE SHIP GOING DOWN. (SINKING SHIP SOUNDS) YOU WANT SOME HAPPY MUSIC? SAY HI TO MY FELLOW MUSICIANS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN! ( BAND PLAYING ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, JON, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
Jon: GREAT, MAN.
Stephen: WHO WAS YOUR BREAK, MAN?
Jon: FANTASTIC. I WAS RELAXING, THEN I WENT TO PLAY A FEW SHOWS, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE JUST CHILLED OUT AND HAD A GOOD TIME.
Stephen: WELL, THAT SOUNDS NICE. ONE THING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS, WITH EVERYBODY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE OLYMPICS, ONE STORY THAT I THINK GOT UNDER A LOT OF PEOPLE'S RADAR IS THERE IS A TRAGIC FLOODING SITUATION GOING ON IN SOUTHERN LOUISIANA RIGHT NOW, HISTORIC LEVELS OF RAIN COMING, TRILLIONS OF GALLONS FELL IN ONE WEEK, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MISPLACED, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DAMAGE AND THEY STILL DON'T KNOW TOTAL. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NAMED STORM,ETH NOT GETTING THE ATTENTION LIKE KATRINA AND SANDY BUT IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE AFFECTED BY IT?
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY EXTENDED FAMILY. MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY ARE BLESSED ENOUGH TO BE OKAY. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN DO SOMETHING.
Stephen: COLBERTLATESHOW.com, WE HAVE LOCAL CHARITIES THERE THAT ARE DIRECTLY HELPING THE PEOPLE WHERE YOU CAN GO HELP RIGHT NOW. SO CHECK IT OUT, PLEASE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, THE LATE SHOW WAS OFF FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT DONALD TRUMP STILL HAD ORIGINAL EPISODES. (LAUGHTER) SO LET'S CATCH UP, IN TONIGHT'S REPORT: "WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID ON MY SUMMER VACATION." (LAUGHTER) NOW, BEFORE I DIVE IN, I'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE. I'M NOT USED TO TAKING A TWO-WEEK DOSE OF TRUMP IN ONE SEGMENT. HE'S LIKE ARSENIC. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SMALL SIPS EVERYDAY SO HE DOESN'T KILL YOU. WHILE I WAS AWAY, TRUMP DID SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM DO BEFORE: TRY TO APPEAL TO SOMEONE. THIS WAS HIS PITCH TO BLACK VOTERS OVER THE WEEKEND:
TONIGHT I'M ASKING FOR THE VOTE OF EVERY SINGLE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZEN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO WANTS TO SEE A BETTER FUTURE. LOOK HOW MUCH AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED UNDER DEMOCRATIC CONTROL. TO THOSE I SAY THE FOLLOWING, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE BY TRYING SOMETHING NEW LIKE TRUMP? YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY, YOUR SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD, YOU HAVE NO JOBS, 58% OF YOUR YOUTH IS UNEMPLOYED. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? (AUDIENCE REACTS) (BOOING)
Stephen: HE'S A PEOPLE PERSON. (LAUGHTER) VERY APPEALING. VERY APPEALING?
Jon: YEAH, I'LL DEFINITELY VOTE FOR THAT GUY. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU SEE, YOU'RE OPEN MINDED. THANK YOU FOR STAYING OPEN MINDED, JON. YES, BLACK PEOPLE, AS FAR AS DONALD TRUMP KNOWS, YOU'RE ALL POOR, YOUR SCHOOLS SUCK, YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED, YOUR LAST MEAL WAS A FOOTBALL WITH THE WORD TURKEY WRITTEN ON IT, SO TAKE A CHANCE! WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE? IT'S SUMMED UP IN TRUMP'S NEW SLOGAN: "YOU'RE ALREADY ON FIRE, SO YOU MAY AS WELL SHOOT SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE HEAD." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THAT'S A NEW GAME. I LIKE THAT. NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH SELL -- JON'S ENTHUSIASM ASIDE -- BECAUSE -- AND THIS IS TRUE -- AMONG BLACK VOTERS, IN A TWO PERSON RACE, TRUMP IS IN FOURTH PLACE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S LIKE COMING IN THIRD AT SOLITAIRE. (LAUGHTER) PLUS, LAST WEEK, TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN, AND JOE PESCI CORPSE DOUBLE, PAUL MANAFORT RESIGNED AFTER UKRAINE'S ANTI-CORRUPTION BUREAU REVEALED THAT HE MAY HAVE RECEIVED $12 MILLION IN UNDISCLOSED PAYMENTS... BY THE PRO-RUSSIAN POLITICAL PARTY OF UKRAINE'S PRO-PUTIN GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS WAS UNDISCLOSED. IF SOMEONE GAVE ME $12 MILLION, I'D BE AT THE BAR SAYING, "HEY, GUESS WHO JUST GOT PAID $12 MILLION? OH, AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I DIDN'T WIN GOLD IN THE POLE VAULT? IT'S A PRETTY GOOD STORY." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO, WITH MANAFORT OUT, TRUMP WAS FORCED TO BRING IN A NEW TRUMP-WRANGLER: BREITBART NEWS CHIEF AND LESBIAN HAIRCUT MODEL STEVE BANNON. NOW, IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF BREITBART NEWS-- YOU DON'T HAVE A RACIST UNCLE ON FACEBOOK. BANNON IS KNOWN AS A POLITICAL BRAWLER. ACCORDING TO ONE FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR BREITBART: "HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS PRONE TO PROFANITY-LACED TIRADES AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT." WHAT A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM DONALD TRUMP, WHO LIKES TO GO TO BED "EARLY." AND HE HAS A BOLD NEW DIRECTION FOR THE CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE "BANNON HAS CONVINCED TRUMP THAT THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO BE BARE-KNUCKLES BRAWL WITH HUGE RALLIES. GLOVES OFF. THAT'S RIGHT. BANNON THINKS THE REASON TRUMP IS BEHIND IN THE POLLS IS THAT HE'S BEEN TOO CIVIL, AND NOW THE GLOVES ARE OFF. THE TINY, TINY GLOVES. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE WITH THE POLE VAULT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH AMY SCHUMER. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪

Stephen: YOU WENT TO THE HOSPITAL?

Stephen: LIKE FLUIDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SNINCHTS SISTER AND I WERE LAUGHING SO HARD. THEY WERE TAKING BOOED ALL THE TIME AND THEY KEPT HAVING TO TAKE MORE. I WAS ROCK BOTTOM AND, SO, I COULDN'T SPEAK, AND I COUGHED SO HARD --
Stephen: THAT'S DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE A PERFORMER NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK.
TURNS OUT, I THOUGHT THE GOLD WAS JUST THIS, BUT I'M, LIKE, ARIEL, YOU HAVE TO HEAR MY VOICE. I COUGHED SO HARD I FRACTURED MY OWN RIBS.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT A LITTLE HOT TEA?
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT. THANK YOU. SELF-PROMOTION.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT. ALL YOU GUYS ARE THE SAME.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO. THAT'S SOFIES. THANK YOU.
Stephen: DID YOU GET TO ENJOY THE ISLANDS? WHAT ISLAND WERE YOU ON?
HO-- HONOLULU, OAHU -- I DON'T KNOW, THERE WAS A PALM  TREE. (LAUGHTER) I WAS SICK THE WHOLE TIME. FIRST OF ALL, I'M FROM HERE, SO I LIKE TO SIT AND NOT MOVE.
Stephen: YEAH. AND EVERYONE HIKES THERE. LIKE, EVERYONE LIKES EVERY DAY.
Stephen: THEY'RE SO HEALTHY.
THEY'RE SO HEALTHY. DOGS HIKE. CATS, YOU WILL SEE ON A HIEFNLGT (LAUGHTER) I WENT LIKING AND SOMEBODY SAID, ON YOUR LEFT -- IT WAS, LIKE, A BABY IN A DIAPER BLOWING PAST ME. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: DID YOU GO TO KAUAI? BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE GRAND CANYON OF --
I WAS TOO SICK. I WAS BED RIDDEN.
Stephen: I WENT HIKING ON KAUAI ON MY HONEYMOON BECAUSE WE WALKED DOWN INTO A CANYON AND I COULDN'T GET OUT. (LAUGHTER) I THOUGHT, THAT'S IT FOR ME, NO SEX ON MY HONEYMOON. I COULDN'T CLIMB UP A HILL.
AND NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH YOU.
Stephen: I FELT LIKE CUTTING OFF MY ARM BY THE END OF IT.
WHAT A GREAT WAY TO START A MARRIAGE.
Stephen: YEAH. HAWAII DIDN'T TOTALLY AGREE WITH ME. THEY WOULD HIKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU AND WHICH ARE STOPPED EASILY. IT WAS REALLY MUDDY AND I ASKED SOMEONE AND THEY SAID, IS IT GOING TO BE THIS MUDDY AT THE TOP? THEY WERE, LIKE, YES, BUT ALSO THERE ARE BEES UP THERE. (LAUGHTER) NOTHING SLOWS THEM DOWN.
Stephen: DON'T DRINK THE WATER. IT HAS LEPROSY IN IT.
NOTHING SLOWS THEM DOWN.
Stephen: WE WENT TO THE MET GALA.
WE DID.
Stephen: LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, MY GOSH.
Stephen: THAT'S ALL SAFETY PINS.
THOSE WERE A NECESSITY.
Stephen: YEAH, IN CASE SOMEBODY NEEDED TO CHANGE A BABY'S DIAPER.
I LOOK LIKE BEN ROTH ALSO BERGER -- ROETHLISBERGER.
Stephen: NO, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. WHO IS THAT?

Stephen: THESE ARE PERSONAL STORIES FROM YOUR LIFE. EVEN DIARY ENTRIES WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW CAN YOU BE AN INTROVERT AND PLAY HUGE CROWDS AND BE A COMEDIENNE?
BEING A PERFORMER IS GREAT. YOU'RE ALONE UP HERE. YOU CAN FEEL THAT, RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH. YOU'RE ALONE.
Stephen: VERY LONELY. PEOPLE COME IN, THERE IS A PERFORMANCE AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE THEM ANYMORE. I'M ON STAGE, YAPPING, THEN IN MY HOTEL ROOM BY MYSELF. SEEMS STRANGE BUT I AM A CLASSIC INTROVERT. YOU RUN OUT OF ENERGY.
Stephen: MOBILELY AVAILABLE PEOPLE.
I DON'T LIKE TO TALK TO ANYONE WITH. EVEN IF I SEE SOMEONE I LIKE AT THE GYM, I'M, LIKE, OH, MY GOD... YOU WANT TO RECHARGE AND BE ALONE.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO BE WITH PEOPLE TOTALLY ON YOUR OWN TERMS, LIKE, JUST STAND OVER THERE, I MIGHT COME TALK TO YOU IF MY LONELINESS BECOMES GREAT ENOUGH.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO MY BOYFRIEND?
Stephen: YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND CAY NOODLING IN BED ON INSTAGRAM.
I TOLD HIM JOKES I HAD BEEN WRITING AND HE FELL ASLEEP.
Stephen: THAT'S A REALLY LONELY FEELING. YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT BEING OUT ON THE ROAD, LIVING THE LIFE OF A STANDUP. I WAS IN IMPROV TROUPES BUT NEVER STANDUP. WHAT'S THAT LIKE?
IF YOU'RE A GUY, IT'S FUN BECAUSE YOU GET LAID. (LAUGHTER) MM-HMM. I'M SURE THEY'RE ALL MARRIED NOW.

SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH HIM. TRUST ME. HE HAS AN ENERGY.  HE HAS AN ENERGY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
SORRY. GOOD POINT. SO, YOU KNOW, YEAH, I'M AN INTROVERT. SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEFENSE FOR WHY I WOULD BE HITTING ON YOUR STANDUP BASSES.
Stephen: YEAH. O THE ROAD SUCKS. WHAT'S THE QUESTION? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THE QUESTION WAS HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW. HAS THE FEVER KICKED IN?
I'M STILL NOT AT 100%, THAT'S THE TRUTH. BUT I'M SO LUCKY THE WAY I GET TO GO ON THE ROAD NOW. I BRING MY FAMILY. JAZZ TRIO OPENS UP THE SHOW.

Stephen: YEAH, GOOD FOR YOU. SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE A BUSY GUY SHOOTING THAT. HOW HAS YOUR SUMMER BEEN SO FAR? I KNOW YOU'RE AN ATHLETE. YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL IN GEORGIA, RIGHT?
I DID. I'M FROM THE SOUTH.
Stephen: WHERE. ATLANTA, GEORGIA.
Stephen: I'VE HEARD OF IT. I PLAYED SOME BALL. I DOVE INTO THE OLYMPICS THIS YEAR. I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME. MANY ATHLETES DIDN'T GO TO RIO BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME OF THE BEST OLYMPICS WE'VE HAD, MAN.
Stephen: AMERICA KICKED A LITTLE ASS. KICKED A LITTLE ASS. (APPLAUSE) AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS A SERIOUS ATHLETE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SHOW BOATING OF USAIN BOLT? DO YOU THINK THAT'S ARROGANT OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR SPORTS?
HE RUNS WITH THE JOY OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD. HE'S LIKE ROBIN WILLIAMS, REST IN PEACE, ACTING. HE'S FOUND THE CHILD IN HEART AND HE RUNS AND HAS FUN AND DANCES RIGHT BEFORE THEY SHOOT THE GUN OFF AND I THINK IT'S AWESOME. I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT HE DOES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HE'S A REAL PERFORMER:  YOU PLAYED FOR GEORGIA AND ALMOST FOR THE N.F.L., RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEING A GOOD ATHLETE AND ACTOR?
SURE, BECAUSE HOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TO A GAME WHERE E.R. BORED OUT OF OUR MINDS. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE EXCITING.
Stephen: ONE IS BASEBALL, ONE IS FOOTBALL.
THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) WE STILL ROOTED FOR DENNIS RODMAN EVEN DURING THOSE MOMENTS WHEN HE PUT ON A WEDDING DRESS.
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT HIS JOURNEY.
IT IS, IT'S ABOUT JOURNEY. THE BAND SHOULD HAVE --
Stephen: NO, NO, THEY'RE GOOD. (LAUGHTER)

I DO. OR IN PART -- I IMPART WHATEVER THERE IS TO IMPART.
Stephen: OKAY, WHO? O THERE IS TWO OLYMPIC ATHLETES, CARRY IRVIN AND DRAMOND GREEN.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU ADVISE THEM?
IT WAS TOUGH. MY TEXT MESSAGES WERE DEFINITELY BY POLAR.
Stephen: DID YOU GIVE DRAMOND GREEN ADVICE ON STOP HITTING PEOPLE IN THE GROIN DURING GAMES?
I DIDN'T --
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T THINK HE WAS? HE WAS WORKING THEM LIKE A SPEED BAG.
REALLY.
Stephen: YES. WE NEED TO PLAY THAT BACK.
Stephen: DON'T NEED TO. ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.
AND LeBRON STEPPED OVER HIM. HE'S A LITTLE TESTY.
Stephen: TESTY'S THE RIGHT WORD. TELL US ABOUT YOUR SHOW.
WE HAVE A GREAT PRODUCE AROUND TEAM OF STARS. THEY CREATED A SHOW WHERE A MAN CAME FROM SOUTH SIDE JA JAMAICA QUEENS, AND AFTER HAVING DEALT DRUGS THROUGH THE GREATER PART OF NEW YORK CITY, HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FLY STRAIGHT.

I WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THAT HUG.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER FOR A SECOND. IT'S LIKE WE WERE SLOW DANCING FOR A SECOND.
I WE WANT.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THOUGHT WE WOULD BE GREAT FRIENDS IN A MORE NATURAL SETTING. THIS IS UNNATURAL.
Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING. THIS IS SPEED DATING, SIX MINUTES, LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON "CASUAL."
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: IT'S A FUNNY SHOW AND SAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: HEARTBREAKING. IT'S THE STORY OF A SISTER AND KIND OF A NARY DO WELL BROTHER AND SHE'S TAKING CARE OF HIM BEYOND WHEN SHE SHOULD.
THEY'RE VERY CO-DEPENDENT, IT'S VERY UNHEALTHY.
Stephen: IS THIS BASED ON YOUR LIFE?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YOU ARE A FREED -- YOU ARE A COMEDIENNE. AREN'T THEY ALL SUPPOSED TO BE SAD?
I HAVE A TEAR ON THE INSIDE.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN IMPROVISER.
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU GO DO SETS IN LOS ANGELES.
YES.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN FOREVER. I THINK I WOULD SUCK.
NO.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A SPORT, YOUR BACKHAND. YOU LOSE IT IF YOU DON'T USE IT. IT COULD BE PAINFUL TO DIE UP THERE.
YEAH, I'VE DONE THAT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE PARTICULARLY PAINFUL MEMORIES OF DYING ON STAGE?
ONE TIME I DID A SKETCH THAT, IN MY MIND, IT WAS SO FUNNY WHEN I WROTE IT, BUT WHEN WE PUT IT UP, YEAH, IT WAS GOING SO BADLY, AND I STILL HAD, LIKE, FOUR MORE MINUTES LEFT OF IT. YOU COULD HEAR CRITICS. AND I SOMEHOW PROJECTED INTO THE AUDIENCE AND WATCHED MYSELF ON STAGE AND THOUGHT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING AND HOW BAD IT WAS AND ALL THAT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD THAT I WET MY PANTS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND DID YOU SHARE THAT WITH THE AUDIENCE?
I SHARED WIT THE STAGE MANAGER WHO WAS BRINGING OUT A COUCH AND I WAS, LIKE, PUT IT OVER THERE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S A BETTER STORY THAN I HAVE.
DO YOU HAVE A STORY?
Stephen: NO, I LEARNED TO ENJOY THE FEELING OF FAILURE.
YOU DID?
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. I HAD A FIRST DIRECTOR WHO SAID YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO LOVE THE BOMB. BECAUSE WHEN YOU IMPROVISE, LIKE, 25% OF THE TIME, IT WORKS, AND THE REST OF THE TIME IS WAITING FOR IT TO WORK. AUDIENCES ARE PATIENT WITH THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'RE MAKING IT UP, BUT THE AGONY OF WHEN YOU KNOW THE 25% IS NEVER SHOWING UP, THAT YOU HAD TO LEARN TO LOVE HOW TERRIBLE THAT FELT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: THEN I GOT ADDICTED TO SUCKING.
SO YOU LIKE SHAME IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I LOVE SHAME. I LOVE AN AWKWARD FEELING.
YES, I LOVE SHAME AND AWKWARDNESS.
Stephen: I LOVE SINGING TOO LOUD IN ELEVATORS WITH STRANGERS.
YOU DO?
Stephen: YEAH. I GET IN THERE, I SING GORDON  LIGHTFOOT. JIMMY BUFFETT.
PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY GETTING EXCITED, COLBERT IS SING LOUD IN MY ELEVATOR. THERE IS THINGS TO DO WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WHEN PEOPLE TALK REALLY LOUD ON THEIR PHONE, I WANT TO GET ON MY PHONE AND TALK RIGHT NEXT TO THEM -- OH, I KNOW! ISN'T IT TERRIBLE! I FEEL THE SAME! OH... ARE YOU ON THE PHONE, TOO?
Stephen: YOU CAN DO THIS, MY HAND TALKS TO ME, TOO!
BYE!
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER IS DIVORCED IN "CASUAL."
YES.
Stephen: SHE'S HAVING TO DATE IN HER LATE 30s OR 40.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THERE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU? ARE YOU STILL DATING? ARE YOU MARRIED?
I'M NOT STILL DATING BECAUSE I AM MARRIED.
Stephen: IT'S A MODERN WORLD, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.
YEAH.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND IT'S, LIKE, WELCOME BACK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY USED TO WORK AROUND HERE.
I USED TO WORK ACROSS THE STREET IN A SOUL-SUCKING WAITRESSING JOB.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY OTHER KIND? WHERE?
MARTINI'S. I CAN SAY IT BECAUSE THEY WERE HORRIBLE TO ME.
Stephen: THEY'RE GONE NOW RIGHT?
YEAH, THEY'RE GONE. HA HA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT CAN BE TOUGH. DID YOU EVER GET TO SAY, I'M OUT OF HERE?
NO, I NEVER GOT THAT MOMENT. I GOT TO WORK ONE TIME WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE DID. IT'S A BIG CORPORATE RESTAURANT AND EVERYBODY IS AN ACTRESS OR ACTOR. I DIDN'T KNOW HALF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE IT WAS SO BIG AND CORPORATE. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY DID.
Stephen: IT'S OKAY. WE DID SILVERWARE ROLEUPS, PEOPLE COME IN, THROW IT AROUND, THEY DON'T KNOW IT TOOK US 20 MINUTES TO DO THAT. SO WE'RE ROLLING THOSE UP, YEAH, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BACK DOOR OPENS AND THIS GIRL, WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE LILLY TAYLOR BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS, SO LILLY TAYLOR OPENS THE BACK DOOR AND THIS GIRL SCREAMS -- I MEAN, IT'S 9:00 A.M., WE'RE ALL MISERABLE, I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE TOOK IT OUT ON US, BUT SHE SCREAMS, HEY, EVERYBODY, I JUST GOT A JOB IN A MOVIE, SO I QUIT AND (BLEEP) YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU NEVER -- I NEVER.
Stephen: YOU NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO YELL THAT AT THAT RESTAURANT.
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW? LET'S GO DO IT RIGHT NOW. COME ON! LET'S LIVE THE DREAM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COME ON! COME ON! ALL RIGHT, COME ON! COME ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RIGHT OUT HERE. SO THIS IS A RESTAURANT RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.
YEAH.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. GET YOURSELF BACK IN THAT MIND FRAME. ALL RIGHT.
OH, MAN! THIS IS REALLY GREAT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
THERE IS A REAL BUCKET LIST MOMENT FOR ME.
Stephen: IMAGINE THAT THEY'RE STILL THERE.
OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, MARTINI'S! I'M ON STEPHEN COLBERT! SO (BLEEP) YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
