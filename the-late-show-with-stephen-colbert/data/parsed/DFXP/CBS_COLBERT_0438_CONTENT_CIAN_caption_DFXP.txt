PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN SOUTH KOREA RIGHT NOW AS PART OF A FIVE-NATION TRIP THROUGH ASIA. ♪ GOOD-BYE, DEAR FRIEND GOOD-BYE, I'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN ♪ GOOD-BYE, SWEET-- ♪
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT DONALD J. TRUMP TWEETS AN OOMSY. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES JASON SEGEL. JEFF FAGER AND LESLEY STAHL. AND MUSICAL GUEST MAVIS STAPLES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I KNOW I CAUGHT YOU THIS TIME. WHAT'S GOING OJON?
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU. JON BATISTE, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.  ( APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A BIG SHOUTOUT TO ALL OUR VIEWERS IN NAIROBI JOINING US TONIGHT. I HEAR WE'RE HUGE IN KENYA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: MEANWHILE, BACK HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S ELECTION DAY. JUST NOT THE ONE WE WISH IT WAS. DAMN YOU, CURSED MONKEY PAW! NOW, WE TAPE THIS SHOW EARLY, SO WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS YET. EITHER WAY, I'M PLANNING TO UPHOLDHE ELECTION DAY TRADITION I STARTED LAST YEAR: GETTING A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT MY CARPET THROUGH AN EMPTY LIQUOR BOTTLE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ONE YEAR TOMORROW. ONE YEAR TOMORROW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TOMORROW IS THE ANNIVERSARY.
Jon: WOW, LOOKING DOWN, HUH?
Stephen: THE ELECTION EVERYONE'S WATCHING IS THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. IT'S BETWEEN REPUBLICAN AND ANXIOUS GROUNDHOG, ED GILLESPIE, AND DEMOCRAT AND DOCTOR EXPLAINING WHERE HE'S GOING TO PUT HIS FINGER, RALPH NORTHAM. ONE PERSON WEIGHING IN ON THIS RACE IS SPARE TRUMP AND MAN WHO READS "MAXIM" ON HIS KINDLE, DONALD TRUMP JR. DON JR. WOKE UP THIS MORNING TO URGE PEOPLE TO GET THE VOTE OUT. BUT MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL HE'D HAD HIS MORNING CUP OF HAIR GEL, BECAUSE HE TWEETED, "LET'S TAKE @EDGILLESPIE ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TOMORROW! VIRGINIA: GET OUT AND VOTE FOR ED AND ENTIRE G.O.P. TICKET #VAGOV #VA." WHICH IS A FINE THING TO TWEET, EXCEPT THE ELECTION WAS TODAY, NOT TOMORROW. #WHOOPSY-DAISY! #TURNS-OUT-ERIC-IS-THE-SMART-ONE NOW-- FINGER, FINGER PHOTO. A LITTLE LATE! NOW, DON JR. LATER REPEATED HIS MISTAKE, TWEETING A SECOND TIME THAT VIRGINIA VOTERS SHOULD CAST A BALLOT FOR GILLESPIE A DAY LATE. BUT THEN, REALIZING HIS MISTAKE, HE WENT BACK AND SCREWED IT UP AGAIN, BECAUSE A FEW HOURS LATER, HE TWEETED, "VIRGINIA, THE FUTURE OF THE COMMONWEALTH IS AT STAKE-- GET OUT AND VOTE TOADY!" TOWEDY. VOTE TOWEDY. I DON'T KNOW WHO TODY IS. BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY VOTE FOR HIM. THIS IS REALLY DEVOLVING. I ASSUME HIS NEXT TWEET IS "PLEASE VOTE FOR TED GALOSHES FOR GOV OF VAGINA! ALSO, SOMEBODY HELP-- I GOT MY HEAD STUCK IN MY POCKET!"  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, HE MUST BE--
Jon: GILLESPIE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE TOND, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR THIS GUY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HE HAS TO BE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE BECAUSE FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS, HE IS THE ONLY DONALD TRUMP IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, 'CAUSE HIS DAD CONTINUED HIS ASIAN TOUR IN SOUTH KOREA TODAY. IT MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY TENSE, SINCE THERE WAS A MADMAN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, NORTH KOREA.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, WHILE HE WAS THERE--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHILE HE WAS-- STOPPED BY A MILITARY BASE. TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS HE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE OF A "BIG BEAUTIFUL LUNCH," BUT INSTEAD DECIDED HE WANTED TO EAT WITH THE TROOPS FOR "TACO TUESDAY." WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? GOOD FOR HIM. I CRITICIZE HIM A LOT, BUT THIS IS WHAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF SHOULD DO. IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT HE'S WILLING TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE, AS LONG AS IT INVOLVES EATING A TACO.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY NEWSPAPER "STARS & STRIPES," TRUMP HAD TACOS, A BURRITO, AND CURLY TRIES WHICH SHOWS, I THINK, JUST HOW FAR WE'VE COME. BECAUSE JUST TEN YEARS AGO, FRIES-- LIKE EVERYTHING IN THE MILITARY-- HAD TO BE STRAIGHT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN SOUTH KOREA IS NORTH KOREA. AND TRUMP WAS FAR MORE RESTRAINED THAN HE HAS BEEN OVER HERE. HE DIDN'T ONCE USE THE TERM "LITTLE ROCKET MAN," POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE MAN'S LITTLE ROCKETS CAN REACH HIM OVER THERE.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) "I'VE ALWAYS LIKED HIM. I'VE ALWAYS-- I LIKE HIM. I LIKE HIM." BUT AT THE JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH SOUTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT, TRUMP EXPLAINED THAT THE U.S. IS STRONG.
I THINK WE'RE SHOWING GREAT STRENGTH. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND WE HAVE UNPARALLELED STRENGTH. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN STRENGTH LIKE IT.
Stephen: "IT IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST STRENGTHS IN THE STRONG-O-VERSE. AND, NOW, JUST TOTALLY UNRELATE:  DOES ANYBODY HAVE A THESAURUS I COULD USE? JUST..."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE CONTINUED:
YOU KNOW, WE SENT THREE OF THE LARGEST AIRCRAFT CARRIERS IN THE WORLD, AND THEY'RE RIGHT NOW POSITIONED. WE HAVE A NUCLEAR SUBMARINE, ALSO POSITIONED. WE HAVE MANY THINGS HAPPENING THAT WE HOPE, WE HOPE-- IN FACT, I'LL GO A STEP FURTHER-- WE HOPE TO GOD WE NEVER HAVE TO USE.
Stephen: YES, "HOPE TO GOD," BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW GOD'S IN THE NUCLEAR CHAIN OF COMMAND.  (  LAUGHTER  ) HE'S GOT THE OTHER KEY. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THE "NUCLEAR TRIAD," BECAUSE IT'S THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY (BLEEP). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DON'T DO IT. OF COURSE, IT'S TOUGH FOR TRUMP TO BE OVERSEAS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE FOREIGNERS ARE.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP IS NOT A HUGE FAN. DOESN'T REALLY LIKE THEM THAT MUCH. TRUMP HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT HE WANTS US TO "BUY AMERICAN, HIRE AMERICAN," SO IT'S SLIGHTLY SURPRISING THAT HE RECENTLY HIRED 70 FOREIGN WORKERS FOR HIS MAR-A-LAGO GOLF CLUB. SO ALL YOU DREAMERS ARE WELCOME TO STAY, AS LONG AS YOUR DREAM IS MOWING THE BACK NINE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) MAR-A-LAGO HAS BEEN GRANTED WHAT'S KNOWN AS H2B VISAS, AND TO GET THEM, MAR-A-LAGO "HAD TO SHOW THAT NO ONE ELSE WANTED THE JOBS, INCLUDING CALLING OLD EMPLOYEES AND PUTTING ADS IN THE NEWSPAPER." THEY ALSO POSTED THE JOB ONLINE WITH "YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING FOR A monster.com."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD ORGANIZATION. GOOD ORGANIZATION. SO, OBVIOUSLY THE WAY THE LAW IS DRAWN UP, THEY HAD A STRONG INCENTIVE TO MAKE THE JOBS LOOK BACK TO AMERICAN WORKERS, AND THEY SUCCEEDED BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS ACTUAL LISTING IN THE "PALM BEACH POST" THAT READ: "THREE MONTHS RECENT AND VERIFIABLE EXPERIENCE IN FINE DINING COUNTRY CLUB, NO TIPS," AND "INSTRUCTED APPLICANTS TO APPLY BY FAX." YOU MIGHT AS WELL POST, "DEAD- END JOB, SLAVE WAGES, MUST APPLY VIA TELEGRAM, HIGH PROBABILITY OF MEETING DONALD TRUMP."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE,-- RUBBING ELBOWS! RUBBING ELBOWS!  ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, LAWN CARE IS A ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE WORLD OUT THERE, LAWN MAINTENANCE. JUST ASK KENTUCKY SENATOR AND MAN CAUGHT MID-MACARENA, RAND PAUL. NOW, SENATOR PAUL WAS ATTACKED LAST WEEK, SUSTAINING FIVE BROKEN RIBS AND A BRUISED LUNG. IT WAS A VICIOUS ATTACK, AND I WISH SENATOR PAUL A SPEEDY RECOVERY SO HE CAN GET BACK TO THE SENATE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR HEALTHCARE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) PAUL'S ASSAILANT WAS HIS NEXTDOOR NEIGHBOR, RETIRED ANESTHESIOLOGIST AND BOTOX AMERICAN, RENE BOUCHER. BOUCHER IS A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SPECULATING THAT BOUCHER ASSAULTED THE LIBERTARIAN SENATOR FOR POLITICAL REASONS. IT WAS LIKE A CHAPTER OUT OF AYN RAND'S BOOK, "ATLAS MUGGED."  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT WE'RE LEARNING MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE INCIDENT. APPARENTLY, "THE VIOLENT ALTERCATION BEGAN OVER A LANDSCAPING DISPUTE." OF COURSE, LANDSCAPE DISPUTES ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF VIOLENCE BETWEEN MIDDLE-AGED WHITE MEN.  (  LAUGHTER  ) RIGHT AFTER LOWES PARKING LOT SCUFFLE AND WRESTLING OVER THE LAST TOMBSTONE FOUR-MEAT PIZZA AT CVS. NOW, I CONDEMN ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE, BUT IT IS REFRESHING TO SEE THAT EVEN IN THIS POLITICALLY-CHARGED ENVIRONMENT, WE CAN GO BACK TO FEUDING OVER STUPID STUFF, BECAUSE I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER A TIME WHEN YOU DIDN'T HATE PEOPLE FOR THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS. NO, YOU HATED THEM BECAUSE THEIR SCREEN DOOR STILL MAKES THAT DAMN SOUND. OIL IT!  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE DIDN'T JUDGE A MAN BY THE BUMPER STICKERS ON HIS CAR. WE JUDGED HIM FOR LEAVING THAT CAR ON CINDERBLOCKS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. IT'S AN EYESORE, JIM! SO GO TO YOUR NEIGHBOR, LOOK HIM IN THE EYE AND SAY, "I WILL NEVER ATTACK YOU FOR YOUR PRINCIPLES, BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE DOWN THOSE DAMN WIND CHIMES, I WILL TORCH YOUR GARAGE." WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JASON SEGEL IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, YOU WILL NEVER GUESS WHERE BONO PUTS HIS MONEY. STICK AROUND.  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU--
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S NO SECRET, I LOVE GOSSIP, OKAY. GREASE ME. I GOT AN WHO'S PREGNANT, WHO'S DATING, WHO IS TAYLOR SWIFT FEUDING WITH NOW? IT'S JIMMY CARTER. SHOULDN'T HAVE THROWN SHADE AT HER NEW ALBUM, JIMMY. NOW YOU'RE OUT OF THE GIRL SQUAD. BUT SOME OF THE JUICIEST GOSSIP RIGHT COMES FROM A HUGE LEAK OF DOCUMENTS DETAILING SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHIEST PEOPLE, KNOWN AS THE "PARADISE PAPERS." ♪ TAKE ME DOWN TO THE PARADISE PAPERS ♪ WHERE YOU PAY NO TAX ON FINANCIAL CAPERS ♪ WOOO! ♪ WON'T YOU TAKE ME DOWN ♪ THAT'S IT. I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING IT. I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING IT.  ( LAUGHTER ) THE PAPERS FOCUS ON THE DEALINGS OF THE BERMUDAN LAW FIRM APPLEBY, WHICH HELPS CLIENTS REDUCE THEIR TAX BURDEN AND SET UP HUGE OFFSHORE TRUSTS THAT IN SOME CASES HOLD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT'S LIKE THEIR SLOGAN SAYS, "APPLEBY'S: CHEATIN' GOOD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) AND THE PAPERS, THESE PAPERS ARE JUST DELICIOUS. THEY'RE FULL OF PRIMO DISH ON BIG-TIME CELEBRITIES, LIKE BONO, WHO USED A COMPANY BASED IN LOW-TAX MALTA TO BUY PART OF A SHOPPING MALL IN LITHUANIA OH, YEAH, BECAUSE NOTHING'S MORE ROCK 'N' ROLL THAN HAVING A 3% INTEREST IN THE PROFITS OF AN EASTERN EUROPEAN JAMBA JUICE.  ( APPLAUSE ) ALTHOUGH, BONO'S INVESTMENT IN THAT MALL DOES EXPLAIN SOME OF ITS STORES, LIKE THE LINEN SHOP "WHERE THE SHEETS HAVE NO NAME,"  (  LAUGHTER  ) OR THE ICE CREAM PARLOR, "SUNDAES NUTTY SUNDAES."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THE "PARADISE PAPERS" ARE JUST THE LATEST GIANT LEAK OF SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS. LAST YEAR, WE HEARD ABOUT THE "PANAMA PAPERS," BUT THE MOTHER OF ALL LEAKS-- THE "UR-DUMP," IF YOU WILL-- WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE "PENTAGON PAPERS." IN 1971, A MAN NAMED DANIEL ELLSBERG, LEAKED A CLASSIFIED DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REPORT REVEALING THAT THE PREVIOUS THREE ADMINISTRATIONS HAD SECRETLY EXPANDED THE WAR IN VIETNAM, THEN KNOWINGLY LIED ABOUT IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH TODAY IS ASTONISHING. JUST IMAGINE HAVING A PRESIDENT THAT KNOWS HE'S LYING. THERE WAS A HUGE-- TO GET THESE PAPERS OUT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE THEY ARE. THERE WAS A HUGE COMPETITION BETWEEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND "THE WASHINGTON POST" OVER WHO WOULD GET THE TRUTH OUT, WHILE FACING ENORMOUS RESISTANCE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU? THE KEY PLAYERS AT "THE POST" WERE PUBLISHER KATHARINE GRAHAM, FIRST WOMAN TO PUBLISH A MAJOR NEWSPAPER, AND EDITOR IN CHIEF, BEN BRADLEY. AND NOW, THE STORY OF "THE PENTAGON PAPERS" HAS BEEN MADE INTO A NEW MOVIE CALLED "THE POST" STARRING MERYL STREEP AND TOM HANKS AND DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG! IT'S THE FIRST TIME THESE THREE HAVE ALL WORKED TOGETHER. I SMELL OSCAR BUZZ!  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, "THE POST" IS COMING DECEMBER 22 IN LIMITED RELEASE, AND THEN NATIONWIDE JANUARY 12. WHY DO I TELL YOU THIS? I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WORLD-EXCLUSIVE DEBUT OF THE TRAILER FOR "THE POST." NO ONE HAS SEEN THIS THING-- OTHER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT, ONE WOULD HOPE, OR ELSE IT COULD BE A MESS. I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU, THIS IS REAL. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THIS IS LIKE HAVING A MARVEL TRAILER, IF MERYL STREEP WAS PLAYING THOR AND HANKS WAS HULK. SO HERE IT IS, THE WORLD PREMIERE OF THE TRAILER FOR "THE POST."  ( APPLAUSE )
SO, CAN I ASK YOU A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION?
OH, DEAR, I DON'T LIKE HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS.
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THE REAL ONE, EITHER.
DO YOU HAVE THE PAPERS?
NOT YET.
THIS IS A DEVASTATING SECURITY BREACH THAT WAS LEAKED OUT OF THE PENTAGON. THE MOST HIGHLY CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS OF THE WAR.
"THE TIMES" HAS 7,000 PAGES DETAILING HOW THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN LYING ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR FOR 30 YEARS.
THE WAY THEY LIED, THOSE DAYS HAVE TO BE OVER.
KAY, PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING A WOMAN IN CHARGE OF THE PAPER. BET SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOLVE TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES.
THANK YOU, ARTHUR, FOR YOUR FRANKNESS.
LET'S DO OUR JOBS, FIND THOSE PAGES.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPOSING YEARS OF GOVERNMENT SECRETS.
IS THAT LEGAL?
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK WE DO HERE FOR A LIVING, KID.
BEN, I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.
MUST BE FRESHES CARGO.
IT'S JUST GOVERNMENT SECRETS.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WAS BARRED FROM PUBLISH ANYTHING MORE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS DEALING WITH THE VIETNAM WA WAR.
IF YOU PUBLISH, WE'LL BE AT THE SUPREME COURT NEXT WEEK.
MEANING?
WE COULD ALL GO TO PRISON.
TO MAKE THIS DECISION, TO RISK HER FORTUNE AND THE COMPANY THAT'S BEEN HER ENTIRE LIFE, WELL, I THINK THAT'S BRAVE.
IF THE GOVERNMENT WINS, "THE WASHINGTON POST" WILL CEASE TO EXIST.
IF WE DON'T HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE,.
WE CAN'T HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IF WE DON'T HAVE A NEWSPAPER.
IF THERE'S A WAY TO DESTROY YOU, BY GOD, HE'LL FIND IT!
I'M ASKING YOUR ADVICE, BOB, NOT YOUR PERMISSION.
SHE CAN'T DO THIS.
THE LEGACY OF THE COMPANY IS AT STAKE.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE DON'T PUBLISH? WE WILL LOSE. THE COUNTRY WILL LOSE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, MRS. GRAHAM.  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS AN ACTOR AND NOW NOVELIST YOU KNOW FROM "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL", "HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER" AND "THE MUPPETS." PLEASE WELCOME JASON SEGEL. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THIS IS LOVELY.
Stephen: ISN'T IT LOVELY?
HI, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: ISN'T IT NICE?
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THREE YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU BACK ON THE OLD "COLBERT REPORT" BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.
THAT'S RIGHT, FOR MY BOOK.
Stephen: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
YEAH, FANTASTIC. I MOVED TO AN ORANGE GROVE.
Stephen: I HEARD THIS.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU MOVED-- LIKE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE-- ARE YOU A HERMIT NOW?
NO, NO.
Stephen: YOU LIVE IN AN ORANGE GROVE.
THERE'S A WHOLE TOWN OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: IS THERE A HOME THERE OR DO YOU JUST FROLLIC AMONG THE TREES?
NO, I KIND OF WALK AROUND AND THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE ORANGES LIKE "HOW I MET YOUR MARMALADE." SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: THAT WOULD SO SELL.
I KNOW.
Stephen: THAT WOULD SO SELL. CBS WOULD WANT THEIR BEAK WET, BUT THAT WOULD SELL.
I DID A MOVIE CALLED "THE END OF THE TOUR."
Stephen: I SAW, THAT BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE, BEAUTIFUL CHARACTER, I'M SURE.
REALLY SCARY. I RENTED THIS ORANGE GROOVE TO READ INFINITE JEST, BECAUSE I'M NOT A --
Stephen: YOU RENTED AN ORANGE GROVE TO READ A BOOK?
YEAH, YEAH. BECAUSE I HAD THE "HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER" MONEY.
Stephen: THAT'S A REAL HOLLYWOOD THING TO HAVE DONE.
YEAH. AND I WAS REALLY-- I WAS JUST, LIKE, REALLY HAPPY THERE, AND I DECIDED I'M GOING TO STAY. SO I NEVER EYE NEVER WENT BACK.
Stephen: SO IT WAS RENT TO OWN.
YEAH, I ESSENTIALLY LEASED IT.
Stephen: DO YOU LIVE THERE ALONE?
NO, I HAVE A WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND, YEAH.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW. BUT I'M HAPPY FOR HER AND YOU.
YEAH, WE'RE BOTH REALLY HAPPY.
Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT PLACE TO START A CULT.
YES, YEAH. I'M RENT WRITING SCI-FI NOVELS AS WELL SO IT'S PERFECT. HEALTHTRONICS.
Stephen: THE THING IS YOU RENTED-- I JUST WANT TO GO BACKUE RENTED AN ORANGE GROVE TO READ A BOOK.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND--
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE-- HOW YOU DO THE BOOK READING. I--  (  LAUGHTER  ) I--
Stephen: I LEASED AN AVOCADO FARM TO DO MY TAXES THIS PAST YEAR.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU GOT GET AWAY FROM IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE LITTLE PEOPLE DO IT, BUT WE JUST HAVE TO GET AWAY. I JUST CAN'T BE DISTRACTED.
I USED TO THINK THE REASON YOU READ A BOOK WAS TO SAY YOU READ THE BOOK, BUT THIS TIME I HAD TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT.
Stephen: SO NOT A BIG READER.
I DO MORE WRITING THANE DO READING.
Stephen:  SO NOW YOU LIVE ON THE ORANGE FARM YOU RENTED TO READ A BOOK AND NOW YOU'RE WRITING BOOKS.
YEAH.
Stephen: THIS IS JUR FIFTH BOOK, ISN'T IT?
YEAH, THAT'S NUMBER FIVE.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED "OTHERWORLD."
( APPLAUSE ).
THANKS.
Stephen: AND BOOK WRITING IS HARD. IT'S REALLY HARD WORK.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW WHAT-- WHY DOES THIS SEEM-- IS THIS HARDER OR EASIER THAN BEING AN ACTOR, IN YOUR OPINION?
WELL, MY-- NO ONE WAS EVER KNOCKING DOWN MY DOOR TO PLAY CAPTAIN AMERICA, THAT'S WHAT MY CAREER WAS LIKE. I WROTE A LOT OF OF THE MOVIES I DID. I WROTE "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL" WHEN I WAS 24. AND I WROTE "THE MUPPETS" WITH A FRIEND OF MINE NICK  ( APPLAUSE ).
OH, THANKS, THANKS. PRETTY COOL. BUT, HONESTLY, WHEN I WAS WORKING ON "THE MUPETS--" I WANT TO SAY THIS CORRECTLY IN CASE KIDS ARE WATCHING-- BUT THE MUPETS ARE PUPPETS, YOU KNOW.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: MUPPETS.
WHEN KIDS WOULD COME TO MEET KERMIT, A PUPPETEER IS STANDING RIGHT THERE OPERATING KERMIT, BUT I NOTICED THE KID LOOKS DIRECTLY AT KERMIT. THEY DON'T SEE THE PUPPETEER STANDING NEXT TO THEM. AND I THOUGHT KIDS WANT TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION. THEY WANT TO BELIEVE. AND I WANTED TO START WRITING BOOKS FOR THEM, BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ A BOOK AS A KID YOU'RE DOING HALF THE WORK. I PROVIDE THE WORDS, AND THEIR IMAGINATION DOES THE REST OF THE STORY.
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST YOUNG ADULT NOVEL.
YEAH.
Stephen: Y.A. WHAT QUALIFIES Y.A.? WHAT'S THAT CATEGORY?
IT'S 16 AND UP. I GET REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE KIDS, BECAUSE I FELT INFERIOR TO THEM WHEN I WAS 16 AND CONTINUE TO.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: MY CHILDREN ARE ALL 16 UP AND, AND THEY'RE WAY SMARTER THAN I AM.
YEAH --
Stephen: I COULDN'T DO THEIR HOMEWORK.
I WAS AT A RESTAURANT THE OTHER DAY, AND THE VALET PARKER CAME AROUND. HE WAS, LIKE, A 16-YEAR-OLD KID STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR AND I WAS INSTANTLY LIKE, "OH, MAN, HE'S SO MUCH COOLER THAN ME."
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET HE THOUGHT SO, TOO. THAT'S NATURE OF 16-YEAR-OLDS. HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 37 NOW.
Stephen: OLD MAN.
LOOK LIKE THE VICE PRINCIPAL. I WANTED TO INGRAISHATE MYSELF TO THE KID MAKE HIM, I WAS COOL, TOO, AND I TRIED TO MAKE SMALL TALK, "YEAH, LOOKS LIKE SUMMER IS OVER, HEY, BRO."
Stephen: DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY "HEY, BRO."
HE SAID, ," YEAH, THE BRAKES ARE ON." I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT. AND I SAID, "OH, YEAH, BRAKES ARE ON! BRAKES ARE ON! THEY'RE ON!"
Stephen: THE IDEA BEING THAT SUMMER IS OVER AND, THEREFORE, THE BRAKES ARE ON, BECAUSE THE FUN BREAKS.
I GOT IN THE CAR TO DRIVE AWAY AND THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON.
Stephen: SO LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON. LITERALLY THE BRAKES WERE ON.
YEAR, I'VE BEEN-- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT INTERACTION FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS NOW.
Stephen: WOW.
BECAUSE I WENT FOR IT. "THE BRAKES ARE ON!" YOU SAID IT.
Stephen: MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. MAYBE WE CAN GET IT STARTED. WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO MEAN? LET'S TRY TO GET IT IT STARTED.
OKAY.
Stephen: WHAT DOES IT MEANS, THE BRAKES ARE ON! WE HAD A GOOD TIME BUT NOW MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN TO WORK.
I'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FOR A LONG TIME WHEN SOMEONE INSULTS SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL."  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: I KNOW YOU'RE MY GUEST.
YEAH.
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE.  ( LAUGHTER ).
OH,-- RETURN TO SENDER!
Stephen: I WANT TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. MY FRIEND PAUL AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS ONE STARTED. IT'S-- WE'RE TRYING TO GET TEENS TO USE THIS TERM, "OH, THAT'S MASSIVE." WHEN SOMETHING IS REALLY GOOD, "THAT'S MASSIVE."
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE AN EXPRESSION AS MUCH AS AN ADJECTIVE.
Stephen: "DO YOU LIKE MY SUIT?" "IT'S MASSIVE." IT'S PERFECT, IT'S PERFECT.
"BRAKES ARE ON."
Stephen: A THIRD PARTY RIGHT NOW SHOULD LOOK AT ME AND SAY, "OH, YOU'VE GOT MAIL."
OH, MY GOD, TOTALLY!
Stephen: RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.
YOU CAN ADD THAT GLAERT WE'LL DO IT POST. IT WILL ALL BE DIGITAL. YOU'VE BEEN A MOVIE STAR, A TV STAR. NOW YOU'RE A STAR IT'S PREVIOUS SERIES LIKE THIS, THERE ARE, LIKE, FIVE BOOKS IN IT. SOMEBODY WILL MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF THIS STUFF. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A BOOK STAR, TO BE OUT WITH KIDS-- AND ADULTS, I ASSUME, AT A READING? IS IT DIFFERENT?
IT'S FUNNY YOU SAID THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO THESE READINGS, HONESTLY, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COME BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BOOK, BUT THE PARENTS WANT TO MEET THE GUY FROM "FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL." AND THEY-- WELL, IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT CROWD. AND SOMETIMES THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF DOING, LIKE, WINE EVENTS BEFORE THESE KIDS BOOK EVENTS. AND I JUST DID ONE -- >--
Stephen: THEY GET YOU DRUNK?
NO, THEY GIVE THE PARENTS-- THEY GIVE THEM SOME ROSE WHILE THE KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK ME PARENTS. THE OTHER DAY, THE FIRST SIX ROSE WERE KIDS, AND THE REST WERE PARENTS. AND I CAME OUT, "I THINK I'LL START READING THE FIRST PAGES OF THIS BOOK." AND A WOMAN SAID, "OR YOU COULD JUST TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT'S AN OPTION.
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS SAD? I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER.
Stephen: OH, NO, OH, NO.
AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED.
Stephen: OKAY. SO, I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THE BOOK HERE BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT.
QUICKLY, SINCE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. BASICALLY, IF THE KIDS FROM FREAKFREAKS AND GEEKS GOT SUCKED INTO DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS.
Stephen: THAT'S A QUICK PITCH. DID YOU PLAY D& "D."
I PLAYED "MIST."
Stephen: I REMEMBER "MIST."
I I WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. >IWOULD WANDER AROUND. AND THE BOOK IS ABOUT WHAT IF A COMPANY LIKE AMAZON CREATED A VIRTUAL WORLD SO SEDUCTIVE NOBODY WANTED TO LEAVE. YEAH?
Stephen:  I'M IN. I'M IN. I CAN KEEP THIS?
YEAH, IT'S ALL YOURS. I'LL SIGN IT FOR YOU.
Stephen: JACEOB, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. "OTHERWORLD" IS ON SALE NOW. JASON SEGEL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JEFF FAGER AND LESLEY STAHL. FROM "60 MINUTES"! STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THIS SEASON "60 MINUTES" CELEBRATES ITS 50th ANNIVERSARY. MY NEXT GUESTS HELP MAKE IT THE MOST-WATCHED NEWS PROGRAM IN AMERICA. PLEASE WELCOME LESLEY STAHL AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEFF FAGER.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LESLEY, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
Stephen: JEFF, NICE TO SEE YOU. NOW, LESLEY, OBVIOUSLY, WE ALL KNOW YOU. YOU'RE ON TV. THAT MAKES YOU IMPORTANT. WHO'S THAT GUY OVER THERE? AND WHY DO WE CARE?
SO,OB, HE, OBVIOUSLY, HE'S TH BOSS, AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT JEFF IS THAT HE TOOK OVER FROM THE GIANT, THE CREATOR, DONAHUEI DON HEWITT WHO CREATED "60 MINUTES," AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, AS YOU MAY WELL KNOW, TO TAKE OVER FROM THE GOD. BUT JEFF DID IT, AND HE DID IT MAGNIFICENTLY. HE'S KEPT WHAT DON CREATED AT ITS HEART AND SOUL, BUT HE'S MADE US MORE NEWSY. HE'S MADE US ON THE NEWS MORE THAN WE USED TO BE. AND ONE OF DON'S GREAT STRENGTHS WAS THAT HE COULD LOOK AT A STORY AND KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER. AND WE ALL THOUGHT, WELL, JEFF'S NEVER GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS DON AT THAT. AND HE IS.
THANK YOU.
HAVE I SUCKED UP ENOUGH?
Stephen: YEAH, YOU SURE HAVE.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, SO, YOU'RE IN THE 50th SEASON OF "60 MINUTES."
YES.
Stephen: IT'S AS GOOD AS IT EVER WAS. I WATCHED IT THIS SUNDAY. HAD THREE PERFECT "60 MINUTES" STORYS. YOU HAD PUERTO RICO. YOU HAD THE SLOWLY TILTING MILLENNIUM TOWER IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND YOU HAD THE MUSICAL PRODIGY FROM ENGLAND. LIKE, WHAT'S THE FORMULA THAT GOES INTO CHOOSING THOSE THREE STORIES? WHY ARE THOSE "60 MINUTES" STORIES.
IT REALLY IS A PERFECT MIX, THIS SUNDAY NIGHT BROADCAST WE JUST HAD. YOU LOVE TO HAVE SOMETHING WHICH IS IN THE NEWS-- WHICH IS PUERTO RICO. IT'S DEVASTATED BY THIS TERRIBLE HURRICANE. AND TO HAVE THE PIECE ABOUT THE LEANING BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE WAS FASCINATING. AND THEN THIS BEAUTIFUL PRODIGY AS THE END PIECE, WHICH WAS INSPIRATIONAL AND JUST LOVELY TO WATCH. SO THAT MIX IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT.
Stephen: NOW, IS THERE A-- IS THERE A COMPETITIVE CULTURE AT "60 MINUTES"? I HEAR THAT IT'S-- WHAT'S THE WORD-- A TIGER PIT BETWEEN THE--  (  LAUGHTER  ) IS THERE A STORY THERE? IS THERE A STORY THERE?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT IS A TIGER PIT. AND STEVE KROFT AND I WENT AT IT BECAUSE WE BOTH WANT HARVEY WEINSTEIN. I'M JOKING.
Stephen:ENING YOU'RE KIDDING ON THE SQUARE BECAUSE--
I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GUYS WILL SNAKE EACH OTHER'S STORIES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER, AND THAT'S JUST HOW THAT IS.
WELL, I THINK THAT THAT REPUTATION COMES FROM MIKE WALLACE WHO WAS NEVER AFRAID TO SAY, "I'M PREPARED TO STEAL YOUR STORY FRU."
Stephen: BUT PREPARED AND THEN WOULD DO IT.
YES.
OH, MY GOD, HE DID IT WITH ME WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE WITH BARBRA STREISAND. HE READ UPSIDE DOWN ON MY NOTES THAT BARBRA STREISAND-- HE THOUGHT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. AND HE CALLED HER AND HE TOOK IT AWAY FROM ME.
Stephen: DID YOU GO AFTER HIM WITH A BROKEN BOTTLE? WHAT DID YOU DO?
YOU KNOW, I SUFFERED. I SUFFERED. I JUST WAS HURT. HE WAS VERY LOVELY TO ME. HE WAS A TOUGH MAN. HE'S WHAT YOU SAW ON TELEVISION. BUT HE CALLED ME IN ONE DAY, AND HE SAID, "LOOK, KID, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW TO ASK AN EMBARRASSING QUESTION WITHOUT BEING EMBARRASSED." AND THAT'S, OF COURSE, WHAT HE DID.
YEAH.
AND IT WAS HARD. YOU KNOW, YOU ASK THESE PERSONAL QUESTIONS, AND BELIEVE ME, YOU SUFFER INSIDE.
Stephen: IS THERE A QUESTION-- LIKE, IS THERE A QUESTION THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BRING YOURSELF TO ASK, LIKE, WITH A SUBJECT?
WELL, IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN YOU HAVE A SICK KID AND YOU'RE INTERVIEWING THE PARENTS. AND MAYBE THE PARENTS DID-- WERE NEGLIGENT IN SOME WAY. AND THAT IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S THE PERSONAL STORIES THAT-- NOT WITH POLITICIANS. THERE'S NOTHING I WOULDN'T ASK A POLITICIAN.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOTHING I WOULD BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT ASKING A POLITICIAN.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, THERE'S A NEW BOOK OUT TO GO WITH THE 50th YEAR OF "60 MINUTES." THE BOOK IS WARTS AND ALL. MOSTLY SUCCESSES, BUT SOME FAILURES.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU-- WHAT DID YOU DO, YOU KNOW, ON A PIECE OR PRODUCING SOMETHING IF IT DIDN'T GO WRITE, IF YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT, IF YOU WERE CAUGHT UP SHORT ON SOMETHING, HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH IT?
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM DON HON HEWITT THAT GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF CBS NEWS, IS OWN UP TO YOUR MISTAKES. NOBODY THINKS YOU'RE GOING TO BE PERFECT. THE AUDIENCE, VIEWERS KNOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOMETIMES. WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLY STRENUOUS AND RIGOROUS PROCESSES OF BRINGING THE STORIES TO AIR. SO BY THE TIME THEY GET TO AIR, OUR-- ALL OF OUR TOOLS FOR WATCHING AFTER FAIRNESS AND ACCURACY, IT'S GONE THROUGH THE GRIST MILL. IT REALLY HAS. THEY'RE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. BUT WHEN WE DO MAKE MISTAKES, YOU BETTER OWN UP TO THEM, EXPLAIN HOW IT HAPPENED, AND MOVE ON ONE STORY AT A TIME.
I HAD ONE.
Stephen: YOU HAD ONE MISTAKE?  ( APPLAUSE ).
I HAD A BIGGIE. IT'S TRUE. IT WAS A DEFECTOR.
Stephen: A DEFECTOR.
RIGHT BEFORE THE IRAQ WAR, AND HE CAME ON. I WAS WARNED NEVER LISTEN TO A DEFECTOR. THEY'RE GOING TO LIE TO YOU. BUT I WENT AHEAD AND DID IT. WE HAD HIM VETTED. AND HE WAS TELLING US ABOUT THESE TRUCKS THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD HIM BUY-- RENAULT TRUCKS-- AND THEY WERE ROAMING THE COUNTRYSIDE OF IRAQ MAKING BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. AND, OF COURSE, IT WASN'T TRUE. AND WE PUT THE STORY ON "60 MINUTES," AND IT WAS SO PAINFUL WHEN WE REALIZED IT. AND WE DID APPROXIMATION IT.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT? HOW LONG BEFORE YOU FOUND OUT IT WAS A LIE?
FOR A LONG TIME, MONTHS.
Stephen: HAD THE WAR ALREADY STARTED AT THAT POINT?
YEAH, WE FOUND-- THE WHOLE WAR FOUND OUT AFTER THE WAR START GLD DID YOU FEEL ANY CULPABILITY AT THAT POINT?
I DO, TERRIBLE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THESE FEEL ?TION I DON'T MEAN TO BE TOO PERSONAL. BUT YOU TAKE THE WORK VERY PERSONALLY AND YOU ARE PART OF A HISTORICAL MOMENT YOU WISH HADN'T HAPPENED, HOW DO YOU OBI HAVE AT THAT?
YOU GO ON AND DO YOUR NEXT STORY AS WELL AS YOU CAN AND THE NEXT ONE AND THE NEXT ONE AND YOU DON'T MAKE ANY MORE MISTAKES.
YEAH.
