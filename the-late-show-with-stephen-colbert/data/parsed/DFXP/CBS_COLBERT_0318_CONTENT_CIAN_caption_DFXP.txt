GOLF, GOLF, GOLF, GOLF. MORE, MORE, MORNING MORE. I LIKE GOLF, BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS, FOLKS. 'CAUSE I'M GONNA TO BE WORKING FOR YOU, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TIME TO GO PLAY GOLF.
THIS WEEKEND, PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITED THE TRUMP NATIONAL GOLF CLUB IN VIRGINIA. IT WAS HIS 13TH VISIT TO ONE OF HIS COURSES SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE IN JANUARY.
YEAH, I'VE CADDIED FOR MR. TRUMP. HE'S A PRETTY GOOD. BUT WHEN HE MISSES A PUTT, HE BLAMES IT ON OBAMA WIRETAPPING HIS CLUBS. HE TIPPED ME ONCE AND SIGNED HIS BOOK. THE AUTOGRAPH WAS FREE.
HE KEPT ASKING ME IF I WAS A MAGICAL GHOST.
IF HE HITS A BALL TOWARD A FEMALE GOLFER, HE'LL YELL, "FOUR" -- UNLESS HE FINDS HER UNATTRACTIVE -- THEN HE YELLS, "TWO."
I ONCE SAW HIM NAME A GOLF BALL SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR JUST BECAUSE IT WAS WHITE. THE THING ON TOP OF HIS HEAD IS A DIVOT FROM THE 12th HOLE.
HE NAMED HIS PUTTER VLADIMIR PUTTIN.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, HANK AZARIA, KATE WALSH AND A PERFORMANCE FROM CIRCUS 1903. JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET WITH TRUMP BECAUSE HE DIDN'T REPEAL OBAMACARE. SO, TODAY, HE KEPT HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO REPEAL THE ENVIRONMENT. SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESSENTIALLY "WIPE OUT OBAMA'S CLIMATE CHANGE RECORD." I THINK HE JUST SURRENDERED FLORIDA TO THE OCEAN, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY WHEN HE SIGNED  THE ORDER, HE INVITED AQUAMAN. YOU KNOW WHAT I NOTICED? NOT A SINGLE AQUAWOMAN IN THAT PICTURE. SO, WHY IS TRUMP DOING THIS? ACCORDING TO HEAD OF THE E.P.A. AND GUY WHO HATES THE E.P.A. SCOTT PRUITT: "IT'S GOING TO CREATE JOBS." YEAH, REPEALING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WILL CREATE ALL SORTS OF NEW JOBS: OIL REFINING, FRACKING, CLEAN WATER HISTORIAN. KEEPER OF THE LAST SIX BEES. AND, OF COURSE, COAL MINING. IN FACT, TODAY, THE PRESIDENT CELEBRATED THE NEW LACK OF REGULATIONS WITH COAL MINERS, AND HIS REASONING WAS AS CLEAR AS MUD.
MY ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING AN END TO THE WAR ON COAL. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CLEAN COAL. REALLY CLEAN COAL.
STEPHEN: I KNOW CLEAN COAL SOUNDS LIKE AN OXYMORON, BUT SO DOES "PRESIDENT TRUMP." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ WORKING IN THE COAL MINE ♪ ♪ WORKING IN THE COAL MINE ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO NICE TO HAVE TRUMP FANS HERE TONIGHT. CLEAN COAL IS REAL. BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, I HAD A GIRLFRIEND IN CANADA WHO WAS A CLEAN COAL MINER. SHE TOLD ME THEY MINE THE CLEAN COAL AND THEN THEY PUT IT ON THAT SILVER BULLET TRAIN AND SEND IT TO NARNIA WHERE THE KEEBLER ELVES USE IT TO POWER THE PUMP ON THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. AND WHEN YOU BURN CLEAN COAL, IT ACTUALLY MAKES THE AIR CLEANER. SO CLEAN YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT, JUST LIKE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THIS LIE. TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO "REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT FEDERAL OFFICIALS CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN MAKING DECISIONS." SO NOW WHEN A POWER PLANT DUMPS MERCURY IN THE HUDSON, IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE BAD, IT'S BECAUSE WE NEVER TOLD THEM TO BE GOOD. IT'S JUST LIKE WOODSY OWL SAID:
YOU ARE NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED TO GIVE A HOOT, SO GO POLLUTE." ( BLEEP ) THE PLANET!
Stephen: WOODSY'S A LITTLE ANGRY. JUST A QUICK WORD TO DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HIS PLAN TO MELT THE ARCTIC: ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR RUSSIA, TOO? BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND RUSSIA, SIR, AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE DOES, EITHER. PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED, THIS INTRIGUE, DID YOU CALL SOMEBODY, DID ANYBODY CALL YOU, DID THEY HACK FOR YOU, AND PARTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE WORLD'S MOST BORING SPIES. SO, I'M GOING TO LIVEN IT UP BY EXPLAINING IT WITH TOM CLANCY NOVELS. SEE, THE "COMMANDER IN CHIEF" IS REACHING THE "BREAKING POINT" BECAUSE TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION IS "UNDER FIRE" FOR A POSSIBLE "CALL TO TREASON," PUTTING US IN "CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER,"  "WITHOUT REMORSE," WHICH IS WHY I'M EXPERIENCING "THE SUM OF ALL FEARS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: THAT'S THE FIRST CIRCUMSTANCES ACT OF THE EVENING. THE LATEST DAMAGING REVELATION IS ABOUT TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW AND NATIONAL DIMPLE RESERVE, JARED KUSHNER. WE ALREADY KNEW HE MET WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEI KISLYAK, BUT YESTERDAY THE WHITE HOUSE ACKNOWLEDGED A PREVIOUSLY UNDISCLOSED MEETING BETWEEN KUSHNER AND THE CHIEF OF RUSSIA'S GOVERNMENT-OWNED VNESHECONOMBANK. IF YOU CAN PRONOUNCE IT CORRECTLY, THE F.B.I. WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU. BECAUSE AMERICANS CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS BANK BECAUSE -- WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THIS BANK BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. IN FACT, IF YOU OPEN UP A CHECKING ACCOUNT FOR $100 OR MORE, YOU GET A FREE TOASTER AND A DEAD JOURNALIST. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT. I'M NOT SAYING I'M RECOMMENDING IT. I'M JUST SAYING IT'S FREE. HARD TO SAY NO. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESSURE OF THESE RUSSIAN RUMORS ARE GETTING TO THE ADMINISTRATION. CASE IN POINT, TODAY, SEAN SPICER AT THE "SPICEY TIME "--
I'VE SAID IT FROM THE DAY THAT I GOT HERE UNTIL WHATEVER THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION. YOU'VE GOT RUSSIA. IF THE PRESIDENT PUTS RUSSIAN SALAD DRESSING ON HIS SALAD TONIGHT, SOMEHOW THAT'S A RUSSIAN CONNECTION.
STEPHEN: WAIT, THE PRESIDENT PUT RUSSIAN DRESSING ON HIS SALAD TONIGHT? THAT'S HUGE NEWS. TRUMP ATE A SALAD? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE? I SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. I THOUGHT THE ONLY GREEN THING HE ATE WAS $100 BILLS IN FRONT OF MARK CUBAN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND RUSSIA RUMORS MUST BE GETTING TO TRUMP, TOO, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT HE TWEETED -- "WHY ISN'T THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE LOOKING INTO THE BILL AND HILLARY DEAL THAT ALLOWED BIG URANIUM TO GO TO RUSSIA, RUSSIAN SPEECH..." ( DEEP INHALE ) "...MONEY TO BILL, THE HILLARY RUSSIAN 'RESET,' PRAISE OF RUSSIA BY HILLARY, OR PODESTA RUSSIAN COMPANY. TRUMP RUSSIA STORY IS A HOAX. #MAGA!" ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. WHY ISN'T SOMEBODY INVESTIGATING THAT? WHY ISN'T SOMEBODY INVESTIGATING ALL THAT? BECAUSE, REMEMBER, REMEMBER, TRUMP NOSE IF CONGRESS FINDS SOMETHING ON HILLARY, SHE MIGHT HAVE TO RESIGN FROM NOT BEING PRESIDENT? AND CHECK OUT THE TIMES ON THESE TWEETS. HE SENT THE FIRST ONE AT 9:26, LAST NIGHT, AND THEN HE COMPLETED THE SENTENCE NINE MINUTES LATER. THE SECOND TWEET WAS 23 WORDS. THAT MEANS HE TYPES TWO AND A HALF WORDS A MINUTE. HE'S GOT SLOW THUMBS OR A VERY TALENTED PENIS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: WHOA, WHOA. WHOA.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY THOSE LETTERS ARE VERY SMALL. YOU WANT SOMETHING TINY TO TYPE IT OUT WITH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? IT'S ALL IN FUN. BUT WHAT'S THE TRUTH? WAS THERE NEFARIOUS COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA, OR IS THIS ALL BEING BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION BY THE LIBERAL MEDIA, THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND THE F.B.I.? WHO KNOWS? MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT FROM THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, LED BY INTEL CHAIRMAN AND CAR SALESMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS YOU TO HELP HIM OUT HERE, DEVIN NUNES. BUT NUNES MIGHT NOT BE THE GUY TO INVESTIGATE RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BECAUSE NUNES ADVISED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND WAS ON TRUMP'S TRANSITION TEAM. THAT'S LIKE SAYING TO LUKE SKYWALKER, "WE'VE GOT A GREAT NEW ADVISER FOR THE REBEL ALLIANCE. HIS NAME IS DARTH VADER." DARTH. COME ON IN MERE A SEND. WHO'S YOUR DAD, BY THE WAY? WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. BUT I CAN'T TELL IF WE'RE GOING TO LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS GUY. HE DOESN'T SEEM ALL THAT FOCUSED ON RUSSIA BECAUSE HE'S SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO VALIDATE TRUMP ACCUSING OBAMA OF WIRETAPPING HIM. AND LAST WEEK, NUNES HELD A SURPRISE NEWS CONFERENCE.
I RECENTLY CONFIRMED THAT, ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY INCIDENTALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION ABOUT U.S. CITIZENS INVOLVED IN THE TRUMP TRANSITION.
STEPHEN: SO, INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DID COLLECT INFO ON THE TRUMP TEAM, BUT IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE LISTENING TO FOREIGN AGENTS THAT THE TRUMP TEAM WAS TALKING TO. BUT NUNES SAYS THIS INFORMATION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA. BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT BECAUSE HE WON'T SHOW IT TO ANYBODY OR REVEAL HIS SOURCE, NOT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN COMMITTEE. THE ONLY PERSON HE HAS BRIEFED ON THE SUBJECT IS DONALD TRUMP. BRILLIANT DETECTIVE WORK. GATHER ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU CAN ON THE PRIME SUSPECT AND THEN SHARE IT WITH HIM. IT'S ALL PART OF CBS' NEW SHOW: "C.S.I. WASHINGTON: NO INVESTIGATION." ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS CAT. HE'S A SLOW TALKER. HE TALKS REALLY SLOWLY, AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S FROM AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION BECAUSE HE'S ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE OR BECAUSE HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THEN YESTERDAY, THERE WAS NEW NUNES NEWS. TURNS OUT THE INFORMATION HE GAVE TO DONALD TRUMP HE GOT FROM MEETING WITH AN INTELLIGENCE SOURCE ON THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS. SO, HE WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO TELL TRUMP WHAT HE LEARNED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT NUNES INSISTS THAT THERE'S NOTHING SINISTER ABOUT ANY OF HIS TRIPS TO THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS.
AND LOOK, IF I... IF I REALLY WANTED TO, I COULD HAVE SNUCK ON TO THE GROUNDS LATE AT NIGHT, AND PROBABLY NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN ME.
Stephen: BOO! I'VE DEVIN NUNES, CONGRESSIONAL NINJA! ( LAUGHTER ) HOW DO YOU DO THAT? HOW DO YOU SNEAK ON TO THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS? IS THAT REALLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE TELLING PEOPLE YOU CAN DO? IS THAT A SECRET HE GAVE AWAY OR IS IT HARD TO SEE YOU SNEAK ON TO THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS WHEN THE SECRET SERVICE IS KNEELING ON YOUR NECK. NOW, NUNES HAS REFUSED TO SAY WHAT INTELLIGENCE HE SAW AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND WHO LEAKED IT TO HIM, WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEETING. BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT BECAUSE ALL THIS WEEK'S MEETINGS HAV BEEN CANCELLED. TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT, WE'RE GOING TO NEED "THE LATE SHOW'S FIGURE-IT-OUT-A-TRON." ( APPLAUSE ) BRING IT OUT, BOYS!
WHEN LIGHT HITS IT. IT REFLECTS OFFER AND GOES INTO YOUR EYES. HERE AT THE CENTER WE HAVE A PHOTO-REALISTIC PORTRAIT OF DEVIN NUNES. OKAY? NOW, CONGRESSMAN NUNES CAN'T REVEAL WHAT HE LEARNED BECAUSE HE'S GOT SPLIT LOYALTIES. ON THIS HAND, OKAY, HE IS ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE, ALL RIGHT? ON THE OTHER HAND, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM. HERE HE'S SPLITTING HIS FOCUS BETWEEN ACCUSING THE TRUMP TEAM ACCUSING OBAMA OF WIRE HAPPENING AND WHILE ALL THIS IS HAPPENING, HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, WHICH I WILL INDICATE WITH THIS W. AND HE'S WAY UP IN THERE. HE'S IN SO DEEP, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE HIS HEAD. HE'S THERE TALKING TO TRUMP AND TRUMP'S ASSOCIATES -- ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S TALKING TO TRUMP'S ASSOCIATES -- ASSOCIATES -- I'M WRITING OCIATES REALLY SMALL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WASTE CHALK HERE -- AND HE'S SO FAR UP HERE TALKING TO TRUMP'S ASSOCIATES THAT HE CAN'T TELL US. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M SAYING, HE'S REALLY IN TRUMP'S INNER CIRCLE, AND NO MATTER WHERE THIS INVESTIGATION LEADS, NO MATTER WHAT WE FIND OUT, ONE THING IS TRUE, NUNES IS NOT COMING OUT OF THIS SMELLING LIKE A ROSE. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. HANK AZARIA IS HERE. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR WHOSE VOICE STARS IN "THE SIMPSONS" AND WHOSE FACE STARS IN THE NEW I.F.C. SERIES "BROCKMIRE." PLEASE WELCOME HANK AZARIA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
HOW'S IT GOING?
Stephen: GOOD. YOU LOOK NICE, ALL DRESSED UP IN A VEST AND EVERYTHING.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WORE A VEST.
Stephen: I LOOK LIKE I'M ABOUT TO TAKE A LOAN OUT FROM YOU.
WE'LL REVIEW YOUR FILE AND I PROMISE WE'LL BE FAIR.
Stephen: ANY QUESTIONS? YOU'RE THE GUEST.
I'M NOT GOING TO TIP YOU OFF BEFORE HAND. WE'LL SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING THEN LET YOU KNOW IN SEVEN TO TEN BUSINESS DAYS HOW YOU'RE DOING.
Stephen: IS THAT YOUR WATER? IT'S STILL YOURS. YOU'RE A MASTER OF VOICE. EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM THE SIMPSONS PLAYING THE CHARACTERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ARE YOU YOUR OWN GREATEST SOURCE OF JOY AND AMUSEMENT?
ON SO MANY LEVELS, YES, STEPHEN, I AM.
Stephen: YOU CAN WILE AWAY THE HOURS. YOU MUST NEVER GET BORED, YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF TO LISTEN TO.
I CERTAINLY GOT MYSELF THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD MIMICKING WHATEVER CAME MY WAY.
Stephen: BEFORE THE INTERNET, THAT WAS YOUR HANDHELD DEVICE?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WE ALL HAD A HAND-HELD DEVICE AS A CHILD.
A THEME OF PLEASURING YOURSELF AND HAND-HELD DEVICES. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, YES, AS A CHILD, I WOULD MIMIC WHOEVER I HEARD. THE TAPE RECORDERS, YOU HAD TO PRESS TWO BUTTONS AT ONCE AND I WOULD RECORD MYSELF AND HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO BE BUM DOING CERTAIN VOICES. I DO PROFESSOR FRANK, YOU MENTIONED, WHICH IS BASED ON, YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER, THE ORIGINAL NUTTY PROFESSOR, JERRY LEWIS. HE TALKS ABOUT THIS, IF YOU RECALL, AND, OF COURSE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SAD SPEAKING THIS WAY. YOU CAN SAY, MY GOODNESS, I'M HAVING A HORRIBLE DAY, IN FACT A HORRIBLE LIFE, AND I'M SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED AND LIFE'S A SONG! SO, YOU KNOW -- ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CAN I MAKE THAT MY RING TONE, PLEASE?
SURE, FOR A VERY SMALL FEE. YOU CAN'T BE SAD WHEN YOU MADE THAT NOISE.
Stephen: SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE LAST YEAR YOU WON YOUR SIXTH EMMY. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I AM -- NOMINATIONS COME OUT IN JULY. I'M HOSTING THE EMMYS THIS YEAR.
I HEARD ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THE FIX CAN BE IN FOR YOU IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT. I CAN FLIP THE ENVELOPES AROUND. I SAW THE OSCARS THIS YEAR.
I GOT MY CHEAT NOTES THERE. THERE'S A 20.
Stephen: OKAY. I MEAN, THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME ( VOICE ) THAT JUST MAKES YOU GOOD.
Stephen: I KNOW THIS IS A JOKE, BUT I AM KEEPING IT.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BECAUSE NOW IT'S FUNNY TO ME. DO YOU LIKE GOING TO THE EMMYS?
OH, NO.
Stephen: IT'S A PARTY. OH, NO. IF THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE -- DO YOU LIKE IT? DOES ANYBODY LIKE IT?
Stephen: I LIKE TAKING MY KIDS TO IT. I TOOK MY 10-YEAR-OLD TO IT AND HE GOES, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME IT WAS FUN!
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS, UNTIL -- > I ENJOYED BRINGING MY MOTHER TO IT ONCE. I THINK ANYBODY WHO LOOKS FORWARD TO THE EMMYS HASN'T BEEN THERE YET BECAUSE IT'S VERY NERVE RACKING ON MANY LEVELS.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT THERE TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN UNLESS YOU WIN.
YEAH, BUT ONE-FIFTH OF THE AUDIENCE IS GOING TO WIN. I THINK SEINFELD SUMMED IT UP CORRECTLY. HE WENT UP THERE AND SAID, YOU KNOW, BY DEFINITION EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. WE THROW THIS NIGHT SO WE CAN ALL FEEL LIKE LOSERS, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE ROOM WILL GO HOME WITH ITS TAIL BETWEEN ITS LEGS.
Stephen: AND IT'S HARD NOT TO CARE ONCE YOU'RE THERE.
THAT'S THE THING. EVEN IF YOU TRULY DON'T CARE AND YOU REALLY FEEL IT'S ABHONOR TO BE NOMINATED, AFTER ALL, YOU WERE ONE OF FIVE PERFORMANCES SINGLED OUT. IN THE MOMENT THEY'RE READING THE NAMES OFF, YOU WILL GIVE ANYTHING TO WIN, MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE IS A CAMERA IN YOUR FACE RECORDING EVERY MICROEXPRESSION.
Stephen: WHEN HE MEANS IN YOUR FACE, HE MEANS THERE IS A GUY AS CLOSE AS THIS SHOOTING YOUR FACE.
THEY COME UP FAST ON PURPOSE AND MAKE LOUD NOISES TO SCARE YOU.
Stephen: REALLY? I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.
NO -- HEY, HEY, HEY! THEY'LL DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LAUGH LAV AND THEN, YOU KNOW, 80% LOSE, AND THEN EVEN IF YOU'RE FINE, EVERYBODY TREATS YOU LIKE THERE WAS A DEATH IN THE FAMILY. GEORGE CLOONEY WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS. THE NEXT DAY AT WORK, NO ONE CAN LOOK YOU IN THE EYE. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY -- I'M SORRY, MAN, REALLY, REALLY SORRY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I WAS NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY.
Stephen: EVERYBODY ASSUMES. YEAH, ASSUMES YOU'RE BUMMED.
Stephen: I HEARD YOU DIDN'T WIN AN EMMY. ARE THE DOCTORS SURE? DO YOU WANT US TO TAKE THE KIDS FOR A WHILE?
THEN YOU GET AGITATED. HE'S FREAKING OUT BECAUSE HE LOST.
Stephen: THE ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE EMMYS, ESPECIALLY SINCE I WORK IN NEW YORK AND NOT LOS ANGELES, IS I GET TO MEET PEOPLE THERE THAT I NEVER GET TO MEET. PEOPLE ASSUME I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SHOW BUSINESS BUT I DON'T. I LOVE MEETING THE PEOPLE. MEETING MONTY PYTHON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THRILLS ME.
THAT'S OFTEN GREAT. AT THE FLIPS ON YOU, TOO. MAYBE I SEE THE GLASS HALF EMPTY IN ALL THIS, BUT SOME OF IT'S, LIKE, NEVER MEET YOUR HEROS, OR ALSO YOU OFFEND PEOPLE BY ACCIDENT. I FORGET WHO I'VE WORKED WITH. THEY'RE, LIKE, HI. I'M, LIKE, HAVE WE MET? THEY'RE, LIKE, YEAH, WE SPENT TWO YEARS ON THE ROAD DURING THE ODD COUPLE. OH, OF COURSE! SORRY. AND THEN I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO MEET WILLIAM SHATNER, HE'S A TREMENDOUS HERO OF MINE.
Stephen: GOT TO LOVE SHATNER.
I WAS NOMINATED IN HIS CATEGORY, I'M STANDING NEXT TO HIM. YOU BE ME, I'LL BE SHATNER. LOVE YOUR WORK, START THE WHOLE THING.
Stephen: BEFORE THE CEREMONY, OKAY?
YEAH.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, BILL -- MR. SHATNER, I'M HANK AZARIA, AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR WORK AND I JUST ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET YOU AND YOU INSPIRED ME IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND WHAT AN HONOR JUST TO BE WITH YOU AND BE NOMINATED WITH YOU.
HELLO. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK ACTUALLY YOU WENT ON LESS LONG THAN I ACTUALLY DID. I WANT TO TAKE IT BACK, MR. SHATNER. DIDN'T MEAN IT.
Stephen: WE'LL TAKE A BREAK AND BE BACK WITH MORE HANK AZARIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW" ALREADY IN PROGRESS. WE'RE HERE WITH HANK AZARIA. HANK, YOU'VE GOT THE NEW SHOW "BROCKMIRE."
BROCKMIRE.
Stephen: WHO IS JIM BROCKMIRE?
JIM BROCKMIRE IS A BASEBALL ANNOUNCE WHO ARE TALKED LIKE THIS -- I NOTICED ESPECIAL IN THE '70s WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, STEPHEN COLBERT -- AND EVERYBODY HAS THEIR FULL NAME -- BACK TO YOU STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU'RE NOT STEPHEN, YOU'RE NOT MR. COLBERT YOU'RE STEPHEN COLBERT. I HOOKED ON TO THIS AS A MIMIC IN THE '70s. THEY ALWAYS SOUND LIKE THIS WHEN THEY GO HOME, HAVE DINNER, HAVE SEX WITH THEIR WIVES, ARGUE WITH THEIR GIRLFRIENDS, DO THEY CALL IT? DO THEY SAY STUFF LIKE, IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, WE GOT A GOOOD ONE GOING HERE!
Stephen: HEY! IT'S SUCH A PRETTY DAY, LET'S PLAY, TOO! BROCKMIRE TAKING NO CHANCES, JUST TRYING TO GET A RHYTHM EARLY IN THE MISSIONARY POSITION, OH! AND A SURPRISE FINGER IN THE (BLEEP)! AND BROCKMIRE IS IN THE LEAD! HOA! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH! OH! IT'S A KNUCKLEBALL!
I'M GOING TO STOP THERE. I COULD GO ON.
Stephen: COULD GO ON. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IN THIS CLIB, I THINK IT'S THE BEGINNING TO HAVE THE SERIES.
YES.
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER IS HAVING A ROUGH DAY.
YES, THIS IS WHERE THE SHOW STARTS. HE HAS A MELTDOWN ON THE AIR, AS YOU WILL SEE. HE HAS JUST WALKED IN ON HIS WIFE WITH ANOTHER MAN. USUALLY HAS THREE OR FOUR BEERS. TODAY HE HAD, LIKE, ABOUT A BOTTLE OF RYE, AND HE'S IN A BIT OF A BLACKOUT DRUNK.
Stephen: AND HE'S CALLING A GAME.
HE IS CALLING A REAL PROFESSIONAL GAME IN KANSAS CITY, HIS LAST ONE FOR AWHILE AS YOU WILL SEE WHY, AND, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER DYNAMIC OF THESE GUYS THAT I LOVE IS YOU WILL SEE IN ACTION HERE, YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU GIVE THE COUNT RIGHT AFTERWARDS, AS LONG AS YOU TELL THE BASEBALL COUNT, THOUGH YOU CAN'T QUITE GET AWAY WITH THIS.
PLEASE IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I OPENED MY FRONT DOOR TO FIND ABOUT HALF A DOZEN NAKED FOLKS SPRAWLED OUT IN MY LIVING ROOM ENGAGED IN WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A DESPERATE AND HUNGRY ACCOUNT OF LOVEMAKING AND RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF IT ALL WAS MY WI -- MY WIFE LUCY. SHE WAS WEARING A STRAP-ON AND HE WAS (BLEEP) OUR NEIGHBOR BOB GREEN WALLED AND FOLKS I DO I MEAN (BLEEP). COUNT THOSE, 3 AND 2!
DID YOU SAY STRAP-ON IN ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: A CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL. A PROFESSIONAL TO THE END.
I BET THERE IS NEVER BEEN THIS MUCH BASEBALL DIRTY TALK ON YOUR SHOW EVER.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO THROW OUT OR -- A COLLEAGUE OF MINE, A GUY NAMED DONNY FRANKS, WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO THROW OUT THE CEREMONIAL FIRST PITCH AT WRIGLEY FIELD THE DAY AFTER THEY CLINCHED THE PLAYOFFS AND I WOULD JUST BE SO HONORED IF JIM BROCKMIRE COULD JUST CALL THE PITCH. IF WE COULD PLAY THE FOOTAGE OF DONNY FRANKS THROWING THE BALL OUT AT WRIGLEY, I WOULD BE SO HONORED IF JIM COULD CALL THE PLAY.
YES, I SAW A LITTLE BIT OF THIS BACKSTAGE. JIM, THERE HE IS. DON GRAPHICS LOOKING LIKE A BEARD STEPHEN COLBERT WITH '80s HAIR AND WHEN HE PULLS HIS LOT DOG OUT OF HIS PURR VANES DEVICE, HE SHAKES SOMETHING OFF EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO CATCHER THERE, GOES INTO HIS WINDUP AND HERE COMES THE PITCH! AND IT'S WAY INSIDE, WAY OUTSIDE -- IT'S HORRIBLE, BUT HE'S CELEBRATING LIKE HIS HAIR BAND JUST WON A BAT OF THE BANDS CONTEST! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT AN HONOR! HANK, GOOD TO SEE YOU! "BROCKMIRE" PREMIERES APRIL 5 ON I.F.C. HANK AZARIA, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KATE WALSH. ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

HI, HI!
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU. I JUST FOUND OUT RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW, WHICH IS WHAT I RAN BACKSTAGE TO SAY HI TO YOU FOR, IS WE WERE IN THE CHICAGO IMPROV TEAM AT THE SAME TIME. I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR PATHS DIDN'T CROSS. IT'S A SAMUEL COMMUNITY.
IT IS. I WAS THERE FROM '91 TO '95.
Stephen: I LEFT IN $94. NO WAY WITH WE DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER.
I.O. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU WERE WITH DEL AND SHARNA?
YEAH.
Stephen: THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE BUT THEY'RE VERY GOOD.
THEY HAVE ALL THE CONSONANTS IN THEIR NAME.
Stephen: THEY HAVE THE FACE AND HANDS AND GREAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE THING YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY AT IS IMPROV. HOW DID YOU SURVIVE?
WAITRESSING AND TRENCHING AS WELL. I TRY TO MIX IT UP AND -- I CONSIDER DOG WALKING WAS JUST STARTING OUT BUT THEN I WAS, LIKE, TOO MUCH POOP.
Stephen: TOO MUCH POOP? TOO MUCH POOP. COULDN'T DO IT. THE TEMPING WAS REALLY WHERE I LANDED BEFORE I STARTED MAKING MONEY AS AN ACTOR.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT CHICAGO IS NO MATTER HOW POOR YOU ARE IN CHICAGO, BECAUSE IT'S ILLINOIS AND THE LAND OF LINCOLN, THEY HAVE -- EVERY PLACE HAS TO ACCEPT PENNIES AS PAYMENT.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH. I REMEMBER WALKING AROUND CHICAGO AND BEING THE IMPROV GUY AND BEING A DEPRESSED AND I THOUGHT, WHY AM I SO SAD? YOU PAID FOR THE BUS WITH PENNIES.
I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN. THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME. MUCH DIFFERENT.
Stephen: DON'T THROW THEM AWAY.
DON'T.
Stephen: YOU ARE A SELF-PROCESSED, I UNDERSTAND, CAT LADY.
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF CATS AND DOGS.
Stephen: THE CAT LADY WHO HAS DOGS, OKAY?
DOES THAT MAKE IT BETTER IN I THINK IT DOES.
Stephen: IT'S ALL GREAT. I LOVE CAT LADIES. ARE YOU A SHOULD WORRY ABOUT YOU CAT LADY OR --
I THINK THAT'S ALL SUBJECTIVE.
Stephen: YOU GO EVERYWHERE WITH YOUR CATS.
I DON'T. THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.
Stephen: YOU THRAVL WITH THEM?
HERE IN NEW YORK.
Stephen: DID THEY COME ON THE PLANE WITH YOU.
NO, BUT THEY CAME ON THE PLANE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU TRAVEL WITH -- I HAVE MY ANIMAL TEAM, BRING THE MENAGERIE. THE LAMA GOT STUCK AT O'HARE. ( LAUGHTER ) HUE DO YOU TRAVEL, UNDERNEATH?
PET CARRIERS GO UNDERNEATH THE SEAT IN THE FRONT AND THE DOG THEY GOT THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOG. IN FACT, THE PERSON WHO WROTE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, WE JUST CALLED A SHRINK. TO GET AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOG CERTIFICATE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THERAPIST OR A SHRINK, AS I SAY --
Stephen: THEY PREFER THAT. I THINK THEY LIKE THAT. THEY WENT TO ALL THAT SCHOOL. SHRINK IS FLATTERING. SO YOU HAVE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I HAVE ANXIETY ISSUES AND THAT SOUNDS GOOD, ANXIETY ISSUES, MADE A LIST OF THINGS. I AM SO -- I MEAN, IT'S, LIKE, BIPOLAR, BORDERLINE PERSONALITY. I SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO BE ON THE PLANE LET ALONE THE DOGS.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU WROTE ON YOUR PRESCRIPTION IN.
YEAH, NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR MY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT -- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANIMAL HANDLERS. ( LAUGHTER ) MY ASSISTANT AND BROTHER TOOK THE DOGS OUT FOR ME, OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE'RE ALL REALLY MESSED UP.
Stephen: YOU WENT INTO THE PSYCHIATRIST TO GET THE PRESCRIPTION SO YOU COULD TRAVEL BUT HE SAID WHO'S TAKING THE ANIMALS AS WELL?
WE'RE ALL MESSED UP. MY BROTHER, ASSISTANT AND I.
Stephen: AND THESE ARE ALL -- ARE YOU TROUBLED OR ARE THESE LIES?
I'M REALLY MESSED UP. I CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH THIS SEGMENT. THIS IS REALLY HARD. I WAS TOLD MY DOGS WOULD BE HERE.
Stephen: WE HAVE DOGS HERE. WE HAVE DOGS. WE KEEP THEM AROUND.
YOU DO?
Stephen: OH, YEAH. WE ALLOW DOGS IN THIS BUILDING.
THAT'S NICE.
Stephen: IT WAS A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME, MY FRIEND. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE GOT THE NEW SHOW ON NETFLIX IS "THIRTEEN REASONS WHY" BASED ON A SERIES OF BOOKS.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: AND IT'S ABOUT A TEEN GIRL WHO COMMITS SUICIDE AND LEAVES 13 TAPES AS TO HER REASONS WHY SHE DID THAT.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU PLAY -- I PLAY HER MOTH SNORE THAT'S INTENSE.
VERY INTENSE. IT'S A VERY HEAVY ROLE TO TAKE ON. IT'S AN AMAZING SHOW, AN INCREDIBLE PROJECT. BRIAN YORKIE WROTE AND ADAPTED IT BY THE NOVEL FROM JAY ASHER AND TOM McCARTHY DIRECTED IT DIRECTED THE FIRST TWO --
Stephen: IS THERE A HOPEFUL --
IT'S HOPEFUL. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SHOW. THE KIDS ARE SO AMAZING. IT DEALS WITH BIG ISSUES OTHER THAN SUICIDE. DEALS WITH BULLYING AND LGBTQ AND RACE AND GENDER ISSUES, IT'S PRETTY INTERNET BULLYING IN PARTICULAR. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON TWITTER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR ADMINISTRATION.
Stephen: THE BULLY IN CHIEF.
WE GOT THAT GOING. SO, YEAH, YOU CAN IMAGINE SORT OF EXACERBATED HOW IT'S MAGNIFIED IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE PART OF IT.
Stephen: AFTER DOING AN INTENSE EMOTIONALLY DRAINAGE THING, WHAT DO YOU DO NEXT? SOMETHING LIGHT TO LIFT YOU?
I FELT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS GO INTO A REALLY DARK THEATER IN THE DEAD OF NEW YORK IN WINTER AND IF I FORGET STEPHEN LEVINSON'S PLAY. IT'S ABOUT POLITICS, FAMILY, BEING JEWISH IN THE HOLOCAUST IN ISRAEL. IT'S SOME LIGHT FARE. IT'S REALLY FUNNY, IT REALLY IS.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE A DOG FOR HER? DO WE HAVE -- ( LAUGHTER )
NOW I SOUND LIKE A COMPLETE LUNATIC BETWEEN THE CHOICES I MADE AND THE DOG SITUATION.
Stephen: YOU SOUND LIKE AN ARTIST.
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL CALL IT.
Stephen: IT'S A FINE LINE. YEAH.
Stephen: I WITH WISH WE'D KNOWN EACH OTHER IN THE '90s WHEN I HAD TIME TO IMPROVISE. I BET YOU WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN TO HAVE A SET WITH.
WE WOULD HAVE HAD FUN. WE COULD HAVE MADE CRANK PHONE CALLS. ADAM McKAY AND I USED TO DO THAT.
Stephen: ON STAGE? NO, IN REAL LIFE. McKAY WOULD CALL AND PRETEND TO BE A MANAGER OF A PIZZA RESTAURANT TO GET PIZZAS ORDERED AND DELIVERED TO US OR A MOVIE THEATER MANAGER AND WOULD SAY, WE NEED TICKETS RIGHT AWAY TO THE MULTI-PLEX OR WHATEVER, AND WE WOULD GET IT. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. PROFESSIONAL LIARS.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT ACTORS ARE.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU. REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: "THIRTEEN REASONS WHY" AVAILABLE FRIDAY ON NETFLIX. AND "IF I FORGET THE LAURA PELS THEATRE. KATE WALSH, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY CIRCUS 1903.
