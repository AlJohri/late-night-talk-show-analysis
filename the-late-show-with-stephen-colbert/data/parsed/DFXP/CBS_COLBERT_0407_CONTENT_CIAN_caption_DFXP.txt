HOW COULD I POSSIBLY HAVE A NEWSPAPER FROM THE PAST IF I WASN'T THERE RIGHT NOW? AND TONIGHT, I'M TAKING A LOOK BACK AT SOME OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS FROM MY FIRST TWO YEARS HERE AT THE SHOAVMENT I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW MUCH HOPE I HAD IN MY EYES BEFORE ELECTION DAY. A LOT OF THE SHOW HAPPENS RIGHT HERE. BOY, IF THIS DESK COULD TALK, IT WOULD PROBABLY SAY, STEPHEN SITS HERE AND TALKS TO CELEBRITIES OVER ME. IT'S A DESK. IT'S KIND OF BORING. THAT'S WHY I DON'T INTERVIEW THE DESK. JIM? THIS IS THE FIRST THING. EVEN OPRAH CAN MAKE THIS SOUND EXCITING. ♪ YOU FLIGHT HAS BEEN CANCELED!♪ ( APPLAUSE )

Stephen: NO, I'M NOT CRITICIZING YOU SAID THAT. I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IMPULSE, BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE GUY NOW?
YOU KNOW, LISTEN, MAN... IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, I THINK WE'RE ALL GETTING AN EDUCATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER HEARD IN POPULAR DISCOURSE PEOPLE DISCUSSING ETHICS THIS MUCH AND I DIDN'T REALIZE EVEN HOW ETHICS WERE SUPPOSED TO WORK AT THAT LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT AND HE'S PUTTING ALL THAT STUFF ON THE FOREFRONT.

IN FACT, I DID MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF DONALD TRUMP ONLINE BEFORE WE EVEN WENT ON THE AIRPORT WE RUSHED TO GET THAT ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE EVERYBODY THOUGHT HIS CAMPAIGN WOULDN'T LAST TILL SEPTEMBER OF 2015. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE NOTHING HE SAYS IS TRUE. WELL, NOW EVERYBODY DOES A TRUMP IMPRESSION. THEY SAY IMITATION IS THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO IMITATE DONALD TRUMP CLEARLY CANNOT STAND THE GUY. WHAT'S YOUR HOOK?

TRUMP PITCHES FORWARD SO WHEN HE STANDS, HE STANDS LIKE THIS. HE HAS NO CENTER OF GRAVITY. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHY HE'S ALWAYS LEANING ON PEOPLE. SO HE LEANS LIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ACCENTUATE THE MOUTH, BRING THE MOUTH FORWARD, AND THEN BRING IN THE ARMS. THIS IS THE KEY. THE ARMS -- NOW DO THE WHOLE THING. WE'RE DOING SO WELL, SO UNBELIEVABLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NORTH KOREA, BEST NOT MAKE ANY MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE AND FURY LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY THREATENING BEYOND A NORMAL STATEMENT.
