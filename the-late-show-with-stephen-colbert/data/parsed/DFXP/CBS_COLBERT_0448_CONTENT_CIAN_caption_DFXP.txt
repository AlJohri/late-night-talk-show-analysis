IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT CHARLIE GOES. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES GAYLE KING DAVEED DIGGS AND MUSICAL GUEST GREGORY PORTER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU, JOE? WHAT'S GOING ON LEWIS? HEY, MADDIE! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. SIT DOWN EVERYBODY, YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ONE AND ALL, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HOW ARE YOU? IS EVERYBODY OKAY?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S HEARTENING TO HEAR BECAUSE THINGS AREN'T GOING THAT GREAT. EVERY DAY, THERE IS ANOTHER SHOCKING REVELATION OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. IF ALLEGATIONS OF HARASSMENT WERE WEATHER, THIS IS HURRICANE SEASON RIGHT NOW. AND SOME TOWERING FIGURES HAVE BEEN BLOWN OVER RECENTLY. IN FACT< YESTERDAY, IT WAS CHARLIE ROSE. EIGHT WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED CHARLIE ROSE OF SEXUALLY HARASSING THEM WITH NUDITY, GROPING, AND LEWD CALLS. HIS SHOW WAS DROPPED BY PBS, AND CBS FIRED HIM BECAUSE THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE DISTURBING AND STRANGE. ON THE MILDER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, ROSE FREQUENTLY GAVE UNSOLICITED SHOULDER RUBS TO SEVERAL YOUNG FEMALE ASSOCIATES, BEHAVIOR REFERRED TO AMONG EMPLOYEES AS "THE CRUSTY PAW."  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND YOU MAY MAKE THREE WISHES UPON THE ACCURSED PAW, ALL OF WHICH ARE TO NOT GET A BACK RUB FROM CHARLIE ROSE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) SO FAR, ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS STEM FROM HIS SHOW ON PBS. IT IS THE WORST SCANDAL IN PUBLIC BROADCASTING SINCE IT WAS REVEALED PBS IS SHORT FOR PUBES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
Jon: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, EITHER.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT ALL. IS THAT TRUE? THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT'S TRUE. I THOUGHT WE MADE UP THAT, BUT HE'S SAYING THAT'S TRUE, THANK YOU.
HE PROPOSED AFTER APPLYING FOR A JOB ON THE "CHARLIE ROSE" SHOW, ONE WOMAN WAS INVITED TO ROSE'S BEACH THEY WATCH A DVD OF ONE OF HIS SHOWSES. WHAT IS IT WITH THE ROBES? FIRST COSBY, THEN WEINSTEIN NOW, CHARLIE ROSE. WHO'S NEXT? YODA? "MMM, TENSE YOU SEEM. SHOULDERS I WILL RUB. REPORTED TO H.R. I AM."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THIS IS REALLY JUST-- IT'S A HARROWING AND TERRIBLE ABUSE OF POWER AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE WOMEN AND THEIR CAREERS IS HORRIFYING. ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY I'M NOT SURPRISED. I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER LISTENED TO THE LYRICS OF THE "CHARLIE ROSE" THEME SONG? ♪ HERE COMES CHARLIE OH, NO ♪  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND IT SEEMS-- THEY RARELY RAN WITH THE LYRICS, RARELY. IF ALL THE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS COMING OUT OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OR NEWS AGENCY HAVE GOT YOU DOWN, YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK AND DISTRACT YOURSELF WITH THE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON. THE LATEST REVELATIONS ARE ABOUT MICHIGAN REPRESENTATIVE AND GERIATRIC LANDO CALRISSIAN, JOHN CONYERS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT, IN 2015, CONYERS SETTLED WITH A FORMER STAFF MEMBER WHO ALLEGED SHE WAS FIRED BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT SUCCUMB TO HIS SEXUAL ADVANCES. QUICK TIP FELLAS: IF YOUR SEXUAL ADVANCES REQUIRE THAT A WOMAN SUCCUMB, DON'T DO IT!  (  LAUGHTER  ) THERE'S A REASON WHY THE MOVIE WASN'T "WHEN SALLY SUCCUMBED TO HARRY."  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, NORMALLY, THESE SETTLEMENTS ARE PAID OUT OF A SPECIAL FUND FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT, BUT IN THIS CASE, THE SETTLEMENT OF $27,000 CAME FROM CONYERS'S OWN OFFICE BUDGET. SO BAD NEWS IS NO OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY. GOOD NEWS IS NO OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. AND THIS IS ALL SHEDDING LIGHT ON JUST HOW BROKEN THE SYSTEM OF REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ON CAPITOL HILL. NO! GOTTA GO! HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN REALITY TO GO REPORT AN INCIDENT. FIRST, YOU'VE GOT ONLY 180 DAYS TO REPORT IT TO THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE. YOU THEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH 30 DAYS OF MANDATORY COUNSELING, FOLLOWED BY 15 DAYS TO DECIDE IF YOU'D LIKE TO BRING THOSE COMPLAINTS TO MEDIATION, WHICH THEN IS ANOTHER 30 DAYS. OH, MY GOD. YOU COULD BUY, LIKE, 40 GUNS IN THAT TIME! LOUVRE LAUGH I'M JUST KIDDING. I'M JUST KIDDING. YOU CAN BUY AS MANY GUNS AS YOU WANT. AND THAT IS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GUN LOVERS. SOME GUN LOVERS TONIGHT. AND THAT IS IF YOU CAN FIND THE OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY, ONLY ONE IN TEN STAFFERS WERE AWARE OF THE OFFICE'S EXISTENCE. AND EVEN IF YOU FOUND IT AND REACHED A SETTLEMENT, YOU MUST SIGN A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT THAT KEEPS YOU FROM TALKING TO ANYONE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE, EVEN WITH YOUR THERAPIST. BUT IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT YOU FROM DISCUSSING IT WITH YOUR ABUSER USING ONLY HAND SIGNALS.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS-- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS LOADED. I APOLOGIZE. BUT OF ALL THE RECENT SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS, THE CREME DE LA CREEP IS ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE AND FOUNDER OF "TAKE A DAUGHTER FROM SCHOOL DAY," ROY MOORE.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Jon: OH!
Stephen: THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN COY ABOUT ENDORSING ROY, BUT TODAY, THE PRESIDENT WEIGHED IN.
WE DON'T NEED A LIBERAL PERSON IN THERE, A DEMOCRAT. ROY MOORE DENIES IT. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. HE DENIES IT. HE TOTALLY DENIES IT. HE SAYS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIM, ALSO.
Stephen: "YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIM AND NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE AT THE MALL, THE Y.M.C.A., OR YOUR CONSCIENCE, BECAUSE THAT LITTLE SUCKER WILL NOT STOP SCREAMING UP HERE." AND THE PRESS PRESSED ON.
MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU BELIEVE ROY MOORE'S DENIAL? DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?
WELL, HE DENIES IT. I MEAN, ROY MOORE DENIES IT. AND, BY THE WAY, GIVES A TOTAL DENIAL.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: SIR, I DON'T THINK HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN TOTAL DENIAL.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING PRETTY DAMNING STUFF ABOUT ROY MOORE. FOR INSTANCE, ROY MOORE, AN ALABAMA REPORTER DUG UP THIS CLIP OF MOORE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HIS WIFE, KAYLA.
I WAS THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MANY YEARS BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED. I SAW HER AT A DANCE RECITAL, AND I WAS STANDING OH, AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM, AND I SAW HERIP FRONT, AND I REMEMBER HER CAME WAS KAYLA KAISER, K.P. BUT I REMEMBER THAT. I NEVER DID MEET HER THERE. I LEFT AND IT WAS, OH, GOSH, EIGHT YEARS LATER OR SOMETHING, I MET HER, AND WHEN SHOW TEELD ME HER NAME, I REMEMBERED K.K.
THAT'S A CUTE STORY. EIGHT YEARS LATER HE MET HER AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY WHEN SHE WAS 23. IF YOU DO THE MATH... 23 YEARS, MINUS EIGHT, EQUALS-- YEAH, HE'S A PEDOPHILE.
Jon: OH! SIMPLE MATHEMATICS.
Stephen: THAT'S MATH. THAT'S MATH.
Jon: OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THE MATH SAID.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT ME! THAT'S MATH. SO, SHE WAS ONLY 15 WHEN HE FIRST SAW HER AT THE DANCE RECITAL. WHY WAS HE HANGING AROUND TEENAGERS' DANCE RECITALS? WAS THE MALL CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS?  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND IT'S NOT JUST ROY MOORE TRUMP IS LETTING OFF THE HOOK. TODAY, THE PRESIDENT PARDONED SOME TURKEYS-- AND NOT JUST THE WHITE MEAT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Jon: OH!
Stephen: IT'S A FINE JOKE. TODAY WAS THE BIG DAY, AND THE TURKEYS THAT TRUMP PARDONED WERE NAMED DRUMSTICK AND WISH BONE. THAT'S OMINOUS. THOSE NAMES DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE PARDENING THEM. THAT'S LIKE NAMING YOUR FISH "FLUSHABLE." AND BEFORE THINGS GOT UNDERWAY, TRUMP HAD TO SNEAK IN A SHOT AT OBAMA.
UPON BEING PARDONED, DRUMSTICK AND HIS FRIEND WISHBONE WILL LIVE OUT THEIR DAY AT GOBBLER'S REST. THERE, THEY'LL JOIN TATER AND TOT, THE TWO TURKEYS PARDONED LAST YEAR BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN OVERTURNING A NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS BY MY PREDECESSOR. HOWEVER, I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE THAT TATER AND TOT'S PARDONS CANNOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, BE REVOKED.
Stephen: "BECAUSE IF THEY COULD, I WOULD EAT TATER AND MAKE TOT WATCH. YOU'RE NEXT, TOT." I'M EATING TATER BECAUSE HE TALKED TO MUELLER." ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN-- I THINK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT. AND THEN, JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PARDON THE TURKEYS, THINGS GOT WEIRD.
WOW. THAT'S A BIG BIRD. HOW HEAVY IS THAT BIRD?
36 POUNDS.
36 POUNDS. THAT'S A BIG BIRD. AM I ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT? WOW. I FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT MYSELF DOING THIS. ARE YOU READY, DRUMSTICK?
Stephen: GET OUT OF THERE, DRUMSTICK! DON'T LET HIS WATTLE FOOL YOU! HE'S NOT A TURKEY! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. GAYLE KING IS HERE. AND WE'LL TALK TO HER ABOUT THE CHARLIE ROSE NEWS SO STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST DELIVERS THE HARD NEWS AS CO-ANCHOR OF "CBS THIS MORNING" AND DELIVERS THE GOOD NEWS AS EDITOR AT LARGE OF "O, THE OPRAH MAGAZINE." PLEASE WELCOME GAYLE KING. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HI. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
OH, BECAUSE, STEPHEN, I CAME THIS CLOSE TO CANCELLING.
Stephen: I AM NOT SURPRISED. PEOPLE OUT THERE WOULDN'T KNOW THIS, BUT WE ACTUALLY ASKED YOU TO BE ON A LONG TIME AGO.
WE BOOKED THIS WEEKS AGO, GUYS, BECAUSE I WAS HERE TO TALK ABOUT OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS-- MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAY S.
Stephen:  WHEN WE ARE GOING TO DO. THIS TURNED OUT A DIFFERENT DAY FOR YOU, THE LAST 24 HOURS, AS WE SAID TO THE PEOPLE BEFORE, CHARLIE ROSE HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY EIGHT DIFFERENT WOMEN OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, AND TODAY, CBS FIRED HIM, PBS DROPPED HIS SHOW. I WAS VERY PROUD OF CBS NEWS AND WHAT YOU AND NORAH AND EVERYONE AT "CBS THIS MORNING" DID, COVERING THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CHARLIE ROSE AS NEWS.
I WAS VERY PROUD --
Stephen: OBJECTIVELY AND FULLY.
YEAH, YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.  ( APPLAUSE ) I WAS --
Stephen: BUT IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY.
NO, NO, STEPHEN, YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IT STILL ISN'T EASY. IT'S STILL VERY PAINFUL. IT'S STILL VERY HURTFUL. YOU KNOW, CHARLIE AND I, WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, BEEN FRIENDS. BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE ANGUISH OF THOSE WOMEN, DESPITE THE FRIENDSHIP, YOU STILL HAVE TO REPORT THE NEWS. SO WHEN I THINK OF THE JOB THAT WE DO AT CBS-- THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO CANCEL BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS. BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE JOB WE DO AT CBS, AND HOW HARD THE PEOPLE WORK, I WANT TO KNOW, WE ARE A TOP-NOTCH BROADCAST OPERATION. AND THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: WELL, AS I SAID--
I WAS WINCING AT YOUR MONOLOGUE, THOUGH, STEVE GLEN YOU WERE WINCING AT MY MONOLOGUE?
YES!
Stephen: WELL, YOU DID YOUR JOB THIS MORNING, I DID MY JOB TONIGHT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Stephen: WE HAVE DIFFERENT JOBS.
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, TOO. IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU WERE DOING THE MONOLOGUE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE I WAS LIKE AH-HA. AND THEN IT WAS CHARLIE AND I THOUGHT HE'S A FRIEND, IT'S DIFFICULT. AND THEN I THINK ABOUT WHATS WE THESE WOMEN WENT THROUGH. I DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO DO THIS.
NO.
Stephen: REPORT ABOUT A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE.
NOT IN THIS MANNER, NO, NEVER, NEVER. AND IT WAS VERY-- IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY PAINFUL FOR ME THIS MORNING. IT REALLY WAS. AND STILL IS. AND STILL IS.
Stephen: NO, I HAVE NO DOUBT. THE STATEMENTS THAT BOTH YOU AND NORAH MADE THIS MORNING, NORAH'S WAS VERY POWERFUL AS WELL, AND SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED THAT SHE SEEMED ANGRY.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: ARE YOU ANGRY?
I-- I'M A VARIETY OF EMOTIONS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME ANGER. THERE'S SOME SADNESS. THERE'S COMPASSION. THERE'S CONCERN. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HOLD A VARIETY OF EMOTIONS AROUND ONE PARTICULAR INCIDENT, ONE PARTICULAR PERSON. SO I CAN'T REALLY SAY I'M ONE THING. I TELL YOU WHAT I AM IS RAW. WE HAD A COMPANY MEETING THIS AFTERNOON. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY GATHERED IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. AND I THINK SOMEBODY EVEN USED THE WORD "I JUST FEEL RAW. I JUST FEEL NUMB." WE'RE ALL REELING ABOUT ABOUT. IT'S A STUNNING THING WHAT HAPPENED IN 24 HOURS. MONDAY YOUR WORLD IS ONE WAY, AND IN 24 HOURS, CHARLIE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED AND THEN HE HAS BEEN FIRED, CHARLIE ROSE WHO WAS AN ICON IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M STILL WRAPPING MY BRAIN ABOUT THAT. BUT, AGAIN, I GO BACK TO WHAT THESE WOMEN ARE GOING THROUGH. AND I APPLAUD THEM FOR SPEAKING UP. IF ANYTHING CHANGES IN THIS, WHAT I DO HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE WILL SPEAK UP AND THAT COMPANIES ARE SENDING A MESSAGE THAT, "WE HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR." AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, EVER SINCE HARVEY WEINSTEIN REVELATIONS CAME TO LIGHT, THERE SEEMS TO BE A SEA CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO TALK ABOUT THIS. DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A PERMANENT THING, OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO SORT OF-- IT'S GOING TO RUN ITS COURSE, WE'LL FORGET ABOUT AND THESE SORTS OF ACTIONS WILL GO BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GO BACK INTO THE SHADOWS, STEPHEN, BECAUSE WOMEN FEEL EMPOWERED TO SPEAK UP. WOMEN ARE NO LONGER AFRAID TO SPEAK UP. BUT THE BEST PART OF IT IS THEY ARE NOW BEING BELIEVED. THEY ARE NOW BEING BELIEVED. BEFORE-- THAT'S BIG. THAT'S BIG. THEY ARE NOW BEING BELIEVED. BUT IT HAS TO BE MORE THAN JUST A BUNCH OF WOMEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WE REALLY DO NEED MEN TO JOIN THIS CONVERSATION. NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE UNTIL MEN JOIN THE CONVERSATION, TOO, AND MORE WOMEN ARE IN PLACES OF POWER. THAT, ALSO, IS SOMETHING THEY THINK WILL CHANGE.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR MEN TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION, OTHER THAN TO LISTEN AND BELIEVE?
TO LISTEN AND SAY, "THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE TOLERATED. THIS IS NOT COOL. KNOCK IT OFF." YOU MEN WHO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I'M IRRITATED WHEN PEOPLE GO, "I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS." NO DEGREE IS OKAY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL BEEN PLACE WHERE'S WE GO, "WELL, HE TOUCHED ME, AND IT WASN'T THAT BAD. OR HE DID-- HE SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE BUT IT WASN'T THAT BAD." WE NOW HAVE TO REALIZE IT'S ALL BAD. ALL OF IT IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE. BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO JOKE AND LAUGH WITH FRIENDS WITHOUT THINKING I'M GOING TO BE CALLED INTO HUMAN RESOURCES. BUT WE ALL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE WHAT THAT IS. WE DO.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK, BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK TO TALK ABOUT OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS.
ARE WE REALLY GOING TO MAKE THE TURN!
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE TURN.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE GAYLE KING, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ WE'RE BACK WITH GAYLE KING HERE ON THIS THANKSGIVING EVE.
THANKSGIVING EVE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR THANKSGIVING? YOU SAID JON IS COMING OVER.
Stephen: JON IS COMING OVER WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, AND HIS PARENTS ARE COMING TO JOIN US.
I WOULD LIKE TO COME WITH 14 RELATIVES. DO YOU HAVE PLACEAT THE TABLE.
I WILL BRING THE NAPKINS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK YOU.
Stephen:  DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK?
NOPE. STEPHEN I MADE ONE THANKSGIVING DINNER IN MY LIFE. THIS WAS BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS 20-SOMETHING. I PUT IT IN THE OVEN AND FORGOT TO TURN ON THE OVEN WHICH SHOWS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT COOKING, BECAUSE YOU BE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BAIFT THE BIRD WHILE YOU'RE COOKING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT. I OPENED IT, AND HE'S STILL SITTING THERE LOOKING AS PING AS HE EVER DID. SO, NO, NO, I'M NOT GOOD. MRS. COLBERT LIKES ME.
Stephen: SHE DOES.
I COULD COME OVER WITH 14 PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU COULD ALSO COME OVER WITH SOME GIFT.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR.
IT'S TIME FOR--
"OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS."
Stephen: "OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS." IT'S LIKE THE WISH BOOK WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN. YOUR EDITOR AT LARGE. WHAT ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES?
IT'S OUR BIGGEST LIST EVER, 102 ITEMS. AND SOMEBODY SAID TO ME, "DO YOU HAVE TO BE A BILLIONAIRE TO BUY SOMETHING ON OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS?" NO, YOU DON'T.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T HURT.
IT DOESN'T HURT. IT'S NICE. IT RANGES FROM $10 TO $2,000 SO THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY ON THAT LIST, INCLUDING YOU, STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU, IS THIS OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS OR REALLY IS IT THE STAFF OF "O" MAGAZINE'S FAVORITE THINGS?
OH, TRICK PEP NO, IT'S HER FAVORITE THINGS. LISTEN --
Stephen: SHE HAS TIME FOR THESE FAVORITE THINGS?
NO, SHE DOESN'T. BUT SEE-- NO SHE DOESN'T.  ( LAUGHTER ) WE SPEND ALL YEAR CURATING IT IT. WE CURATE THE LIST. WE BRING IN A BUNCH OF THINGS FOR HER TO LOOK AT. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SHE HANDPICKS EVERYTHING BUT THE WORK IS DONE ALL YEAR LONG.
Stephen: THEE SAYS THUMBS UP.
THEE SAYS THUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN. AND WE WILL SAY, "EVERYBODY LIKES IT." AND SHE'LL SAY, "BUT I DON'T. IT'S CALLED "O" THE MAGAZINE. NOT A.," AND I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT, AND IT DOESN'T MAKE THE LIST. WE HAVE A TEAM, A VERY SMALL TEAM, BUT THEY TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY GO TO GIFT SHOWS. PEOPLE SEND THINGS IN TO THE MAGAZINE. SO IT'S A WHOLE PROCESS GLI WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LIST OF OPRAH-REJECTED THINGS?
WOULD YOU.
Stephen:  THAT OOB A GREAT ISSUE. IT'S LIKE THE ISLAND OF MISFIT TOYS.  ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT'S GOOD!
Stephen: DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT, BUT STILL GOOD.
STILL GOOD, BUT THEY DIDN'T LIVE UP TO HER STANDARDS.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT DID LIVE UP TO STANDARDSES THIS YEAR. LET'S START OFF WITH THIS. WE START OFF WITH-- WHAT'S THIS CALLED.
THE HERB GARDEN.
Stephen:  THE HONEY CAN-DO HERB PRESERVER. WHAT DOES THIS DO? AND IT'S REALLY FOR POT, RIGHT?  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHAT DOES THIS-- WHAT IS IT THIS DO?
I'VE NEVER SMOKED POT SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FOR THAT.
Stephen: ANOTHER YOU'RE NOT UNDER OATH RIGHT NOW.
IT'S TRUE, STEPHEN. I ALWAYS SAY, "ONE DAY I AM BEFORE I DIE," BUT I HAVEN'T.
Stephen: SO IT'S JUST EDIBLES FOR YOU  (  LAUGHTER  ).
BUT OPRAH ACTUALLY GARDENS, SHE ACTUALLY DOES. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A GARDEN, DON'T HAVE PROPERTY, YOU CAN PUT THIS IN IT. IT SAVES HERBS FOR TWO WEEKS. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MARIJUANA, IT'S FOR BASIL, MINT.
Stephen: SURE, ANY HERBS YOU MIGHT HAVE. KEEPS THEM NICE AND FRESH. DO YOU AND OPRAH CHANGE GIFTS EACH YEAR?
WE USED TO. THE KIDS AND I HAVE A FAVORITE SON, FAVORITE DAUGHTER. WE GO TO HAWAII FOR CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A FAVORITE SON AND FAVORITE DAUGHTER?
YES.
Stephen: HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE?
TWO.
Stephen: THAT MAKES SENSE. IF I THOUGHT YOU WERE WILLING TO BE A TERRIBLE MOTHER FOR A SECOND?
NOT ON NATIONAL TV.
Stephen: SO YOU GO TO HAWAII.
WE GO TO HAWAII. AND LAST YEAR SHE SAID I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BUY GIFTS. NONE OF US REALLY NEEDS ANYTHING-- WHICH IS TRUE-- BUT I THINK EVERYBODY LIKES TO OPEN SOMETHING ON CHRISTMAS, BUT SHE SAID, NO, NO GIFTS." SO NO GIFTS THIS YEAR.
Stephen: AGAIN, 102 OF THESE WE MOUNTAIN MAN FIELD'S MAPLE VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP. BEAUTIFULLY PACKAGED ORGANIC MAPLE SYRUP.
THAT MADE THE LIST BECAUSE SOMEBODY BROUGHT IT TO HER-- SHE LIKES SYRUP. BUT THE PACKAGI PACKAGING IS SO  I WISH YOU HAD THE PACKAGING.
Stephen:  IT'S PRETTY RIGHT THERE.
IT COMES IN A REALLY PRETTY WOODEN BOX.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE THE WOODEN BOX? WE THREW AWAY THE WOODEN BOX.  ( LAUGHTER ).
SHE'S VERY BIG ON-- SHE'S VERY BIG ON PRESENTATION. THEN WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU GET THIS BEAUTIFUL BOTTLE OF MAPLE SYRUP.
Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE A BOTTLE OF WINE, LIKE A HIGH-END BOURBON, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I DON'T DRINK. IS BOURBON THAT COLOR.
Stephen: YOU NEVER-- ME THINK SHE DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH?
NO, NO, NO.
Stephen: "IS BOURBON THE WET ONE? I WOULDN'T KNOW."  (  LAUGHTER  ).
I'M KIDDING. I DO KNOW THAT BOURBON IS THAT COLOR. BUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I GOT DRUNK AT THE YOUTH CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CAMP.
Stephen: OH, MY GOD.
I WAS YOUTH CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP, AND I GOT DRUNK ON BEER, REGULAR KEG BEER. IT MADE ME SO SICK, STEPHEN, I SAID, "I NEVER, EVER WANT TO FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN." AND I HAVEN'T DRUNK AGAIN.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I DON'T DO MUSHROOMS ANYMORE.
THERE GU.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT--
SO YOU CAN RELATE!
Stephen: THIS ONE IS INTERESTING TO ME. THIS ONE IS BEEHIVE FAT BOOK CROCKEN BAG.
NOW, WHY DID YOU PICK STUFF THAT IS KIND OF GOOFY.
Stephen: I DIDN'T PICK ANYTHING! WHAT DO YOU MEAN GOOFY? THEY ARE FAVORITE THINGS.
THEY ARE.
Stephen: IT'S NOT "OPRAH'S GOOFY THINGS." IT'S "OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS." YOU HAVE TO STAND BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, GAYLE.
I AM.
Stephen: DON'T BACK WHAT. THEY'RE ALL YOUR CHILDREN. IT'S $120 FOR A BAG OF STICKS.  ( LAUGHTER ).
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: WITH A BACKUP BAG OF STICKS.  ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU HAVE BUILT A FIRE LATELY?
Stephen: I HAVE! I HAVE.
YOU ARE NOT POINTING OUT THE BEAUTY OF THIS POTTERY VASE.
Stephen: IT IS A GORGEOUS BOT POTTERY VASE. I'VE BEEN TOLD YOU CAN ALSO STRIKE A MATCH ON THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAVE THAT TYPE OF MATCH THAT DOES THAT TYPE OF THING. AND THIS IS FAT WOOD FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW...
IT'S EASY TO START A FIRE.
Stephen: NOW YOU SAID STEDMAN THINKS YOU'RE A GENIUS AT BUILDING FIRES.
STEDMAN THINKS OPRAH IS A GENIUS AT BUILDING FIRES, NOT ME.
Stephen: NOT YOU?
NO. I HAVE ACTUALLY NEVER BUILT A FIRE-- YOU KNOW.
WHEN TALK TO YOU, I FEEL LIKE MY FIRE IS QUITE BORING. I NEVER BUILT A FIRE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T GET DRUNK, YOU DON'T SMOKE WEED.
BUT I'M A FUN GIRL! DON'T I LOOK FUN, AUDIENCE! I'M A FUN GIRL.
Stephen: VERY FUN.
CAN I SAY THIS? I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
Stephen: NEXT--
WAIT, WAIT, I BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
Stephen: I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS. THIS IS VERY PRETTY TO PUT AT THE FIREPLACE AND IT'S A FIRE HAZARD.
WE ALWAYS DO A BIG HOLIDAY PICTURE AT CHRISTMASTIME. CHECK-- CHECK OPRAH'S INSTAGRAM, YOU'LL SEE IT THIS YEAR. THIS IS A CARD WITH YOU AND ME.
Stephen: IT SAYS-- HOLD ON. THERE'S THE CARD.
ISN'T THAT CUTE? ME AND STEPHEN TOGETHER.
Stephen: MERRY CHRISTMAS.
I MADE THAT FOR YOU.
Stephen: WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?
I BOUGHT A BANDANNA FOR THE DOG.
Stephen: A BANDANNA FOR THE DOG, THAT'S NICE.
FOR THE COLBERT FAMILY, EVERYBODY GUESS ONE OF THESE!
Stephen: OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC! CHRISTMAS MORNING!
CHRISTMAS MORNING EYE THINK THOSE ARE CUTE AND FUN.
Stephen: NOW ARE, THESE--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ARE THESE AVAILABLE ON "OPRAH'S FAVORITE THINGS?"

Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S NICE TO BE BACK.
Stephen: IT'S THE THIRD TIME WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION. THE FIRST TIME WAS AFTER THE FIRST TIME I SAW "HAMILTON" ON STAGE.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, SO, YOU'RE ALWAYS READY TO PLAY JEFFERSON AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE THE JEFFERSON BEARD THAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.
I MEAN, I SWEAR, KIDS COME UP TO ME ON THE STREET AND CHALLENGE ME TO THE RAP BATTLE AND THEY ALWAYS WIN. I CAN'T DO THAT. I NEED SIX WEEKS OF REHEARSAL, GUYS.
Stephen: YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE. IT'S LIKE PLAYING TENNIS. YOU DON'T HAVE A BACKHAND ANYMORE?
YOU LOSE IT VERY QUICK.
Stephen: WE KNOW YOU FROM PLAYING JEFFERSON AND LAFAYETTE, OF COURSE, IN "HAMILTON." NOW YOU'RE IN YOUR FIRST MAJOR MOVIE. IT'S CALLED "WONDER." BUT YOU MUST HAVE ALREADY BEEN READY FOR THE KIND OF ATTENTION MOVIES GET BECAUSE YOU HAD ALREADY DONE SO MUCH PRESS AND EVERYTHING DOING "HAMILTON."
I DON'T KNOW, MAN, THIS HAS BEEN SO WEIRD, LIKE, GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF MY FIRST MOVIE PRESS JUNKET. AND IT WAS CRAZY. YOU'VE DONE THIS? I LANDED IN LONDON, AND WE DID 66 INTERVIEWS THAT DAY. 66. THAT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION. THAT'S A REAL NUMBER. THAT'S, LIKE, I SAID-- I SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR AND 66 PEOPLE CAME THROUGH AND ASKED ME THE SAME FIVE QUESTIONS.
Stephen: WELL WHAT, ARE THE QUESTIONS? >>, YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING WITH JULIA ROBERTS AND OWEN WILSON?" AND "WHAT-- HOW IS IT WORKING WITH KIDS?" ALL TOTALLY REASONABLE QUESTIONS TO ASK, BUT I COULD HAVE ANSWERED THEM ONCE. ITT WASN'T LIKE THERE WAS A TWO-SHOT. YOU UNDERSTAND. THERE WAS ONE QUESTION ON EACH OF US. I COULD HAVE ANSWERED ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ONCE AND GONE HOME. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
Stephen: SO WHAT IS IT LIKE WORKING WITH JULIA ROBERTS AND OWEN WILSON?
I DIDN'T WORK WITH THEM.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T?
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE SCENES TOGETHER SO I WAS ACTUALLY LEAVING SET AS JULIA WAS ARRIVING. I MET JULIA BACKSTAGE AT "HAMILTON," AND I MET OWEN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.
Stephen: ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS WAS THE LONGEST YOU WORKED WITH HIM?
AND WE WEREN'T IN THE ROOM TOGETHER. SO I GOT TO SEE HIM IN THE HALLWAY AND GETTING COFFEE.
Stephen: SO INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP?
WE'RE VERY CLOSE RIGHT NOW. HE'S COMING TO MY THANKSGIVING.
Stephen: YOU PLAY A TEACHER. WHAT'S THE TEACHER'S NAME?
MR. BROWNE.
Stephen: BUT YOU ACTUALLILYUE WERE A TEACHER?
I WAS, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU TEACH?
I WAS TEACHING POETRY AND RAP CLASSES IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN THE BAY AREA.
Stephen: WOW, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE GONE TO THAT MIDDLE SCHOOL.
YEAH, THERE WERE A FEW OF THEM. I DEVELOPED A CURRICULUM WHERE I WOULD COME INTO SCHOOL AND WORK WITH THEIR ENGLISH AND SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHERS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT RAP SONGS WE COULD BRING IN THAT PAIRED NICELY WITH THE THINGS THEY WERE LEARNING AND, ALSO, WORK ON SKILL-BUILDING STUFF WITH THEM.
Stephen: PAIR A RAP SONG ON, LIKE, SOME SORT OF MORE CLASSICAL PIECE OF POETRY?
SURE, IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THE ENGLISH CLASS OR WHATEVER BOOK THEY WERE READING, IS THERE A SONG THAT GOES ALONG WITH THIS? THE GREAT THING THAT IS THAT I WAS NOT THEIR REGULAR TEACHER AND COMING IN FOR, LIKE, TWO PERIODS A DAY, AND I'M, LIKE, 24 YEARS OLD. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SO THEY GOT TO BE THE EXPERTS ABOUT THINGS IN THE TIME THAT THERE I WAS THAT THEIR TEACH HERSELF NO IDEA ABOUT. ME AND THE KIDS COULD HAVE DEEP, SILL SOSKAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT JOEL JABOY.
Stephen: WITH EIGHTH GRADERS.
AND THE STUFF LIKE THE KIDS COULD REALLY DIG INTO.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU-- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS CLIP IN THE CLASSROOM?
I'M TEACHING A CLASS. THIS IS-- THIS IS--
Stephen: THERE IT IS. THAT MAKES SENSE.
THIS IS AUGUSTEE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU READ THE BOOK.
Stephen: AUGGIE IS A YOUNG MAN-- HE'S A BOY WHO HAS HAD A DISEASE. HE'S HAD FACIAL RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY, MULTIPLE TIMES.
YUP.
Stephen: AND THIS IS HIS FIRST DAY IN CLASS?
YEAH, YEAH THIS IS-- I THINK SO. YOU KNOW ABOUT AS MUCH AS I DO.
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. EVERYONE'S GOING TO COME UP WITH TWO THINGS THAT THEY THINK EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEM. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GO FIRST. NUMBER ONE, I USED TO WORK ON WALL STREET FOR A LONG TIME. AND, TWO, I LEFT WALL STREET TO PURSUE MY DREAM AND TEACH. BOOM, WHO'S NEXT? AHHHH...
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S BEAUTIFUL-- BUT IT IS-- IT IS-- YOU GET SOME SENSE FROM THAT SMALL SCENE RIGHT THERE, IT'S A TEAR JERKER.
IT IS.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE CRYING.
YEAH.
Stephen: HARD IN THIS MOVIE.
THEY ARE BUT --
Stephen: DID YOU CRY?
WHEN I SAW, THIS YES, I DID. I WAS IN A SCREENING ROOM BY MYSELF THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT. SO I CRIED A LOT BECAUSE THERE WERE ZERO REPERCUSSIONS.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN I SAW IT AGAIN AT THE PREMIERE, AND IT GOT ME AGAIN. SO IT DOES-- IT DOES THE THING, BUT I THINK IT IS EMOTIONAL IN GOOD WAYS.
Stephen: ARE YOU COMMONLY, LIKE, DO YOU CRY AT MOVIES ALL THE TIME? BECAUSE I'LL CRY AT AT&T COMMERCIALS.
I DON'T. NOT-- NOT LIKE THIS. I HAD-- I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE PARTICULAR REACTIONS TO MOVIES. LIKE, FAMOUSLY, ME AND MY DAD-- "FAMOUSLY" BECAUSE-- YEAH, THIS IS A FAMOUS STORY. NO --
Stephen: IN YOUR FAMILY.
IN MY FAMILY, ME AND MY FATHER I REMEMBER GOING TO SEE "JURASSIC PARK" FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND ME AND MY DAD LAUGHING SO HARD THROUGH THE WHOLE FILM-- LIKE, ON THE FLOOR DISTURBING EVERYBODY IN THE THEATER.
Stephen: LIKE, WHEN PEOPLE GET TORN APART BY VELOCIRAPTOR?
IT WAS SO FUNNY.  ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE, I HAVE THAT MEMORY OF A VERY VISCERAL REACTION IN A MOVIE THEATER. THE OTHER ONE, WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD, WE WENT AND SAW "GODZILLA."
Stephen: THE MATTHEW BRODERICK "GODZILLA."
NO, '86, RUBBER MONSTER GODZILLA. AND I WAS SO EXCITED TO GO SEE IT AS A KID. AND MY MOM TOLD ME, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED. IT'S A SCARY MOVIE." I SAID NO-- I HAD BEEN TO THE CIRCUS RECENTLY AND I GOT THIS SWORD. I'M LIKE, "I'M GOING TO BRING MY SWORD AND I CAN'T WAIT TO FIGHT GODZILLA IN THE THEATER." MY DAD BROUGHT ALL OF MY COUSINS THERE. THERE WERE, LIKE, 10 OF US. WE WERE IN A WHOLE ROW OF THE THEATER AND I DON'T EVEN MAKE IT THROUGH THE OPENING CREDITS-- AND I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE. ALL I REMEMBER IN THE OPENING THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING ON THE SHIP AND THERE IS WATER DRIPPING DOWN. IT FEELS VERY SCARY. AND SO I TOLD MY DAD I WANTED TO LEAVE. AND HE WAS LIKE, "WELL, IF NOTHING'S HAPPENING YET, WE COULD ACTUALLY STAY." AND SO I STOOD UP ON THE SEAT OF THE THEATER HOLDING MY SWORD AND SAID, "MY MOMENT SAID THAT IF I WANTED TO LEAVE, WE COULD LEAVE."  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND MY DAD SAID, "THAT IS WHAT SHE SAID, AND WE'RE LEAVING." SO WE GOT ALL THE COUSINS AND WE LEFT THE THEATER  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: AND THEY CRIED?
YEAH, THEN THEY CRIED, AND I HAVE YET TO SEE "GODZILLA."
Stephen: IT'S A CLASSIC MOVIE, YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT, THAT AND RODAN, ALL FANTASTIC MOVIES.
I HAVE A BETTER SWORD NOW.
