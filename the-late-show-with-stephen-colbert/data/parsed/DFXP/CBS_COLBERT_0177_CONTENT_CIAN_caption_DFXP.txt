Stephen: I'M TELLING YOU, THE MALLOW MAR IS A SEASONAL COOKIE.
HI, STEVE.
Stephen: WHAT'S UP? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONVENTION.
Stephen: I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
DO YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO?
Stephen: HELLO VERY IMPORTANT CELEBRITY. NOW'S A FINE TIME TO TALK.
C'MON, STEPHEN, YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR HAND.
Stephen: HOLD ON. AM I?
HELLO. WHO IS THIS? I'M TALKING TO STEPHEN. BLING-BLING. HOLD ON. GETTING ANOTHER CALL. OH, MR. PRESIDENT! WHAT'S UP? OF COURSE NOW'S A GOOD TIME. HOLD ON. GOT TO GO!

(CHEERING) WHICH, OF COURSE, THIS IS FRIDAY. OF COURSE, AMERICA IS STILL BUZZING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE, INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. THERE'S PENCE FEVER. ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS, YOU KNOW WHO MIKE PENCE IS. IT'S CURABLE. DON'T THINK ABOUT HIM FOR A WHILE. YOU WILL FORGET WHO MIKE PENCE IS. IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT GOVERNOR PENCE, FOR INSTANCE, THAT HE CURRENTLY HAS A 40% APPROVAL RATING IN HIS STATE. SO TRUMP COULD WIN INDIANA JUST BECAUSE VOTERS WANT PENCE OUT OF THERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT COMING OUT OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE LEARNED WHO WILL BE SPEAKING AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE SENATOR TED CRUZ GOT A SPEAKING SLOT. DURING THE CAMPAIGN, CRUZ CALLED TRUMP A "MORON," AND TRUMP GAVE HIM THE NICKNAME "LYIN' TED." NOW CRUZ SAYS HE FULLY SUPPORTS TRUMP... SO I GUESS HE WAS LYIN' TED AFTER ALL. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) LYIN' TED! MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON WAS CAMPAIGNING IN VIRGINIA YESTERDAY AND SHE SHOWED THAT SHE WAS DOWN WITH MILLENNIALS.
I DON'T KNOW WHO CREATED POKEMON GO, BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THEM MAKE POKEMON GO... TO THE POLLS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: "I MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT "ANGRY BIRDS," BUT ANGRY BERNIE JUST ENDORSED ME! (APPLAUSE) DONALD TRUMP WILL "CANDY CRUSH" OUR ECONOMY. I'M NOT JUST A GRANDMA, I'M AN INSTA-GRANDMA! HASHTAG SNAP CHAT." INTERNET.com. SPEAKING OF PANDERING TO MILLENNIALS, I'M A BIG FAN OF "DORA THE EXPLORER."
Jon: OH, DORA. MY NEPHEW LIKED DORA.
Stephen: BUT DORA HAS UNO PROBLEMO MAS GRANDE, BECAUSE THE 15-YEAR-OLD ACTRESS WHO VOICES DORA THE EXPLORER WAS JUST NAMED IN A  LAWSUIT ALLEGING THAT SHE "CALLED ANOTHER STUDENT A   ( BLEEP ) FOR REFUSING TO TRY AN E-CIGARETTE." (LAUGHTER) I'M PRETTY SURE CBS BLEEPED THAT WORD THAT BEGAN WITH A P, SO LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. YOU KNOW THAT CHARACTER, PUSS IN BOOTS? WELL, IMAGINE IF HE WAS A VAGINA. THAT'S THE AREA, OKAY? (LAUGHTER) THIS ACCUSATION SEEMS SHOCKING, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS OF DORA'S BULLYING FOR YEARS.
HEY, BOOTS! GET THE TALKING JOINT OUT OF BACKPACK AND SMOKE IT OR YOU'RE GAY!
COME ON, SMOKE ME, BOOTS! I'M FUN!
I DON'T WANT TO. MY MOM SAYS IT'S BAD. COME ON! STOP BEING SUCH A LITTLE BITCH!

PLEASE WELCOME CHARLIE ROSE, GAYLE KING, AND NORAH O'DONNELL. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE ALL THREE OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
HE SANG "LOVELY DAY" WHEN WE WERE COMING OUT.
Stephen: I KNOW, IT IS A LOVELY DAY.
THE BIGGEST THING I WANTED NOT TO DO WAS TRIP. I TRIPPED LAST NIGHT WHEN I WAS FRANKENSTEIN.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE THE BOOTS OR THE PROSTHETICS ON YOUR FACE.
INDEED.
Stephen: THAT WAS THE NICEST THING YOU DID WAS SURRENDER YOUR DIGNITY FOR ONE OF MY SHOWS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIGNITY.
PHYSICALLY, I NEVER LOOKED BETTER.
Stephen: YOU LOOKED FRESH. HE LIKES TO SURRENDER HIS DIGNITY.
Stephen: DOES HE? I'D LIKE TO HEAR STORIES OF CHARLIE SURRENDERING HIS DIGNITY.
OR NOT.
Stephen: BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE CONVENTIONS NEXT WEEK, JUST FOR THE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME AND IN HERE, WE'RE ACTUALLY RECORDING THIS ON THURSDAY EVENING FOR THE FRIDAY SHOW, AND RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW, WE FOUND OUT, AND THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE MAY NEVER KNOW HERE THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTACK IN NICE, FRANCE WHERE DOZENS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT SO FAR? WHAT CAN YOU GUISE TELL ME FROM CBS NEWS?
WE KNOW A LOT WERE INJURED AS WELL AS THOSE KILLED. WE KNOW THE VEHICLE CRASHED INTO A CROWD.
Stephen: IT'S A TRAGEDY. PEOPLE DIED IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. TOO MANY OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
Stephen: THEY'RE WATCHING THE FIREWORKS CELEBRATION BECAUSE IT'S BASTILLE DAY.
MOMENTS BEFORE WE WERE WALKING IN.
THIS IS TERRORISM RELATED. ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS WE HAVE TO DO AS A TEAM IN THE MORNING IS WE WAKE UP A LOT OF TIMES TO THESE EVENTS. WHETHER DOMESTICALLY OR INTERNATIONALLY IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, WE'VE HAD WAY TOO MANY OF THESE TRAGEDIES TO COVER.
Stephen: FOR NEXT WEEK, WE FOUND OUT A LIT MORAL ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, WHO THE SPEAKERS ARE AND AREN'T. ALL TRUMPS ADULT CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING NEXT WEEK, WHICH SHOULD BE FUN TO HAVE THEM THERE.
YES.
Stephen: YOU WILL BE THERE FOR THE FULL WEEK. HOW MANY OF THESE HAVE YOU DONE? HOW MANY OF THESE CONVENTIONS HAVE YOU GONE TO?
MY SIXTH. THE FIRST ONE I WENT TO WAS 1968.
Stephen: IN CHICAGO? YES.
Stephen: LET'S HOPE IT'S NOT AS EXCITING AS THAT.
YEAH. I WENT AS A DRIVER FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES." IT WAS THE MOST EXCITING THING.
YOU WERE A DRIVER? ES. WHO DID YOU DRIVE AROUND? REPORTERS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE CONVENTION AND THEIR HOTELS.
ARE YOU AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK?
Stephen: ARE THE CONVENTIONS FUN TO GO TO? IS IT, LIKE, NEWS CAMP? BECAUSE ALL THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE THERE IN ONE BUILDING. IT'S LIKE A FESTIVAL.
I THINK THEY'RE FUN, ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLICAN ONE. THIS IS WILL BE MY FIFTH. IT'S VERY UNPREDICTABLE WHAT CAN HAPPEN AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. YOU DIDN'T MENTION ANTONIO SEBATO, JR. IS GOING TO BE SPEAKING. REMEMBER HIM FROM "DANCING WITH THE STARS."
Stephen: IT'S GOING TO BE A SEXY CONVENTION. THIS MUST BE REFRESHING. WHAT FAKE CONVENTION AVERAGE I'VE DONE, THIS WILL BE MY FIFTH TIME MAKING JOKES ABOUT CONVENTIONS, ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD MAKE JOKES ABOUT, LIKE THE REAL NEWS PEOPLE, IT WAS ALL A STAGED PAGEANT FOR YEARS AND YOU HAD TO GRUDGINGLY GO, WHY ARE WE HERE, SHOULD WE BE COVERING THIS, BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT FEELS LIKE THERE COULD BE BIG NEWS ON A DAILY BASIS.
HISTORICALLY, THE BROADCAST NETWORKS HAVE REDUCED THE KIND OF ATTENTION WE'VE GIVEN THESE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY'RE SO HEAVILY SCRIPTED AND COMMERCIAL. THIS CONVENTION WITH TRUMP IS A SEAT OF THE PANTS. REMEMBER WHEN CLINT EASTWOOD CAME OUT WITH HIS CHAIR? I TALKED TO A REPUBLICAN SOURCE WHO SAID THIS IS CLINT EASTWOOD TIMES 20, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. A LOYAL REPUBLICAN. >. IT WILL BE GREAT FORIO. YOU WILL BE LIVE.
Stephen: WRITING JOKES UP TO THE LAST MINUTE.
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU WILL HAVE A LOT TO SAY. BEFORE I CAME IN TODAY, THEY WERE TELLING ME, TENNIS BALLS AND SLEEPING BAGS ARE BANNED OUTSIDE THE ARENA BUT GUNS ARE OKAY OUTSIDE THE ARENA. THAT JUST MAKES NO SENSE TO ME WHATSOEVER.
I UNDERSTAND PART OF THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE STATE. >STATE.  IT'S WHAT? AN OPEN CARRY STATE.
Stephen: IN OHIO YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CARRY A GUN OPENLY BUT NOT BRING TENNIS BALLS. WHAT ABOUT A TENNIS BALL GUN?
WELL, UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES -- (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT MIKE PENCE BEING THE NO, MA' NOMINEE? RIGHT REFLECTS OFF HIM, BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT GOVERNOR PENCE BESIDES THAT.
VICE PRESIDENTS DON'T WIN ELECTIONS.
Stephen: THEY CAN HURT, THOUGH.
OR HELP BY GIVING AN AURA TO THE CANDIDATE THAT HE'S SERIOUS, PRESIDENTIAL, THAT HE'S CHOSEN SOMEONE TO BALANCE HIS OWN EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: WHY DID HE PICK THEM?
AT THE BEGINNING HE SAID HE WANTED AN ATTACK DOG. THE NEXT DAY HE SAID, NO, HE DIDN'T, HE WANTED SOMEBODY TO COMPLEMENT HIM AND HELP HIM ON THE TICKET. THIS WILL BE INTERESTING.
THE TRUTH IS DONALD TRUMP IS DOING POORLY AMONG CHRISTIANS, PEOPLE WHO TURN OUT TO THE POLLS O MIKE PENCE IS EXTREMELY POPULAR. THIS IS A NOD TO THE RIGHT WING TO SHORE UP HIS BASE AND TO THE ESTABLISHMENT WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO DUES TRUSTED HIM AND NOT SHOWING UP AT THE CONVENTION. MIKE PENCE SERVED A DOZEN YEARS IN CONGRESS, ROSE THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP, COULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE FUTURE AND IS A SAFE CHOICE IN TERMS OF SHORING UP THE REPUBLICANS.
AND HAS ACCESS TO THE MONEY. THE KOCH BROTHERS LIKE HIM A LOT. KOCH MONEY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BIG.
Stephen: I SUPPOSE. SO BUT THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT TRUMP PICKING PENCE, THE SAFE CHOICE, IS THAT I THINK IF IT WAS REVERSED, IF PENCE HAD BEEN THE NOMINEE, I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM PICKING TRUMP. (LAUGHTER)
WHO WHO WOULD PICK TRUMP, STEPHEN COLBERT?
Stephen: I WOULD. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. BUT STICK AROUND. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE GAYLE KING, NORAH O'DONNELL AND OUR FRIEND CHARLIE ROSE. STICK AROUND. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
STEPHEN: WE'RE BACK WITH NORAH O'DONNELL, CHARLIE ROSE, AND GAYLE KING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU GUYS DO "THE MORNING SHOW," AND NEXT WEEK YOU'RE DOING "THE MORNING SHOW" AND LIVE CONVENTION COVERAGE AT NIGHT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT GOING TO BE LIKE? DO YOU NAP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?
OH, SURE. YES.
Stephen: YOU LEAPT ON THAT ONE, CHARLIE. I DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM THEM.
WELL, I HAVE BEEN DOING DOUBLE DUTY, SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE THE CHARLIE ROSE SHOW AT THE SAME TIME, AND I UNDERSTAND THE CHARLIE ROSE WEB SITE HAS BEEN TOTALLY REVAMPED AND YOU CAN WATCH MILLIONS OF HOURS OF CHARLIE ROSE NOW?
EXACTLY.
Stephen: TALK ABOUT NEEDING A NAP!
TALK ABOUT PUTTING YOU TO SLEEP!
Stephen: YEAH. (LAUGHTER) HOW MANY HOURS OF INTERVIEWS DO YOU HAVE UP THERE?
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IS UP THERE NOW BUT ABOUT 20,000. OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS, ABOUT 20,000. (APPLAUSE) 20000 GUESTS.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY, HOW DO YOU DO THE SHOW IN THE MORNING? BECAUSE YOU'RE UP AT THE CRACK OFFDAWN, AND THEN STAY ALERT AT NIGHT?
LIQUID COCAINE.
Stephen: I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M LIVE NEXT WEEK, CAN YOU HOOK ME UP?
THAT'S A JOKE, PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE, STEPHEN --
A DRINK, FOR GOD'S SAKE. DRINK CAFFEINE.
Stephen: WHAT? HE'S A PURE PERSON.
Stephen: ALWAYS THIS WAY OR DID YOU PURIFY YOURSELF LATER.
I GOT DRUNK IN HIGH SCHOOL ONCE AT THE CHRISTIAN YOUTH LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE OFF OF A KEG OF BEER.
Stephen: THEY HAD A KEG OF BEER AT THE CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE?
IT MADE ME SO SICK THAT I THOUGHT, I NEVER WANT TO FEEL THAT FEELING AGAIN. I REALLY WAS. IT MADE ME SO -- I WAS THROWING UP.
SOMEBODY DID SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO YOU THEN.
NO, IT WAS JUST REGULAR KEG BEER, BUT I THOUGHT, I JUST DON'T LIKE IT.
GOOD COLD BEER.
Stephen: THAT WAS MY NICKNAME IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLD BEER?
WAS IT REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH, COLD BEER -- COLBERT.
SEE WHAT YOU LEARN? THERE IS A BIG THING ABOUT POKEÉMON GO.
YEAH. WHO DO YOU THINK SIGNED UP FOR POKEÉMON GO TODAY?
Stephen: HE DID. WHY DID YOU GUESS THAT? (APPLAUSE) DID HE TELL YOU?
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE I THINK HE'S A CHILD AT HEART.
I AM.
Stephen: WHICH IS A NICE WAY OF SAYING INFANTILE. (LAUGHTER) IS THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION GOING TO BE LOCKED DOWN AND BY THE BOOK IS THIS IS THAT GOING TO BE A TIME TRAVEL BACK TO THE BORING DAYS OF FOUR YEARS AGO?
IT'S GOING TO BE HEAVILY SCRIPTED BECAUSE IT'S THE CLINTONS, THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE, THERE IS A HUGE AUDIENCE, BUT I ALSO THINK IT WILL BE AN HISTORIC CONVENTION. BOTH CONVENTIONS WILL CLARIFY THE FOCUS. IT'S THE COMING OUT PARTY FOR THE CANDIDATES. THIS IS THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO BE THE NOMINEE OF A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY IN AMERICA. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT IS HISTORIC. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT DOESN'T GET AS MUCH PLAY AS, SAY, BARACK OBAMA BEING THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN CANDIDATE? BECAUSE IT'S NOT CELEBRATED AS MUCH.
I THINK WHEN IT HAPPENS, IT WILL SORT OF -- WHEN EVERYONE'S WATCHING, I THINK IT WILL SINK IN JUST HOW HISTORIC THIS IS.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT CHELSEA CLINTON THE OTHER DAY. IMAGINE BOTH YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE BEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: THE POSSIBILITY IS THERE.
THE POSSIBILITY IS THERE IF SHE WINS.
Stephen: NO PRESSURE! (LAUGHTER)
YEAH. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF AWESOME WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.
I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE TALKED TO HER ABOUT THE DAY SHE MIGHT BECOME PRESIDENT.
Stephen: REALLY. YEAH, BECAUSE BILL CLINTON USED TO TALK ABOUT BEING PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS 13.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. I'VE SEEN THE PHOTOS OF HIM AND KENNEDY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE EASIER OR MORE ACCEPTABLE FOR MRS. CLINTON TO BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HERE OR HAVE A BETTER CHANCE NOW THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER FEMALE PRIME MINISTER OF ENGLAND, ANGELA MERKEL, IN MY LIFETIME IT'S MORE NORMIZED FOR WORLD LEADERS TO BE FEMALE. DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HELP HER?
A LOT OF WOMEN HAVE REPLACED MEN.
ENGLAND, BREXIT, THEY BRING IN A WOMAN TO FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET YOU CLEAN IT UP.
TRUE. NO DOUBT ANGELA MERKEL IS THE LEADER OF EUROPE.
TWO INTERESTING THINGS OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, IS ONE, WHO WILL BE HER VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK L IT BE A SAFE CHOICE LIKE SENATOR TIM KAINE OR SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE BOX WHICH SOME IN HER CAMPAIGN INDICATED.
Stephen: WHO IS THE OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR HER BECAUSE TIM KAINE FEELS LIKE A MIKE PENCE.
BOB GATES -- TIM KAINE ASKED WHAT'S YOUR BEST QUALITY, HE SAID I'M BORING AND BORING'S IN. IS THAT A GOOD THING?
Stephen: IS BORING IN? THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
Stephen: THAT'S A BORING THING TO SAY.
HAVEN'T YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT ON THIS SHOW?
Stephen: YEAH, I CAN BARELY STAY AWAKE FOR IT.
THE GOVERNOR OF COLORADO, HE'S VERY, VERY GOOD.
I LIKE HIM. WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT BOB GATES.
FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY, C.I.A. DIRECTOR. THERE IS AN IDEA SHE MAY PICK A WISE MAN, A FOREIGN POLICY ESTABLISHMENT TYPE, SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AN ELECTED POLITICIAN TO CEMENT THE IDEA OF TRUST AND GRAVIDAS, WHAT SHE HAS PROBLEMS WITH, TRUST AND HONESTY IN THE POLLS.
SHE HERSELF SAID SHE HAS THOSE PROBLEMS.
SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT. IT'S LESS LIKELY NOW ELIZABETH WARREN.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE FUN. AKIN TO WHAT HER HUSBAND DID WHEN HE CHOSE AL GORE, TWO VERY YOUNG SOWNERS.
Stephen: AND CALLED THEM HUCK AND JIM.
THEY DID. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHAT ROLE BILL CLINTON WILL PLAY. HE CAUSED HEADACHES FOR HILLARY CLINTON IN THE PAST AND IN THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS.
MIGRAINES. HE HAD ONE OF THE MOST STANDOUT SPEECHES IN THE LAST CONVENTION IN 2012. SOME SAY HE GAVE A BETTER SPEECH THAN BARACK OBAMA WHEN HE DELIVERED A POINT BY POINT INDICTMENT OF MITT ROMNEY'S ECONOMIC POLICIES.
I THINK BARACK OBAMA DID THAT.
WILL BILL CLINTON DO SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THIS ELECTION.
HE'LL MAKE THE CASE FOR THE FIRST LADY.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU PREDICTED FOR HER CANDIDATE?
I WOULD LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN BUT I THINK IT WILL BE TIM KAINE. I THINK THE ELECTION IS CRAZY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER ONE WANTS TO DO ANYTHING TO TAKE FOCUS AWAY FROM THEMSELVES.
HE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE ELIZABETH WARREN BECAUSE --
Stephen: SHE'S FUN TO TALK ABOUT.
OH. (LAUGHTER) I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: I THINK FUN IS GREAT. (LAUGHTER) CHARLIE, GAYLE, NORAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. CATCH "CBS THIS MORNING" EVERY MORNING, FROM  7:00 TO 9:00. CHARLIE ROSE, GAYLE KING, AND NORAH O'DONNELL, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A LEADER IN THE "BLACK LIVES  MATTER" MOVEMENT. PLEASE WELCOME DERAY MCKESSON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
GOOD TO BE BACK.
Stephen: LAST TIME WE TALKED WAS IN THE FALL.
YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE HERE. THERE WAS ALREADY A LOT OF ATTENTION BEING PAID TO "BLACK LIVES MATTER" AND ABOUT THE RACIAL TENSION IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR RACE RELATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: YOU YOURSELF WERE ACTUALLY ARRESTED IN BATON ROUGE DURING A PROTEST. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? DO YOU THINK ANYTHING POSITIVE CAN COME FROM SUCH A TERRIBLE SITUATION?
YES, WHEN I THINK ABOUT PROTEST, I THINK IT OF THE IDEA OF TELLING THE TRUTH IN PUBLIC. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING WITH OUR BODIES IS TELLING TRUTH THAT PHILANDO CASTILE, ALTON STERLING, SO MANY PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALIVE. I HOPE THESE ARE LEADING TO BETTER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOLUTIONS. WE THINK ABOUT THE PROTEST IN BATON ROUGE. I DIDN'T PLAN TO GET ARRESTED BUT SO MANY PEOPLE GOT ARRESTED THAT BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS WITH THE BATON ROUGE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T PLAN TO GET ARRESTED BUT IT LOOKS ART DIRECTED. IT WAS EVEN WELL LIT.
I HAD A MOMENT WHERE I WAS, LIKE, IF I RESIST ARREST, IT WILL BE A REAL PROBLEM. SO I JUST HAD TO FIND THIS MOMENT OF PEACE AND SAY, I'M OKAY WITH IT AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO. BUT AGAIN, I THINK ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT FORCING A CONVERSATION IN PUBLIC AND RACE AND RACISM THAT PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN AFRAID TO HAVE AND I'M HOPEFUL WE CAN CREATE SPACE TO TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS. I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT WITH THE MEETING WITH OBAMA WE HAD.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT HAD A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY LEADERS AND LEADERS FROM BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FROM CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YOURSELF.
YEP.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT PLEADING LIKE AND WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?
WE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF HOURS, AND TALKED ABOUT SOLUTIONS. SO PRESIDENT OBAMA PUSHED PEOPLE NOT TO JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE IN THE SLICE OF THE WORLD THEY REPRESENTED BUT TO REALLY THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS. SO WE TALKED ABOUT THINGS LIKE USING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MONEY AS A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE OR HOLD POLICE DEPARTMENTs ACCOUNTABLE DIFFERENTLY. WE TALKED ABOUT POLICING CONTRACTS AND THE FACT IN THIS COUNTRY THERE IS A SHADOW JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR POLICE AND POLICE HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR WORK. BUT WE GOT TO HEAR ABOUT POLICE ABOUT HOW THEIR WORK IS HARDER IN DIFFERENT WAYS. I'VE NOT BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY POLICE CHIEFS IN THE COUNTRY, AND WHILE WE DO NOT AGREE WITH SOLUTIONS, IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THEM. JUST BEING IN THE ROOM IN AND OF ITSELF DOESN'T CHANGE THINGS. LORETTA LYNCH WAS THERE.
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT IN HIS SPEECH AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE, HE SAID THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO WALK IN EACH OTHER'S SHOES, OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF "BLACK LIVES MATTER" FULLY BECAUSE I'M NOT A BLACK MAN AND I HAVEN'T BEEN PULLED OVER REPEATEDLY BY THE POLICE. BUT CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF WHAT POLICEMEN YOUR AGE MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH IF THEY COME TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVE IS POSSIBLY A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HAS IT OPENED YOUR EYES AT ALL TO WHAT THEIR FEARS AND WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS MIGHT BE THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY RACIST?
YES, SO WE CAN ACCEPT THAT POLICING IS HARD, WE CAN ACCEPT THAT PEOPLE WANT THE WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND GO HOME ALIVE, WE ACCEPT THOSE THINGS. BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION, RIGHT? I'VE NOT BEEN A DOCTOR BUT I HAVE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW THEY FUNCTION. I HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT POLICE DON'T KILL PEOPLE AS PART OF THEIR JOB. WE BELIEVE THAT. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHEN SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU THE VAST MAJORITY OF POLICE DON'T DO THAT, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?
THIS IS ABOUT A CULTURE THAT'S BROKEN AND WE KNOW THAT THE CULTURE OF POLICING HAS TO CHANGE SO THAT THE COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AGAIN. AND WE THINK OF THE DEATH OF PHILANDO AND ALTON, AND SO MANY OTHERS, AND THAT SPEAKS TO A CULTURE THAT'S BROKEN. YEAH, THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE NOT KILLED PEOPLE. THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN A SYSTEM WHERE THE CULTURE IS BROKEN AND WE NEED THEM TO STEP UP AND SAY THEY KNOW THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO CHANGE. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SPEECH WITH OBAMA, WE NOTED THE POLICE NEEDS CHANGE AND THAT WAS PRODUCTIVE.
Stephen: PEOPLE WERE STILL IN THE STREETS, YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S OVER TILL EVERYBODY'S GONE HOME. I'M SAYING THIS PERSON PARTICULARLY TARGETED POLICE, SPECIFICALLY WHITE POLICE IN DALLAS, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID TO THE NEGOTIATORS ON THE PHONE WITH HIM. THE "BLACK LIVES MATTER" MOVEMENT IS A DECENTRALIZED MOVEMENT. WHILE YOU ARE A LEADER OF THE MOVEMENT, THERE IS NOT A SINGULAR ORGANIZATION.
CORRECT.
Stephen: DO YOU BEAR ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING A CENTRAL ORGANIZATION THAT CAN HAVE A COHESIVE MESSAGE SO PEOPLE CANNOT MISINTERPRET WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS A CALL FOR VIOLENCE OR REPRISALS AGAINST THE POLICE? BECAUSE WHILE THIS PLAY BE A DERANGED INDIVIDUAL, THERE HAVE BEEN -- WE'VE HEARD RECORDINGS OF PEOPLE CHANTING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE IN MARCHES. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A LEADER OF THIS MOVEMENT TO KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING?
FIRST, THERE ARE INCREDIBLE LEADERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE STEPPING UP AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, FOR SOME PEOPLE HAVING THEIR VOICES HEARD AND LEARNING HOW TO ORGANIZATION IS POWERFUL, SO THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE IS A STRENGTH, NOT A WEAKNESS OF THE MOVEMENT. THE SECOND THING ABOUT DALLAS, IS MOVEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ROOTED IN A CALL TO END VIOLENCE. THAT WAS TRUE TEN DAYS AGO, FIVE DAYS AGO, TODAY AND TOMORROW. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DALLAS, IT IS A TRAGEDY, AND MY CONDOLENCES GO OUT TO THE VICTIMS OF ALL VIOLENCE, BUT THAT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT. SO I THINK THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE AGAIN IS A STRENGTH OF THE MOVEMENT AND THERE ARE SO MANY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE LEADING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO GO. ONE LAST THING, THE PRESIDENT SAID YOU ARE TOO HARD ON THE POLICE IN YOUR RHETORIC. DUNES WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT?
NO, I THINK HIS GENERAL PUSH IS WE SHOULD ALL TRY SEE EACH OTHER'S PE PERSPECTIVES. OUR FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF IS POLICE SHOULDN'T KILL PEOPLE. WE'LL SAY IT TILL IT CHANGES.
Stephen: HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. DERAY McKESSON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (BAND PLAYING) ♪ ♪ ♪ (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) ♪

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! I DO THIS FOR THE MONEY. (LAUGHTER) I THOUGHT I ENCOUNTERED REAL SEXISM TODAY. I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND A GUY I HAD NEVER MET BEFORE, A TOTAL STRANGER, CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, "SMILE." I WAS LIKE, ARE YOU REALLY TELLING ME HOW TO MAKE MY FACIAL EXPRESSIONS? THEN HE WALKED OVER TO A GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR AND SAID, "WALK." SO IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO A GENDER. HE HAD CONTROL ISSUES. I HATE WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME TO SMILE. YOU CAN'T BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME. YOU'LL RUIN YOUR LIVER. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BOTTLE DOWN. LIKE WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING. LET'S TALK ABOUT TEXTING AND DRIVING. I HATE WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY, "I ONLY DO IT ONCE IN A WHILE!" THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING THAT WILL GET YOU KILLED. TO BE GOOD AT SOMETHING YOU NEED TO PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL THE TIME. ON RAMPS, OFF RAMPS, WHEN YOU'RE MERGING. I KNOW IT'S HARD. IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY. LIVES ARE AT STAKE. I LOVE MY PHONE. I LOST MY DAUGHTER IN WALMART ONCE-- I DID NOT HAVE THE SAME ANXIETY. AS WHEN I LEFT MY PHONE IN THE BATHROOM AT TGI FRIDAYS. MY KID IS OKAY, TOO. BUT I WOULDN'T FREAK OUT IF SHE FELL IN THE TO TOILET. WE PARENT DIFFERENT TODAY. I SAY, STAY DOWN, IF SHE'S IN THE CAR. I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TO BREAK MY WINDOW. PEOPLE WALK UP AND SAY WE LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME. I ALWAYS FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT. I FEEL ALMOST OFFENDED-- I JUST THINK I'M SO MUCH HOTTER THAN SHE IS. I MEAN, SHE HAS HER OWN THING GOING ON, IF YOU'RE INTO THAT SORT OF THING. THE HARDEST PART OF PARENTING IS PUNISHING YOUR KID. IT'S SO HARD. THERE'S NO RULES IN OUR HOUSE. WELL, THERE'S NO TV. NO BOOKS EITHER. NO LEARNING OF ANY KIND. JUST MINECRAFT AND WE GOT HER A TINDER ACCOUNT. SHE LOVES TO SWIPE. MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME SHE KNOWS A CURSE WORD WORSE THAN THE F-WORD. I SAID, "WHAT?" SHE SAID, CONT. IT TOOK EVERYTHING IN ME NOT TO SAY, "YOU'RE SAYING IT WRONG." YOU DON'T KNOW SO MUCH. WE ALWAYS GET IN ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN SAY OR NOT SAY. ONCE SHE TOLD ME CRAP WAS A BAD WORD. I WAS LIKE, "NO. YOU CAN SAY CRAP." SHE SAID, "NO, IF YOU SAY IT AT SCHOOL YOU GET IN TROUBLE." I WAS LIKE, "THAT IS BULLCR- BULLSHI- STUPID. THAT IS SO STUPID." SHE SAID, "YOU CAN'T SAY STUPID. IF YOU SAY IT AT SCHOOL YOU'LL GET IN TROUBLE." I WAS LIKE, "YOUR TEACHER SOUNDS LIKE A REAL COT, YOU KNOW THAT?" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU. I HAD A TOUGH TIME IN SCHOOL BECAUSE I WAS BULLIED. I WAS BULLIED ALL THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL BECAUSE I MATURED SO QUICKLY. I HAD A FULL BEARD IN 8TH GRADE. I REALLY WAS BULLIED AND IT WAS HARD. I WOULD COME HOME EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL, UPSET, CRYING. AND THEN ONE DAY MY MOM SAID TO ME, I GUESS IN A MOMENT OF TOUGH LOVE, SHE SAID, "BONNIE, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE IT WORSE OFF THAN YOU DO, AND YOU CAN BULLY THEM." AND ONCE I STARTED DOING THAT, MY SELF-ESTEEM WENT THROUGH THE ROOF! IT FEELS AMAZING. I HATE HEARING GROWN WOMEN COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR PASTS BECAUSE USUALLY IT'S SO PETTY. THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE WHO HAVE HAD REAL PROBLEMS, REAL ISSUES GROWING UP AND YET THEY'RE OUT THERE. THEY GET OUT OF BED EVERY DAY, THEY'RE LAWYERS AND ASTRONAUTS AND COWGIRLS AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT STRIPPER COSTUMES, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR SONG. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A DANCER SAYING. WORDS TO LIVE BY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY! NICE CROWD. THANK YOU!
