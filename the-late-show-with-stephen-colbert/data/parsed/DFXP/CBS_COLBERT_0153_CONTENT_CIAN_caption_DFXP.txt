IS WELL WITH, THAT WAS A GREAT VACATION, BUT I WAS TOTALLY UNPLUGGED FOR THE LAST WEEK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEWS. SO OPUS, PLUG ME IN. (LAUGHTER) (SCREAMING)
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE TRUMP SHOT THAT GORILLA!
TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES JAMES CORDEN SCHND SCOTT SPEEDMAN AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY "DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE"! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪  Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH! YEAH! WHOO! WHOO! WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! I DON'T KNOW... CAN YA TELL? CAN YA TELL -- CAN YA TELL I'VE HAD A WEEK OFF, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? I'M ENERGIZED, FULLY LOADED AND BOTH TANKS ARE CHARGED, FOLKS, AND IT IS GREAT TO BE.
WE WERE ON BREAK FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS, AND I HIT MY TARGET WEIGHT WHICH WAS TO GAIN ONE POUND A DAY. (LAUGHTER) A LITTLE BIT OF DRINKING, A LITTLE BIT OF FISHING. DON'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF FISH IT WAS BECAUSE ONCE YOU DEEP FRY IT, CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS. SPEAKING OF FRYING, ANYBODY HERE A FAN OF BURGER KING? I LOVE THE KING. IT'S MY FAVORITE FOOD-BASED AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT, EVER SINCE THEY STOPPED MAKING "DICTATOR-TOTS." (LAUGHTER) THANK YOU! SO GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT BY MYSELF, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONELY. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW, BURGER KING IS TESTING A NEW MENU ITEM THAT COMBINES A WHOPPER AND A BURRITO-- CALLED THE WHOPPERRITO. (LAUGHTER) IT'S GOT ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF THE WHOPPER, WRAPPED UP LIKE  A BURRITO. IT'S GREAT IF YOU LOVE BOTH THOSE FOODS AND HATE YOURSELF. (LAUGHTER) REALLY SOUNDS MORE LIKE A SUICIDE PACT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE WHOPPERITO IS CURRENTLY BEING TESTED ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME AT SELECT BURGER KINGS IN PENNSYLVANIA. SO IF YOU'RE HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND READY TO GET SOMEPLACE REALLY QUICK, YOU ARE NOT THE TARGET MARKET FOR THE WHOPPERITO. (LAUGHTER) I'M GUESSING THE WHOPPERITO IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF HISPANIC FANS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HE IS PRESENTLY BEING SUED OVER HIS FAKE COLLEGE, TRUMP UNIVERSITY. HIS MASCOT IS SO OFFENSIVE, WE CAN'T EVEN SHOW IT. IT'S JUST TWO ORANGE BALLS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE, FOLKS, HE'S GOT A SWINGIN' PAIR OF 'EM. (LAUGHTER) AND, EVIDENTLY, TRUMP DOESN'T TRUST THE JUDGE IN THE CASE FOR ONE VERY MEXICAN REASON. (LAUGHTER)
I HAVE HAD HORRIBLE RULINGS. I HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY BY THIS JUDGE. NOW, THIS JUDGE IS OF MEXICAN HERITAGE. I'M BUILDING A WALL, OKAY? I'M BUILDING A WALL. THIS JUDGE IS GIVING US UNFAIR RULINGS. NOW, I SAY WHY. I'M BUILDING A WALL, OKAY? AND IT'S A WALL BETWEEN MEXICO, NOT ANOTHER COUNTRY.
STEPHEN: YES. (AUDIENCE BOOING) THAT'S IMPORTANT. BETWEEN "MEXICO, NOT ANOTHER COUNTRY." PROOF THAT TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE MEXICO AND CAN'T NAME "ANOTHER COUNTRY." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, THE JUDGE IN QUESTION, GONZALO CURIEL, WAS BORN IN THE MEXICAN PROVINCE OF "INDIANA." (LAUGHTER) I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY. SO IT'S RAISED A BIG QUESTION: IS TRUMP A RACIST FOR SAYING AN AMERICAN CAN'T BE TRUSTED BECAUSE OF HIS HERITAGE? HARD FOR ME TO JUDGE TRUMP -- MY IRISH HERITAGE MAKES ME WANT TO FIGHT ANYONE WHO LOOKS THAT MUCH LIKE A POTATO. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I THINK I WAS JUST RACIST AGAINST MYSELF! (LAUGHTER) TRUMP'S POINT IS, HE CANNOT BE JUDGED BY A MEMBER OF ANY GROUP HE'S OFFENDED. SO THAT MEANS NO MEXICAN JUDGES, NO MUSLIM JUDGES, NO ASIAN JUDGES, NO WOMEN JUDGES, UNLESS SHE'S A "10." (LAUGHTER) TRUMP'S INSULTED THE POPE, SO NO CATHOLIC JUDGES. HE CALLED EVERYONE IN IOWA "STUPID," SO NO JUDGES THAT EAT CORN. YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE TRUMP MIGHT BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF HE COULDN'T TELL THE JUDGE'S RACE OR GENDER. MAYBE COVER THE JUDGE UP, IN AN UNBIASED ROBE. MAKE IT WHITE. MAYBE WITH A MATCHING HOOD. THAT SEEMS RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS! GOT TO BE FAIR! THAT WAY IT'S GOT TO BE FAIR! SEEM RIGHT?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE.
Stephen: TRUST ME, TRUST ME, IT WILL BE FINE. IT WILL BE FINE. (LAUGHTER) BUT THERE IS ONE MINORITY GROUP TRUMP IS REACHING OUT TO AND POINTING AT THEM.
WE HAD A CASE WHERE WE HAD AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY WHO WAS A FAN OF MINE. GREAT FAN. GREAT GUY! IN FACT, I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M -- OH, LOOK AT MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN OVER HERE! LOOK AT HIM! ARE YOU THE GREATEST?
Stephen: WELL, IT SHOCKED SOME PEOPLE, BUT TRUMP DID SAY HE WAS GOING TO START ACTING PRESIDENTIAL, AND "LOOK AT MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN" DOES SOUND LIKE SOMETHING THOMAS JEFFERSON MIGHT HAVE SAID. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: THAT'S A FAIR COP. IN TRUMP'S DEFENSE, THE MAN HE WAS POINTING OUT "WAS" AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN TRUMP SUPPORTER. ALTHOUGH, IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT THE ONE, IT WOULD BE POLITE TO LEARN THE GUY'S NAME. (LAUGHTER) SO THERE ARE A FEW LINGERING ISSUES OF INTOLERANCE IN AMERICA, BUT ONE BRIGHT SPOT IS GAY RIGHTS. IN JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS, WE'VE SEEN LEGALIZED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, THE END OF "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL," AND THE MAINSTREAM -- (APPLAUSE) -- AND THE MAINSTREAM ACCEPTANCE OF BRUNCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS BEEN WON OVER. TAKE TEXAS CONGRESSMAN AND SOFT-BOILED EGG, LOUIS GOHMERT. RECENTLY, ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS, HE TACKLED THE PRESSING ISSUE OF GAYS IN SPACE!
YOU ARE WANTING TO SAVE HUMANKIND FOR POSTERITY, BASICALLY A MODERN-DAY NOAH. OK, WE GOT A SPACESHIP THAT CAN GO, AS MATT DAMON DID IN THE MOVIE, PLANT A COLONY SOMEWHERE. IF YOU COULD DECIDE WHAT 40 PEOPLE YOU PUT ON THE SPACECRAFT THAT WOULD SAVE HUMANITY, HOW MANY OF THOSE WOULD BE SAME SEX COUPLES?
STEPHEN: OOO, OOO, I KNOW THAT ONE. I KNOW THAT ONE! TONIGHT, YES, I LOOKED IT UP IN THE BIBLE, AND -- THIS IS TRUE -- THERE WERE ACTUALLY ONLY EIGHT PEOPLE ON NOAH'S ARK, AND THEY REPOPULATED THE ENTIRE WORLD. WHICH MEANS, THE REMAINING 32 PEOPLE ON LOUIS GOHMERT'S SPACE ARK COULD BE GAY. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STILL WORKS! AND IF THAT HAPPENED, ONLY TWO YEARS AFTER IT LAUNCHED, THAT SPACESHIP WILL BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE GALAXY! (APPLAUSE) AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS DISTINCTION BECAUSE, AFTER SIX MONTHS ON A SPACE SHIP, EVERYBODY'S GAY. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL. I MEAN, REPRESENTATIVE GOHMERT, HAVE YOU SEEN "THE FIFTH ELEMENT?" EVERYONE DRESSES LIKE LADY GAGA AND LOVES EUROPEAN DISCO OPERA. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (APPLAUSE) IT'S THE GAYEST OUTER SPACE MOVIE SINCE LUKE AND HAN SOLO'S WEDDING AT THE END OF "STAR WARS." THEY LOOK SO HAPPY! HEY, YOU KNOW WHO'S ALWAYS HAPPY? JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: EXCELLENT. WELL, IT WAS A LOVELY BREAK. DID YOU HAVE A LOVELY BREAK, JON?
YES, INDEED, IT WAS NICE.
Stephen: WE HAD ONE BIT OF SAD NEWS OVER THE BREAK AND NAT IS THE WORLD LOST A TRUE ICON, MUHAMMAD ALI. HE WAS ONE OVER THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OF THE 20TH CENTURY AND ONE OF THE MOST DOMINANT ATHLETES IN THE HISTORY OF SPORTS. DURING THE 1960 OLYMPICS, AT AGE 18, HE WON THE GOLD OLYMPICS MEDAL FOR THE U.S. BOXING TEAM, AND IN 1964, HE BECAME HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD, UPSETTING SONNY LISTON, THE 7-TO-1 FAVORITE. WOW. 7-TO-1 ODDS. HE WAS TRULY THE BERNIE SANDERS OF HIS TIME. LAUGH A LAUGH (APPLAUSE) BACK THEN, AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE EXPECTED TO BE DEFERENTIAL IN PUBLIC, BUT HERE'S YOUNG CASSIUS CLAY RIGHT AFTER THAT FIGHT.
I AM THE GREATEST. I DON'T HAVE A MARK ON MY FACE AND I UPSET SONNY LISTON AND I JUST TURNED 22 YEARS OLD. I MUST BE THE GREATEST. I TOLD THE WORLD. I SHOOK UP THE WORLD, I SHOOK UP THE WORLD, I SHOOK UP THE WORLD!
STEPHEN: THAT TYPE OF OUTRAGEOUS BRAGGING PAVED THE WAY FOR SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) ALI PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR HIS BELIEFS. HE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE AND BANNED FROM BOXING AFTER HE REFUSED TO FIGHT IN VIETNAM. HIS BAN WAS EVENTUALLY OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME COURT, AND ALI WENT ON TO WIN THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE THREE TIMES AND FOUGHT IN SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BOXING MATCHES OF ALL TIME: THE "RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE," THE "THRILLA IN MANILA," AND THE LESS SUCCESSFUL "ADEQUATE IN CONNECTICUT." (LAUGHTER) AND HE DIDN'T JUST CHANGE BOXING, HE CHANGED TRASH TALK. HE TURNED IT INTO PERFORMANCE ART. "I FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY, STING LIKE A BEE." JUST LAST WEEK, I MURDERED A ROCK, INJURED A STONE, HOSPITALIZED A BRICK. I'M SO MEAN, I MAKE MEDICINE SICK." "JOE FRAZIER IS SO UGLY THAT WHEN HE CRIES, THE TEARS TURN AROUND AND GO DOWN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD." THAT'S COLD. THE CHAMP APPEARED ON LATE NIGHT SHOWS, SITCOMS, AND COMMERCIALS AND EVEN IN THE COMIC BOOK "SUPERMAN VS MUHAMMAD ALI!" -- ALTHOUGH THE MOVIE VERSION FLOPPED WHEN BEN AFFLECK WAS CAST AS MUHAMMAD ALI. (LAUGHTER) NOTHING SUMS UP THE DEFIANT, CULTURE-CHANGING SPIRIT OF ALI LIKE WHEN HE SAID: "I AM AMERICA. I AM THE PART YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE. BUT GET USED TO ME. BLACK, CONFIDENT, COCKY; MY NAME, NOT YOURS; MY RELIGION, NOT YOURS; MY GOALS, MY OWN; GET USED TO ME." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE HELPED CREATE THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN TODAY-- AND I MEAN THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT AMERICA, NOT THAT WHOPPERITO THING. (LAUGHTER) JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS MUHAMMAD ALI'S LEGACY IS A HALL OF FAME BASKETBALL PLAYER  AND SIX-TIME NBA CHAMPION WHO WAS A FRIEND OF ALI'S AS WELL AS A FELLOW CONVERT TO ISLAM. PLEASE WELCOME, KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
NICE TO BE WITH YOU.
Stephen: I'M SORRY ABOUT THE LOSS OF YOUR FRIEND MUHAMMAD ALI. HOW DID THE TWO OF YOU GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER?
I RAN INTO ALI AT A PARTY HERE. I WAS A FRESHMAN AT U.C.L.A., AND I WENT TO A PARTY, AND ALI WAS THERE. THERE WAS A LITTLE BAND THERE, AND I WAS FOOLING AROUND WITH THE DRUMS, AND JUST GOOFING AROUND, AND MUHAMMAD ALI AND HIS PHOTOGRAPHER CAME UP. SO HE PICKED UP THE GUITAR AND STARTED ACTING LIKE HE WAS PLAYING THE GUITAR. I ACTED LIKE I WAS PLAYING THE DRUMS.
Stephen: ALI WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BOTH CULTURAL AND POLITICAL FIGURES OF THE 20t 20th CENTURY. WHY WAS HE IMPORTANT TO YOU?
MY DAD BOXED, SO, YOU KNOW, BOXING WAS A BIG SPORT FOR ME WHEN I WAS A KID AND KNEW THAT THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP WAS SOMEBODY TO BE RESPECTED. HE HANDLED ALL THAT. ON TOP OF THAT, HE HANDLED A WHOLE LOT OF ISSUES THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SPORTS, YOU KNOW, CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.
Stephen: AS A CHAMPION YOURSELF, TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHAT HIS GAME WAS LIKE BEFORE THE CONTEST STARTED, THE WAY HE PSYCHED OUT HIS OPPONENTS AND USED THE MENTAL GAME AGAINST THE PEOPLE HE WAS ABOUT TO BOX.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY GOT TO ME AND MADE ME TOTALLY THINK HE WAS INCREDIBLE WAS THE WAY, LIKE, WHEN HE WENT TO SONNY LISTON'S CAMP WHERE HE WAS TRAINING AND STARTED HECKLING HIM WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO TRAIN. SONNY LISTON CAME OUT AND TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND START A FISCAL CONFLICT RIGHT THERE. ALI TOTALLY GOT INTO THE GUY'S HEAD, AND HE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT IN HIS REACTION. HE SAID, I'LL KILL HIM! YOU KNOW, AND, OF COURSE, ALI WENT OUT THERE AND EMBARRASSED SONNY LISTON. THAT WAS THE TYPE OF GUY HE WAS. YOU HAD TO LOVE HIM FOR THAT.
Stephen: YOUR DAD WAS A BOXER. YOU TRAINED WITH BRUCE LEE.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE GONE FIVE ROUNDS WITH MUHAMMAD ALI? YOU'VE GOT THE REACH, TALE OF THE TAPE IS ON YOUR SIDE.
WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. HE WAS MY BROTHER AND MY FRIEND. WILT WANTED TO BOX HIM.
Stephen: WILT CHAMBERLAIN DID?
YEAH, HE WAS DREAMING. HE WOKE UP AND WAS DREAMING HE WAS GOING TO BOX MUHAMMAD ALI. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S WHERE EGO WILL GET YA.
Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR FRIEND THAT THEY SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT INTEGRITY WAS ALL ABOUT WAS REMARKABLE AND IT'S AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO REPEAT FOR OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS BECAUSE IT WAS THE REAL DEAL.
Stephen: KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JAMES CORDEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS HOST OF BOTH "THE  LATE LATE SHOW" AND THE UPCOMING 70TH ANNUAL TONY AWARDS THIS SUNDAY ON CBS. PLEASE WELCOME JAMES CORDEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK! HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU! NICE TO BE HERE.
Stephen: THAT IS A MAN COMFORTABLE ON A BROADWAY STAGE.
I GUESS. SO YOU'RE PRETTY COMFORTABLE YOURSELF.
Stephen: YOU'RE A TWEARD WINNER YOUR -- A PHONY AWARD WINNER YOURSELF AND YOU WILL BE HOSTING THE SHOWS. DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING READY? AREN'T YOU REHEARSING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
OH, YEAH, WE'RE CERTAINLY REHEARSING.
Stephen: JUST IMPROVISE IT, MAN! SOMETHING WONDERFUL RIGHT AWAY.
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT FROM A DISTANCE SEEMS LIKE SUCH A GREAT THING. I'M SO HONORED TO DO IT AND I FEEL SO PROUD TO BE AT THE CENTER OF IT AND I REALLY -- IT MEANS MORE TO ME TO HOST THAT THAN ANYTHING, BUT NOW THAT IT'S HERE, I'M, LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
Stephen: SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA ONCE UPON A TIME.
WHAT'S THIS UNNECESSARY PRESSURE PART OF MY RIFE? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU SHOULD LOVE IT.
I WAS USED TO PRE-TAPED SHOWS AND I THOUGHT, WHY AM I DOING THIS?
Stephen: HOW'S THE WIFE AND FAMILY, YOU HAD A WEEK OFF BUT DECIDED TO WORK INSTEAD. THAT GOES OVER HUGE WITH FAMILIES, I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, YEAH, BUT THE TRUTH IS MY WIFE IS GREAT AND AMAZING AND SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT. I JUST NEVER THOUGHT -- I JUST NEVER EVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET THE CHANCE TO HOST AN AWARDS SHOW LIKE THAT, SO SHE KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME --
Stephen: RIGHT. -- AND WE'RE ALL HERE. MY CHILDREN AND WIFE ARE HERE.
Stephen: THEY'RE HERE TONIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. O IN THAT RESPECT, WE'VE MADE IT A LITTLE ADVENTURE.
Stephen: AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN NOMINATED AND HOSTING, WHICH IS HARDER, BEING NOMINATED AND WONDERING WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO WIN OR HOSTING?
NO, HOSTING IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, IF YOU'RE NOMINATED, LIKE -- LOOK, I WAS VERY LUCKY TO WIN THAT AWARD THAT YEAR, BUT I SAID IN MY SPEECH THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEST. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST. JUST BECAUSE YOU WIN IT, YOU DON'T GO AROUND THINKING I'M THE BEST ACTOR IN NEW YORK. YOU'RE NOT. IT'S, LIKE, YOU'RE NOT, SO THE PRIZE IS BEING NOMINATED. THE PRIZE IS BEING IN THE ROOM, BOOING THERE. THE HOSTING IT, IT'S LIKE -- I JUST KEEP THINKING, LIKE, I'M SO WORRIED CONSTANTLY ABOUT FALLING OVER. LIKE -- (LAUGHTER) -- I WORRY ABOUT IT ON THE WALK FROM THERE TO HERE. I THINK, WELL -- AND I FALL OVER A LOT. IT'S JUST PART OF MY LIFE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S VERY FUNNY WHEN YOU DO SO.
YEAH, BUT THEN I THINK, WHAT IF I FALL OVER, HIT MY NOSE, NOSEBLEEDS IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR OPENING SONG?
Stephen: I BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD WEAN AN EMMY FOR THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH. THEN THEY'LL MAKE YOU HOST THE EMMYS AND IT'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE.
THEY'LL THINK I'D DONE IT ON PURPOSE AND THEY WON'T!
Stephen: HERE'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP YOU GET THROUGH THIS SUNDAY. IF YOU FORGET ALL OF YOUR LINES, JUST SAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, "HAMILTON"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS YEAR, THERE IS JUST NOTHING ELSE.
SEE, I DON'T THINK THERE IS NOTHING ELSE. I THINK IT'S ONCE IN A DECADE OR MAYBE EVEN LONGER TYPE PHENOMENA, AND I FEEL VERY, VERY LUCKY TO HOST THE SHOW ON A YEAR WHERE A SHOW IS SORT OF CROSSED BOUNDARIES INTO THE ETHER OF PUBLIC LIFE.
Stephen: YOU DO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING NEW WHEN YOU SEE THAT.
YES, YOIFL LIKE THERE WILL BE LIFE BEFORE AND POST-"HAMILTON" IN THE WORLD OF MUSICALS.
Stephen: WITHOUT A DOUBT. I HAD DINNER WITH ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS LAST NIGHT.
Stephen: JUST NAME DROPPING. YEAH, WELL I TALKED TO JAMES CORDEN TONIGHT. PRETTY SPECIAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HUH ALLOWED TO TELL PEOPLE WHO YOU WENT FISHING WITH LAST WEEK?
Stephen: NO, I DON'T HAVE TO.
JUST SAYING, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
Stephen: NO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU AND MARTIN SCORSESE WENT FISHING LAST WEEK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! DON'T MAKE MY STORY BETTER THEN TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME! (LAUGHTER)
SO I HAD DINNER WITH HIM AND I SAID, THERE WERE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE, IT WASN'T JUST US, IT WASN'T LIKE A DATE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S COOL. URE.
Stephen: JUST DON'T DO IT IN SPACE. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL, AND I SAID TO HIM, I SAID, I FELT LIKE, AT THE END OF THAT SHOW, THAT I WAS TODAY UP AND CLAPPING, BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL ENOUGH, BECAUSE I'VE DONE THESE OTHER SHOWS, AND I WISH -- LIKE, PEOPLE COULD COME UP WITH ONE MORE THING BETTER THAN A STANDING OVATION.
Stephen: JUST TEAR OFF YOUR ARM AND BEAT YOURSELF ON THE HEAD AND THEN YOU TRADE ARMS WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN EVERYBODY LEAVES WITH A DIFFERENT ARM.
HOUSE OF IT LAST NIGHT? IT WAS AMAZING. WE TRADED ARMS. I DON'T KNOW WHOSE THESE ARE BUT WE TRADED ARMS.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU HAVE TO REHEARSE BUT CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR ANOTHER ACT?
IF I DON'T, I WILL BE SO DISAPPOINTED.
Stephen: BACK WITH MORE JAMES CORDEN! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND THE GREAT JAMES CORDEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON "THE LATE LATE SHOW" AND THE SUCCESS OVER THERE.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
Stephen: AND THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF CAR POOL KARAOKE.
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT IDEA? HOW DID IT START?
I DID A SITCOM FOR THE B.B.C. CALLED GAVIN AND STACY, IT DID WELL AND MY CHARACTER WAS QUITE POPULAR. THERE'S A HUGE THING AT HOME CALLED COMIC RELIEF, A CHARITY THAT RAISES MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF POUNDS FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT AND THE TRADEOFF IS WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME COMEDY AND YOU DONATE SOME MONEY. MY CHARACTER DID SOME SKETCHES THAT WERE QUITE POPULAR. WE WERE COMING OUT WITH A NEW ONE AND I HAD THIS IDEA -- MY ORIGINAL IDEA WAS TO PICK GEORGE MICHAEL UP FROM PRISON IN A CAR.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. AND TEN WE'LL REALIZE MAYBE WE'LL LOSE THE PRISON BUT THERE IS STILL FUN FOR ME AND GEORGE TO BE IN THE CAR AND WE'LL SING WHAM SONGS. IT WAS JUST PART OF THE SKETCH.
Stephen: WAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU GO GO.
BABY, I'M YOUR MAN AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY JOYFUL ABOUT IT AND WE DECIDED -- I WONDERED IF IT WAS IDEA, LOS ANGELES, TRAFFIC, CAR POOL LANES, KARAOKE, TRAFFIC, DRIVING PEOPLE IN THE CAR, SINGING SONGS, GREAT, PEOPLE WERE GOING TO LOVE THIS. NO ONE WANTED TO DO IT. NO ONE AT ALL.
Stephen: REALLY? COULDN'T GET ANYBODY TO BITE?
OH, GOD! IMAGINE A RECORDING ARTIST. THEY SAID NO.
Stephen: OKAY. THERE WASN'T ANYONE THAT WOULD DO IT. THEN IT WAS A CHANCE MEETING MARIAH CAREYY AND SHE SAID, OKAY, I'LL DO IT AND --
Stephen: CHANCE MEETING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WAS IN THE STEAM ROOM WITH LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA AND MARIAH CAREYY, YEAH.
GO AHEAD. WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD TURN OUT THE WAY IT HAS. IT'S GREAT. WE HAVE ONE GOING OUT ON THE SHOW FOR THE TONY AWARDS WHICH IS ME, LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, AUDRA McDONALD, JESSE TYLER FERGUSON AND JANE KRAKOWSKI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE DID THE BEST OF BROADWAY SPECIAL.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. IT'S FUN.
Stephen: SO THE SHOW'S A BIG SUCCESS. YOU'RE IN LOS ANGELES.
YES.
Stephen: BUT YOU STARTED YOUR CAREER IN LONDON. ARE YOU BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE AN AMERICAN NOW OR DO YOU --
UM...
Stephen: DOES LOS ANGELES FEEL LIKE HOME OR DO YOU MISS LONDON A LOT?
I MISS LONDON. I VERY MUCH MISS BEING AT HOME. I MISS ARCHITECTURE AND MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
Stephen: YOU MISS ARCHITECTURE? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
TRULY.
Stephen: DO THEY NOT HAVE STRIP MALLS IN LONDON?
NOT SO MUCH. IT'S A WEIRD THING. IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY FEEL A SENSE OF IT HERE IN NEW YORK, BUT IN LONDON, PARTICULARLY FOR ANYONE, WHEN ANYONE SAYS TO ME I'M GOING TO LONDON, WHAT SHOULD I DO, I ALWAYS GO, LOOK UP, BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE REWARDED. IF YOU'RE IN LONDON AT ANY POINT OF YOU THINK HOW IS THIS CHURCH AMONGST THESE SKYSCRAPERS? BUT IN TERMS OF FEELING -- LOTS OF PEOPLE SAID TO ME BEFORE, OH, HOW IS IT BEING A BRIT IN AMERICA? I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE OR JUST ME AND THE FAMILY I GREW UP IN, BUT I NEVER CONSIDERED MYSELF TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD, REALLY, AND I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS BEING BRITISH NOR AMERICAN. I SORT OF FEEL WE'RE ALL KIND OF IN IT TOGETHER AND THERE SHOULDN'T REALLY BE ANY -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- YOU KNOW, OF THOSE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I JUST WANTED TO VALIDATE THAT MOMENT BECAUSE I WAS FEELING IT WITH YOU. (LAUGHTER)
I MET A GUY, YOU KNOW THE VIRGIN GALACTIC ARE DOING THIS THING WHERE RICHARD BRANSON IS GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE UP TO SPACE FOR EIGHT MINUTES AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EARTH AND SOMEONE WAS TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY AND I SAID, EIGHT MINUTES, GOING UP, JUST FEELS LIKE A LOT OF RISK OF POSSIBLY DYING. HE SAID TO ME IT'S EXACTLY HOW PEOPLE FELT WHEN THE FIRST PROPELLER PLANES CAME OUT AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS, IN A TOWN, IN AMERICA OR ACROSS THE WORLD, THEY'D GO UP IN THE AIR FOR EIGHT MINUTES AND COME DOWN, AND PEOPLE WOULD COME DOWN WITH A COMPLETELY NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT THEIR HOME WHERE THEY LIVED, THEIR STATE, BECAUSE THEY'D SEE THAT THESE DIVISIONS BEING CREATED WERE NOT -- THEY WERE MANMADE DIVISIONS. WE DECIDED THAT THIS WOULD BE MINE AND THAT WOULD BE YOURS AND THIS WOULD BE HERE AND THAT WOULD BE HERE. HE SAID, IMAGINE IF YOU COULD MAKE PEOPLE TODAY REALIZE THAT ON A GLOBAL SCALE, IF YOU COULD GO UP AND LOOK DOWN AND GO, OH, IT'S JUST EARTH, AND IT'S OURS TO LOOK AFTER. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU BEING FROM HERE OR ME BEING FROM THERE OR BUILDING A WALL HERE OR DOING THOSE THINGS. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT BEING BRITISH HERE.
Stephen: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY CHEST.
Stephen: I'VE SEEN PICTURES. DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
FOR YEARS I WAS SO NERVOUS ABOUT DOING SHIRTLESS SCENES. I WAS, LIKE, WHY WOULD I TAKE MY SHIRT OFF IN THIS OR THAT SCENE. I'M ALWAYS VERY NERVOUS ABOUT DOING IT? WHY WOULD MY CHARACTER BE TAKING THE SHIRT OFF.
I WOULD BE IN BED WITH A WOMAN AND I WOULD BE, LIKE, GIVE ME A SWEATER. THESE GUYS WERE SURFERS AND I THOUGHT, I KNOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT? DID YOU SHOW UP AND EVERYBODY IS SHIRTLESS?
YES. WE DID A POST-FUNERAL SCENE AND MY BROTHER WAS THERE AND S.A.T., SHIRT OFF.

Stephen: OH, ARE YOU OKAY? NO.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOT THE YOUNG STUD IN THIS ONE?
NO, I PLAY THE OLDEST BROTHER OF FIVE BROTHERS AND IT'S BEEN AN HILARIOUS ADVENTURE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THESE YOUNG DUDES. ONE'S 20, 25, 30, AND ONE CLOSER TO MY AGE, BUT I DON'T PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO HIM.

YOU TELL? ES. GOOD, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. ALWAYS COME TO ME FIRST, OKAY?
WHAT? HE CHECKED LIZ LICENSE BEFORE YOU LEFT.

WHAT KIND OF FAMILY DO YOU THINK WE ARE, MAN? I GOT IT FROM HERE.
Stephen: YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW.

LET'S GET LESS LIGHTS! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: CAN WE GET YOUR SHIRT BACK ON AND --
IT'S MOVE THE LIGHTS BACK.
Stephen: WHAT IF WE DID THIS ON THE RADIO, SCOTT? (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU WERE A SERIOUS ATHLETE. SHIRT OR NO SHIRT, YOU WERE A SERIOUS ATHLETE. YOU WERE LIKE NUMBER 9th. YOU FINISHED 9th IN THE OLYMPIC TRIALS IF SWIMMING.
WHEN I WAS 16.
Stephen: WHAT YEAR WAS THERE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
1992.
Stephen: 1992. I COMPETED OLYMPIC TRIALS AND THREE WEEKS LATER I COULDN'T PULL THROUGH THE WATER ANYMORE.
Stephen: WHY? I DON'T KNOW, THE MOST BORING SPORT OF ALL TIME AND I GOT INJURED. SO IT'S NOT FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL OR SOMETHING COOL, LITERALLY MY SHOULDER GAVE OUT AND THAT WAS IT.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO FROM BEING REALLY A NATIONALLY-RANKED ATHLETE TO AN ACTOR? WHAT'S THE TURN? HOW DID "FELICITY" HAPPEN IF THAT HAPPENED YOUNG FOR YOU.
IT HAPPENED YOUNG BUT I WAS AT A HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIFTED ATHLETES AND GIFTED ARTISTS.
Stephen: SAME HIGH SCHOOL, ATHLETES AND ARTISTS.
YES.
Stephen: BASICALLY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T MAKE IT TO CLASS TODAY. (LAUGHTER)
A LOT OF WEED AND A LOT OF STEROIDS. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHEN I GOT INJURED, I STARTED HANGING OUT WITH THE DANCERS AND CHICKS.
Stephen: PARTY PEOPLE. AND I GOT ADDICTED TO THAT WHOLE THING, I GOT A COUPLE OF LUCKY BREAKS, AND "FELICITY" CAME ALONG, I WAS LIVING ON MY MOM'S COUCH WITH NO MONEY AND GOT A CALL TO AUDITION FOR THIS TV SHOW. MY MOM GOT THE CALL AND I WAS, LIKE, WHAT'S THE WB? I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THAT, WHO'S J.J. ABRAMS? I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THAT SHOW. SO AN AGENT FOUND OUT I'D SAID, NO THEN THEY GOT ME THE SCRIPT AND I READ IT AND I THOUGHT I'VE GOT TO DO THIS. SO I RENTED THIS VIDEO ROOM WHERE THIS KID WOULD FILM YOU DOING WHATEVER YOU WANTED -- I MEAN, NOT WHATEVER YOU WANTED -- (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE AUDITION?
SO I GOT THERE AND OPENED THE DOOR AND IT WAS, LIKE, A 17-YEAR-OLD AWKWARD KID AND I HAD TO DO THESE, LIKE, INTENSE LOVE SCENES WITH A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY.
