NORTH KOREA IS THREATENING TO RETALIATE "THOUSAND-FOLD" AGAINST THE U.S. IN RESPONSE TO NEWLY IMPOSED U.N. SANCTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES CHRISTOPH WALTZ. CHRIS O'DOWD. AND SEAN EVANS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! THANKS, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. NOW I. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TUNE INTO THIS SHOW ON A NIGHTLY BASIS TO GET THEIR NEWS AND INFORMATION. THEY COUNT ON ME TO BE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER, OKAY, WITH A CALM VOICE. I DON'T WANT TO BE ALARMIST. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE U.S. INTELLIGENCE BELIEVES THAT NORTH KOREA IS NOW MAKING MISSILE-READY NUCLEAR WEAPONS. MY GOD, DENNIS RODMAN, DID YOU DO NOTHING? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT DON'T WORRY. THE STORY GETS WORSE BECAUSE OVER THE WEEKEND, THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL VOTED 15-0 TO SANCTION NORTH KOREA. AND IN RESPONSE, NORTH KOREA WARNED THAT THEY ARE "READY TO TEACH THE U.S. A SEVERE LESSON WITH ITS NUCLEAR STRATEGIC FORCE," ADDING THAT "OTHER COUNTRIES WERE NOT BEING THREATENED." WHAT? HOW IS THAT FAIR? OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOT? IT WAS 15 COUNTRIES. WE'RE JUST ONE OF THE 15 COUNTRIES. WHY JUST US? LOOK, NORTH KOREA, STOP TRYING TO MAKE US A THING. I'M NOT SAYING WHAT WE HAVE IS SPECIAL, BUT IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE. THE UNITED STATES, WE SANCTION A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES. WE SANCTIONED RUSSIA JUST LAST WEEK, AND IT FELT PRETTY GREAT. THEY THREATEN US. THEY THREATEN US, OKAY-- LISTEN, LISTEN. THEY THREATEN US IN A WAY YOU NEVER WILL. YOU SHOULD SEE THE SIZE OF THEIR MISSILES. YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE-- I'M JUST SAYING. MAYBE YOU SHOULD START THREATENING OTHER COUNTRIES, TOO. GET OUT THERE. WHO KNOWS? MAYBE THE COUNTRY YOU REALLY WANT TO ANNIHILATE HAS BEEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU THE WHOLE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS IS THE LEVEL OF NORTH KOREA'S PRESENT PARANOIA: THEY DESCRIBED THIS U.N. VOTE AGAINST THEM AS "PACKS OF WOLVES ARE COMING IN ATTACK TO STRANGLE A NATION." SO IN THIS METAPHOR, THE U.S. AND OUR ALLIES ARE WOLVES? HAS KIM JONG-UN EVER SEEN A WOLF? BECAUSE STRANGLING'S NOT REALLY THEIR THING. ( LAUGHTER ) AAARRGGHHH! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! THAT TICKLES! THAT TICKLES! ( LAUGHTER ) I KEEP THEM NOW! THANKFULLY, FACED WITH THE GREATEST CHALLENGE OF HIS PRESIDENCY, DONALD TRUMP STEPPED UP, AND IN A MOMENT OF PURE STATESMANSHIP, DE-ESCALATED THE RHETORIC AND BROUGHT CALM TO OUR WORRIED NATION. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JUST KIDDING. HE SAID THIS:
NORTH KOREA BEST NOT MAKE ANY MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE AND FURY LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN. HE HAS BEEN VERY THREATENING, BEYOND A NORMAL STATEMENT. AND AS I SAID, THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE, FURY AND, FRANKLY, POWER, THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SHUT UP! JUST SHHHH! OKAY? YOU'RE GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED, AND I JUST STARTED "THE HANDMAID'S TALE." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW KIM JONG-UN'S CRAZY, RIGHT? HE'S A LOOSE CANNON. LIKE MEL GIBSON IN "LETHAL WEAPON." ALSO, THAT ONE TIME HE GOT PULLED OVER. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, LOOK, THE ONE RAY OF HOPE HERE IS THAT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER TO BELIEVE TRUMP'S NUCLEAR SABER RATTLING, AND NEITHER ARE YOU, BECAUSE A POLL CAME OUT TODAY THAT FOUND THREE-QUARTERS OF AMERICANS SAY THEY CAN'T TRUST MOST OF WHAT THEY HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. I DON'T BLAME THEM. I DON'T BLAME THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PEOPLE ARE APPLAUDING PROFOUND DOUBT IN THEIR GOVERNMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T BLAME THEM FOR NOT TRUSTING THEM. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS MADE A LOT OF QUESTIONABLE CLAIMS. FOR INSTANCE, THE CROWD SIZE AT THE INAUGURATION, THE OBAMA WIRETAPPING, AND THERE'S NO WAY STEVE BANNON IS THAT FLEXIBLE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HERE'S THE THING, HERE'S THE THING: WHILE ONLY 24% OF AMERICANS TRUST WHAT THEY HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING IN THE POLL IS 38%. THAT MEANS 14% OF VOTERS ENJOY BEING LIED TO. AND-- I JUST WANT TO SAY-- IF ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE TUNING IN RIGHT NOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY, "EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT ELSE? LIGHTER NEWS. LIGHTER NEWS. OH, THE WORLD IS BURNING. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" JUST PUBLISHED A REPORT ON THE DRASTIC IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE U.S., WHICH SAYS "EVIDENCE FOR A CHANGING CLIMATE ABOUNDS, FROM THE TOP OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEANS." AND "AMERICANS ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW." IT'S KIND OF DETAILED, SO THEY ALSO RELEASED THIS VIDEO SUMMARY. ( SCREAMING ) HE'S OKAY. HE'S OKAY. HE'S ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS A STUNTER. THAT WASN'T THE ACTUAL EARTH. WE WOULDN'T DO THAT TO THE ACTUAL EARTH, I PROMISE YOU. UNLESS THE RATINGS WOULD BE REALLY GOOD. BUT HERE'S THE CRAZY THING: THIS IS AN UNRELEASED, AS-YET-UNAPPROVED GOVERNMENT REPORT BUT IT WAS RELEASED AND LEAKED BECAUSE "THE TIMES" SAYS OUT OF CAN THE FEAR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION COULD CHANGE OR SUPPRESS THE REPORT." SO, WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE CLIMATE SCIENCE HAS TO BE LEAKED.
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET OUR WEATHER FROM.
IT'S GOING TO BE UNSEASONALLY WARM THIS WEEKEND. HIGH IN THE LOW 90s. ON SUNDAY YOU'LL WANT TO BRING IN AN UMBRELLA. YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME.
Stephen: NOW, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW WE'RE DESTROYING OUR ENVIRONMENT, YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT IN THE MASSIVE 600-PAGE INTER-AGENCY DOCUMENT WHICH I HAVE RIGHT HERE AND, WHICH, IN HINDSIGHT, I SHOULD NOT HAVE PRINTED OUT. SORRY. THAT'S ON ME. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S ON ME.
Jon: THAT'S A BIG OLD DOCUMENT.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND THE THING IS, THESE SCIENTISTS ARE NOT TOTALLY CRAZY TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT KILL THIS JUST BECAUSE JUST YESTERDAY, WE LEARNED THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ISSUED A MEMO INSTRUCTING STAFF TO AVOID USING CERTAIN TERMS. APPARENTLY, "CLIMATE CHANGE" IS IN THE "AVOID" CATEGORY. YES, CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD BE IN THE AVOID CATEGORY SO WE CAN STAY OUT OF THE "DEAD" CATEGORY. APPARENTLY, "CLIMATE CHANGE" AND "CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION," ARE TO BE REPLACED BY "WEATHER EXTREMES" AND "RESILIENCE TO WEATHER EXTREMES." AND THE TERM "REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES" HAS BEEN BLACKLISTED IN FAVOR OF "BUILD SOIL ORGANIC MATTER." GLIEWD--
Audience: BOOO!
Stephen: DO PANTS COUNT AS ORGANIC MATTER? BECAUSE TODAY'S NEWS IS MAKING ME BUILD SOIL IN THEM. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. CHRISTOPH WALTZ IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, SURFING DOGS! I PROMISE! STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, JON, JON. MAN ALIVE. JON, I AM VERY EXCITED FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW. IN A MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHRISTOPH WALTZ OUT HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHRIS O'DOWD IS HERE. AND ALSO, AT THE END OF THE SHOW, I'M EXCITED AND KIND OF SCARED, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A GUY NAMED SEAN EVANS ON THE SHOW FROM-- FROM THE SHOW "HOT ONES," FROM FIRST WE FEAST. THIS IS ON YOUTUBE. YOU SEE THIS GUY? HE EATS THE HOTTEST WINGS LEGALLY ALLOWABLE BY LAW. AND I'M GOING TO EAT THE WINGS TONIGHT AND HE'S GOING TO INTERVIEW ME. I'M GOING TO EEPT THE WINGS. ASK ME IF I LIKE HOT FOOD.
Jon: DO YOU LIKE HOT FOOD?
Stephen: I DO NOT. THIS IS GOING TO BE EXCITING. THIS IS GOING TO BE EXCITING. IT IS GOING TOON A ROLLER COASTER IN MY ELEMENTARY CANAL. INFORMATION, WHERE WERE WE, RIGHT OVER HERE? NOW, DESPITE ALL THE TROUBLING NEWS TODAY, AUGUST IS TRADITIONALLY THE SLOWEST NEWS CYCLE OF THE YEAR. AND NETWORKS OFTEN FILL OUT THEIR BROADCASTS WITH FLUFFIER STORIES. WELL, YESTERDAY, ONE ANCHOR FOR THE BBC JUST COULD NOT FAKE INTEREST.
NOW YOU'RE WATCHING BBC NEWS. BEAR IN MIND, IT IS AUGUST. THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK. DOG OWNERS AND THEIR PETS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HIT THE WAVES IN THE SECOND ANNUAL WORLD DOG SURFING CHAMPIONSHIPS. HERE ARE THE PICTURES.
THERE'S ALSO STYLE. THERE'S CONFIDENCE. THERE'S THE SIZE OF THE WAVES.
( SIGHS ) THE COMPETITOR'S MAIN CHALLENGE IS TO STAY AFLOAT ON THE BOARD. THIS IS IN PACIFICA, NEAR SAN FRANCISCO. BUT THERE ARE ALSO PRIZES FOR THE BEST-DRESSED AND TANDEM-SURFING DOGS, THE WINNER, OF COURSE, BEING CROWNED "TOP DOG." THAT'S A SHAME. WE'VE RUN OUT OF PICTURES. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: TRIEWLT EMBODIMENT OF THAT OLD BRITISH SAYING, "KEEP CALM AND LOSE THE WILL TO LIVE." BUT BBC ANCHORS ALWAYS STRUGGLE THIS TIME OF YEAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BBC CLIP FROM JUST THIS MORNING.
THIS IS THE BBC, AND THE AUGUST NEWS CYCLE CONTINUES. ( SIGHS ) YOU'VE HEARD OF SPRING CLEANING, BUT RACCOON CLEANING? THIS OUT OF MONTANA. A RACCOON INEXPLICABLY NAMED "MR. SPAGHETTI," HAS LEARNED TO SWEEP THE FLOOR. WONDERS NEVER CEASE. ACCORDING TO SOURCES, THE VIDEO HAS GONE-- GOD HELP ME-- TOETS EPICALLY MEGA-VIRAL. OH, ARE WE OUT OF RACCOON PICTURES ALREADY? PITY. PLEASE, NO ONE ALERT THE NOBEL COMMITTEE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN OTHER NEWS, I WENT TO CAMBRIDGE FOR THIS. OH, WE'RE GETTING MORE NEWS IN JUST NOW. AN ALLIGATOR IN FLORIDA ISN'T JUST COLD-BLOODED. HE'S ALSO-- DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS? I DO OR I'M FIRED? A COOL DUDE. FLORIDIANS ARE CELEBRATING AFTER A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES HAS FALLEN ON TO AN ALLIGATOR. THE LOCALS HAVE DUBBED HIM-- "KING BAD ASS" AND HAVE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO ELECT HIM MAYOR. IT'S COME TO THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION, THE NETWORK THAT BROUGHT YOU THE PARTITION OF INDIA IS NOW REPORTING ON ANIMALS WEARING CLOTHES! OH, GOD! MY WIFE HATES ME. MY CHILDREN DON'T RESPECT ME. MY LIFE IS A WASTE! ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT, WHAT? WAIT. WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS. REAL NEWS! OUT OF THE ROGUE NORTH KOREAN REGIME, IT APPEARS THAT IN THE CAPITAL PYONGYANG, A DALMATIAN HAS LEARNED TO RIDE A TRICYCLE! BLOODY HELL, THAT'S BRILLIANT! LOOK AT HIM GO!
Stephen: THANKS FOR THAT REPORT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CHRISTOPH WALTZ. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS A TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNER YOU KNOW FROM "INGLORIOUS BASTERDS" AND "DJANGO UNCHAINED." HE NOW STARS IN "TULIP FEVER."
I HAVE DECIDED TO ENGAGE THE SERVICES OF A PORTRAIT PAINTER. HE HAS FOUND AN ARTIST. HIS NAME IS JUAN MANU "DJANGO UN HE IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING YOUNG ARTISTS IN AMSTERDAM. THEY'LL SAY LOOK THERE AT THAT LUCKY OLD DOG. DIDN'T HE HAVE A LOVELY YOUNG WIFE?
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME CHRISTOPH WALTZ! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU'RE THE GUEST. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE'VE NEVER BEFORE. IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW.
THANK YOU. IT'S ONE OF THE NICEST PLACES I CAN MEET PEOPLE WHO I CAN HIRE. WHO WERE YOU, WALTER KEENE IN "BIG EYES." YOU STARTED YOUR LIFE NOT AS A FRIGHTENING PERSON, THOUGH. YOU PLAYED A LOT OF SORT OF SERRIFYING PEOPLE.
NO, NO, I STARTED AS A FRIGHTENING PERSON AND THEN I WAS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, PUT INTO SHAPE.
Stephen: OH, OH, IS THAT WHAT THEY DO IN AUSTRIA, THEY PUT YOU INTO SHAPE?
YEAH. YOU DON'T FIT THE LEDERHOSEN, OTHERWISE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE PICTURES OF YOU IN LEDERHOSEN?
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: I HAVE PICTURES OF ME IN LEDERHOSEN.
REALLY.
Stephen: WE SHOULD TRADE SOME TIME OR START A WEBSITE.
YOU SEE, WE ARE MORE TRADITIONAL ABOUT THIS. AMERICANS ARE MORE OUTGOING. WE'RE KIND OF VERY, VERY CONTAINED AND PRIVATE. HENCE THE, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: OH, NO, I KNOW. I'VE BEEN TO VIENNA, YOUR HOME TOWN. I LOVE IT.
SO DO I. IT'S FANTASTIC. I WANT TO BE BURIED THERE.
Stephen: ULTIMATE TO BE BURIED THERE?
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT ANYTHING BETWEEN NOW AND DEATH? ( LAUGHTER ).
A TRUE VIENNESE DOESN'T THINK THAT WAY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THE BIG IN BETWEEN. WE THINK ABOUT BIRTH IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT DEATH. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S TRUE BY THE WAY.
Stephen: REALLY?
WHY DO YOU THINK FREUD INVENTED ALL THIS STUFF IN I VIENNA.
Stephen: THE BIRTH CANAL INTO A HOLE. KEEP IT LIGHT. IT'S A LATE-NIGHT SHOW. I TOTALLY LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT POSTPONE OF VIEW.
WE ARE OBSESSED WITH DEATH BUT WITH THE BEAUTY AND CELEBRATION. FUNERALS ARE THE HAPPIEST OF OCCASIONS.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MAKE TO THE YEARS IN BETWEEN? DOES THAT MAKE THE YEARS IN BETWEEN BECAUSE YOU CAME FROM NOTHINGNESS, AND YOU RETURN TO NOTHINGNESS, OR IS IT YOU RETURN BACK TO THE ONENESS WITH GOD? IS IT A RELIGIOUS THING OR MERELY SECULAR?
NO, NO, IT'S JUST FUN. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IS IT FUN IN BETWEEN BECAUSE IT'S CARE-FREE AND WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DIE SO LET IT RIP?
KIND OF, YES. THAT'S WHOLE JOKE ABOUT CATHOLICISM, ISN'T IT.
Stephen: ALMOST EVERYONE IN AUSTRIA IS CATHOLIC, 99%.
99.9.
Stephen: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. AND YOU WERE AN ALTAR BOY, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE GLIFS AN ALTAR BOY, TOO, FOR 11 YEARS.
BUT YOU HAD A CHOICE.
Stephen: NO. ( LAUGHTER ) THE YOUNGEST OF 11 CHILDREN. I HAD NO CHOICE.
SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW.
Stephen: I WAS WHIPPED INTO SERVICE.
THERE YOU GR, SAME THING.
Stephen: DID YOU ENJOY IT AT ALL? I SAID THIS TO SOME OF THE MY GUESTS WHO WERE ALTAR BOYS. I LIKED BEING ON STAGE. THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH PERFORMING.
FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT. I'M MANUFACTURE A FILM PERSON, EVEN THOUGH I DID A LOT OF STAGE. I WAS MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPEAT-- SORRY, CAN I DO THAT.
Stephen: NO, YOU'VE GOT TO BE EXACTLY RIGHT FOR THE PRIEST.
I HAD A POLISH GUY, YOU KNOW, AND THE POLISHES PRIESTS ARE A LITTLE SHARPER THAN THE REST. AND HE ALWAYS PUT ME-- I WAS AFRAID OF HIM SO I MADE EVEN MORE MISTAKES. WHEN TO RING. IN THE END WE HID BEHIND THE BIG ARMOIRE AND DRANK HIS WINE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THEY BELIEVE. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG-- THAT'S A MORTAL SIN. ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAD-- WE DIDN'T HAVE A POLISH PRIEST, BUT OUR BISHOP, WE HAD A GERMAN BISHOP. AND WE CALLED HIM OUR GERMAN SHEPPARD. AND I WAS TERRIFIED OF HIM. I WAS TERRIFIED OF HIM.
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER SERVE FOR A BISHOP? BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT MASS WHEN YOU SERVE FOR A BISHOP.
YEAH, BUT I WAS NOT PROMINENT ENOUGH.
Stephen: YOU WEREN'T FIRST STRING?
NO.
Stephen: WOW, YOU WERE A WEAK LINK ON THE ALTAR?
YES, AN UNDER-STUDY.
Stephen: YOU EVEN HAD TO WAIT FAIR WHILE TO BREAK OUT AS AN ALTER BOY. YOU HAVE THIS AMAZING CAREER-- HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN "INGLORIOUS BASTERDS" HAPPENED?
REALLY YOUNG, 52-- YEAH, I THINK 52.
Stephen: SO WHAT IS IT-- LIKE, BECAUSE YOU WON AN OSCAR FOR THAT. YOU ALSO WON AN OSCAR-- DID YOU WIN AN OSCAR FOR--
"DJANGO UNCHAINED."
Stephen: EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU WERE EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE NOT JUST SOMEBODY WHO IS UNKNOWN? YOU WERE KNOWN WORLDWIDE AT THE AGE OF 52. WERE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT?
YES. THE THEATERICALITY OF IT ALL. IT'S NOT DIFFERENT FROM MASS.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, VIENNA IS AMAZING. IT'S AN AMAZINGLY THEATRICAL PLACE IN A WAY. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW-- IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN, YOU SHOULD GO. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY, "WHY DID YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH?" IT'S LIKE ROME IF ROME FELL BUT NEVER BURNED PUP GET THE SENSE OF ALL THE EMPIRE BUT NOTHING IS DESTROYED. THINGS WERE REBUILT, I GUESS AFTER THE WAR. ST. STEPHENS CATHEDRAL, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE.
IT CERTAINLY IS. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES IN THE WORLD. AND IT'S AN OLD ONE. IT WAS A ROMAN GARRISON, AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO TODAY. AND LET'S SEE WHAT, YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE BRINGS BECAUSE POLITICALLY, THEY'VE-- TRADITIONALLY, POLITICALLY, THEY'RE A LITTLE...
Stephen: TO THE RIGHT?
OH, I SHOULD SAY SO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU CAN HAVE FUN THERE. I'LL SAY ONE THING, LATE AT NIGHT, I WOULD MAKE THE DISCO, YOU KNOW. YOU MAKE THE DISCO?
NO.
Stephen: GO TO MAKE THE DISCO?
NO.
Stephen: GO TO DISCOS AND IT WOULD BE, "JAKE SENT ME." WE HAD A GUY WHEN WE WERE THERE BARBARA. IT WAS THE MOST FUN I HAVE EVER HAD. MY WRITING PARTNER.
I LOVED A BAR THAT NOBODY-- WHEN I WAS STILL LIVING IN VIENNA AS A TEENAGER. NOBODY WENT TO THAT BAR EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY, AND YOU HAD TO KNOCK, AND IT TOOK A WHILE, AND SOME OLD GUY KIND OF SHUFFLED UP AND PUT HIS BARKEEPER'S JACKET ON AND LET YOU IN, AND THEN HE GAVE YOU THE CHOICE-- WHITE, RED-- REFERRING TO WINE-- COKE OR FANTA. AND THAT WAS IT. AND THEN HE SHUFFLED OVER TO THE PIANO-- WHICH WAS COVERED. AND THERE WAS A LITTLE TAPE RECORDER ON THE PIANO. AND THEN HE PRESSED THE BUTTON, AND THEN THERE WAS A NICE LITTLE BAR. AND THEN HE SHUFFLED OFF TO GET YOUR WHITE, RED, COKE OR FANTA, WHATEVER YOU ORDERED.
Stephen: WOW. WHAT WAS YOUR ORDER?
BEER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I WANT TO REMIND YOU, THAT WAS NOT ONE OF THE OPTIONS YOU JUST NAMED.
COULDN'T AFFORD THE REST. BUT I-- HE DIDN'T. I JUST LIKED TO SIT THERE AND SEE IT-- IT REALLY WAS ONE-- AN ENCHANTED PLACE. IT WAS WONDERFUL. YOU WOULD BE ON YOUR OWN IN PEACE AND BE LEFT ALONE TO THINK ABOUT DEATH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: "TULIP FEVER" IS IN THEATERS AUGUST 25. CHRISTOPH WALTZ, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS A TONY NOMINEE YOU KNOW FROM "BRIDESMAIDS," "GIRLS," AND "THE I.T. CROWD." HE NOW STARS IN THE SERIES "GET SHORTY." PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS O'DOWD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I GOTTA TELL YOU, NOT EVERY GUEST GETS THAT KIND OF REACTION FOR JUST ONE OF THE THINGS ON THEIR C.V.
IT'S A GOOD ONE, THOUGH. THANK YOU, THAT WAS VERY KIND.
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU. I NEVER MET YOU BEFORE.
YEAH, I KNOW, IT'S NICE.
Stephen: YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR ACCENT BETRAYS THAT YOU'RE A 'FERNER. YOU'RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE, STRANGER. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE FROM ROSS COMMON.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: MY FAMILY, TOO.
STOP IT!
Stephen: NO, NOT AT ALL, MY BROTHER ED IS RIGHT OUT THERE, ROSCOMMON, RIGHT.
THE COLBERT HELP CANS.
Stephen: THE TUCK SIDE OF THE FAMILY.
HAVE YOU BEEN.
Stephen: YES.
IT'S NICE.
Stephen: OH, IT'S LOVELY!
A LOT OF BOG.
Stephen: A LOT OF PEAT.
IF YOU'RE INTO SOIL IT'S REALLY THE PLACE FOR YOU. YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THIS, WE HAVE THE BEST FOOTBALL TEAM IN IRELAND.
Stephen: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. YOU MEAN SO, RIGHT?
NO, I MEAN GAELIC FOOTBALL.
Stephen: OH, GAELIC FOOTBALL, SURE.
WHICH IS A SPORT FOR STRONG MEN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DID YOU PLAY? DID YOU PLAY?
I PLAYED A BIT. I PLAYED A BIT BECAUSE I WAS TALL.
Stephen: DOES THAT HELP?
BIG ADVANTAGE.
Stephen: YOU ATTENDED DRAMA SCHOOL IN LONDON.
RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. AND WAS THAT FUN? HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU WENT THERE?
LIKE, 20.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD TIME.
YEAH, IT WAS NICE. I WENT TO COLLEGE IN DUBLIN, FIRST, AND I WANTED TO BE A POLITICAL SPEECHWRITER.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU TO THAT?
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED ORATORS AND WELL-USED WORDS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WORN DOWN, ALL WORN-DOWN WORDS, WELL USED.
THAT'S RIGHT. OVERLY USED PHRASES AND LEXICON. BUT ANYWAY, I STARTED DOING PLAYS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE DOING THAT. GAVE UP ON THE POLITICS NONSENSE. AND THEN WENT TO DRAMA SCHOOL, AND STRUGGLED FOR 10 YEARS.
Stephen: 10 YEARS. THAT'S A LONG TIME TO STRUGGLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, THOUGH, DON'T YOU THINK? SUFFERING IS GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IT'S COMMON. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD, BUT IT'S A COMMON THING.
IT'S A HARD THING TO SAY AROUND IRISH PEOPLE, "HEY, THIS STRUG CELL GREAT FOR YOU. IT'S CHARACTER BUILDING. YOU DON'T NEED THAT FOOD NONSENSE!"
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD-- YOU HAD A JOB WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNG ACTOR TRYING TO MAKE IT FOR-- IS IT THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND?
OH, RIGHT, YES. I WAS, LIKE-- I WAS, LIKE, A CALL CENTER OPERATIVE.
Stephen: YOU CALL AND SAY, "GIVE MONEY SO WE CAN SAVE THE ANIMALS?"
RIGHT. AND I WAS ON, LIKE, THE ENDANGERED SPECIES BEAT.
Stephen: "OH, SAVE US-- GIVE US MONEY NOW BECAUSE THESE THINGS COULD BE GONE"--
THESE GUYS ARE IN TROUBLE. DO IT TODAY. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN YOU'RE-- ENDANGERED SPECIES, THERE'S THE KIND OF REALLY COOL ONES, LIKE THE ELEPHANTS OR WHATEVER. BUT ANOTHER GUY HAD THOSE. AND MOST OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE LIKE A NEWT FROM ALASKA. AND A BAD BATFROM NEW ZEALAND. YEAH, NEW ZEALAND BATS! SADLY, THEY ARE NO LONGER. BUT WHEN YOU CALL SOMEONE AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I NEED MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE THESE BATS IN NEW ZEALAND." THEY SAY, "THAT SOUNDS GREAT. HOW DO WE GET RID OF THESE BATS?" NOBODY LIKES BATS!
Stephen: JUST LIE AND SAY IT'S FOR THE PANDAS.
OR MAKE UP ANIMALS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU JUST MADE UP ANIMALS?
WELL, BECAUSE I WAS GETTING SO LITTLE MONEY, AND TIFS, LIKE, COMMISSION. AND WE WERE GENUINELY TRYING TO SAVE ANIMALS. SO I WOULD-- I WOULD-- I CREATED A COUPLE OF CREATURE S.
Stephen:  LIKE WHAT? LIKE WHAT?
LIKE, FOR A WHOLE YEAR, I WAS SAVING THE SPECIES THE TIGER SWAN. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH --
Stephen: THE TIGER SWAN?
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SWAN WITH THE PLUMAGE OF A BENGAL.
Stephen: AND THEY'RE ENDANGERED?
THEY'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE, STEPHEN!
Stephen: HAS ANYONE SEEN-- EVER SEEN ONE OF THEM.
THIS IS THE THING AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, "I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT." AND, OF COURSE, THE RESPONSE S, THEY'RE REALLY RARE. OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE CALLING. WE WOULD JUST LET THEM GET ON WITH THEIR BUSINESS."
Stephen: DID IT WORK?
NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT IT WAS A GOOD YEAR. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW YOU'VE GOT THE SERIES ON EPIX, "GET SHORTY."
YES.
Stephen: THIS IS A BOOK. IT'S BEEN A MOVIE. WHAT DO WE SEE IN THE SERIES THAT-- THAT IS DIFFERENT? WHAT'S THE VALUE ADDED HERE?
WELL, I FEEL LIKE-- IT'S --
Stephen: FEEL FREE TO LIE BECAUSE I'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY TO ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
I MEAN, IT'S-- OBVIOUSLY, WE WORK FROM THE SAME KIND OF-- THE POOL OF THE BOOK, BUT TOTALLY IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE VISITING A BAR AT A DIFFERENT TIME OF THE WEEK. SO IT'S, LIKE, WITH THE MOVIE, IT'S KIND OF SLIM SLIK AND COOL AND IT'S LIKE VISITING A BAR, LIKE, 9:00 P.M. ON A SATURDAY WHERE EVERYBODY'S DRESSED REALLY WELL, AND THEY'RE USING THEIR PICKUP LINES. IN OUR SHOW IT'S, LIKE, 3:00 A.M. ON A TUESDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE KIND OF FIGHTING WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND. THE FLOOR IS STICKY. THE BAR BILL IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE, AND YOU CAN'T PAY IT. AND IT'S, LIKE ENTER SCENE. IT'S GREAT. IT'S KIND OF GRITTY AND UGLY, LIKE THE BOOK SI THINK.
Stephen: AND I THINK-- WE HAVE A CLIP HERE? WE DO NOT HAVE A CLIP.
OH, GOOD. I'LL DO IT --
Stephen: IMAGINE THIS. IMAGINE THIS! ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ON-- ON SOMEWHERE ELSE, ON A DIFFERENT SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: "GET SHORTY" PREMIERES SUNDAY ON EPIX. CHRIS O'DOWD, EVERYBODY. WHEN WE COME BACK, I'M EATING THE HOTTEST WINGS LEGALLY ALLOWABLE, WITH SEAN EVANS. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING )
FOLKS I AM A NEW FAN OF MY NEXT GUEST'S SHOW "HOT ONES." TONIGHT, I ENTER THE BELLY OF THE BEAST. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SEAN EVANS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU ON THIS SIDE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, ALL RIGHT, SEAN, JUST QUICK. JUST QUICKLY, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME HERE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PAIN TO GO THROUGH. I-- I-- I LOVE YOUR SHOW "HOT ONES," AND WHAT YOU DO ON THE SHOW IS YOU PUT YOUR GUESTS OFF BALANCE, I BELIEVE, IN A REALLY INTERESTING WAY, BY GIVING THEM INCREASINGLY SPICY FOOD AND IT BREAKS DOWN THEIR INHIBITION AND YOU GET GREAT ANSWERS OUT OF PEOPLE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU GOT GREAT RESEARCH AND YOU'RE A GREAT INTERVIEWER YOURSELF. SO I'M GOING TO HAND THIS OVER TO YOU. EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO TO THE PEOPLE OUT THERE-- I ALREADY KNOW. AND THEN LET'S GET-- LET'S BRING THE HURT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. I DON'T DESERVE THAT. THAT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE HAVE SORT OF AN ABBREVIATED VERSION. USUALLY WE DO 10 WINGS. TODAY WE'RE DOING FOUR, AND THE SAUCES ARE BY SKOVAL SCORE. THE HIGHER THE SCOVAL LEVEL THE HOTTER THE SOURCE. TODAY, VALLENTEEN AIS ABOUT 2,000. BUT 550,000 SCOVAL, 110 TIMES HOTTER THAN A JALAPENO.
Stephen: 110 TIMES HOTTER THAN A JALAPENO.
IT'S REALLY A STEEP CLIMB TODAY HERE STEPHEN.
Stephen: AND WE'RE DOING IT IN ONLY FOUR SO IT IS A STEEP CLIMB.
THE FIRST VON, VALLENTINA. CHEERS.
Stephen: NICE. SWEET.

Stephen: NOT BAD. WARM. MMM.
THAT'S A CHANGE. THAT'S A DEPARTURE FROM OURS.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE, SLIGHT CAMPFIRE QUALITY TO IT.
IT IS.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.
BESIDES BEING HANDSOME TALK SHOW HOSTS, YOU AND I SHARE SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON IN THAT WE BOTH SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN BOTH CHICAGO AND NEW YORK CITY. NEW YORK SLICE VERSUS DEEP DISH.
Stephen: OKAY, TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. I LIKE THE CRISPNESS OF A NEW YORK SLICE. THAT'S PIZZA, OKAY. CHICAGO DEEP DISH IS A BABY POOL FILLED WITH SAUCE AND CHEESE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT HAS ITS PLACE.
IT HAS ITS PLACE.
Stephen: IT HAS ITS PLACE. BUT WHEN I GO TO GIORDANO'S I WANT TO BRING A SNORKEL BECAUSE I'M GOING STRAIGHT IN.
THERE IT IS.
Stephen: SHALL WE MOVE ON?
LET'S HEAT THINGS IN A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS THE HOT ONES SAUCE. I'M COMING TO YOU FROM "HOT ONES" SHOW.
Stephen: FIERY WHIC CHIPOTLE. OH, THAT'S REALLY TASTY.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. I'M BLOWN AWAY.
Stephen: WHAT'S MY CAPSAICIN LEVEL THIS IS SEVEN TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN THAT?
AND THE NEXT ONE WE REALLY START GOING CRAZY.
Stephen: I BIT MY INNER CHEEK REALLY BADLY YESTERDAY. IS THAT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM?
I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S JUST A HURDLE YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME, STEPHEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. THIS IS WARMING UP A LITTLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: THIS IS WARMING UP A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S GOT A LITTLE OF A DELAYED KICK TO IT.
IT MIGHT BE WARM IN YOUR MOUTH. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER AND IT REALLY IS AS COLD AS EVERYBODY SIZE IT IS.
Stephen: IT'S COMEDY WEATHER.
IF SOMEBODY WERE TO START A SMALL FIRE TO WARM THEMSELVES UP AND IT TURNED INTO A BURNING INFERNO, WHAT WOULD BE THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO SAVE BEFORE THE THEATER BURNED DOWN.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD I SAVE FROM HERE?
THE ONE THING.
Stephen: THESE PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
THE NEXT ONE IS DABOMB. BEYOND INSANITY.
Stephen: DABOMB, BEYOND INSANITY. OKAY. WOE, THIS IS WHAT KIM JONG-UN IS ARMING HIS MISSILES WITH ACTUALLY.
WE'RE ALL DOOMED.
THIS IS 135,000 SCOVALS, SO HERE'S WHERE WE CRANK IT.
Stephen: OH, WOW. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S NOT FOOLING AROUND.
VERY SMOKY.
Stephen: YEAH. THIS FEELING I HAVE IN MY MOUTH RIGHT NOW IS WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS. OH! OH! ( APPLAUSE ) (BLEEP) IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, MAN. IS THIS COMMON? MY FILLINGS ARE ON FIRE.
IT'S ALL THE HOT ONES EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS?
MILK, IT MIGHT HELP YOU OUT A LITTLE BIT. PROBABLY NOT A TON. BUT STEPHEN I KNOW YOU'RE A HUGE "LORD OF THE RINGS" FANATIC. IF YOU WERE IN POIMPRESSION-- IF YOU THROUGH THE ONE RING INTO THIS, IT WOULD MELT.
TAKE A LAP. TAKE A LAP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH! OH, MAN!
STEPHEN. STEPHEN.
Stephen: OH! OH!
SO THE RING WON'T SAVE YOU NOW. WE HAVE ONE MORE HOT SAUCE TO GO. ONE MORE VEGAN NUGGET, AND YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I'M SHAKE THE BOTTLE. IT'S TRADITION TO PUT A LITTLE EXTRA DAB ON THE LAST ONE.
Stephen: GIMME, GIMME!
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
Stephen: I WANT TO.
DAB, DAB, DAB!
Stephen: (BLEEP).
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
STEPHEN! ALL RIGHT, STEPHEN, CHEERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH! OH!
SO, STEPHEN.
Stephen: YES! ASK ME A QUESTION.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT YOUR FAITH AND CATHOLICISM OVER THE YEARS.
Stephen: YES.
DO YOU OONG WHO WHATDO YOU THINK HELL IS ACTUALLY LIKE? AND DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT INVOLVE DEATH SAUCE WITH LIQUID RAGE.
Stephen: THERE WOULD BE A BOTTLE OF THAT AND NONE OF THIS AVAILABLE, I THINK. OH, MY GOD. HELL IS THE ABSENCE OF GOD'S LOVE. AND I WANT TO ASK GOD WHATEVER DITO DESERVE THIS, PLEASE FORGIVE ME. OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, (BLEEP). OH, MY GOD! SEAN, THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU CAN SEE NEW EPISODES OF "HOT ONES" ON THURSDAYS ON "FIRST WE FEAST'S" WEBSITE. SEAN EVANS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE ROBERT PATTINSON, DAVID TENNANT, AND NIECY NASH. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, JOHN BOYEGA AND JEFFREY TAMBOR. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
