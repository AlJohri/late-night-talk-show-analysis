Announcer: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING A WORKING VACATION AT HIS NEW JERSEY GOLF COURSE FOR 17 DAYS. ♪ ♪ ♪
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES LAURA DERN, LEAH REMINI AND MUSICAL GUEST TROMBONE SHORTY, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AS OF FRIDAY, DONALD TRUMP IS ON A 17-DAY VACATION AT HIS GOLF CLUB IN BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY. HE'S THERE TO RELAX AFTER MONTHS OF GRUELING GOLF AT MAR-A-LAGO. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. HE'S WORKING ON IT. BUT THE PRESIDENT SWEARS HE'S NOT TAKING IT EASY, TWEETING: "WORKING IN BEDMINSTER, N.J., AS LONG PLANNED CONSTRUCTION IS BEING DONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS NOT A VACATION -- MEETINGS AND CALLS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) MEETINGS AND CALLS! MEETING CALL -- MEETING AND CALLS! WOW! BOTH OF THEM! TRUMP HAS TO DO ALL THAT DURING HIS VACATION? MAN, I WOULD NOT WANT TO WORK FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN. ( LAUGHTER ) TOP BOSS! TOP, TOP! TOUGH TASK MASTER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OVER THE WEEKEND, FOOTAGE LEAKED OF THE PRESIDENT TAKING ONE OF HIS HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS -- A SUMMIT OF NEW JERSEY'S TOP BRIDESMAIDS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THAT'S ALSO WHAT TRUMP SAYS WHEN HE VISITS EASTERN EUROPE. "WHERE'S THE BRIDE? COME ON. COUGH HER UP. LET'S GO BLONDE THIS TIME." ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP'S BUDDY VLADIMIR PUTIN IS ALSO TAKING A BREAK. HE'S IN SIBERIA PUTTING ON A SNORKEL AND SHOOTING FISH WITH A SPEAR GUN. THOUGH HE LATER CLAIMED THE FISH WERE KILLED BY UKRAINIAN SEPARATISTS. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST WANT TO SAY, THOUGH, MR. PUTIN, FOREST CAMO DOESN'T WORK UNDER WATER. ( APPLAUSE ) THE FISH CAN SEE YOU! WHO KILLED YOUR BROTHER STAN? IT WAS AN ENTIRE FOREST WITH A SPEAR GUN! ( LAUGHTER ) I GUESS IN THAT SCENARIO IT WAS A MOTHER TALKING TO ONE FISH, AND THE FISH'S BROTHER WAS NAMED STAN IN THAT SCENARIO. OF COURSE, SINCE IT'S PUTIN, HE ALSO RELEASED PHOTOS OF HIMSELF CHILLING BY THE RIVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAN, THOSE SANCTIONS HAVE ALREADY DEVASTATED THEIR SHIRT INDUSTRY. GOTTA SAY, COMPARED TO TRUMP THAT LOOKS LIKE A VACATION. I WOULD LOVE TO GO ON A BRO-DOWN FISHING TRIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. I'LL BET IT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN THAT I'D "NEVER" COME BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, TRUMP NEEDS A VACATION BECAUSE HIS POLL NUMBERS HAVE REACHED A NEW LOW. ONLY 33% OF VOTERS APPROVE OF THE JOB HE'S DOING. 33%. AS MEATLOAF SAID, "TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD, BUT ONE OUT OF THREE SUCKS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THAT'S A FRIEND OF HIS, RIGHT? MEATLOAF IS A FRIEND OF HIS.
Jon: MEATLOAF IS A FRIEND.
Stephen: AND WITH THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATINGS PLUMMETING, SOME HAVE THEIR EYE ON TRUMP'S JOB, INCLUDING -- CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT AND DAD WHO HAS A FAVORITE MARCHING BAND, MIKE PENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE "NEW YORK TIMES" CLAIMS PENCE IS PREPARING FOR A RUN IN 2020, CITING THE FACT THAT PENCE HAS CREATED HIS OWN POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. IN FACT, TRUMP CONFIDANTE AND MAN CALLING TO HAVE YOU KILLED, ROGER STONE, TWEETED, "NO VICE PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY HAD THEIR OWN PAC LESS THAN SIX MONTHS INTO THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST TERM. HMMMM." ( LAUGHTER ) YES, HMM! NO VEEP HAS ACTED THIS SUSPICIOUSLY SINCE GROVER CLEVELAND'S VICE PRESIDENT EUSTACE P. MCBACKSTABBY. ( LAUGHTER ) PLUS, IN JUNE, PENCE SPOKE AT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT YEARLY EVENTS FOR IOWA REPUBLICANS, SENATOR JONI ERNST'S PIG ROAST. VERY IMPORTANT. THOUGH IT DOES ALIENATE ALL THE JEWISH REPUBLICANS IN IOWA. ( LAUGHTER ) NO SURPRISE PENCE IS POPULAR IN IOWA, SINCE HE IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL CHILDREN OF THE CORN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS GOOD. BUT YESTERDAY, PENCE ISSUED THIS STRONG DENIAL, "TODAY'S ARTICLE IN THE 'NEW YORK TIMES' IS DISGRACEFUL AND OFFENSIVE TO ME, MY FAMILY AND OUR ENTIRE TEAM. WHATEVER FAKE NEWS MAY COME OUR WAY, MY ENTIRE TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ALL OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND SEE HIM RE-ELECTED IN 2020. ANY SUGGESTION OTHERWISE IS BOTH LAUGHABLE AND ABSURD." YEAH, HE'S DEFINITELY RUNNING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY RUNNING, WITHOUT A DOUBT. BUT TRUMP'S NOT WORRIED. THIS MORNING HE TWEETED, "THE TRUMP BASE IS FAR BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE, DESPITE SOME PHONY FAKE NEWS POLLING, LOOK AT RALLIES IN PENN, IOWA, OHIO- ..." "...AND WEST VIRGINIA. THE FACT IS THE FAKE NEWS RUSSIAN COLLUSION STORY RECORD STOCK MARKET, BORDER SECURITY, MILITARY STRENGTH, JOBS ..." "... SUPREME COURT PICK, ECONOMIC ENTHUSIASM, DEREGULATION AND SO MUCH MORE HAVE DRIVEN THE TRUMP BASE EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER. WILL NEVER CHANGE!" DON'T JINX YOURSELF. REMINDS ME OF CUSTER'S FAMOUS SPEECH, "THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY SUCCESSFUL STANDS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND BEFORE HE UNPLUGGED, TRUMP NEEDED ONE LAST HIT OFF THE BASE, SO HE WENT TO WEST VIRGINIA TO STIR THE POPULIST POT.
MOST PEOPLE KNOW THERE WERE NO RUSSIANS IN OUR CAMPAIGN. THERE NEVER WERE. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY RUSSIANS IN WEST VIRGINIA OR OHIO OR PENNSYLVANIA? ARE THERE ANY RUSSIANS HERE TONIGHT? ANY RUSSIANS?
Stephen: OKAY, NO RUSSIANS. SO TRUMP IS REPLACING THE CIA WITH AN INFORMAL SHOW OF HANDS. "ANYBODY HERE GAY? NO? OKAY. GAY PEOPLE DON'T EXIST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MIKE PENCE WAS RIGHT." ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS TRUMP RALLY WAS NOT ABOUT "HIM."
SINCE OUR ELECTION, NOT MINE, SINCE OUR ELECTION, WE ARE WORKING EVERY SINGLE DAY TO HEED AND HONOR THE WILL OF THOSE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF VOTERS WHO CAME OUT AND VOTED FOR US. NOT FOR ME, THEY VOTED FOR US.
STEPHEN: "YES, THEY VOTED FOR "US." OKAY. SO "US" BETTER LAWYER UP BECAUSE WE'RE IN SOME DEEP DOO DOO. ." ( APPLAUSE ) SPEAKING OF DEE-DEE -- ( LAUGHTER ) FOX NEWS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE "HUFFINGTON POST" IS REPORTING THAT CO-HOST OF "THE SPECIALISTS" AND GUY WHO'S COLOGNE YOU CAN SMELL THROUGH THE TV, ERIC BOLLING, SENT COWORKERS "AN UNSOLICITED PHOTO OF MALE GENITALIA VIA TEXT MESSAGE." OH, MY GOD. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OLD FASHIONED COURTSHIP WHEN A GENTLEMAN WOULD TELEGRAPH HIS GENITALIA? "HERE IS MY PENIS. STOP." "STOP SENDING ME YOUR PENIS. STOP. SERIOUSLY, STOP. STOP." BOLLING -- ( PIANO RIFF ) -- HAS BEEN SUSPENDED WHILE FOX NEWS INVESTIGATES. BUT HE DENIES THE CHARGES. SORT OF. ACCORDING TO HIS LAWYER, "MR. BOLLING RECALLS NO SUCH INAPPROPRIATE COMMUNICATIONS." HE DOESN'T RECALL? HOW DO YOU FORGET SENDING SOMEONE YOUR BITS AND PIECES? "DID I LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON? DID I TURN OFF THE STOVE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID I LEAVE THE WATER RUNNING THE TUB? DID I SEND MULTIPLE PENIS PICS TO MY COWORKERS?" ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CALLING BOLLING A HYPOCRITE BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID ABOUT DISGRACED CONGRESSMAN, AND THE CHUCK YAGER OF (BLEEP) SNAPS ANTHONY WEINER.
HE IS A SICK HUMAN BEING TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN, CONTINUE TO GET CAUGHT, SAYING HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN, GETS CAUGHT AGAIN.
STEPHEN: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES -- IT'S EASY TO SHOW YOUR JUNK TO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I GOTTA SAY, IT'S AN APT METAPHOR. AND IT'S NOT A CRAZY METAPHOR. THIS WEEKEND, FORMER FOX CONTRIBUTOR, CAROLINE HELDMAN, ACCUSED BOLLING OF SEXUALLY HARASSING HER AS WELL, WRITING "ONCE, HE TOOK ME UP TO HIS OFFICE IN NEW YORK, SHOWED ME HIS BASEBALL JERSEYS AND, IN THE BRIEF TIME I WAS THERE, LET ME KNOW THAT HIS OFFICE WAS HIS FAVORITE PLACE TO HAVE SEX." AND KEEP IN MIND, "BOLLING'S OFFICE IS ENTIRELY MADE UP OF GLASS AND THE VIEW INTO IT IS UNOBSTRUCTED." DO NOT BRING GRANDMA ON THE FOX NEWS TOUR. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY THIS WAY. OKAY, THIS WAY. COME ON, KEEP UP, EVERYBODY. LET'S GO. KEEP UP. OKAY. "ON YOUR LEFT, THERE'S THE NEWS DESK WITH BRET BAIER. ON YOUR RIGHT, YOU'LL SEE... IS SOMEONE PRESSING A SHAVED SQUIRREL AGAINST THAT GLASS? OH GOD!" ( LAUGHTER ) SHAVED SQUIRREL... NOW, NOBODY KNOWS HOW THIS IS GOING TO END -- I KNOW -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- BUT BOLLINO DOES HAVE A FALLBACK POSITION, TELLING AN INTERVIEWER, "WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DOWN ON MY TV CAREER, THE NEXT STEP IS RUNNING FOR SENATE." SO GET READY FOR BOLLING 2018. THOUGH THE LAWN SIGNS WILL HAVE TO BE BLURRED. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ( BAND PLAYING ) LAURA DERN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I HAVE AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR MILLENNIALS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! YOU KNOW, THE BEST PART OF DOING THIS JOB IS FORMING A GENUINE CONNECTION WITH ALL MY VIEWERS... WHO ARE BETWEEN AGE 18 AND 35 WITH DISPOSABLE INCOME. ANGEL SOFT -- COMFORT WHERE YOU WANT IT. ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE YOUR BUTT. ( PIANO RIFF ) THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED MILLENNIALS-- PEOPLE BORN BETWEEN 1980 AND THE EARLY 2000S. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH EASTERN EUROPEAN WOMEN TRAPPED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THOSE ARE "MELANI-ALS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) VERY DIFFERENT. ( PIANO RIFF ) ADVERTISERS ARE DYING TO UNDERSTAND MILLENNIALS. AND I CAN HELP THEM BECAUSE I SPEAK MILLENNIAL. THIS IS -- THE "LATE SHOW'S" W.T.F. IS UP WITH MILLENNIALS, MY HOMEDOGS... SCOOTER EMOJI A.F. A.F., OF COURSE, STANDS FOR "ALSO FRIENDLY." I RECENTLY LEARNED SOME NEW MILLENNIAL SECRETS FROM THE HIPPEST NEWS SOURCE AROUND -- THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL." THE "JOURNAL," OR "WIZJOURN," AS THE KIDS CALL IT, PUBLISHED -- I THINK, RIGHT? I THINK THAT'S IT.
Jon: I CALL IT WIZJOURN, THAT'S GREAT.
Stephen: OKAY, THE WIZJOURN PUBLISH QUOTES FROM CORPORATE C.E.O.'S ABOUT WHAT THEIR RESEARCH TELLS THEM MILLENNIALS LIKE. THE FIRST ONE'S OBVIOUS. MILLENNIALS LOVE THE WORD "OLD." TURNS OUT IT WAS A COMPLIMENT WHEN THOSE TEENS CHASED ME DOWN THE STREET YELLING, "YOU SUCK, OLD MAN!" ( LAUGHTER ) AND MY C.E.O C.E.BROS HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT MILLENNIALS ARE MOVING TO THE SUBURBS AND THAT THEY LOVE GRILLING BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO CORPORATE RESEARCH, MILLENNIALS ARE OVER INDEXING ON CHARCOAL. OVERINDEXING. OKAY? LISTEN, KIDS. BE CAREFUL. CHARCOAL STARTS INNOCENTLY ENOUGH. MAYBE HIT THE SMOKY JOE ON THE WEEKENDS, NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A THREE-BAG-A-DAY KINGSFORD HABIT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY? YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: THAT CHARCOAL WILL GET YA.
SELF-LIGHTING, YOU END UP WITH SELF-LIGHTING LUNG. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. THESE PLUGGED-IN C.E.O.S KNOW MILLENNIALS TOTALLY VAPE OVER AUTHENTIC THINGS LIKE SNACKING, PETS, AND MOVIE WATCHING. ( LAUGHTER ) WOW. THAT IS SOME CUTTING EDGE MARKET RESEARCH. MY SOURCES TELL ME THAT MILLENNIALS ENJOY SEX AND OXYGEN. ( LAUGHTER ) OFTEN AT THE SAME TIME. OKAY. YEAH. IT'S CALLED THE SEX-O-BALL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) EVEN MORE MIND-BLOWING, THE C.E.O. OF HERSHEY'S DISCOVERED MILLENNIALS ARE INTERESTED IN FLAVORS AND TEXTURES. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, FLAVORS AND TEXTURES. WHICH IS WHY HERSHEY'S HAS IMMEDIATELY HALTED PRODUCTION ON LIL' BLANDIES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, OF COURSE, MILLENNIALS LOVE THE EMPLOYMENT TREND OF TEMP JOBS AND FREELANCING KNOWN AS THE GIG ECONOMY. AS ONE C.E.O. PUT IT, "IT'S A LIFESTYLE CHOICE FOR THE MILLENNIALS." YES, MILLENNIALS LOVE CHOICE. SPECIFICALLY, THE CHOICE BETWEEN STARVING AND BEING ABLE TO AFFORD FLAVORS AND TEXTURES. ( APPLAUSE ) AS A CERTIFIED LAMINATED MILLENNIAL-KNOWER, ALL THIS "RINGS TRUE." OR AS MY MILLENNIAL FRIENDS WOULD SAY, "KEEP RUNNIN', OLD MAN!" THAT'S WHY I'VE COMBINED ALL THIS ON-THE-PULSE MARKET RESEARCH INTO THE ULTIMATE MILLENNIAL PRODUCT. PRESENTING: OLD HOT DOG. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S FROM OUR HERITAGE SELECTION OF CHARCOAL-INDEXED BEEF TEXTURING, OLD HOT DOG IS SERVED ON A RECLAIMED PLANK OF SUBURBAN -- ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) OLD HOT DOG IS SERVED ON A RECLAIMED PLANK OF SUBURBAN PICKET FENCE AND IS THE PERFECT SNACK TO STRESS EAT BETWEEN GIGS ON UBER AND TASK RABBIT. ( LAUGHTER ) MM-MM-MM BRACKE ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) FLAVOR AND TEXTURE!
Jon: OH! BACK WITH LAURA DERN!
Stephen: FOLKS, YOU'VE SEEN MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IN EVERYTHING FROM "JURASSIC PARK" TO "WILD" TO "TWIN PEAKS." SHE'S NOW NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY FOR HER PERFORMANCE IN HBO'S "BIG LITTLE LIES." PLEASE WELCOME, LAURA DERN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
OH, MY GOD!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
I'M SO THRILLED TO SEE YOU AND SO STAR STRUCK. THIS IS AMAZING.
Stephen: ARE YOU KIDDING? THE FEELING IS MUTUAL, THEN.
THE REASON I CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE IN LIFE, I HAVE YOU TO WATCH AND CALM ME DOWN.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: I HAD A NICE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOU IN MAY. WE WERE BOTH INVITED TO THE MET GALA HERE, VERY FANCY THING.
AMAZING. I WAS SITTING BETWEEN YOU ON MY LEFT AND MEGYN KELLY ON MY RIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS.
YES. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS AMAZING. I WAS THRILLED BY OUR TABLE. WE HAD THE AMAZING JOHN KERN TO OUR LEFT AND AS PEOPLE WERE COMING UP TALKING ABOUT SELFIES AND FASHION AND ISN'T IT AMAZING AND SO GORGEOUS, I REMEMBER WE ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT PSORIASIS, WHICH I REALLY ENJOYED. IT SOMEHOW BECAME OUR TABLE CONVERSATION, I WAS, LIKE, IT'S REAL LIFE.
Stephen: EVERYBODY IS DOING IT NOW. EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT PSORIASIS THESE DAYS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU HAVE A VERY BUSY YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE TIME TO GO TO DINNERS BECAUSE "BIG LITTLE LIES," "TWIN PEAKS," YOU'RE IN THE UPCOMING "STAR WARS" MOVIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M EXCITED, TOO.
Stephen: ONE OF THE INCREDIBLE THINGS ABOUT YOU IS -- I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN OF YOUR WORK SINCE PROBABLY BLUE VELVET WAS THE THING I SAW YOU IN 1986.
YEAH ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CITIZEN RUTH, YOU'RE PLAYING A HUFFER.
THAT WAS TYPE CASTING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW DO YOU AVOID BEING TYPE CAST? WHAT'S YOUR TRICK?
I THINK BEING RAISED BY ACTORS. BOTH MY PARENTS ARE ACTORS AND MY FATHER BRUCE STERN WHO STARTED BEING KNOWN AS THE BAD GUY IN WESTERNS.
Stephen: YEAH, COWBOYS. YEAH, AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID, MY PARENTS SAID IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ACTOR, BE A CHAMELEON, TRY DIFFERENT THINGS. AND THEY LOVED PLAYING FLAWED PEOPLE TO CAUSE EMPATHY FOR HUMAN BEHAVIOR, AND I LIKE TO SHAKE IT UP.
Stephen: YOUR FIRST FOR MARTIN SCORSESE, WHAT DID HE HAVE YOU DO?
HE HAD ME EAT AN ICE CREAM CONE. WE DID 17 TAKES. IT WAS FOR THE FULL "ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE." MY MOM WAS, YOU WILL NEVER BE AN ACTRESS, TELLING ME IT'S NOT THE EASIEST JOB, IT'S COMPLICATED FOR WOMEN, I HEARD ALL THESE THINGS AND SCORSESE WALKED OVER AND SAID, THAT CUD JUST ATE 17 ICE CREAM CONES AND DIDN'T THROW UP, SHE'S GOT TO BE AN ACTOR. I WAS, LIKE, THANK YOU, MR. SCORSESE! SO THAT WAS GOOD. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, YOUR MOM DISCOURAGED YOU TO BE A AN ACTRESS. WHEN DID SHE GIVE IN?
I THINK I WAS SO DETERMINED. MY DAUGHTER IS IN THE DRESSING ROOM, DON'T GET ANY IDEAS. AROUND MY DAUGHTER'S AGE, 11, 12, I BECAME FAR MORE VIGILANT.
Stephen: 15, YOU BECAME EMANCIPATED? I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT TERM MEANS.
WHICH CAN MEAN MANY THINGS.
Stephen: FROM YOUR PARENTS. IN MY CASE, IT WAS SOMEWHAT BORING. I WAS WORKING ON FILMS AND, THEREFORE, I COULD NOT DO AS MUCH SCHOOL HOURS AND WORK LONGER HOURS.
Stephen: IS THERE A REGAL PROCESS WHERE YOU BECOME EMANCIPATED?
YEAH, I SHOULD HAVE USED IT MUCH TO MY ADVANTAGE AND DIDN'T.
Stephen: SO COULD YOU, LIKE, TAKE A PART WITHOUT GETTING YOUR PARENTS' PERMISSION AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
IN THEORY. I BASICALLY WAS DEEMED A REBEL WITH NO REBELLIOUS BONE IN MY BODY.
Stephen: DID YOU THROW IT IN YOUR MOM'S FACE AND SAY, YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO, I'M EMANCIPATED?
ONLY NOW THAT I'M IN MY '40s. SHE'S, LIKE, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING -- I SAY, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT WHEN I WAS 16. YOU WASTED IT.
Stephen: YOU PLAY VICE ADMIRAL HOLDO. YOU HAVE PINK-PURPLE HAIR AND A MATCHING DRESS.
YES.
Stephen: CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT VICE ADMIRAL HOLDO?
I CAN TELL YOU I LOVE HER.
Stephen: IS SHE A GOOD GUY, A BAD GUY?
COMPLICATED.
Stephen: SHE IS COMPLICATED. ( LAUGHTER )
I TOLD YOU I LIKE COMPLICATED CHARACTERS EVEN IN "STAR WARS."
Stephen: IS IT LIKE "STAR WARS" THE FORCE?
IT'S GOING TO UNFOLD. ( LAUGHTER ) I WILL TELL YOU, TO BE AN ACTOR MY WHOLE LIFE BUT FIRST A KID WHO LOVED MOVIES AND WALK ON A SET, YOUR COSTUME IS READY, YOU'RE MICKED, YOU'RE LEARNING YOUR LINES, THE CAMERA IS ROLLING, YOU OPEN YOUR EYES TO DO A SCENE LIKE ANY OTHER WORKDAY, AND IT'S "STAR WARS" -- I COULD CRY. LITERALLY, LIKE, OH, MY GOD, THAT'S R2D2. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO PASS OUT. IT'S THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED. IT'S AMAZING.
Stephen: I WOULD DO THE SAME THING. ( APPLAUSE )
SO INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: IN CASE ANYBODY WANTS TO ASK ME, I WOULD DO THE SAME THING. BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A FAN AND THE WORLD IS SO IMMERSIVE, DO YOU EVER, LIKE, FORGET YOU'RE DOING A MOVIE? DO YOU EVER GO, LIKE, TOURIST OR ANYTHING IN YOUR OWN JOB?
NO. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE MOST EMBARGOS STORY ONLY BECAUSE RYAN JOHNSON OUR DIRECTOR EMBARRASSED MY BY TELLING IT A FEW DAYS AGO. I DIDN'T KNOW I DID IT AND I GUESS THEY WERE WATCHING DAILIYS AND RECOGNIZED IT DEEPLY. THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW, I GET TO HAVE A SPACE WEAPON IN MY HAND.
Stephen: A BLASTER. AND, I GUESS, DIDN'T REAL I WAS BACK IN MY BEDROOM EIGHT YEARS OLD DOING THE SCENE AND I WENT, PEW! PEW! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THEY'D TAKEN THE SOUND OUT. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HEAR THAT IN THE MOVIE, HOPEFULLY.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING, PEW, PEW!
I WAS SO EXCITED! ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IT'S "STAR WARS"!
Stephen: THAT'S THE MOST ADORABLE THING I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, LESS ADORABLE. "BIG LITTLE LIES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CONGRATULATIONS, NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY THIS YEAR.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE.
YES.
Stephen: LET'S HIT THE PARTIES TOGETHER.
LET'S DO IT. I CAN'T WAIT.
Stephen: NOW, WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. RENATA IS A FIGHTER AND FIGHTS FOR HER KIDS. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SCENE WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE?
SHE IS TEACHING HER DAUGHTER ABOUT VOICE AND NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO BE BULLIED BUT UNFORTUNATELY DOES IT IN COMPLICATED WAYS BECAUSE I PLAY COMPLICATED CHARACTERS.
Stephen: SHE'S USING THE FORCE. JIM?
OH, MY GOD! SOMEONE IS BITING OUR DAUGHTER! OH, MY GOD. OKAY. HONEY, MOMMY IS GETTING VERY UPSET. I'M GETTING VERY, VERY UPSET BECAUSE SOMEONE IS BULLYING YOU, AND YOU NEVER LET A BULLY WIN. DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP, EMMA BELA! YOU HAVE TO BE A BIG GIRL AND USE YOUR VOICE IN THIS WORLD! THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME A BULLDOG BECAUSE I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO FIGHT BACK WITH A BULLY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: VERY COMPLICATED. YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
I'M SO THRILLED TO BE HERE.
Stephen: IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
OH, MY GOD. AMAZING TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: "BIG LITTLE LIES" IS AVAILABLE ON HBO. LAURA DERN, EVERYBODY. BACK WITH LEAH REMINI. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST STARRED FOR NINE YEARS ON "KING OF QUEENS." SHE'S NOW CREATED A DOCUMENTARY SERIES COVERING HER FALLOUT WITH THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY. PLEASE WELCOME, LEAH REMINI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL DRESS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE SUCH A GENTLEMAN.
Stephen: AM I? YOU WALKED ME, HELD MY HAND THE WHOLE WAY, VERY NICE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE HIGH HEELS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SNAP AN ANKLE. WE DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.
YOUR WIFE TAUGHT YOUR WELL.
Stephen: MY WIFE SAID BEFORE, WHEN YOUR FEMALE GUEST SITS, JUST LIKE IN PUBLIC.
WAS I NOT WRONG SHE TRAINED YOU?
Stephen: IF YOU'RE SAYING SOMETHING POS THETIVE ABOUT MY WIFE, YOU'RE NEVER WRONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND NOW -- AND NOW YOU WILL GET LAID FOR SAYING THAT.
Stephen: WE'LL SEE. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'VE GOT TWO EMMY NOMINATIONS FOR THIS DOCUMENTARY SERIES DOING A&E FOR SEASON ONE, SCIENTOLOGY AND THE AFTERMATH, LEAH REMINI. THIS IS YOUR FIRST EMMY NOMINATION, RIGHT IS THIS.
YES.
Stephen: AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, YOUR FIRST ONE. YOU DIDN'T GET ONE FOR PLAYING THE HOT WIFE OF THE DOUGHY GUY ALL THOSE YEARS?
NO, AND I LOVE HIS DOUGH.
Stephen: OF COURSE! ( LAUGHTER ) NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT SEASON 2 OF "SCIENTOLOGY AND THE AFTERMATH." STARTS TUESDAY AUGUST 15 ON THE A&E. YOU WERE IN THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY FOR 35 YEARS. IS THE CHURCH COOL WITH YOU DOING THIS DOCUMENTARY? ( LAUGHTER )
NO.
Stephen: NO, THEY'RE NOT. WERE YOU SURPRISED HOW UNCOOL THEY ARE WITH IT?
WELL, I KNEW THE POLICIES OF SCIENTOLOGY. SCIENTOLOGY HAS POLICIES, YOU KNOW, THE WRITINGS OF EL RON HE  HUBBARD THAT ARE FOLLOWED TO THE T. EVERYTHING IN SCIENTOLOGY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO THE T.
Stephen: I LOVE THE TERMINOLOGY. KSW, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING.
YOU MUST HAVE LOVED IT.
Stephen: WHAT O.T. LEVEL DID YOU REACH?
5.
Stephen: IS THAT GOOD? YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT? IT MEANT I HAD CLEARED ALL MY BEINGS THAT ARE ATTACHED TO MY BODY FROM SICKNESS, THAT I CURED MYSELF OF ALL ILLNESS.
Stephen: AND DID THAT ACTUALLY WORK?
NO.
Stephen: YOU DID NOT GET ILL?
YES, WE ALL GET ILL.
Stephen: DID YOU GET ILL LESS THAN OTHER PEOPLE?
NO, BUT YOU BELIEVE IT. YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE.
Stephen: WAS THERE A VALUE FOR THAT?
NOT FOR THAT. BUT IN THE BEGINNING, YOU KNOW, SCIENTOLOGY TEACHES VERY BASIC MORALS AND CONCEPTS, TEACHES YOU THINGS LIKE HOW TO CO'D DO YOUR FINANCES, THOUSAND COMMUNICATE BETTER -- HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETTER, NOT THAT I ACHIEVED THAT TOTALLY. IT'S VERY SMALL THINGS THAT ARE HELPFUL IN THE BEGINNING, BUT AS YOU GET FURTHER INDOCTRINATED YOU CAN'T GET OUT WITHOUT HARM TO YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY AND IF YOU GET OUT IT'S THEIR POLICY TO ATTACK.
Stephen: DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S A RELIGIONS OR NOT.
NO.
Stephen: BECAUSE A SYSTEM OF THOUGHT EVEN IF DESTRUCTIVE IN SOME PEOPLE'S EYES, HOW IS THAT LESS OF A RELIGION THAN, I DON'T KNOW, MY BELIEF IN ANGELS?
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE OR NOT BELIEVE IN ANGELS. ALSO, SCIENTOLOGY IS A BUSINESS. YOU HAVE TO PE TO BAY BEFORE --  HAVE TO PAY BEFORE YOU GO UP THE CHART OF SCIENTOLOGY. BY THE END OF THE SCIENTOLOGY BRIDGE YOU'RE IN IT FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN OUT?
ABOUT FIVE YEARS.
Stephen: ARE YOU SHOPPING FOR A NEW RELIGION.
I'M NOT SHOPPING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT? AGAIN, I HAVE ISSUE WITH CALLING IT FOR ANOTHER RELIGION.
Stephen: ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR RELIGION NOW? CAN I INTEREST YOU? YOU WERE CATHOLIC?
I HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED CATHOLIC AND I BAPTIZED MY DAUGHTER CATHOLIC.
Stephen: CAN YOU BE CATHOLIC AND THE SCIENTOLOGIST AT THE SAME TIME?
THEY SAY YOU CAN BUT THAT'S A LIE. WHEN YOU GET UP THE LADDER THAT COSTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS YOU FIND OUT GOD IS A LIE TO SCIENTOLOGIST.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
THEY SAY GOD IS A LIE.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU BELIEVE THE TECH IS COMING FROM?
L. RON HUBBARD.
Stephen: IS HE DEAD? IN SCIENTOLOGIST'S MINDS HIS BODY IS DEAD.
Stephen: WHERE IS THE REST? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I MEAN, ANGELS -- DON'T CONTINUE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE SAME CATEGORY. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. HAVE YOU SEEN "1984"?
Stephen: YEAH. WOULD YOU CALL THAT A RELIGION?
Stephen: NO, THAT'S A FASCIST REGIME THAT CRUSHES THE FACE OF A MAN FOREVER UNDERNEATH THE HOBNAIL BOOT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S DESCRIBED AS, YEAH.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: OKAY. SO --
I MEAN, THE STORIES THAT WE TELL ARE OF PEOPLE'S REAL PAIN, THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE GOING ON OUR PROGRAM TO GAIN NOTORIETY OR FAME. THESE ARE PEOPLE GOING UP, APPEARING ON OUR SHOW, KNOWING THEY WILL BE SHUNNED AND ATTACKED. WITHIN HOURS OF OUR SHOW AIRING, PEOPLE HAVE HATE WEB SITES BUILT ON THEM FROM SCIENTOLOGY. DO YOU KNOW ANOTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION THAT DOES THAT.
Stephen:?
Stephen: AM ILL GOING TO HAVE A HATE WEB SITE FOR HAVING YOU ON?
A LITTLE BIT, YOU'RE TOWING THE LINE A LITTLE BIT IS THAT WHY?
YOU'RE SAYING, WELL, IS IT LIKE OTHER FAITHS, IS IT -- SO YOU COULD BE KIND OF FORGIVEN BUT UNLESS YOU MAKE AN ACTUAL STATEMENT.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF STATEMENT? WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY? ( LAUGHTER ) PROS ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS VERY EXCITING. NEXT SEASON, YOU'RE BACK WITH KEVIN JAMES ON "KEVIN CAN WAIT."
YES.
Stephen: DOING WHAT? AGAIN, THEY'RE GOING WHY IS THE PRETTY GIRL WITH --
NO, NO -- ( LAUGHTER ) AT THE END OF THE FIRST SEASON, I PLAYED HIS EX-PARTNER, WE WERE COPS TOGETHER, AND I COME BACK AS THAT CHARACTER.
Stephen: YOU CAME BACK LAST YEAR AND PEOPLE LOVED IT.
I LOVE THAT.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER THINK BECAUSE OF PEOPLE IN YOUR FORMER NOT A FAITH, IS THERE A FEAR ABOUT LEAVING SCIENTOLOGY THAT YOU WON'T WORK AGAIN?
NO, I FELT IT WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE. I ALWAYS FELT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ME PEOPLE WERE SCARED OF BECAUSE I WAS IN THE ORGANIZATION. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I LEFT AND I WAS CLOSE TO PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS, THEY SAID, WHEN THEY FELT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW YOU WERE IN THIS CULT, HOW SOMEBODY SO NOT CULTISH WOULD WANT TO -- THEY NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW I COULD BE IN IT BUT I WAS IN IT AS A CHILD. A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE WERE BROUGHT IN AS CHILDREN AND DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. I FEEL JUST THE OPPOSITE. I HAVE BEEN EMBRACED BY HOLLYWOOD, I HAVE BEEN EMBRACE BID OUR AUDIENCE AND SO HAVE OUR CONTRIBUTORS AND FOR THAT WE ARE SO GRATEFUL.
Stephen: LOVE TO MEET YOU. SEASON 2 OF "SCIENTOLOGY AND THE AFTERMATH" PREMIERINGS NEXT TUESDAY ON A &A. AND SHE'LL BE BACK THIS FALL ON CBS' "KEVIN CAN WAIT." LEAH REMINI, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY TROMBONE SHORTY. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
