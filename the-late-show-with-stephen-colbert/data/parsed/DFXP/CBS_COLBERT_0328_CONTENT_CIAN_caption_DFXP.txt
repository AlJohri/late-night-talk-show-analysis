THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD LEGALIZE MARIJUANA USE FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES NEXT YEAR.
AND NOW A SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM THE CANADIAN ROYAL MOUNTED POLICE.
GOOD DAY. IT'S TRUE THAT MARIJUANA WILL SOON BE LEGAL IN CANADA, SO I JUST WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO ALL AMERICANS -- BE COOL. WE CAN'T HAVE YOU RUSHIN' THE BORDER FOR OUR LEGAL WEED OR PRIMO STICKY ICKY WHICH IS YOUR MAPLE SYRUP. AND THIS WILL INCLUDE EVERY STRAIN OF CANADIAN MARIJUANA, INCLUDING JUSTIN BOO BLAZE, SAC CASH WAN, THE DANK, DRAKE AND BAKE, CELINE DEBONG, THE GRASSY LET'S GET HIGH. CANADIAN BACON, ALEX TOBEK, TO RANTO MAPLE LEAVES AND I'M GOING TO ENJOY CANADA'S SOON TO BE LEGAL MARIJUANA IN THE MOST CANADIAN WAY POSSIBLE.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WE CANNENS ELIZABETH MOSS, ANTHONY ATAMANIK AND MUSICAL GUEST SHERYL CROW, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HOW ARE YA?! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I REALLY GOT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WELCOME YOU JUST GAVE US JUST NOW BECAUSE I NEED IT. I KIND OF -- I NEED A LITTLE SOMETHING TO HOLD ME TOGETHER BECAUSE I'M STILL REELING FROM THE ROSS OF BILL PLANTE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ROCKIN' AND A ROLLIN' ♪
Stephen: THIS IS REELING, RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) THANK YOU! ALL OF THAT IS AVAILABLE ON MY EXERCISE TAPE. BUT LET'S GET SERIOUS PHO FOR A MOMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO STOP RIGHT NOW AND JUST WELCOME ANY ORPHAN BILL PLANTE VIEWERS TO THE SHOW TONIGHT. WELCOME. I KNOW THIS IS A CONFUSING TIME FOR YOU. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. NOT AS MUCH AS WOMEN WHO'VE WORKED FOR HIM, BUT A LOT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE'S LEAVING. I MEAN, AS THE SIGN OUTSIDE FOX NEWS BUILDING SAYS, "NOBODY MOVES THIS MAN." NOBODY! EXCEPT FOR THE JANITOR WHO SCRAPED HIM DOWN THIS MORNING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, BILL'S BROADCASTING CAREER MAY HAVE A HIT OF HICCUP BEFORE IT EXPLODED IN A HAIL OF BLOOD AND BONE, BUT HE STILL HAS HIS BOOKS, AND HIS RAGE, AND HIS FOX NEWS PAYOUT WORTH $25 MILLION. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THAT'S TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY PAID HIS ACCUSERS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? BILL O'REILLY SEXUALLY HARASSED HIMSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) GUESS SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TOUCH IT.
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! ( APPLAUSE ) CALM DOWN!
Stephen: NO, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, NO! SO WHAT'S BILL O'REILLY GOING TO DO NOW? FOR A LITTLE HINT, I DECIDED TO TURN TO HIS 1998 NOVEL, "THOSE WHO TRESPASS." WHICH, I NOTICE, IS DEDICATED TO "THE WOMEN IN HIS LIFE." THIS IS TRUE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) OR AS THEY'RE AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN, "THE PLAINTIFFS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AND AGAIN, WE'RE NOT MAKING THIS UP. HE ACTUALLY WROTE THIS BOOK. IT'S A NOVEL. THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS NOVEL IS A BRASH T.V. JOURNALIST NAMED SHANNON MICHAELS, WHO IS FIRED FROM HIS NETWORK NEWS JOB. AND IN THIS SECTION, O'REILLY EXPLAINS HOW HE HANDLES IT. "HIS CAREER WAS THE SOURCE OF HIS FEELINGS OF OMNIPOTENCE AND GRANDIOSITY. HIS TV JOB GAVE HIM DAILY EGO GRATIFICATION AND EXCITEMENT. IT REINFORCED HIS OPINION THAT HE WAS A VERY SPECIAL HUMAN BEING. HE GOT THE ATTENTION HE CRAVED, THE ADMIRATION OF THOUSANDS. BEING ON T.V. WAS LIKE A DRUG TO HIM, AND WHEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM, HE HAD TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE DRUG: PLANNING AND CARRYING OUT THE EXECUTIONS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD HUMILIATED HIM." ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Jon: WHOA... WHOA... ( PIANO RIFF ) WATCH YOURSELF OUT HERE. CAT'S GOTTA WATCH IT. ( PIANO RIFF ) BILL... BUDDY... HELLO, HANDSOME. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT: I NEVER HUMILIATED YOU! OKAY? I KNOW FOR TEN YEARS I DID THAT SHOW ON COMEDY CENTRAL. I KNOW THE CHARACTER WAS NAMED "STEPHEN COLBERT," BUT I DIDN'T EVEN PLAY HIM. I THINK STEVE CARELL DID. HE'S SO GOOD.
Jon: IT'S CARELL.
Stephen: OSCAR LONG OVERDUE FOR CARELL ON THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, HE USED TO LAUGH AT YOU. IT'S PAYBACK TIME-- RUN, STEVE. OF COURSE, BILL MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN NOW BECAUSE KIM JONG UN MIGHT BE DRAGGING US INTO THERMO-NUCLEAR CONFLICT. AND FACED WITH THE POSSIBLE ANNIHILATION OF ALL LIVING THINGS, PRESIDENT TRUMP MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE JOINT CHIEFS, THE HEAD OF THE C.I.A., THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE. I'M JUST KIDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE MET WITH SARAH PALIN, KID ROCK, AND TED NUGENT. ( LAUGHTER ) YES! GIVEN THE SOLEMNITY OF THE OCCASION, IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE NUGE IS WEARING HIS FORMAL CAMO HUNTING HAT. ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER THE PICTURE, NUGENT HUNTED REINCE PRIEBUS WITH A CROSSBOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY ALSO STOPPED BY THE OFFICIAL PORTRAIT OF HILLARY CLINTON, WHERE NUGENT GAVE A SARCASTIC THUMBS UP, AND SARAH PALIN DID THE OLD POINT-AND-SNEER. YOU KNOW SOMETHING WEIRD'S GOING ON WHEN KID ROCK IS THE DIGNIFIED ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF KID ROCK, HAPPY 4/20. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) APRIL 20. 4/20. DON'T HAVE TO ASK YOU. ANYONE HERE SMOKE A LITTLE MARIJUANA TODAY? ( CHEERING ) BUSTED! YOU FOOLS! THIS WHOLE SHOW IS A STING OPERATION. OKAY, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR TRUSTING SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) UNDER "NARC" IN THE DICTIONARY, IT'S A PICTURE OF THIS GUY.
Jon: YOU SEE? IT'S A STING!
Stephen: CBS NEWS, BEST NEWS THERE IS. THIS MORNING, A CBS NEWS POLL REVEALED THAT 61% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT MARIJUANA USE BEING LEGAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MM-HMM. MM-HMM. THAT NUMBER, LIKE THE SUPPORTERS, IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. AND TODAY, MARIJUANA ACTIVISTS PASSED OUT THOUSANDS OF JOINTS TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS NEAR CAPITOL HILL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, I WILL SAY, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I'M NOT SURE THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT. IF CONGRESS SPARKS UP, AT LEAST THEY'LL FINALLY BE PASSING SOMETHING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AND, AS ALWAYS, COLORADO IS LEADING THE CELEBRATION OF 4/20, BECAUSE, TODAY, THEY OPENED THE COUNTRY'S FIRST DRIVE-THROUGH MARIJUANA SHOP-- WHERE THEY ALWAYS ASK, "WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET FRIED WITH THAT?" ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S CALLED "THE TUMBLEWEED EXPRESS!" GET IT? "WEED," AS IN MARIJUANA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND "TUMBLE," AS IN "TUMBLE INTO THE CANYON 'CAUSE YOU'RE DRIVING HIGH." ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TO 4/20, THERE'S NO BIGGER ENTHUSIAST OF THIS SACRED DAY THAN MY INTERN, STONEY VON DANKINGTON. SAY HI TO STONEY, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HAPPY HOLIDAY, STEPHEN!
STEPHEN: STONEY, THIS MUST BE AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT, STEPHEN. EVERY YEAR ON APRIL 20, ME AND MY BUDS GET TOGETHER IN MY BASEMENT, SIT DOWN ON MY COUCH, AND CELEBRATE THE 1836 CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION THAT CREATED WISCONSIN, HAIL TO THE CHEESE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: STONEY, THAT'S WORTH CELEBRATING BUT NOT WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE SIGNIFICANT ABOUT 4/20?
OH, MOST DEF, STEF! BECAUSE TONIGHT, ME AND MY BUDS LIE ON A HILLSIDE, STARING UP AT THE STARS, AND CELEBRATE GEORGE TAKEI'S BIRTHDAY. LIVE LONG AND PROSPER, SULU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE FEEL THE SAME WAY, LIVE LONG AND PROSPER, GEORGE TAKEI. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT 4/20 THAT'S SIGNIFICANT TO YOU?
WELL, EVERY YEAR ON THIS DAY WE HAVE THE EXACT SAME CONVERSATION.
STEPHEN: REALLY? WE DO?
I THINK SO. I'M NOT SURE. I'M HIGH AS HELL RIGHT NOW. IT'S 4/20, MAN!
STEPHEN: STONEY VON DANKINGTON, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ELIZABETH MOSS IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL HAVE THE LATEST PROCLAMATIONS FROM A HAT. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S AMAZING! JON, GOOD TO SEE YA. HAPPY 4/20, BUT I KNOW THAT'S NOT IN YOUR MIX.
Jon: I DON'T MESS WITH THAT. I DON'T MESS WITH IT.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
Jon: I'M HIGH OFF THE MUSIC!
Stephen: GOOD FOR YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS THE HOST OF A TALK SHOW, I WIELD ENORMOUS POWER. BUT AS POWERFUL AS I AM, THERE ARE THOSE EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN I. HISTORY'S MOST MERCILESS DESPOTS, LIKE GENGHIS KHAN, VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND JARED LETO. ( LAUGHTER ) DEFY HIS RULE, AND HE WILL IMPALE  YOU ON HIS CHEEKBONES. ALL OF US HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON: AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR, AND A BIG FURRY HAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( DRUM CADENCE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MY HEAD, ANY PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. ( DRUM BEAT ) HENCEFORTH: TOTE BAGS WILL JUST BE CALLED "BAGS." ALL BAGS TOTE. I DON'T COME TO WORK IN A "DRIVING CAR." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, ANYONE WHO EATS WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN MUST ALSO DRINK WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS OF NOW, MULTITASKING SHALL BE CALLED BY ITS TRUE NAME: "DOING MULTIPLE THINGS BADLY." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ALL DOGS ARE OFFICIALLY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS. WE DON'T LET THEM LIVE WITH US BECAUSE THEY PAY RENT. ( APPLAUSE ) HEAR MY VOICE: IF YOU EAT AN ICE CREAM SUNDAE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE, IT IS NOW AN ICE CREAM MONDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HEREAFTER, IF YOU SWIPE LEFT ON SOMEONE ON TINDER, YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH TEN PEOPLE WHO SWIPED LEFT ON YOU. BECAUSE, YOU'RE SUCH A CATCH? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO IT IS WRITTEN, SO LET IT BE DONE -- ANYONE WHO GETS PRETENTIOUS ABOUT LISTENING TO MUSIC ON VINYL MUST ALSO USE A ROTARY PHONE AND NO PENICILLIN FOR YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FROM NOW UNTIL THE LIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE IS EXTINGUISHED: ALL YOGA CLASSES WILL PLAY SOUNDTRACKS WITH AMBIENT FARTING NOISES, SO WE NEVER KNOW WHO IN THE CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BE IT DECREED: IN-FLIGHT MAGAZINES MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE ARTICLE THAT I'D WANT TO READ ON THE GROUND. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ANYONE WHO SAYS "AWWWWKWARD" WILL BE "MURRRRDERED." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FROM THIS INSTANT, BEING RELATE TO DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT QUALIFY YOU FOR A GOVERNMENT JOB. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NEITHER DOES BEING DONALD TRUMP. THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ELIZABETH MOSS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"! FOLKS, YOU HAVE BINGE-WATCHED MY FIRST GUEST ON "MAD MEN" AND "THE WEST WING." SHE NOW STARS IN "THE HANDMAID'S TALE." PLEASE WELCOME ELISABETH MOSS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOUR SHOES ARE FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THOSE ARE REALLY AMAZING. ARE THOSE STREET LEGAL, THOSE SHOES?
I HOPE SO.
Stephen: ARE THOSE JUST FOR TV OR ARE YOU WEARING THOSE AROUND TOWN, TOO?
THESE ARE FOR TV. I WAS WEARING UGGS BACKSTAGE AND WILL BE IN A FEW MINUTES.
Stephen: I LOVE HAVING PEOPLE ON THE SHOW BUT WHEN MY NIGHT IS OVER, THEY PUT ME UNDER THE DESK. I STAY HERE. PEOPLE LIKE MOVIE STARS AND WHO DO EPISODIC TV, THEY DO JUNK ET CETERA OF PRESS, THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WEREN'T SOMEPLACE APPROPRIATING SOMETHING? THAT'S PART OF THE GIG.
ALSO. A FEW WEEKS AGO, ME AND MY BEST FRIEND HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO HAWAII WHICH IS THE FIRST VACATION WE'VE HAD IN A WHILE AND WE HAD FIVE DAYS.
Stephen: WHICH ISLAND? MAUI. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YEAH, MAUI, WOO-HOO!
Stephen: WELL, IT'S 4/20. THIS IS THE BEST AUDIENCE EITHER ONE OF US WILL EVER HAVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO? JUST LIE ON THE BEACH?
WE HAD FIVE PRECIOUS DAYS AND WE INTENDED TO SOAK UP AS MUCH DUNN AS POSSIBLE AND SIT BY THE POOL EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEN ONE DAY IT POURED ALL DAY, AND WE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS RAINING. WE WERE IN FULL DENIEVMENT WE WENT TO THE POOL AS IF NOTHING WAS HAPPENING, YOU KNOW, PUT OUR BAGS DOWN, WE HAD OUR UMBRELLAS. WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY SITTING IN THE RAIN, BUT WE JUST READ OUR BOOKS, TALKED, DRANK, WENT IN THE.
Jon: COUPSY, FULL DENIAL BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO GIVE UP TO THE RAIN.
Stephen: COCKTAILS GO WELL WITH DENIAL. THEY REALLY DO. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF A COUPLE OF ICONIC SHOWS. YOU WERE PEGGY ON "MAD MEN " , ZOE ON" THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER "ON WEST WING. YOU WERE A CHILD ACTRESS.
YES.
Stephen: YOU SEEM LIKE A PERFECTLY NORMAL AND WELL-ADJUSTED PERSON. BUT THE STEREOTYPE ISN'T THAT.
YEAH, I WASN'T FAMOUS FOR A LONG TIME.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU DID "MAD MEN"?
23.
Stephen: YOU SEEM YOUNGER. THANK YOU. 17 FOR WEST WING. I WASN'T A CHILD STAR SO I DIDN'T FALL INTO ANY OF THE TRAPPINGS. I TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT WAS MY JOB.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED?
5 OR 6.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL? DID YOU GO TO NORMAL SCHOOL?
NO, MY FAMILY WAS ALL MUSICIANS, SO -- YEAH.
Stephen: OH. HI, GUYS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH, VERY NICE. VERY NICE.
EDUCATION? YEAH, SO, NO, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET UP AND TAKE ME TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHAT TIME DID THEY WANT TO GET UP?
ONE, ONE-ISH. EVERYONE WAS UP LATE, YOU GET IT. THAT'S JUST HOW LIFE IS. AND IT SCREWED ME NOW BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY FOR WORK ALL THE TIME AND I DON'T WANT TO.
Stephen: SO DID YOUR PARENTS TEACH YOU?
NO, I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO DOESN'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT IN MY FAMILY.
Stephen: THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PASS THEIR LIFESTYLE ON TO YOU?
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ALGEBRA, DID THEY TEACH YOU THAT STUFF?
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK THIS, BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW TO READ? ( LAUGHTER ) OR ARE YOUR SCRIPTS GIVEN TO YOU IN PICTOGRAPHS? AND THE BAD MEN WILL START HITTING ON YOU AND SMOKING -- ( LAUGHTER )
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. I DO KNOW HOW TO READ, RELATIVELY I GUESS.
Stephen: NO DOUBT. YEAH, YEAH. ( APPLAUSE )
YEAH. I'M VERY PROUD.
Stephen: YOU HAVE AN R RIGHT THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: FOR READIN', FOR ARITHMETIC. YOU WERE A DANCER, TOO.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T YOU STAKE WITH THE DANCING?
I WAS A BALLET DANCER FROM 5 TO 15. I SAT DOWN WITH MY MOM AT 15 AND WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. I HAD TO DECIDE WHICH ONE I WAS GOING TO DO.
Stephen: AT 15. YEAH, BECAUSE IN BALLET THAT'S A TURNING POINT WHERE YOU GO PRO.
Stephen: DO YOU SPIN THE CACOON AT THAT POINT AND YOU COME OUT LATER AND YOUR TOES ARE ALL CURLED? ( LAUGHTER ) DID YOU GO ON POINT AND ALL THAT STUFF?
YEAH, I WENT UP ON POINT. BALLET IS A VERY TOUGH WORLD, A BEAUTIFUL WORLD.
Stephen: I SAW BLACK SWAN, I KNOW. ( LAUGHTER )
YEAH, IT'S NOT ALL LIKE THAT, BUT --
Stephen: STAB EACH OTHER. YEAH, GRATEFUL.
Stephen: GOT THE FEATHERS. YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS LIKE, AND MY MOM WAS, LIKE, YOU DON'T WANT THAT. MY MOM WAS, LIKE, HELL NO.
Stephen: AND DANCERS ARE LIKE BEING AN ATHLETE.
THEY EAR SO ATHLETIC AND STRONG.
Stephen: YOU WOULD BE AT THE END OF YOUR CAREER NOW.
YES, I'M 34. IF I WAS SUCCESSFUL AND NOT INJURED, I WOULD BE DONE SOON. I'M 34 AND I'M STARTING A NEW CHAPTER WITH A NEW SHOW AND IT DOESN'T FEEL I'M DONE YET.
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. "THE HANDMAID'S TALE" IS GETTING GREAT REVIEWS, BASED ON A 1985 FUTURIST NOVEL BY MARGARET ATWOOD, WHO IS A GREAT WRITER ( APPLAUSE ) AND FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE NOT READING FUTURISTIC NOVELS IN '85 LIKE I WAS, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS I IN "THE HANDMAID' TALE."
YES. IT'S ABOUT, IN AMERICA, A TOTALITARIAN, RIGHT-WING FUNDAMENTALIST REGIME -- ( LAUGHTER ) -- TAKES OVER THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: YEAH. WOMEN ARE ENSLAVED AND MADE TO BE BREEDING HOSTS. ALL REPRODUCTIVE RIGHT ARE STRIPPED, AND THE CONSTITUTION IS BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN IMAGINE -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SURE. -- SUCH A WORLD. ( APPLAUSE ) TRY TO GO THERE.
Stephen: OKAY. JUST TRY.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE A WOMAN WHO IS RESISTANT TO THAT, RIGHT?
VERY, YES.
Stephen: OKAY. AND WE HAVE A SCENE HERE -- DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS SCENE?
YES, THIS IS ME AND ALEXIS -- GILMORE GIRL -- INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE AND SHE PLAYS MY PARTNER. WE CAN'T WALK ALONE. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND TELL EACH OTHER OUR STORIES WHICH IS EXTREMELY FORBIDDEN.
Stephen: JIM? WE TRIED TO CROSS IN MAINE WITH MY HUSBAND AND WE SPLIT UP. THEY SHOT HIM.
THEY CURRENT GOING TO LET ANY OF US GET AWAY. NOT IF YOU HAD A RED TAG.
THIS IS YOUR STUFF, AS THEY USED TO SAY. IT WAS NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
YOU, TOO.
Stephen: FASHION HAS CHANGED SLIGHTLY. ( APPLAUSE )
YEAH, JUST A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: AND THERE IS NO INTERNET OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
Stephen: NO SOCIAL MEDIA. WOMEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO READ. SO I'LL BE RIGHT AT HOME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON STARTING YOUR CAREER AT 34.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: AND I HOPE YOU CAN COME BACK AND DANCE WITH US SOME TIME.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
Stephen: "THE HANDMAID'S TALE" PREMIERES WEDNESDAY ON HULU. ELISABETH MOSS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANTHONY ATAMANIK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT HOSTS A NEW TALK SHOW ON COMEDY CENTRAL WHERE HE STARS AS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. IT WILL ALL BE CLEAR IN A MINUTE. ( LAUGHTER ) PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY ATAMANIK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
ALL RIGHT!
Stephen: SO LET'S MAKE THIS CLEAR FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING.
WHO AM I?
Stephen: NO -- WHO-AM-I?
Stephen: YOU'RE A COMEDIAN ON A NEW SHOW CALLED "THE PRESIDENT SHOW."
"THE PRESIDENT SHOW."
Stephen: STARTS NEXT WEEK. NEXT THURSDAY, THE 27th.
Stephen: AND ON IT, YOU ARE HOSTING IT AS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK GOD I DON'T LOOK THAT MUCH LIKE HIM.
Stephen: HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT? ARE YOU AN IMPRESSIONIST BY NATURE?
NO AN IMPROVISEDDER. I WORK AT THE UPRIGHT CITIZENS BRIGADE ( APPLAUSE ) AND I HAVE BEEN LIKE A TROLL FOR 15 YEARS IMPROVISING. ONE NIGHT WE WERE DOING A SHOW AUGUST 2015. SOMEONE SAID MR. PRESIDENT -- AND I THOUGHT THIS WILL BE FUNNY, IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE THE ESCALATOR THAT ROLLED AROUND THE WORLD. SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT GO DOWN AND DO TRUMP. SO I STEPPED OUT AND DID A HORRIBLE IMPRESSION, NOT GOOD AT ALL. MY FRIEND SHANNON SAID, DO THE SHOW, WRITE A SHOW. SO I WROTE THE SHOW IN A WEEK.
Stephen: THIS SHOW? YES, THIS TELEVISION SHOW I WROTE IN A WEEK -- NO. MY INITIAL SHOW "THE TRUMP DUMP" IS WHAT IT WAS CALLED, AT UCB, AND THE CONCEIT WAS TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT AND IT WAS HIS FIRST PRESS CONFERENCE.
Stephen: HA, HA, HA... YEAH, REAL FUNNY. AND IT ENDS WITH NUCLEAR WAR. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) HATE TO BREAK IT TO EVERYBODY.
Stephen: FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. SO WHAT THEN? WHAT IS YOUR HOOK? PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING INTO ANY CHARACTER THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE DONALD TRUMP?
TEN YEARS OF THERAPY WILL DO IT. FIRST OFF, TRUMP IS AN ELVIS IMPRESSION. IT'S A SHATNER, AN ELVIS, IT'S A WOODY ALLEN. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S A STANDARD IMPRESSION.
Stephen: OKAY. EVERYONE HAS A SHATNER -- NOT EVERYONE BECAUSE EVERYONE'S YOUNG HERE -- BUT OLDER PEOPLE HAVE A SHATNER.
Stephen: SURE. O IT'S NOT LIKE THE SURFACE IS REALLY IT. BUT IN TERMS OF TRUMP, I HAVE TO STAND, DO YOU MIND?
Stephen: SURE. TRUMP PITCHES FORWARD SO WHEN HE STANDS, HE STANDS LIKE THIS. HE HAS NO CENTER OF GRAVITY. THAT'S WHY HE'S ALWAYS LEANING ON PEOPLE BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF STAIRS AND SLOPES, I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE KNOW THIS. SO DON'T READ INTO THAT. SO HE LEANS LIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ACCENTUATE THE MOUTH -- BRING THE MOUTH FORWARD, AND THEN BRING I IN THE ARMS. I'LL DO THE WHOLE THING. WE'RE DOING SO WELL WITH, SO UNBELIEVABLE -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THIS IS TRUMP, TRUMP IS A SHIH TZU. TRUMP IS A SHIH TZU.
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT YOU ON THAT ONE. I REALLY ENJOY YOUR IMPRESSION AND I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY A FEW THINGS WE WOULD LIKE THE HEAR TRUMP SAY BUT WOULD NEVER SAY. WOULD YOU BE UP FOR IT.
YES.
Stephen: PHRASES TRUMP WILL NEVER SAY BUT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO HEAR.
OKAY, YEAH. ( IN TRUMP VOICE )
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY HOW HE DRINKS WATER --
LIKE A DOVE DRINKING FROM A SMALL POND. MY SUPPORT OF BIL BILL O'REILLY  WRONG, INSENSITIVE AND TOTALLY STUPID. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE DOES THAT, TOO. AND THEN THIS ONE -- THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE. WHEN HE DOES THAT ONE, I'M, LIKE, WHAT IS HAPPENING? SORRY. NEXT ONE. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE THAT I WILL NO LONGER BE SEEKING A THIRD TERM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL. BUT HOW DOES THIS THEN BECOME A TALK SHOW? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO A TALK SHOW IN CHARACTER, BEING A RIGHT-WING BLOW HARD FOR YEARS ON COMEDY CENTRAL, IT CAN'T BE DONE. GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO KILL IT, MAN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen:
STEPHEN: "THE PRESIDENT SHOW" PREMIERES APRIL 27 ON COMEDY CENTRAL. ANTHONY ATAMANIK, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SHERYL CROW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )

NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NOW, WE HAD YOU ON THE OLD GIG.
YES.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU AND I WERE TOGETHER OUT IN THE WILD WAS AT THE -- BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN OUT A COUPLE OF TIMES TOGETHER, THE GRAMMYS TOGETHER.
THE GRAMMYS WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
Stephen: IT WAS YOU AND ME, AT THE TIME MY 14-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, BON JOVI AND RICHIE SRICHIESAM BORA.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? MY DAUGHTER CALLS RICHIE ZAM BORA HER FIRST PROM DATE.
ONLY SHE CAN SAY THAT.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME WE WERE OUT IS THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY.
WE TRIED.
Stephen: WE GAVE IT A SHOT. JOHN HAD THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY AND I HAD THE MARCH TO KEEP FEAR ALIVE.
I THINK YOU WON.
Stephen: EXACTLY. YOU PERFORMED THAT AFTERNOON, YOU AND KID ROCK DID A AS LONG AS TOGETHER.
YES.
Stephen: KID WAS JUST IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH TRUMP.
YES.
Stephen: DID YOU GET INVITED THE TO STOP BY?
I DIDN'T. I'M SHOCKED PRESIDENT TRUMP HASN'T ASKED ME TO COME BY. I GOT A TEXT FROM KATHY GRIFFIN WHO SAID I HOLD YOU COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PICTURE OF KID ROCK BEING IN A POLITICAL -- SO I'M --
Stephen: THE MICHIGAN G.O.P. IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET HIM TO RUN FOR CONGRESS.
I KNOW.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A CONGRESSMAN. SENATOR SHERYL CROW?
I'M GOING FOR PRESIDENT. I'M GOING STRAIGHT THERE.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK. IN FACT, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME RUN AGAINST KID ROCK.
Stephen: OH, WOW. I WOULD LOVE TO COVER THAT CAMPAIGN. WOW! HOLY COW!
I CAN KICK!
Stephen: I LIKE KID. I DO, TOO. HE GOT APPROACHED FOR WRITING A SONG ABOUT MITT ROMNEY. HE TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT HOW HE ASKED KIT TO HIS HOUSE AND SAID I HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS BEFORE I WRITE THE SONG.
Stephen: DID HE WRITE THE SONG?
HE DID, YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. YOU'RE POLITICALLY ENGAGED. YOU GOT A PETITION LAST YEAR ON CHANGE.org TO SHORTEN THE ELECTION CYCLE.
I'M REINSTATING IT.
Stephen: YOU'RE REINSTATING IT? IS IT TOO LONG, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I AGREE, BE BUT HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE.
I THINK WE SHOULD APPROACH IT LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME LAWS -- BECAUSE LAST YEAR WAS A HATE FLOG. TRUMP IS ALREADY CAMPAIGNING. LAST YEAR WAS TWO YEARS AND NOW IT'S FOUR YEARS.
Stephen: THERESA MAY CALLED A SNAP ELECTION FOR THE END OF MAY. WE'LL WAKE UP TOMORROW MORNING, THERE'S A NEW ELECTION.
I LIKE IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A NEW ALBUM AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SONG IN A LITTLE BIT CALLED "BE MYSELF" RIGHT THERE. THE LYRICS, YOU BET THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT IS SWEATING, ANSWER THE PHONE, BLOW UP EVERYTHING. HOW DID YOU KNOW TO PUT THAT IN YOUR SONG?
WE WROTE IT IN AUGUST AND IT STARTED OUT AS A SINISTER ESPIONAGE SONG IN THE TONE OF, LIKE, GIVE ME SHELTER, AND I JUST STARTED THINKING -- I WAS SITTING HERE WITH MY BUDDY GOING, WOW, WHAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING YOU CAN IMAGINE? RUSSIA HACKING, THAT WOULD BE CRAZY AND, LIKE, THE PRESIDENT BEING INVOLVED WITH RUSSIA, THAT WOULD BE SO F'D UP! (WHISPERING).
Stephen: JUST BECAUSE YOU WHISPER DOESN'T MEAN CBS WON'T (BLEEP) IT. AND ALL YOUR DREAMS CAME TRUE.
YEAH, I MANIFESTED THAT.
Stephen: WHAT SONG ARE YOU DOING LATER TONIGHT?
I'M DOING -- LATER? WOW. I'M DOING A SONG CALLED "HALFWAY THERE."
Stephen: AND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THE WHOLE SONG, THOUGH.
