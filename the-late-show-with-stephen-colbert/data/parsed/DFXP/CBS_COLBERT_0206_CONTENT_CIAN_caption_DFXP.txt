Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "LATE'S SHOW'S "ENCHANTED FOREST. WHY AM I IN THE THE ENCHANTED FOREST, YOU ASK? BECAUSE WE PAID TO HAVE IT MADE, AND THE BAND THAT INSISTED WE MAKE IT FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE DIDN'T-- LET'S JUST SAY, THEY DIDN'T WORK OUT. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THAT WAS NOT WELCOME NEWS TO THE WORKER ELVES WHO BUILT THE SET OR DID ALL THAT RIDGEITAL RENDERING BACK THERE. THESE ARE UNION ELVES, NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR WHIMSY. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT THE ONLY MAGICAL TALE I HAVE TO TELL YOU. OH, NO!  BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS ALSO A GUEST WHO ASSURED ME HE WAS UP FOR ANYTHING. JUST SURPRISE HIM, HE SAID. SO I RENTED A SHEEP BECAUSE WE HAD A PRETTY FUNNY BIT INVOLVING SHEEP. HERE'S THE SCARY PART-- THAT SHEEP COST $2,000. 2,000! I COULD REASSEMBLE A SHEEP OUT OF LAMB CHOPS FOR CHEAPER. TURNS OUT "BEING UP FOR ANYTHING" DOESN'T INCLUDE SHEEP, OR ANYTHING. BUT THE CASH HAS BEEN SPENT, SO NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU, I PRESENT "THE LATE SHOW'S" MONEY I ALREADY SPENT JUSTIFICATION THEATER." OH, SHEEP! OH, MR. SHEEPLINGTON, OH, OH, WE'RE LOST IN THE FOREST. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT DOES LOOK EXPENSIVE. THIS IS A MOOJICAL FOREST THAT MAKES MONEY DISAPPEAR. OH! THAT PROP COSTS $400. ( LAUGHTER ) WE BOUGHT IT A FEW MONTHS BACK, BUT THE FIRE MARSHAL WOULDN'T LET ME USE IT. HE'S IN FOR A SURPRISE TONIGHT, MR. SHEEPY. WELL, THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. EXCEPT, OF COURSE, SHEEP.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW"" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES TITUS BURGES. JEFF ROSS. AND ADAM RICHMAN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Jon: THAT FEELS GOOD!
Stephen: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAY OR NIGHT IT IS RIGHT NOW. AND I'LL TELL YOU, THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOT ME CONFUSE, A LITTLE BIT UPSET. I COME TO YOU RIGHT NOW-- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER-- I COME TO YOU AS A MAN WHO GOT NO SLEEP LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OF DISTURBING NEWS OUT OF NORTH KOREA. THEY CONDUCTED A NUCLEAR TEST DETONATING A 10 KILOGRAM DEVICE UNDERGROUND. YOU THINK IT'S HARD BEING A NORTH KOREAN? IMAGINE BEING A NORTH KOREAN PRAIRIE DOG. IT'S TRECIAL. AND NORTH KOREA MAY SOON HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO NUKE COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THEIR OWN BECAUSE LAST MONTH THEY TESTED A SUBMARINE. BASED MISSILE CALLED THE "NO DONG." ( LAUGHTER ) NO DONG! MOST MEN JUST GET A SPORTS CAR. HE GOT A MISSILE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE MISSILE FLEW 300 MILES BEFORE FALLING INTO THE SEA OF JAPAN. MAN! THE DOLPHINS AROUND JAPAN JUST CANNOT CATCH A BREAK. NOW, OVER THE YEARS-- IT'S SAD. IT'S A SAD STORY. NOW, OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE ENJOYED A GOOD HA-HA ABOUT LITTLE KIM'S LITTLE NUKES. BUT WITH A SUBMARINE-BASED NUCLEAR MISSILE, THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO THREATEN THE UNITED STATES, AND SUDDENLY AN UNHINGED STRONGMAN WITH A RIDICULOUS HAIRCUT AND NUCLEAR ARMS ISN'T SO FUNNY ANYMORE, ESPECIALLY SINCE AFTER NOVEMBER, WE MIGHT HAVE ONE OF OUR OWN. LAUGH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, YOU KNOW--
Jon:
Jon: YOU WENT INTO IT THERE.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE ISN'T FUNNY, NORTH KOREA? EVERYTHING. BECAUSE THEY BAPPED THE USE OF CAR CAMP. NOW, THEY'RE NOT BANNING I HAD PERPLY. THERE'S NO NEED TO, BECAUSE IN NORTH KOREA, PEOPLE REALLY DO FEEL HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT A HORSE. AND HERE'S WHY THEY BANNED THE SARCASM. BECAUSE KIM JONG-UN FEARS PEOPLE ONLY AGREE WITH HIM IRONICALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT'S HOW HE FEELS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW TO REASSURE KIM JONG-UN. DEAR LEADER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOUR BAN ON SARCASM IS A GREAT IDEA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO, SO-- IT'S SO SMART. IT DOESN'T SEEM DESPERATE AT ALL. AND SETTING OFF A BOMB UNDERNEATH YOUR OWN COUNTRY? GENIUS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BY THE THE WAY, THAT HAIRCUT, AMAZING! DOESN'T MAKE YOU LOOK ANYTHING LIKE A GANG LEADER AT A WOMEN'S PRISON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOPE THAT MAKES HIM FEEL BETTER.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: HE'S SOMEBODY'S LITTLE BOY.
Jon: OH, YEAH.
Stephen: HERE'S SOME HAPPY NEWS, NEW iPHONE SEVEN JUST WENT ON PRESAIL BOTH HERE AND IN HONG KONG, WHERE THEY'RE USING THE TAGLINE, "THIS IS 7." BUT THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A PROBLEM, BECAUSE IN CANTONESE, SEVEN IS ALSO SLANG FOR PENIS.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: SO ALL OF THEIR ADS READ, "THIS IS PENIS." COINCIDENTALLY, "THIS IS PEENES" IS WHAT I SAID RIGHT BEFORE I LOST MY VIRGINITY. I WAS TRYING TO BE POLITE, MAKING AN INTRODUCTION. THIS IS PENIS. EVERYBODY, THIS IS PENIS. I DON'T THINK EQAIGHT THE IPHONE WITH A PENIS IS GOING TO HURT SALES. THEY'RE BOTH TOUCH SENSITIVE, AND FOR BOTH OF THEM, IT'S RUDE TO TAKE THEM OUT AT DINNER. WE'VE ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT, EVERYBODY. FROM "UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT," TITUSS BURGESS IS HERE. AND HAD WE RETURN, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR PARENTS AWAY FROM YOUR POT. STICK AROUND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. HOW IS EVERYBODY FEEL TONIGHT? YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT? LET ME ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION. IT'S A PERSONAL QUESTION, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT MARIJUANA? I HAVE A COUPLE OF STORIES TO TALK ABOUT AND BEFORE I GET SPOT CRIMINAL SIDE OF DRUG ABUSE, THAT IS MARIJUANA. A DANGEROUS, DANGEROUS DRUG. YOU'LL SMOKE IT. YOU'LL THINK YOU'RE A BEE AND TRY ON FORCE YOUR FACE THROUGH A KEYHOLE. I'VE SEEP IT HAPPEN 1,000 TIMES. STAY AWAY FROM, JON.
Jon: I DON'T MESS WITH IT.
Stephen: BUT THEY CALL IT JAZZ CIGARETTES.
Jon: I HEARD THAT BEFORE. I PLAY JAZZ BUT I DON'T DO THE CIGARETTE THING.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOT COMMITTED TO THAT THING. LOUIE ARMSTRONG, SAID EVERY TIME HE PERFORMED. THAT'S THE WORD.
Jon: THAT'S THE WORD. HE ACTUALLY GOT IT FROM DIZZY GILLESPIE ON HIS BIRTHDAY. HE CAME TO HIS HOUSE WITH A SHOE BOX AND SAID, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY. NOW ROLL THEM UP."
Stephen: A SHOE BOX FULL, LIKE THE SIZE OF A BUICK OR 150 JOINTS. NO, I WASN'T THERE --
NO ONE SAID YOU WERE, JON, NO ONE SAID YOU WERE. YOU ALMOST HAD THAT, LIKE-- YOU KNOW THAT WAS LIKE YOU WERE BEING INTERVIEWED BY A COP JUST NOW.
Jon: OH, YEAH, YEAH, SEE. THEY HAVE STORIES ABOUT IT THAT ARE PASS DOWN. BUT JUST NOT THAT COMMITTED SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT FORM HE DELIVERED IT TO HIM IN.
Stephen: OKAY.
Jon: BUT I COKNOW IT PROBABLY HAPPENED BECAUSE I HEARD IT FROM AN OLD GUY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WAS THIS OLD GUY HIGH WHEN HE TOLD YOU THIS, JON?
Jon: I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: OKAY.
Jon: IT'S HARD TO TELL BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T MESS AROUND WITH THAT.
Stephen: YOU UNDERSTAND.
Jon: BUT HIS EYES WEREN'T VERY RED. THAT'S A SIGN, RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW, JON. I'M NOT INTO THAT SCENE. I DON'T KNOW, EITHER. I'M A SUBURBAN DAD. WHAT WOULD I KNOW ABOUT IT?
Jon: I HAVE NO CLUE.
Stephen: GOOD, SO BOTH OF US ARE CLEAN, ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: CLEAN.
Stephen: AND WE'LL BOTH COVER FOR EACH OTHER IF WE EVER GET ARRESTED, RIGHT?
Jon: THERE YOU GO!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, GOOD? ( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THAT UNREHEARSED STORY, JON.
Jon: YES, INDEED. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
Stephen:  HERE'S WHY I WAS GETTING INTO IT. WE HAVE TWO STORIES TONIGHT ABOUT THE DEVIL'S WEED.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: A RECENT STUDY HAS FOUND THAT RATS WHO WERE GIVEN T.H.C., THE CHEMICAL FOUND IN MARIJUANA, BECAME COGNITIVELY LAZY. THE RESULTS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN "THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF YEAH, I SAW THAT COMING." ( LAUGHTER ) SCIENTISTS REACHED THEIR CONCLUSIONS AFTER GIVING RATS THE CHOICE BETWEEN AN EASY TASK TO GET LESS FOOD AND A HARDER TASK TO GET MORE FOOD. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THEY FOUND WHEN GIVEN T.H.C., THE RATS CHOSE TO SIT ON THE COUCH AND WATCH "BOJACK HORSEMAN." IT'S A GOOD SHOW. BUT THE MARIJUANA REPORT THAT REALLY SURPRISED ME IS FROM THE C.D.C. THEY FOUND THAT MIDDLE-AGED PARENTS-- GUYS LIKE ME-- ARE NOW MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE WEED THAN THEIR TEENAGED KIDS. YEAH, TUNE IN, TURN ON, AND CRANK UP THE NPR! WOO! CONSIDER ALL THE THINGS! CONSIDER ALL THE THINGS! ( APPLAUSE ) WAIT, WAIT, DO TELL ME! APPARENTLY, MARIJUANA USE AMONG 12- TO 17-YEAR-OLDS ACTUALLY FELL 10% SINCE 2002, WHILE USE AMONG AMERICANS 45 TO 54 JUMPED BY NEARLY 50%. AND AMONG SENIORS, MONTHLY MARIJUANA USE IS UP 333%. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW WE KNOW. NOW WE KNOW. NOW WE KNOW WHY THEY EAT DINNER AT 4:30 P.M. WHY THEY DRIVE SEVEN MILES AN HOUR, AND WHY THEY THINK $5 IS AN APPROPRIATE BIRTHDAY GIFT. STILL, THIS NEWS ABOUT PARENTAL WEED USE IS SHOCKING. TO FIND OUT MORE, LET'S CHECK IN NOW LIVE VIA SATELLITE WITH THE "LATE SHOW'S" OFFICIAL MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE, BOB AND DIANE HANSON. FROM MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US.
OH SURE, THANK YOU, STEPHEN. WE WATCH YOUR SHOW ALL THE TIME.
YEAH, MATTER OF FACT, WE WATCH A WHOLE LOT OF TV.
Stephen: SO, HAVE YOU FOLKS NOTICED A TREND IN PEOPLE YOUR AGE USING MORE MARIJUANA?
NO, HAVEN'T NOTICED MUCH OF THAT. I'VE BEEN PRETTY FOCUSED ON MY HOBBY OF GLASS BLOWING.
AND I'VE BEEN PRETTY FOCUSED ON THE CAT. WHAT'S HE THINKING WHEN HE LAYS IN THAT PATCH OF SUNLIGHT? IF HE WERE A HUMAN, WOULD WE BE FRIENDS? DOES HE THINK I'M SOME BIG HAIRLESS CAT? OH, MY GOD, WHAT IF HE CAN READ MY THOUGHTS?
Stephen: OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY BAKED RIGHT NOW.
OH, I LOVE TO BAKE. IN FACT, I GOT A BATCH OF BROWNIES IN THE OVEN RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
UH-OH, IT'S OUR SON!
CROTCH THE WEED!
ARE YOU GUYS GETTING HIGH IN HERE AGAIN?
OH, STOP HARSHING OUR BUZZ! NO ONE CARES!
JODI'S KIDS LET US DO IT!
Stephen: EXCUSE ME, YOUNG MAN. IT SEEMS LIKE IT BOTHERS YOU THAT YOUR PARENTS SMOKE WEED.
WELL, I'D PREFER THAT THEY DIDN'T, BUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO, I'D RATHER IT BE AT HOME, WHERE I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.
Stephen: AND AS A TEENAGER, YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIMENTED WITH MARIJUANA AT ALL?
NO. I DON'T DO DRUGS. I SNORT ADDERALL LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. ( APPLAUSE )
OH, MY GOD. DO YOU THINK HE KNEW?
NO. NO WAY-- UNLESS HE CAN READ OUR MINDS, LIKE THE CAT.
OH, NO!
Stephen: BOB AND DIANE HANSON, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TITUS BURGESS. YOU REALLY SEEM HIGH. THAT'S DEFINITELY A BONG.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LOOK, THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT SHOWS ON TELEVISION, BUT THERE IS NO GREATER BAND ON TELEVISION THAN JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AMAZING.

I THINK ANYTHING INVOLVING THE GHOST CHILI. THERE'S A PEPPER THAT IS SO STRONG THAT INDIAN POLICE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO WEAPONNIZE IT INTO GRENADES.
Stephen: WHAT?
YES, AND I SOMEHOW POSSESSED THE INTELLECTUAL FORTITUDE TO WANT TO EAT IT.
Stephen: DID YOU EAT A GHOST CHILI?
I HAVE EATEN THINGS WITH BOTH GHOST CHILLY AND GHOST CHILI EXTRACT AND BARELY LIVED TO TELL TALE.
Stephen: WOW. IS IT ACTUALLY A FLAVOR, OR IS IT LIKE YOUR HEAD TURNS ELECTRIC?
IT TASTES LIKE BURNING. APPARENTLY IT CARRIES SO MUCH CAPSAICIN --
IS THAT THE STUFF. WHAT IS IT.
A SCHOVILLE UNIT, IT'S APPARENTLY THE AMOUNT OF WATER IT TAKES TO WASH AWAY THE ELEMENT OF SPICE SO THAT'S A MEASUREMENT OF SPICE. UP UNTIL RECENTLY, IT WAS THE HOTTEST PERP ON PLANET EARTH, SO MUCH SO THEY WOULD TIE IT TO FENCES AROUND RURAL FARMS IN INDIA TO KEEP WILD ELEPHANTS AT BAY BECAUSE THEY COULD PICK UP THE CAPSAICIN FROM MILES AWAY. AGAIN, I THINK I POSSESS LESINTELLECTUAL FORTITUDE THAN A WILD ELEPHANT. HOPE I DID YOU PROUD, MOM ?RT
Stephen:  THE NEW SHOW IS CALLED "SECRET EATS?" WHAT IS A SECRET EAT. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHAMEFUL SNACKING.
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SHAMEFUL SNACKING. HIDDEN RESTAURANTS WITH AN OFF-MENU DISH.
Stephen: A HIDDEN RESTAURANT? IS THAT A GOOD BUSINESS MOD TOLL HIDE YOUR RESTAURANT? IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE YOUR RESTAURANT RUN. LET'S NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT.
IT'S LIKE IN THE THE MUSICAL "GYPSY." YOU GOTTA GET A GIMMICK. IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHERE EVERYTHING IS, "THAT'S SO FIVE MINUTES AGO. AND OH, MY GOD, THEY INSTAGRAMMED THAT TRUFF FELL TWO YEARS AGO.
Stephen: I NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY, "THEY INSTAGRAMMED THAT TRUFFLE TWO YEARS AGO." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
I DON'T KNOW, I I WAS TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE SWEATER AROUND THE SHOULDERS, PHRASE.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THE TERM FOODIE.
I PREFER GASTRONAUGHT.
Stephen: I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND, THIS-- I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS A PICTURE OF A HIDDEN RESTAURANT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT IS, INDEED. SO THAT LOOKS LIKE THE INSIDE OF P.D.T., WHICH STANDS FOR "PLEASE DON'T TELL" HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. THAT IS ACTUALLY INSIDE OF A HOT DOG PLACE IN THE VILLAGE. IF YOU CALL, MAKE A RESERVATION, YOU GO INTO THIS VERY TELEPHONE BOOTH, YOU PICK UP, SAY WHO YOU ARE --
RIGHT THERE?
RIGHT THERE. GUIN THE BOOTH AND OFFER SAY WHO YOU ARE, YOU HANG UP THE PHONE AND THE THE BACK WALL OF THE PHONE BOOTH OPENS AND THERE'S A HIDDEN RESTAURANT THROUGH IT.
Stephen: WHAT! AND THEN THEY TAKE YOUR KIDNEYS OR SOMETHING. THAT SOUNDS--
ONE DRINK AT A TIME. NO, REALLY AWESOME FOOD AND THEY HAVE MARQUEE CHEFS MAKING FUN DISHES. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A HOT DOG PLACE TO FIND IT.
Stephen: IS THAT THE SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENS JUST HERE IN NEW YORK OR ALL OVER THE WORLD?
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN FINDING. WE SHOPT THE FIRST SEASON OF "SECRET EATS "IN UNITED STATES BUT WE SHOT IN COUNTRY COUNTRIES ON FOUR CONTINENTS AND FOUND THINGS IN SINGAPORE ON THE BACK OF A PARKING DECK IN SOUTH AFRICA. THERE'S A PLACE CALLED SPAVZI, SOMEONE WILL TAP YOU IN SOUTH AFRICA AND HAND YOU A WATCH WITH A NOTE SAYING YOU ARE INVITED TO A PRIVATE DINNER. THIS ENTITLES AND FOUR GUESTS TO COME, AND YOU SHOW UP AT THE TIME ON THE POCKET WATCH AND THERE'S A PRIVATE DINNER JUST FOR THEM. I URNT VIEWED THESE PEOPLE. I SAID, "HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THE POCKET WATCH?" AND THEY SAID, "JAMES CRAIG."
Stephen: JUST RANDOMLY.
HE WAS SHOOTING SOMETHING IN CAPE TOWN. HE MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE, HELLO. AND HANDS THEM A WATCH.
Stephen: WE HAVE AIM A COUPLE OF FOODS THAT YOU SAY COME FROM A SECRET EAT.
THAT'S P.D.T. THIS IS TATER TOTS, I GUESS TAKEN TO HAWT CUISINE. AND SO IT'S SORT OF AN UPDATED VERSION --
DO I JUST GO LIKE THIS. JOIN ME HERE.
PLEASE, OF COURSE,.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT OF CREME FRESH AND CALFAUR. I'M GOING WITH A LOT OF CAVIAR. AND YOU WOULD EAT THIS IN A SECRET ROOM.
YOU WOULD, BEHIND A PHONE BOOING P BOOTH.
Stephen: WOW, THAT IS LIKE A COMBINATION OF THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM AND THE DRIVE-IN AT SONIC.
I WANT TO LIVE THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC. WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE HERE? WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS?
OH, HALLELUJAH. OH, WOW.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT?
THIS IS FROM A PLACE CALLED EL SUBROSEO. ROAST PORK, RED SAUCE AND RICE AND BEANS.
Stephen: IN WHAT WAY IS THIS SECRET?
IT'S ON A LODING DOCK IN THE FASHION DISTRICT, ACROSS FROM F.I.T., THE FASHION INSTITUTE. THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE SIX TOOLS, TWO TABLES SET UP WITH PATIO FURNITURE, AND GUYS WHEELING GARMENT RACKS WHILE YOU'RE EATING AND ONE FAMILY MAKING THIS. IS THAT HOT? APON MUSRED SAUCE. THE RED SAUCE-- SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THE JOINT WITH THE RED SAUCE.
Stephen: DAMN, GIRL. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW MY BARBECUE. THAT IS OFF THE HOOK. AND THAT'S NOT GHOST PEPPER, BUT THAT IS GOING TO HAUNT ME. ( LAUGHTER ) ADAM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
AN ABSOLUTELY PLEASURE.
Stephen: "SECRET EATS" IS ON THE TRAVEL CHANNEL MONDAY'S AT 10:00 P.M. ADAM RICHMAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. JOIN US NEXT WEEK WHEN I HAVE DR. PHIL, JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT, AND ALLEN IVERSON. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND! GOOD NIGHT!
