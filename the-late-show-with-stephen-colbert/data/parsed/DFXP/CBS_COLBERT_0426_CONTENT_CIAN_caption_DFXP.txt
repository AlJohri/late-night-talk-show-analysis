FIRST QUESTION:  WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE INVISIBLE FORCE THAT HOLDS US TO THE EARTH? PRESIDENT TRUMP?
FRANKLY, PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE FACTS.
NO, WE DO KNOW THE FACTS. WE'VE KNOWN SINCE THE 1700s. SECRETARY TILLERSON, YOUR ANSWER?
I'M NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH PETTY STUFF LIKE THAT.
I WOULDN'T CALL IT PETTY. IT'S THE CORNERSTONE OF ALL PHYSICS. BACK TO YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WHEN I MAKE A STATEMENT, I LIKE TO BE CORRECT.
I DON'T BLAME YOU, BUT YOU HAVEN'T YET MADE ONE. GENTLEMEN, LET'S GO OVER THE RULES. IN ORDER FOR US TO ASSESS YOUR INTELLIGENCE, YOU NEED TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION! SECRETARY TILLERSON, YOUR ANSWER IN.
I HAVE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION REPEATEDLY.

I DO NOT, AND I WILL NOT OPERATE THAT WAY.
BOTH ARE MORONS! BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE ALL SCREWED!
BOTH ARE MORONS! WE'RE ALL SCREWED!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, RUSSIA'S SECRET POKEMON PLAY. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES: CONAN O'BRIEN. AND TIG NOTARO. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOOO! HEY! HOW ARE YOU? HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU. JUST A LITTLE SWEEP RIGHT THERE. HEY, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,  EVERYBODY." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT IS-- YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T ASK FOR A BETTER FRIDAY CROWD THAN THAT. YOU CAN'T. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S THE GOLD STANDARD. THAT'S THE GOLD STANDARD OF A FRIDAY CROWD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ON THIS LOVELY FRIDAY, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS FOR FANS OF "POKEMON GO." THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU CAN STOP NOW. IT'S 2017. WE'VE MOVED ON TO FIDGET SPINNERS AND AVOCADO TOAST-- THEN FORGOTTEN THOSE, TOO. THE BAD NEWS IS IT WAS JUST REPORTED THAT EVEN "POKEÉMON GO" WAS USED BY THE RUSSIAN-LINKED, ELECTION-MEDDLING EFFORT. WE SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS COMING. NO, WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AFTER ALL, A SQUIRTLE ISN'T JUST A POKEÉMON. IT'S ALSO WHAT TRUMP REQUESTED IN THAT RUSSIAN HOTEL ROOM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I COULD BARELY GET THAT OUT. MY TONGUE WOULDN'T LET ME. MY TONGUE DID NOT WANT ME TO SAY THAT JOKE.
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: SQUIRTLE. BUT, APPARENTLY, RUSSIANS POSING AS PART OF A BLACK LIVES MATTER GROUP USED "POKEÉMON GO" TO EXPLOIT RACIAL TENSIONS AND SOW DISCORD AMONG AMERICANS. SO YET ANOTHER ONLINE INSTITUTION HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY RUSSIA. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO COULD'VE WARNED US HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS.
I DON'T KNOW WHO CREATED "POKEÉMON GO," BUT I'D TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET THEM TO HAVE "POKEÉMON GO" TO THE POLLS!
Stephen: SO THEY HACKED HER, TOO. IF ONLY SHE'D POKEÉMON GONE TO MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WHO KNOWS-- WISCONSIN FANS. MIDWESTERN FANS-- MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN! WHO KNOWS HOW THIS WHOLE RUSSIA THING IS GOING TO PLAY OUT, BUT I'M HOPING ROBERT MUELLER IS GOING TO CATCH 'EM ALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, SO MUCH HAPPENED THIS WEEK. TRUMP REPEALED PART OF OBAMACARE, HE TALKED ABOUT PULLING OUT OF NAFTA AND THE IRAN DEAL. PLUS, HE THREATENED TO START A THERMONUCLEAR WAR WITH NBC NEWS. IS SO, YOU MAY HAVE MISSED A SOME-RANGING INTERVIEW TRUMP GAVE ON FOX NEWS. HE STARTED THE INTERVIEW BY RIPPING THE MEDIA.
MEDIA IS BAD. THEY ARE REALLY DISHONEST PEOPLE. WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S BEING WRITTEN ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD, AND IT'S ALWAYS-- THEY TRY AND MAKE IT NEGATIVE. SO THE MEDIA HAS TURNED OUT. I CALL IT FAKE MEDIA.
Stephen: NO, YOU DON'T! YOU CALL IT "FAKE NEWS." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S YOUR CATCHPHRASE, AND YOU'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN IT? "LIKE I ALWAYS SAID ON 'THE APPRENTICE,' MEATLOAF, YOU ARE THE WEAKEST LINK." ( LAUGHTER ) HE WOULD SAY "YOU'RE FIRED." AND IT WASN'T JUST DOMESTIC ISSUES. TRUMP ALSO TOUCHED ON OUR TENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN.
IRAN ARE GREAT PEOPLE, AND THEY WANT FREEDOM, AND THEY WANT TO BE SORT OF WANT TO BE FRIENDLY WITH US. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. BUT THEY ARE DANCING IN THE STREETS, AND THEY ARE SINGING "DEATH TO AMERICA."
Stephen: WAIT, DO THEY WANT US DEAD OR ARE THEY FRIENDLY? YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. ( LAUGHTER ) "HEY, CHERYL, YOU'RE DOING GREAT DOWN IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. ALSO, DEATH TO CHERYL." ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS ALSO--
Jon: WOW.
Stephen: I'M SURE CHERYL SEEMS NICE. I TONIGHT KNOW WHY I SAID CHERYL. WE JUST PICKED THAT NAME OUT OF A HAT. IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT TRUMP IS STILL OBSESSED WITH THE 2016 ELECTION.
WINNING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS SO EASY FOR A DEMOCRAT. TO WIN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE FOR A DEMOCRAT IS ALMOST LIKE A GIVEN. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, I NEVER APPRECIATED. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A POPULAR VOTE. FOR ME, THE POPULAR VOTE IS EASIER.
Stephen: HEY, WE CAN GO BY POPULAR VOTE IF YOU WANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I COULD THINK-- OF A FEW MILLION PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE COOL-- I'M OKAY WITH THAT. YOU OKAY?
Jon: I'M COOL WITH THAT. YOU WANT TO DO THAT. LET'S DO THAT. LET'S DO THAT.
Stephen: THEN TRUMP HAD BIG NEWS ABOUT HIS BORDER WALL.
WE'VE BUILT FIVE PROTOTYPES. THEY ARE GOING UP. SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY FINISHED. I WILL SAY, THEY ARE REALLY LOOKING GOOD. THEY ARE REALLY LOOKING GOOD.
Stephen: "REALLY, REALLY LOOKING GOOD. I'M JUST SAYING, IF THEY WEREN'T MY WALL, PERHAPS I'D BE DATING THEM. REALLY." BUT IT IS TRUE-- THIS PART IS TRUE. HE HAS STARTED BUILDING PROTOTYPES FOR THE BORDER WALL. RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE OUT IN SAN DIEGO. THERE THEY ARE. THERE'S A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THEM. THOUGH, IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY, THERE IS A FLAW-- IMMIGRANTS CAN JUST RUN IN THROUGH THOSE GAPS! ( LAUGHTER ) BUT UNG ALL THESE DIFFERENT SAMPLES, I THINK IT MIGHT BE PART OF A LARGER PLAN, A MASTER PLAN. HE CAN'T GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR IT, BUT IF HE GETS ENOUGH COMPANIES TO BUILD SAMPLES, BOOM-- FREE WALL. ( LAUGHTER ) SAME WAY I TILED MY BATHROOM. ( APPLAUSE ) SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK-- I HAVE A PHOTO OF THE SAMPLES RIGHT HERE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THESE POTENTIAL BORDER WALLS. FIRST UP, WE HAVE THE VENETIAN. THIS DELIGHTFUL OPEN CONCEPT FOR A CLOSED BORDER. SEE-THREE MEANS THAT IMMIGRANTS CAN SEE A BETTER LIFE, BUT THEY CAN'T TOUCH IT. NEXT, SAY HELLO TO THE CONTINENTAL. A BIT OF A DRAB SLAB, BUT METICULOUS DETAILING. LOOK AT THE DECORATIVE FRINGE OF BESPOKE RAZOR SPIKES. FUN FEATURE: IT KEEPS PEOPLE OUT, BUT ALSO MAKES THE COUNTRY SEEM LIKE A PRISON FROM THE INSIDE. IT'S A TWO-FER! FINALLY, THERE'S THE MOST POPULAR MODEL, THE MONOLITH: 30 FEET OF PURE, REINFORCED CONCRETE. THIS MODEL IS THE APOTHEOSIS OF BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE PAIRED WITH THE TIMELESS TRADITION OF FEARING BROWN PEOPLE. ENJOY.
Jon: OOOOH!
Stephen: AND-- I DIDN'T BUILD IT! I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA. YO YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A ROUGH WEEK FOR FACEBOOK. MARK ZUCKERBERG JUST HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT'S BEING CALLED "A 'TONE-DEAF' VIRTUAL TRIP TO PUERTO RICO." HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED: IT STARTED INNOCENTLY ENOUGH, WHEN ZUCKERBERG WAS LAUNCHING A PROMOTION OF THEIR "FACEBOOK SPACES" VIRTUAL REALITY FEATURE.
ALL RIGHT. HI, EVERYONE. WE ARE LIVE IN VIRTUAL REALITY. WE ARE IN FACEBOOK SPACES. AND I AM HERE WITH RACHAEL.
HI, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: AMAZING. THAT AVATAR IS ACTUALLY LESS AWKWARD THAN THE REAL MARK ZUCKERBERG. IT'S FUN AND COOL. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS NOT USE A TRAGEDY TO PROMOTE IT.
ALL RIGHT. SO NOW WE ARE IN A 360 VIDEO IN PUERTO RICO.
Stephen: WHAT? YOU DON'T GO TO A DISASTER ZONE TO PUSH YOUR PRODUCT! "THE NEW DYSON VACUUM USES THE SAME CYCLONIC ACTION THAT THE TORNADO THAT JUST DESTROYED THIS TOWN WITH." THAT DIDN'T-- THAT DID NOT STOP-- ( APPLAUSE ) NO, THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WE WANT ME TO SHOW YOU PICTURES OF THE WALL AGAIN? THAT DID NOT STOP ZUCKERBERG FROM BEING IMPRESSED.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY MAGICAL ABOUT VIRTUAL REALITY IS YOU CAN GET THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE REALLY IN A PLACE.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. WITH THIS PRODUCT, IT REALLY FELT LIKE FACEBOOK WAS UP ITS OWN ASS.
Jon: OH!
Stephen: WOW! IT'S SO REALISTIC! OH, LOOK, LOOK! THERE'S THE EXACT SPOT WHERE WE PULLED THIS IDEA FROM! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! CONAN O'BRIEN IS HERE! TIG NOTARO, HERE! STICK AROUND! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS CURRENTLY THE LONGEST SERVING LATE-NIGHT HOST ON TV. HE'S THE OLD MAN IN THE MOUNTAIN. HE'S THE MANDARIN WITHOUT MELONIN. PLEASE WELCOME CONAN O'BRIEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪

Stephen: OH, THANKS VERY MUCH.

Stephen: YES, THANKS, THANKS, YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY-- THAT NIGHT, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.
I KNEW IT!
Stephen: YEAH, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.
I WAS WATCHING THE TV SO HARD THAT NIGHT, AND I COULD SEE I WAS GETTING INTO YOUR HEAD! YEAH. AND I WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN L.A.!
Stephen: WOW.
WHERE I WAS ON TUESDAY.
Stephen: EXACTLY. YOU KNOW. TALK ABOUT THIS WITH TIG NOTARO, MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT. TALK WITH THIS ABOUT HER. SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU, I HEARD.
I SAW HER BACK STAGE. SHE'S THE NEXT ONE ON.
Stephen: YEAH. BY THE WAY, I KNOW YOU'RE A FAN OF DAVE'S. I'M A HUGE FAN OF DAVE'S.
THIS IS DAVE LETTERMAN, AGAIN, RIGHT.
Stephen: DAVID LETTERMAN. ALSO, DAVE, THE GUY FROM WENDY'S.
YES! WENDY'S HAS THE BEST BURGER.
Stephen: THEY'RE SQUARE.
DAVID LETTERMAN. WE ALL GRIEWG UP REVERING DAVID LETTERMAN.
Stephen: YOU WROTE A LOVELY TRIBUTE TO HIM ON E.W.
AS HE WAS DEPARTING THIS STAGE, I WANTED TO WRITE AN APPRECIATION PIECE, SO I WROTE A PIECE ABOUT DAVE --
Stephen: DID YOU EVER HEAR FROM HIM? DID HE EVER SAY, "THANKS FOR THAT?"
I DID HEAR FROM HIM, YES. I DID HEAR FROM HIM. WHAT HAPPENED IS I WROTE THIS NICE APPRECIATION PEOPLE PIECEFOR DAVE AND I JUST SAID HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO ME AND ALL THE COMEDIANS OF MY GENERATION. AND THEN WORD CAME BACK THAT DAVE APPRECIATED WHAT I HAD WRITTEN, AND THAT HE'D BE SENDING ME SOMETHING MY WAY. AND I WAS LIKE, THIS IS-- I MEAN --
Stephen: SURE.
I WAS EXCITED AND I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AMAZING BOTTLE OF WINE, CHOCOLATES, HUMMEL FIGURINES THAT ARE HARD TO FINE, SOMETHING REALLY EXTRAORDINARY EXPICHES LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. I THOUGHT THIS WILL BE COOL. SO IT'S THE NEXT DAY, AND IT'S AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW. I CAN TALK TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A FELLOW HOST.
Stephen: SURE.
AN HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW, YOU'RE CONCENTRATING, YOU'RE GETTING READY --
Stephen: YEAH, A PRESSURE COOKER.
YOUR BODY IS BEING WAXED, OILED --
Stephen: YOU'RE BEING LOWERED INTO THE SUIT.
YEAH, EXACTLY. AND THE WARDROBE GUY, "STOP EATING!" ( LAUGHTER ) AND I HEAR THERE'S A TRUCK THAT'S TRYING TO GET ON TO THE WARNER BROTHERS LOT IN EXPLZ WAS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING ON THE LOT. AND I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" THEY SAID, IT'S TOO WIDE. THE TRUCK IS SO BIG IT CAN'T GET ON THE LOT AND IT'S CARRYING THE GIFT FROM DAVE." MY MIND STARTS TO GO NUTS. BECAUSE YOU AND I, WE'VE DONE WELL. BUT WE'VE DONE OKAY. THIS GUY --
Stephen: IT'S DAVE.
IT'S DAVE! HE OWNS THE ENTIRE STATE OF MONTANA, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: OH, YEAH. HE HAD THE WHOLE THING WAXED.
HE HAS-- HE'S A VERY WEALTHY MAN AND HE'S GOT, YOU KNOW, HIS FINGERS IN EVERY POT, IF THAT'S EVEN AN EXPRESSION!
Stephen: IT'S NOT.
IT'S NOT. THAT WAS TERRIBLE. I'M SORRY.
Stephen: UNLESS THE POT HAS PIE IN IT.
IT'S TUESDAY. IT'S EARLY IN THE WEEK AND I HAVE TROUBLE-- IT'S WEDNESDAY.
Stephen: IT'S FRLDZ.
WE'LL FIX THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NO! YOU DON'T EDIT THAT OUT! YOU KEEP THAT IN! THAT'S THE MAGIC! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN, COLBERT! ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: SO, THE TRUCK CAN'T GET ON THE LOT.
HE'S GETTING ME BACK ON TRACK. ALL RIGHT. TRUCK CAN'T GET ON THE LOT, AND I'M GOING CRAZY. BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE, HE'S A CAR GUY. THIS GUY HAS PORSCHES. I'M THINKING HE'S GIVING ME A VINTAGE PORSCHE.
Stephen: SURE.
MY MIND WENT THERE. THIS IS AMAZING. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET THE CRAZY LEATHER GLOVES. THEN THEY TELL ME IT'S HERE, IT'S READY. I WALK DOWNSTAIRS OUTSIDE MY STAGE. TWO COWBOYS IN FULL CHAPS, COWBOY HATS, HOLDING THE BIGGEST, MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE-- HORSE-- HORSE! ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVE EVER SEEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU RIDE HORSES?
NO! I DON'T RIDE HORSES! AND HERE'S THE THING, THEY HAND ME A LOVELY NOTE FROM DAVE. THEY SAY GOOD-BYE, AND THEY LEAVE. LOOK AT MY EXPRESSION AFTER THEY'VE LEFT! LOOK AT THE EXPRESSION ON MY FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A HORSE. TURNS OUT, I LOOK INTO IT. YOU GOTTA FEED HIM. YOU'VE GOT TO BOARD THEM. YOU'VE GOT TO TREAT THEM HUMANELY. EVERYONE I TELL SAYS, "IT'S FROM DAVID LETTERMAN." AND GUESS WHAT THE HORSE'S NAME IS? DAVE! THANK YOU!
Stephen: WAS IT REALLY DAVE? YES, THE HORSE'S REALLY NAME IS DAVE.
Stephen: DOES IT ANSWER--
HE SEARCHED ALL OF THE WORLD FOR A HORSE NAMED DAVE! NARCISSISM, MAYBE, AND SO THEN --
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A FARM?
NO, I DON'T HAVE A FARM! ( LAUGHTER ) STEPHEN, YOU KNOW ME. I DON'T HAVE A FARM.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED --
I BARELY HAVE A HOUSE.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED TO YOUR HOUSE.
I'VE INVESTED VERY POORLY. INSANITY-- I HAVE TO ROOM IT. I HAVE TO BOARD IT. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? DAVE GAVE ME A HORSE. I'M GOING TO LEARN HOW TO RIDE IT. I GO TO THE PLACE WHERE I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY TO LEARN HOW TO RIDE IT. AND THEY SAID I WOULDN'T GET ON THAT HORSE IF I WERE YOU. I SAID WHY NOT? THEY SAID THAT HORSE IS CRAZY. THIS IS 100% TRUE. THEY SAID THAT HORSE IS SO CRAZY, IT'S THROWN TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO RIDE IT. IF YOU WANT CAN TO KEEP IT HERE YOU HAVE TO GET A LETTER DRAWN UP BY A LAWYER, AN EXPENSIVE LAWYER, TO INDEMNIFY YOU IN CASE THE HORSE HURTS SOMEBODY. AT THIS POINT ONE OF THE CHILDREN IS NOT BEING SCHOOLED THIS COSTS SO MUCH. IT WAS THE BOY. IT WASN'T GOING TO, WITH OUT ANYWAY. HE'S GOOD WITH HIS HANDS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE THING IS, THEY SAY-- I SAY TO THE GUY, LIKE, THIS HORSE PROBABLY GETTING KIND OF OLD, THOUGH, RIGHT? HE WENT, "OH, NO! THIS IS A YOUNG HORSE. IT'S GOING TO LIVE A LONG TIME!" ( LAUGHTER ) I'M GOING INSANE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IT'S DRANK-- IT COSTS A FORTUNE, AND I HAVE THE HORSE FOR TWO YEARS. FINALLY, MY WIFE CRACKS IT, GOD BLESS HER. SHE FOUND A PLACE-- AND THIS IS NOT A JOKE. I HAVE THE REAL WEBSITE, WHERE THE HORSE CAN LIVE-- IT'S AN EQUINE MASSAGE CENTER WHERE-- THIS IS REAL. THINK FOUR SEASONS RESORT FOR HORSE. WE DONATED THE HORSE. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS STUDENTS MASSAGE THE HORSE ALL DAY LONG SO IT LEARNS-- SO THEY LEARN HOW TO MASSAGE A HORSE. AND SO --
Stephen: BUT IT'S AN INSANE HORSE.
IT'S AN INSANE HORSE, BUT NO ONE IS RIDING IT. IT'S GETTING MASSAGED ALL DAY LONG. IF I WAS THE HORSE, I WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS THINKING, "THEY'RE TENDERIZING ME." BIT NO, MASSAGE ALL DAY LONG. THE HORSE IS IN HEAVEN. THIS IS A REAL PICTURE OF DAVE THE HORSE AT THE MASSAGE CENTER, HAS MET AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER HORSE-- COINCIDENTALLY NAMED CHARLIE ROSE. THAT'S A TRUE STORY!
Stephen: WOW, WOW!
THAT IS A TRUE STORY. ( LAUGHTER ) I LEARNED THEN --
Stephen: I DON'T-- I DON'T CARE IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT. I INN JOYED IT SO MUCH.
I KNOW. I LEARNED THEN THAT DAVE WAS A GENIUS, BUT HE'S AN EVIL GENIUS. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING.
Stephen: ( SIGHS ).
YOU GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT? IT'S ALL GOING TO BE GOOD.
Stephen: I FEEL VERY GOOD.
IS THIS MINE?
Stephen: THAT'S YOURS RIGHT THERE. THIS IS LIKE A VACATION. I ASKED YOU ONE QUESTION AND WE'RE-- HOW MANY MINUTES-- WE'RE NINE MINUTES IN TO YOUR ANSWER. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN YOU GET A GUEST LIKE YOU, HOW EXCITED ARE YOU WHEN YOU GET A GUEST LIKE YOU. YOU'RE LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. I DON'T HAVE HAVE TO DO ANYTHING."
I DON'T GET GUESTS LIKE ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: YOU BOTH COMPLIMENTED YOURSELF AND INSULTED YOUR SHOW.
I COMPLIMENTED MYSELF-- I COMPLIMENTED MYSELF WHILE PUTTING DOWN MY SHOW, AND THEN WAVED TO A CROWD. THAT WAS THE TRIPLE-- THAT WAS THE TRIFECTA RIGHT THERE. THAT'S RARELY BEEN DONE.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE CONAN O'BRIEN. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED CONAN O'BRIEN. YOU IS HAVE GONE TO SEVEN COUNTRIES IN LAST TWO YEARS.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: YOU WENT TO CUBA.
YUP.
Stephen: ARMENNIA. QATAR, SOUTH KOREA, GERMANY, MEXICO, AND MOST RECENTLY YOU WENT TO ISRAEL.
YUP, YUP.
Stephen: INCREDIBLE TRIP.
YUP.
Stephen: I LOVE FOLLOWING IT, AND YOU POSTED IT ON TWITTER, TOO. WHAT DID YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT GOING TO ISRAEL? BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC IDEA, YOU GO TO BE A COMMON FOOL, YOU KNOW, FOR-- FOR TWO PEOPLE WHO DONT TALK TO EACH OTHER OTHER LIKE THE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS. YOU'RE THE COMMON ELEMENT AND THEY BOTH THINK YOU'RE RIDICULOUS, I IMAGINE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD HAVE PUT IT, BUT YES.
Stephen: I MEANT THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.
I KNOW. I-- I LOVE-- MY GREATEST JOY IS TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH THAT DON'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH, DON'T KNOW WHO I AM. I LOVE THAT. I LOVE GOING TO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THIS IDEA STARTED VERY NATURALLY WHEN WE WENT TO CUBA AND THEN IT SORT OF TOOK OFF FROM THERE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF QUASI-DIPLOMACY THROUGH COMEDY. I LIKE TO SHOW THAT AMERICANS ARE CURIOUS. WE'RE HUMBLE. WE'RE OKAY TO LOOK RIDICULOUS. IT'S OKAY IF YOU LAUGH AT US. BECAUSE --
Stephen: EVERY TIME I SEE YOU DOING ONE OF THESE, I THINK, "OH, DAMN IT, THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA" I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE STOLEN SOMETHING GREAT FROM THE REST OF US.
YES, MORE OR LESS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: REALLY, HONESTLY.
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS NICE IS THAT IT'S-- IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS ENERGIZED ME THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IT'S GIVEN ME-- SINCE WE STARTED DOING IT, I LOVE IT SO MUCH, THAT IT GIVES ME, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO GETS TO MY POINT WITH ONE OF THESE SHOWS MIGHT THINK IT'S TIME TO GO JOIN THE HORSE AT THE EQUINE MASSAGE SCHOOL.
Stephen: SOUNDS GOOD.
I HAVE ALL OF THIS ENERGY NOW, BECAUSE I ABSOLUTELY LOVE DOING IT, AND THEY LET US GO ANYWHERE. WHEN I SHOW UP WITH A CAMERA CREW, THEY LET US INTO PLACES THAT NORMALLY THEY WOULDN'T LET OTHER PEOPLE --
Stephen: YOU WERE IN THE HOLY LAND.
WE WERE IN THE HOLY LAND --
Stephen: ROMAN CATHOLIC.
YUP.
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT LIKE? DID YOU GO TO THE VIA DEL LA ROALSA.
WE ASKED, IS IT OKAY IF WE SEE THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY? AND THEY SAID YES. THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY, THIS IS WHERE THEY SAY THAT CHRIST WAS BORN ON THIS SPOT.
Stephen: THE MANGER?
THEY SAY THE MANGER IS DOWN THERE. AND THEY SAID, "COME ON IN. YOU CAN COME IN, AND YOU CAN COME DOWN WITH YOUR CAMERA CREW AND WITH YOUR SOUND OPERATOR. YOU CAN COME DOWN AND SHOOT THIS FOR YOUR SHOW. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WE KNOW YOU HAVE COME TO ISRAEL ON THIS MISSION OF PEACE. COME ON DOWN." WE START GOING DOWN LONG, WINDING STEPS-- BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING CHURCH, AND THEN IT GETS CLAUSTROPHOBIC, INTO THE GROUND, SPIRALG. I HAVE A CAMERAMAN WITH A BIG CAMERA. I HAVE A SOUND GUY WHO HAS A GIANT MACHINE STRAPPED TO HIS CHEST WITH SOUND DIALS AND HE HAS A LONG BOOM MICROPHONE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ONE. IT'S LIKE SIX FEET LONG-- I'LL BUY YOU ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S GOT, LIKE, A BIG FLUFFY MIC AT THE END, AND THAT'S HOW HE GETS THE SOUND. WE'RE GOING DOWN THE STEPS, AND I'M NOIG THE THING SWINGING AROUND KIND OF WILDLY. AND WE GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. AND THEY SAY, "THIS IS, THIS IS THE SITE WHERE CHRIST WAS BORN." AND IT'S VERY POWERFUL. THEY'RE SHOWING YOU, "THIS IS WHERE CHRIST WAS BORN." AND MY SOUND GUY IS STRUGGLING WITH HIS BIG, LONG STICK. AND I DON'T WANT TO SELL HIM OUT AND GIVE HIS NAME OR ANYTHING BUT IT'S JASON MIEWN YEZ. HIS GOD NUMBER IS 21445. HE'S DOING THE BEST HE CAN. AND THEY SAY, "THIS IS WHERE CHRIST WAS BORN." AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER STAR ABOUT FIVE FEET AWAY AND THEY SAY, "THIS IS WHERE HE WAS LAID IN THE MANGER. THEY SAY THIS IS WHERE CHRIST WAS BORN, AND I SEE JASON SWING AROUND WITH THE BOOM, HIT AN 800-YEAR-OLD LAMP, HOT OIL OFF THE CANDLES. DOWN ON JASON, SOME GOT ON THE PRIEST, HE WAS FINE. AND THE THING IS EEK-EEK. AND THE GUY IS SAYING, OVER HERE IS WHERE-- "THREE STOOGES" SKETCH, WHAM! BANG! I'M SURE SOMEWHERE CHRIST IS LIKE, "GET HIM OUT OF THERE! GET HIM OUT! GET HIM!
Stephen: SOMEWHERE? CHRIST IS SOMEWHERE SAYING THAT? HE'S EVERYWHERE SAYING THAT.
HE'S SOME PLACE SPECIFIC IN MY MIND.
Stephen: OKAY.
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT THEORIES ABOUT WHERE CHRIST MAY BE EXACTLY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T DESTROY THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY. GOT OUT OF THERE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.
Stephen: NOBODY MEANS TO.
I I AM TELLING-- ( LAUGHTER ) I AM TELLING YOU, I AM TELLING ALL COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT SEE THIS, LET US IN. LET ME IN. DON'T LET THE SOUND GUY IN. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK. I'M SORRY, BUT WE DO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE CONAN O'BRIEN, DON'T GO ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WE'RE BACK HERE WITH CONAN O'BRIEN. NOW, WE DID THIS PUBER ME CHALLENGE LAST WEEK, PUERTO RICO RELIEF. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD ONES. THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD ONES OUT THERE, BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THAT WAS VISIBLE FROM SPACE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) UN-BELIEVABLE. UN-BELIEVABLE.
WHAT A SWEET KID. THAT'S A KID THAT DREAMED ONE DAY I'LL HAVE A HORSE.
Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT QUITE MAKING CONTACT WITH THE LENS. YOU'RE FALLING SLOWLY IN LOVE WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S LEFT SHOULDER THERE. SO THIS LITTLE BOY WENT ON TO BE A SERIOUS KID AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, WANTED TO BE A SERIOUS WRITER, I UNDERSTAND.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE A-- YOU'RE A BIG FLANNERY O'CONNOR FAN, I UNDERSTAND.
YES.
Stephen: SO AM I.
THAT'S REALLY NICE.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FLANNERY O'CONNOR SHORT STORY.
PROBABLY "A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND."
Stephen: THAT'S GREAT. "THE ENDURING CHILL" FOR ME.
I ALSO LOVE "WISE BLOOD." AND WE ARE LOSING AUDIENCE SO FAST RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: THEY TURNED OFF THE CAMERAS HALFWAY THROUGH THAT HORSE STORY. IT'S JUST-- ALL OF THIS-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU WANTED TO BE A SERIOUS WRITER. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE--
I'M NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS NOW. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! NO, I'M KIDDING. NO, IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO COMEDY I VERY MUCH DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW-- PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME WHEN I GOT THE LATE-NIGHT SHOW, AND I GOT IT SO ABRUPTLY, NOBODY KNEW WHO I WAS. AND THE ONE THING THEY FOUND OUT IS THAT I HAD GONE TO HARVARD AND I WAS HORRIFIED BY THAT.
Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THINK, "OH! HE'S ONE OF THOSE. HE'S GOING TO COME ON THE AIR WITH A PIPE. HE'S GOING TO THINK HE'S BETTER THAN US. AND I BET HE'S A REAL CREEP." SORRY, HARVARD, BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I HAD WORKED VERY HARD. I HAD BEEN A VERY SERIOUS-- I WAS FUNNY WITH MY FRIENDS, BUT I WAS A REALLY HARDWORKING KID, AND I HAD WORKED REALLY HARD, AND I HAD GONE TO THIS SCHOOL AND I WAS VERY PROUD OF THE WORK I HAD DONE AND THEN I WANTED TO BE A SERIOUS WRITER AND THEN I GOT INVOLVED IN COMEDY WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. WHEN I GRADUATED MY PARENTS GAVE ME A HARVARD CLASS SIGNET RING. AND I PUT IT ON MY FINGER AND WORE IT WHEN I GRADUATED IN 1985. I WAS 22 YEARS OLD. AND I GO OUT TO L.A. TO GET STARTED IN COMEDY. I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. I WAS LIVING IN A $380-A-MONTH APARTMENT AT THE TIME AND I FELL IN WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER COMEDY WRITER. THEY HAD, "DO YOU WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL WITH US. YOU ARE TALL?" I SAID YES-- THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT QUALIFIED ME. I STARTED PLAYING PICKUP GAMES IN BASKETBALL WITH IMPROVISORS AND COMEDIANS. AND WE WOULD DO IT IN DIFFERENT VENUES, AND ONE DAY THEY PICKED A VENUE THAT WAS SORT IN EAST L.A. AND I HAD NEVER BEEN IN THAT PART OF TOWN BEFORE. I GO THERE, AND I'M PLAYING BASKETBALL AND I WAS HAVING A GO TIME AND SOMEONE PASSME THE BALL REALLY FAST, AND IT JAMS UP MY FINGER. I FORGOT TO TAKE OFF THE RING WHICH I USUALLY DID. AND THE HANDS STARTS TO SWELL UP AROUND THE RING. AND SOMEBODY SAID,, YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND GET THAT OFF IT'S A PROBLEM." AND I SAID, "I CAN'T." THEY SAID, "YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM." I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND IT'S A TOUGH EMERGENCY ROOM. THERE'S REAL STUFF GOG THERE. THEY PUT ME IN A ROOM-- AND I SWEAR TO GOD THIS IS A REAL STORY. I'M STANDING THERE-- I'M 22-YEAR-OLD ME. I'M STANDING THERE AND I'M HOLD MIGHT GO HAND AND A WOMAN COMES IN WITH A CLIP BOARD AND GOES, "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?" THE GUY SAYS, "I GOT SHOT IN THE FACE. A GUY SHOT ME IN THE FACE WITH A .22 AND IT WENT THROUGH MY CHEEK." "WHAT'S YOUR STORY?" "THERE WERE TWO PIT BULLS FIGHTING AND I TRIED TO BREAK IT UP AND THEY TORE THE FLESH OFF MY ARM." "WHAT'S YOUR STORY?" "MY FRIEND THREWASID ON ME." AND SHE SAID, "YOU." AND EVERYONE LOOKED AT ME AND I SAID, "THE RING! THE HARVARD RING IS TIGHT! IT'S A TIGHT RING! LAYOFF LAU( LAUGHTER ) THEY CUT IT OFF. THEY MADE ME WAIT FOR HOURS. THEY CUT IT OFF AND BENT IT BACK NINE TIMES LIKE, "SCREW YOU, BUDDY!" AND GAVE IT BACK TO ME. IT LOOKED LIKE A LITTLE-- IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD RE-ENTERED ORBIT WHEN THEY WERE DONE WITH IT.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL HAVE THE RING?
I DON'T. IT WAS USELESS TO ME AFTERWARDS. I THINK I THREW IT AT SOMEONE IN RAGE.
Stephen: WELL, LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I DO LOVE YOU, FRIEND.
Stephen: I LOVE YOU, TOO.
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. CONGRATULATIONS.

DO YOU SEE ANY HOPE IN THE TERRIBLE NEWS?
YOU KNOW, I-- THAT IS THE KEY WORD. "I HOPE." AND I FEEL LIKE THERE IS HOPE. I FEEL LIKE IT'S CRACKING THE GLASS. BUT IT'S ALSO SNAG NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED TO-- CONTINUE TO DISCUSS IT AND PUSH IT FORWARD. AND FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT-- IT'S HAPPENING. IT'S-- YOUR HEROES, YOUR PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH, FAMILY MEMBERS-- YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME FORWARD.
