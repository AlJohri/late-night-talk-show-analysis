Stephen: GOOD EVENING. BEFORE WE BEGIN THE SHOW, I NEED TO ADDRESS A CONTROVERSY. LAST NIGHT'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION KEYNOTE SPEAKER MELANIA TRUMP HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING PORTIONS OF HER SPEECH FROM MICHELLE OBAMA'S APPEARANCE AT THE 2008 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. I DON'T THINK THIS IS MRS. TRUMP'S FAULT. I THINK HER SPEECHWRITERS ARE TO BLAME, AND YET NO ONE HAS LOST THEIR JOBS. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEONE IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHO ENJOYED FIRING PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WELL, I DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT, BUT DONALD AND MELANIA ARE FRIENDS. WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT, "THE LATE SHOW" HAS SECURED THE FIRST EXCLUSIVE APPEARANCE BY MRS. TRUMP TO ADDRESS THE CONTROVERSY. PLEASE WELCOME MELANIA TRUMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME, MRS. TRUMP. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A STATEMENT.
YES, THAT IS TRUE.
Stephen: AND THIS WAS WRITTEN BY THE SAME STAFFERS WHO WROTE LAST NIGHT'S SPEECH?
YES, I WROTE IT.
Stephen: THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THIS IS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- THIS IS TRULY THE BEST OF TIMES, IT IS THE WORST OF TIMES. I DID NOT PLAGIARIZE MY SPEECH LAST NIGHT. I WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING. I WOULD NOT, COULD NOT WITH A GOAT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I COULD NOT, WOULD NOT ON A BOAT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THAT IS BECAUSE I LEARNED HONESTY DURING MY HUMBLE UPBRINGING:  IN WEST PHILADELPHIA, I WAS BORN AND RAISED -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU! ON THE PLAYGROUND IS WHERE I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS. SO TO THOSE WHO SAY I STOLE MY SPEECH, I SAY GIVE ME A BREAK. GIVE ME A BREAK. BREAK ME OFF A PIECE OF THAT KIT KAT BAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE OUR LIVES, BUT THEY WILL NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE. YOU GOTTA FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO PARTY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE. HAKUNA MATATA. BA DA BA DA DA -- I'M LOVING IT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) OH, AND ONE MORE THING -- LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY --
Stephen: NO!
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, KATHRYN HAHN, AND N.A.F., FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016 NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION! ♪ WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND ♪ ♪ WE'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING TILL THE END ♪ ♪ WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS ♪ ♪ WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS ♪ ♪ NO TIME FOR LOSERS ♪ ♪ BECAUSE WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS ♪ ♪ OF THE WORLD ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN ]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU! PLEASE! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER! HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ALSO LIVE RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO THANK MELANIA TRUMP FOR STOPPING BY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND LAURA, FOR SOME REASON. (APPLAUSE) LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE BIG NEWS TONIGHT -- THE REPUBLICAN DELEGATES OFFICIALLY ELECTED THEIR NOMINEE. SPOILER ALERT FOR ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ENDS -- IT'S TRUMP. AS IS TRADITION, EACH STATE VOTED, AND WE LEARNED THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT NORMALLY YOU CAN ONLY GET BY OPENING 50 BOTTLES OF SNAPPLE.
AMERICAN SAMOA -- THE GREATEST EXPORTER OF N.F.L. PLAYERS.
ARKANSAS -- BIRTHPLACE OF JOHNNY CASH AND AL GREEN.
KENTUCKY -- THE HOME OF CHURCHILL DOWNS AND AMERICAN PHARAOH AND THE SOURCE OF BLUEGRASS MUSIC.
MARYLAND -- HOME TO THE OLDEST STATE CAPITAL IN CONTINUOUS USE.
MISSOURI -- THE BIRTHPLACE OF TALK RADIO.
NEBRASKA -- THE NUMBER ONE BEEF PRODUCING STATE IN THE UNION.
THE GREAT STATE OF CONNECTICUT -- THE LAND WHERE WE MANUFACTURE PEZ. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I DUNNO, I'M PRETTY SURE PEZ COMES FROM DARTH VADER'S NECK. AND THE MOMENT TRUMP SECURED THE NOMINATION, THE CELEBRATION KICKED OFF IN STYLE WITH A GIANT GOLD SCREEN THAT DECLARED "OVER THE TOP!" WHICH WAS EITHER DECLARING VICTORY OR INDICATING THE DIRECTION TRUMP COMBS HIS HAIR. AND THEN FACED WITH THIS NEW REALITY, THE CERTAINTY TRUMP WAS THE NOMINEE, SPEAKER PAUL RYAN STEPPED UP TO THE MIC AND ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED THE FEELINGS OF SO MANY AMERICANS.
SHHHHHHH --
Stephen: -- IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HAVING SECURED THE NOMINATION, TRUMP BRIEFLY ADDRESSED AMERICA FROM THE LOBBY OF HIS BATHROOM.
WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER, WE HAVE TO RESTORE, AND QUICKLY, LAW AND ORDER, AMONG MANY, AND JUST SO MANY OTHER THINGS.
Stephen: YES, WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER AND MANY AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS! LIKE LAW AND ORDER CRIMINAL INTENT, AND "LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT." THEY'RE ALL GOOD SHOWS. WE MISS YOU, MARISKA HARGITAY. AND HE KNEW JUST HOW MONUMENTAL THE NIGHT WAS.
TOGETHER WE'VE ACHIEVED HISTORIC RESULTS, WITH THE LARGEST VOTE TURTLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
Stephen: NO, YOUR EARS DON'T DECEIVE YOU, HE DID SAY "VOTE TURTLE?" NOT A FLUB. HE WAS JUST INTRODUCING THE NEXT SPEAKER. SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL. (APPLAUSE) HE'S THE LARGEST VOTE TURTLE! HE'S THE LARGEST VOTE TURTLE IN AMERICA! MCCONNELL SPOKE FROM THE THEME OF "MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAIN." THAT WAS THE THEME TONIGHT. LOTTA GREAT SPEAKERS ON THAT THEME -- DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND TIFFANY TRUMP BOTH PROVIDED EXAMPLES OF HOW HARD-WORKING AMERICANS JUST NEED TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND BE BORN INTO A BILLIONAIRE'S FAMILY.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE. OKAY? PULL YOURSELF UP BY YOUR DAD'S BOOT STRAPS, AND THEY'RE NICE BOOT STRAPS. THEY'RE THE BEST. DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED, FOUR-STAR BOOT STRAPS. (APPLAUSE) AND NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE -- (LAUGHTER) YES, ALWAYS A CROWD FAVORITE. CHRISTIE OPENED WITH SOME NICE WORDS ABOUT THE NOMINEE.
WE ARE ABOUT TO BE LED BY NOT ONLY A STRONG LEADER BUT BY A CARING, GENUINE AND DECENT PERSON.
Stephen: YEAH, CERTAINLY NOT THE KIND OF GUY WHO PROMISES YOU VP AND THEN LEAVES YOU HANGING FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT UNTIL FRIDAY MORNING! A DECENT MAN WOULDN'T DO THAT! THEN CHRISTIE REALLY FIRED UP THE CROWD WITH A SUPER FUN GAME.
HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE AWFUL JUNG AND CHARACTER OF A DICTATOR BUTCHER IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IS SHE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY? HILLARY CLINTON AS AN INEPT NEGOTIATE OF THE WORST AMERICAN ARMS DEAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS SHE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
AUDIENCE:  GUILTY! GUILTY! GUILTY!
Stephen: CHRIS CHRISTIE PROMISING TERRIFYING SHOW TRIALS BEFORE A MINDLESS SCREAMING MOB WITH NO PRESENTATION FOR THE DEFENSE, SPOOKING OR NOT SPOOKY?
AUDIENCE:  SPOOKY!
Stephen: Y'ALL ARE SPOOKY. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ THERE IT IS. BIG NIGHT.
Jon: BIG NIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S A BIG NIGHT. IT IS NOW OFFICIAL. THERE IT IS. TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE. YOU CANNOT UNCARVE THAT PUMPKIN. YOU CAN'T UN-CANDY THAT I AM. YOU CANNOT UNCANDY THAT YAM. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS, YEAH, WE KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN, BUT THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FLOOR FIGHT. BIKERS CHAIN-WHIPPING THE RULES COMMITTEE. TED CRUZ TRYING TO CUT OUT REINCE PRIEBUS' EYEBALL WITH A BROKEN BOTTLE. WE WERE PROMISED EXCITEMENT! BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENED. THEY VOTED. HE GOT IT. THAT'S IT. LET ME ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU HOW -- NO, NO, THERE IS STILL EXCITEMENT OUT THERE. LET ME ILLUSTRATE TO YOU HOW BORING THIS WAS. WE'VE GOT A SOCIAL MEDIA TEAM ON THE GROUND IN CLEVELAND ALL THIS WEEK, AND YESTERDAY FOR TWO HOURS ON FACEBOOK LIVE, THEY STREAMED FOOTAGE OF THE CONDIMENT STATION AT THE CONVENTION. YOUR KETCHUP, MUSTARD, RELISH, STUFF LIKE THAT. HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED DELEGATES PUTTING KETCHUP ON THEIR HOT DOGS. PROVING WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A BIT OF A SAUSAGE FEST. (APPLAUSE) ♪ AND THEN AN HOUR AND 50 MINUTES IN -- AND THIS IS TRUE -- OUR CONDIMENT CAM CAUGHT FOX NEWS ANCHOR BRET BAIER -- FRIEND OF THE SHOW -- FILLING A WATER BOTTLE WITH MUSTARD. IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE! (LAUGHTER) JIMMY, PLAY THAT AGAIN. THERE HE IS PUMPING TWO PUMPS OF MUSTARD INTO HIS BOTTLE. AND HE KIND OF LOOKS AROUND BEFORE HE LEAVES! (LAUGHTER) WHY IS BRET BAIER HOARDING MUSTARD? WHAT DOES HE KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW? I CAN'T JUDGE THE MAN. WE REPORT, YOU DECIDE. BUT THIS IS THE BIGGEST CONDIMENT SCANDAL TO COME OUT OF FOX NEWS SINCE ROGER AILES  WAS CAUGHT SPANKING THE BOTTOM OF A KETCHUP BOTTLE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAY ABOUT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN IS HE HAS SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THE BREADTH OF HIS APPEAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HE WON MORE VOTES THAN ANYONE EXPECTED BUT THERE IS ONE GROUP HE'S HAD TROUBLE REACHING, AFRICAN-AMERICANS. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST POLLS, DONALD TRUMP HAS 0% SUPPORT FROM BLACK VOTERS IN OHIO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 0%! GOOSE EGG! THAT'S THE SAME ROTTEN TOMATOES SCORE AS "LEPRECHAUN 4. IN SPACE ," WHICH IS UNFAIR BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT LEPRECHAUN HAS NEVER DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. BUT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN PERSON ATTENDING THE CONVENTION. WE GOT AHOLD OF HIM. PLEASE WELCOME, LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM THE QUICKEN LOANS ARENA, FRANK WALTERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR BEING HERE! GOOD TO SEE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOW!
I'M EXCITED! PLEASURE TO BE HERE, STEPHEN. LOOK AT THIS FESTIVE ATMOSPHERE! WHOO-WEE!
Stephen: YOU DO SEEM HAPPY, FRANK. NOW, FRANK, "YOU'RE" AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN...
SO THEY TELL ME!
Stephen: AND ARE YOU HAVING A FUN TIME THIS WEEK, FRANK?
IT'S BEEN AMAZING. CHRIS CHRISTIE BURNED A WITCH EARLIER. BEN CARSON WAS JUGGLING BRAINS. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS ENTERTAINING! GEE WILAKERS!
Stephen: I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE STREET LINGO THERE, FRANK. IT'S A FAMILY SHOW.
OH, HECK, I'M SORRY!
Stephen: HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING ONE OF THE FEW AFRICAN-AMERICANS THERE?
IT'S INCREDIBLE. FROM THE MOMENT I GOT HERE, EVERYONE IS SO NICE. THEY GAVE ME A HAT, THEY GAVE ME A SHIRT. THEY'RE ALWAYS PUT MEG ON CAMERA FOR SOME REASON! I'VE NEVER BEEN SO POPULAR! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WOW, THAT'S REALLY NICE.
YEAH! PEOPLE KEEP COMING UP TO ME AND SAYING, "THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE! THEY KEEP ON SAYING, YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES. YOU'RE ARTICULATE, YOU'RE BRIGHT THE COMPLIMENTS KEEP COMING, STEPHEN. THEY EVEN INVITED ME TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT PARTIES. THEY KEEP SAYING, "WE NEED YOU THERE!" IT'S AMAZING!
Stephen: WELL, YOU DO LOOK LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME. WHAT DREW YOU TO THE CONVENTION? WHAT IS IT FISCAL CONSERVATISM? SOCIAL CONSERVATISM?
OH, I JUST CAME BY HERE LOOKING FOR POKEÉMON. THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, I THINK I SEE ONE. WHAT, OFFICER? NO, IT'S JUST MY PHONE. PUT MY HANDS BEHIND MY HEAD? WHAT?
Stephen: IS EVERYTHING OKAY, FRANK?
HOLD ON, STEPHEN. I'M CONFUSED. DO YOU WANT ME TO FREEZE OR GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR SHUT THE -- SHUT UP? I'M JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY. ALL RIGHT, SEE YA LATER. ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: HAVE A GREAT TIME, FRANK. FRANK WALTERS, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KATHRYN HAHN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪  CLARIFY.
Stephen: FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT CO-CREATED AND CO-STARRED IN ONE OF THE GREATEST SKETCH SERIES OF ALL TIME "KEY & PEELE." HE NOW PLAYS A YOUNG IMPROV COMEDIAN IN THE MOVIE ""DON'T THINK TWICE".
WE'RE AUDITIONING ON THURSDAY FOR WEEKEND LIVE.
CONGRATS, MAN. THANKS, MAN. YOU KNOW WHICH BIT YOU'RE GONNA DO?
WE JUST HEARD, LIKE, TEN MINUTES AGO.
YOU GOT TO DO ALEX RODRIGUES IN THE CELL PHONE STAR.
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT ONE. YOU GOT TO DO ROCK WHEN THE ROCK LOSES ALL THE WAY.
SLIM FAST ROCK. THE PEBBLE. CAN YOU SMELL WHAT THE PEBBLE'S COOKING?
NOT MUCH, AND THAT'S WHY I LOST THE WEIGHT.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ I'M A SOUL MAN ♪ ♪ I'M A SOUL MAN ♪ ♪ I'M A SOUL MAN ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! NICE TO HAVE YOU ON, MAN. YOU JUST MISSED IT, WE HAD ANOTHER BLACK GUY ON SATELLITE FEED. HAD A GOOD TIME AT THE CONVENTION.
SEEMED LIKE THE AUDIENCE WAS CONCERNED FOR HIM AT THE END THERE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU KNOW, THINGS BEING WHAT THEY ARE.
THINGS BEING WHAT THEY ARE.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE IN A SECOND BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN IMPROV AND YOU AND RIBOTH OUT OF CHICAGO.
SECOND CITY OF IMPROV (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND BEFORE WE DO THAT. DO YOU ACTUALLY FOLLOW POLITICS OR THE CONVENTIONS?
I'M TRYING TO WATCH AS MUCH OF THE CONVENTIONS AS I CAN BECAUSE I WAS PROMISED EXCITEMENT.
Stephen: EXACTLY, BLOOD SPORT.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF TRUMP AS WITHIN IMPROVISER? PEOPLE GET DISAPPOINTED WHEN HE'S ON SCRIPT AND THEY LOVE IT WHEN HE FLIES OFF THE CUFF.
I THINK HE'S A VERY GOOD STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IMPROVISER. HE DOESN'T FOLLOW ALL THE IMPROV RULES BUT THE OTHER DAY HE WAS IN A PLACE WHERE HE WAS SPEAKING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN OHIO AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER THING AND, WHO SEES THE MOSQUITO? YOU GUYS SEE THIS MOSQUITO? LOOK AT THE MOSQUITO. THE MOSQUITO'S GOING HIGH. GET OUT OF HERE, MOSQUITO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU, MOSQUITO, WHERE'S THE MONEY?
Stephen: DID HE SAY WHERE'S THE MONEY?
WHERE'S THE SKIT O'S MONEY? IS HE GOING TO SUPPORT THE CAMPAIGN, BUT HE WENT SAYING MOSQUITO ALL THE TIME AND THEN WENT OFF THE RAIL, THE MOSQUITO IS ON THE WALL, THE CEILING, THE CEILING IS HIGH, IT'S A WALL, NOT AS HIGH AS MY WALL WILL BE.
Stephen: FLYS FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER.
THE MIND IS FREE, IT'S NIMBLE.
Stephen: MIND IS FREE IS A KINDER WAY OF SAYING UNHINGED.
UNFETTERED MIND.
Stephen: UNFETTERED. IF HE DOESN'T GOVERN THE WAY HE SPEAKS -- I WONDER THE WAY HE WOULD GOVERN IF HE BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE.
I IMAGINE HE WILL SPEND EVERY SING DAILY GOING, WHERE'S MY SCEPTER? I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY SCEPTER YET!
Stephen: IT'S GOLD. IT'S GOLD, IT SHOULD BE NEAR THE THRONE. THIS IS JUST A REGULAR CHAIR.
Stephen: DO YOU GET THE SENSE WHEN HE CALLS INTO TELEVISION SHOWS AND THERE'S A PHOTO UP THERE, THAT HE'S ON THE TOILET? I'M ON THE THRONE RIGHT NOW.
I'M ON THE THRONE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GONNA WIN BIG, HUGE, GIGANTIC -- AND THEN.
Stephen: FLUSH! YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT HILLARY? ANY THOUGHTS?
HILLARY'S GOING TO BE FINE. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BOILER PLATE AS FAR AS THE CONVENTION. THE DEBATES ARE WHAT I CAN'T WAIT FOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OH, THAT WILL BE FANTASTIC.
BECAUSE HILLARY TRIES TO HIDE IT BUT SOMETIMES HILLARY DOES GREAT EYE ROLLS, SOMETIMES IF YOU WATCH. GOOD OLD FASHIONED STEVE HARVEY FAMILY FEUD EYE ROLLS. SOMEBODY GIVES THEM A NAME AND HE SAYS, SOMETHING YOU DON'T FIND IN THE CUPBOARD! AND SOMEBODY GOES, ELEPHANT! AND HE JUST GOES -- (LAUGHTER) LIKE HILLARY, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT. I'M GONNA LIVE ON A CLOUD -- AND THEN HILLARY IS -- (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU SHOULD ADVISE HER!
I JUST WANT TO TURN AND SAY, I'M ONLY 30 POINTS AHEAD?! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I JUST WANT TO SEE GOOD OLD FASHIONED NORMAN FELD, CIRCUIT 1983 ONE'S COMPANY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL, THE MOVIE IS CALLED "DON'T THINK TWICE," AND IT'S ABOUT -- WRITTEN BY MIKE BROBIGLIA.
SO TALENTED.
Stephen: AND IT'S AN IMPROV TROOP -- I WAS A MEMBER OF AN IMPROV TROUP.
SO WAS I.
Stephen: THEY ALWAYS HAVE ODD NAMES LIKE THIRD RAIL COLDY.
MY FAVORITE IS FROM AN OLD CAST MEMBER OF YOURS, HANS CHRISTIAN YES AND ERSON. I'M OUT OF SECOND CITY DETROIT WE'RE CALLED THE 313.
Stephen: THERE WAS ONE IN CHICAGO I LIKED CALLED A GIANT, CALLED L.B.J.K.K.K.K.
I LOVE THEM.
Stephen: THIS IS KIND OF LIKE YOUR LIFE PAUSE IT'S ABOUT A GUY WHO GETS SORT OF PLUCKED FROM A SMALL IMPROV AND HE CAN'T MAKE A LIVING AT ALL.
AND THERE ARE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ELEMENTS TO THE FILM IN REGARD TO MY LIFE AND CAREER. BUT THE BIGGEST THING THAT'S HARD IS EVERY RULE OF IMPROV IS THE OPPOSITE OF SHOW BUSINESS. GOT YOUR BACK, I'M THERE FOR MY PARTNER. SERVE THE OTHER PERSON.
Stephen: I FOLLOW THE FOUL LOYER OF THE SERVANT. YOU'RE MORE IMPORTANT THAN I AM.
THE OPPOSITE OF SHOW BUSINESS.
Stephen: EXACTLY! GET OUT OF MY WAY!
I NEED TO BE A STAR! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU WENT FROM IMPROV AND NOW YOU'RE A STAR. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT THIS GUY IS GOING THROUGH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL OR TALK TO THE REST TO HAVE THE TROUP BECAUSE HE WENT BIG TIME AND HE SORT OF LEFT THE FAMILY.
IT'S A FAMILY THAT HE'S MADE. AND THERE'S AN AMBIVALENCE THAT HE'S HAD SO HE'S TRYING TO GET EVERYONE FROM HIS TROUP, ALL JOBS ON THE SHOW HE'S ON. THE PROBLEM IS HE'S ON THE SHOW, TRYING TO GET THEM JOBS AND EVERYONE ON THE SHOW IS DON'T GET FIRED YOUR FIRST YEAR. JUST YOU, DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS, JUST YOU DON'T GET FIRED. HE'S CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO WORLDS AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
Stephen: HE'S SAYING YES, AND. EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF THAT.
AGREE AND ADD ON TO IT.
Stephen: EXACTLY. AND I ADD ON TO THAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT CAN BE THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHY TO LIVE YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU WERE, LIKE, A YOUNG IMPROVISER, DID YOU FIND THAT AFFECTING THE WAY YOU WOULD LIVE?
YES, EVERY DAY. WE WOULD FINISH THE SHOW AND SOMEONE WOULD SAY, DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BAR? YES, AND LET'S DRINK LOTS OF DRINKS.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT YOU WANT ME TO PUT IN MY MOUTH? YES, AND LET'S HAVE ANOTHER ROUND. IT'S A GAME FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER RESTRICT AND SAY YES TO EVERYTHING. I THINK IDEAS WORK AS A RULE WHEN YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. IF THERE'S A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GROW IN LIFE, MAYBE THAT'S GOOD. MAYBE DON'T YES AND EVERYTHING. WOULD YOU CARE FOR MORE HEROIN? YES, AND -- MAYBE DON'T YES AND THAT. BUT IN REGARD TO BEING COOPERATIVE AND DOING SOMETHING COLLABORATIVE, IT'S SUPER HELP.
Stephen: DID YOU TEACH IMPROV.
I DID.
Stephen: I FOUND -- I'M INTERRUPTING YOU -- I FOUND OUT -- BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT ME, BABY! (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE TO REVEAL TO THEM WHAT THEY CAN ALREADY DO.
EXACTLY. THEY USED TO SAY MICHELANGELO'S STATUE IS ALREADY INSIDE THAT SLAB OF GRANITE, YOU'VE JUST GOT TO LET IT OUT.
Stephen: DUDE, YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND, MAN. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE TO ASK -- SOMETHING HAPPENED, YOU WERE AT COLLEGE RECEIVING AN HONOR FROM A COMEDY GROUP.
YES,.
Stephen: AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND ONE OF OUR INTERNS HERE KAREN CHI WAS THERE. AND DO WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE? THIS WAS YOU AND YOU KISSED THIS YOUNG MAN AND THERE YOU GO, KAREN IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU, AND HERE WE GO, AND -- NOW YOU -- KISS KAREN. (CHEERING) WE GOT TO GO. (CHEERING) SO, KAREN, WE GOT TO GO! WHAT WAS IT? SO YOU PUT A HEAVY SMOOCH ON HER.
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE I WAS JUST ENDING THE --
BECAUSE I WAS JUST ENDING THE SCENE.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE SCENE ABOUT? GOT TO GO. MAKE IT QUICK.
MY FRIEND HAD AN AFFECTIONATE GRANDFATHER WHO SMOOCHED EVERYONE WHO LIVED ON THE STREET.
Stephen: HOW DID IT FEEL TO GET LIP LOCKEDLY KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY?
IT WAS VERY EXCITING. I ONLY HAD KISSED ONE OTHER BOY IN MY LIFE PRIOR TO THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ I USED TO TELL EVERYBODY 50% OF MY KISSES WERE WITH KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY.
Stephen: YES AND, MY FRIENDS! "DON'T THINK TWICE" COMES OUT THIS FRIDAY. KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A CLASSICALLY-TRAINED ACTRESS WHO PEED IN A URINE IN "STEPBROTHERS." HER NEW MOVIE IS "BAD MOMS."
LOOKING GOOD, JEFF. OH, THANKS. YEAH, YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT?
NO, NOT FOR, LIKE, TEN YEARS. YOUR BEIGE WINDBREAKER IS REALLY LIGHTING UP THE BOARD.
OH, THANKS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY VAGINA. BY, JEFF!
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME KATHRYN HAHN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
HI!
Stephen: WELCOME. HAPPY CONVENTIONS.
OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ON THE LIVE SHOW. AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONVENTIONS, IS THIS TRUE YOU'RE FROM CLEVELAND?
I AM.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE FAMILY THERE?
MY WHOLE FAMILY IS THERE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. EVERYONE IS THERE. IN THE '80s THERE WAS AN AD CAMPAIGN, IF NEW YORK'S AN APPLE, CLEVELAND IS A PLUM, WHICH WAS OUR CITY'S AD CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. YEAH.
Stephen: DO THEY LIKE THE FACT THE CONVENTION IS THERE? WHAT'S IT DOING TO THE CITY?
THEY'RE IN THE SUBURBS. MY DAD, I MEAN, I THINK BOTH ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE CLEANING UP OF PUBLIC SQUARE, THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT. BUT MY MOM IS, LIKE, OH, HONEY, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THERE, THE GUNS AND THE GAS MASKS, IT'S NUTS!
Stephen: HOW MANY WEEKENDS A YEAR DO YOU SPEND AT THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME?
I HAVE NEVER GONE!
Stephen: REALLY? NO!
Stephen: THEY HAVE THINGS JIMI HENDRIX TOUCHED.
MY MOM SAYS I'M NOT SPENDING 25 BUCKS TO SEE A SWEATY T-SHIRT ON PLEXIGLASS.
Stephen: IT'S APPARENTLY A PRETTY COOL PLACE.
IT'S APPARENTLY AMAZING. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND MELANIA RIGHT NOW. IF YOU WERE MARRIED TO DONALD TRUMP -- KEEP BREATHING -- AND HE AND HIS STAFF WERE TO LET YOU TELL A SPEECH THAT CLEARLY HAD PARTS THAT HAD BEEN CRIBBED, WOULD YOU LAY INTO HIM?
WELL, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THAT WOMAN HAS INFINITE, UNFATHOMABLE DEPTHS OF PATIENCE TO BE ABLE TO PUT UP WITH THAT BLOW-HARD CRAP FOR THAT MANY YEARS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE SHE WOULD BE --
Stephen: LOVE. IT'S REAL, TRUE LOVE.
Stephen: IT IS. IT IS. I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BE WORKING A MELANIA EYE TODAY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A LITTLE SMOKEY SMA DO GOING.
IT'S AN EASY LOOK FOR A SIMPLE MOM ON THE GO.
Stephen: THE MOVIE IS BA DA DMOMS," WHO GIVE UP TRYING TO BE PERFECT AND JUST LET HER RIP.
LET HER RIP -- RRRRIP!
Stephen: JUST FUN. (LAUGHTER) HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE?
19 AND COUNTING.
Stephen: YOU WEAR IT WELL. THANK YOU.
Stephen: MM-HMM. I HAVE TWO KIDS.
Stephen: AGES? ABOUT TO BE 7 AND 9.
Stephen: OKAY. YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU A GOOD MOM OR A BAD MOM, IN YOUR OPINION?
STEPHEN, I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN. I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, I DEFINITELY REMEMBER WHEN MY SON WAS NOT EVEN A YEAR -- I MEAN, HE WAS A LITTLE TEENY BABY, TEENY, CRYING SO HARD. I WAS, LIKE, WHAT'S HAPPENING? SWEATING PROFUSELY, HE WASN'T EATING AND I SAID, WHAT'S THE MATTER? THIS IS MY BAD MOM STORY. I LITERALLY OPENED HIS DIAPER BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS SENSITIVE TO URINE BECAUSE I HAD BEEN LETTING HIM SIT IN IT FOR DAYS.
Stephen: YOU WERE PICKLING HIM.
THE LITTLEST ONE OF MY HAIRS HAD WOUND ITSELF AROUND HIS BALLS, LIKE, FIVE TIMES. (LAUGHTER) HORRIBLE MOTHER! I STILL WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THINKING ABOUT THAT. ALMOST CASTRATED MY SON.
Stephen: YOU THINK YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THINKING ABOUT IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOUR SON IS GOING TO SAY TO THE THERAPIST, I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M ATTRACTED TO MESH BRIEFS, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS A THING FOR ME! (LAUGHTER)
YES, MOTHERHOOD.
Stephen: SO MUCH IS ASKED OF MOMS, AND YOU'RE A WORKING MOM.
YES.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN ACTRESS IN DEMAND. DO YOU FEEL LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE AT TIMES?
NO, IT'S VERY CLEAR. IT'S MY CLEAR, STEPHEN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO. YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
NO, NO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MOM DOESN'T WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND THINKS WHEN THEY HAVE TO LEAVE FOR WORK, THAT, AH! SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT THIS! IT'S SUCKS BUT I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A GIG.
Stephen: HAVE YOU DRAGGED THEM WITH THE SET AND TOLD THEM, MOMMY'S GOING TO PRETEND, DON'T EVER DO THE THINGS MOMMY'S GOING TO PRETEND TO DO.
IT'S SO AWFUL. THEY JUST LIKE THE CRAFTS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THEM WHEN YOU'RE WITH A PRETEND CHILD?
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING I'VE DONE NEVER. MOMMY'S BODY OF WORK IS NOT MEANT FOR CHILDREN, BUT THEY GET IT, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CIRCUS KIDS. THEY WERE BROUGHT UP IN A CIRCUS AND ARE TERRIFIC.
Stephen: I DIDN'T LET MY DAUGHTER SEE MY WORK IN THE OLD CASES SPECIAL WHEN I WAS PLAYING A CHARACTER. I WAS DOING THE CHARACTER INTO THE PHONE ONE DAY SAYING PRETTY TERRIBLE THINGS IN CHARACTER WHEN WE WERE WRITING THE SCRIPT. I GOT OFF THE PHONE AND SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING ME 20 MINUTES, LIKE THIS -- (LAUGHTER) AND THEN SHE SAID, I THINK I UNDERSTAND -- YOU DON'T MEAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I SAID, YES, DADDY DOESN'T MEAN WHAT HE'S SAYING FOR A LIVING. (LAUGHTER) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO HAVE MET YOU! "BAD MOMS" WILL BE IN THEATERS JULY 29. KATHRYN HAHN, EVERYBODY!
