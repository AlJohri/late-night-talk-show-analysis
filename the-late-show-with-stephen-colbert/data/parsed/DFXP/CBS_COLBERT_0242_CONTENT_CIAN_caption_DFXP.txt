YESTERDAY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED THAT DONALD TRUMP'S STAFF TOOK AWAY HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT. THE FOLLOWING IS A CARTOON REENACTMENT OF HIS REACTION.
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. 3:00 A.M., TIME FOR A TWEET STORM. LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN PINCH OUT. "CROOKED HILLARY ALONG WITH JAY-Z AND BEYONCE-Z TOTALLY INCITED VIOLENCE AT MY RALLIES. SAD. HASHTAG "99 PROBLEMS AND HILLARY IS ALL OF THEM." END TWEET. KELLYANNE, I CAN'T TWEETY TWEET.
DONALD, I TOLD YOU. YOUR TWITTER HAS BEEN DISABLED.
UNACCEPTABLE. I'LL TWEET ABOUT IT. "MY TWITTER HAS BEEN DISABLED. TOTALLY RIGGED BY THE MAINSTREAM TWEEDIA." OH, THAT'S GOOD. AND TWEET! KELLYANNE, WHY WON'T MY PHONE TWEET?
THAT'S NOT A PHONE, DONALD. IT'S A BAR OF SOAP.
OF COURSE IT'S A PHONE. IT SAYS DIAL RIGHT ON IT.
Announcer: TITS "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES DON CHEADLE! STEVIE WONDER! AND KATHERINE WATERSTON! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN ) THANK YOU, CHRIS, THANK YOU, PAUL, THANK YOU, MATT! THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. GOOD TO SEE YOU! WOW! NOT TOO BAD! YOU CAN FEEL IT! YOU CAN FEEL IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GOT THE JUMPER CABLES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND WE ARE LIVE TONIGHT FROM NEW YORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: THAT'S NOT TOO SHALL BY. MEANWHILE, IN PHILADELPHIA, HILLARY CLINTON HELD A HUGE RALLY IN FRONT OF INDEPENDENCE HALL WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. BRUCE TALKED ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AND TRADE POLICY. HILLARY, AS ALWAYS, CLOSED WITH THUNDER ROAD. TRUMP, ON THE OTHER TINY HAND SPOKE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HAD A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.
TOM BRADY, HE CALLED TODAY, AND HE SAID, DONALD, I SUPPORT YOU, YOU'RE MY FRIEND AND I VOTED FOR YOU.
STEPHEN: NO SURPRISE BRADY IS A TRUMP FAN, BECAUSE DONALD APPEARS TO BE UNDER-INFLATED. ( CHEERING ) TO GET A GOOD GRIP. ( LAUGHTER ) AND LAST NIGHT TRUMP HAD "THE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN OF INSANE BOWHUNTERS," TED NUGENT, AND THE NUGE DID NOT DISAPPOINT.
I GOT YOUR BLUE STATE RIGHT HERE BABY! BLACK AND BLUE!
STEPHEN: WHAT IS HE EVEN SAYING? ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IS HIS CROTCH ACTUALLY BLUE? YOU GUYS, I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, IF YOUR GENITALS RESEMBLE THE ELECTORAL MAP AT ALL, CONSULT A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND THE CRAZE IS PART IS WE LEARNED ALL THIS ABOUT TRUMP FROM THE NEWS, UNFORTUNATELY, NOT FROM THE MAN  HIMSELF BECAUSE, THIS WEEKEND, AIDES TO DONALD TRUMP HAVE FINALLY WRESTED AWAY HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT. WHAT?! YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY TRUMP'S TWITTER ACCOUNT! THAT'S LIKE TAKING AWAY BATMAN'S UTILITY BELT! ( LAUGHTER ) ALL YOU'VE GOT LEFT IS A BILLIONAIRE WITH ANGER ISSUES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE'S GOT NONE OF HIS TOOLS! ( CHEERING ) MAKES NO SENSE. MAKES NO SENSE. TRUMP BASED HIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN ON THAT TWITTER ACCOUNT. WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO NOW? WRITE MESSAGES IN BRONZER ON BEDSHEETS AND HANG THEM OUT THE WINDOW OF TRUMP TOWER? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TWITTER IS TRUMP'S LIFELINE TO THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT TURNS OUT THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT USE A COMPUTER. NO COMPUTER AT ALL. HE EVEN FILES HIS TAXES THE OLD FASHIONED WAY-- NOT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AS FAR AS WE KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW! WE HAVE NO IDEA! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, IF TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A COMPUTER, AND THEY'RE TAKING AWAY HIS TWITTER, I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING -- IF HE LOSES TOMORROW, HIS STAFF ISN'T GOING TO TELL HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WAKE UP, MR. TRUMP! YOU WON BIGLEY! DON'T TURN ON THE TV! HEY, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED TO TAKE AWAY YOUR BELT AND SHOELACES. NO REASON, MR. PRESIDENT. OF COURSE, THE MAJOR STORY THIS WEEKEND WAS F.B.I. DIRECTOR AND SOON TO BE FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY DELIVERING WHAT MAY BE THE MOST INFURIATING "TAKIE-BACKSIE" IN AMERICAN HISTORY. TEN DAYS AGO COMEY UPENDED THE CAMPAIGN WITH A VAGUE LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING HE'D FOUND NEW CLINTON EMAILS TO INVESTIGATE. YESTERDAY, HE TOLD CONGRESS THAT "THESE EMAILS WARRANT NO NEW ACTION AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON." THIS IS THE PSYCHE-OUT SINCE GOD TOLD ABRAHAM, "SLIT YOUR SON'S THROAT. JUST KIDDING! BUT SERIOUSLY, TAKE A CHUNK OFF OF HIS PENIS." ( LAUGHTER ) PSYCH! NOW -- I WAS KIDDING! FOR NINE STRAIGHT DAYS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN HAMMERING HILLARY WITH THIS STORY.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL SINCE WATERGATE!
Stephen: SORRY, DONALD. TURNS OUT IT'S NOT EVEN THE BIGGEST SCANDAL SINCE "WATERWORLD." BUT IF YOU'RE WAITING ON A CORRECTION FROM TRUMP'S CAMP, GET COMFORTABLE. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH COMEY SAYS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE EMAILS, THEY'VE GOT A NEW LINE OF ATTACK.
NO ONE BELIEVES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CAPABLE OF TAKING 650,000 E-MAILS AND REVIEWING THEM IN EIGHT DAYS.
Stephen: YES. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY REVIEW 650,000 EMAILS IN EIGHT DAYS? YOU NEED A COMPUTER THAT CAN DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET EMAILS ONTO A COMPUTER? I MEAN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND! JUST SCANNING THE E-MAILS IN WOULD TAKE WEEKS! ( LAUGHTER ) AS I SAID, WHEN HE FIRST TALKED ABOUT THESE EMAILS, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR JAMES COMEY, AND IT'S RIGHT HERE -- ( CHEERING ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE NOT RELEASING THIS MESSAGE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A TEAM COMPARING IT TO THE CONTENTS OF THIS HAND TO SEE IF THEY MATCH. ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY? TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND HERE, YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH TOMORROW NIGHT ON SHOWTIME. ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, I'M TAKING A LOOK BACK HERE, AND SOME OF THE RESULTS ARE COMING IN, ALREADY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THIS IS IT. THE CAMPAIGN IS COMING TO AN END. SO TOMORROW'S THE BIG DAY ( CHEERING ) ( APPLAUSE ) FINALLY, WE'LL ALL GET OUT THE VOTE AND-- WAIT A MINUTE... WHAT'S THAT? (RAGAMUFFIN IN AUDIENCE IS CRYING)
Stephen: WHY, IT'S AN ADORABLE LITTLE STREET URCHIN! BUT WHY ARE YOU CRYING, LITTLE GIRL? I ASK OUT OF GENUINE CONCERN AND NOT BECAUSE IT'S A LIVE SHOW AND I'M FURIOUS.

VERY NAUSEOUS.
Stephen: I HAVE A LIT AIL AIL -- I HAVE A LITTLE AROMA THERAPY, A LITTLE SOOTHING LAVENDER, AND A STRESS BALL.
I SAW TED NUGENT EARLIER, I'M JUST GOING TO GRAB THIS BALL.

I THOUGHT IT WAS A PERSON OF SPECIAL INTEREST.
Stephen: EXACTLY, IT'S A PERSON OF SPECIAL INTEREST. HMM, IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE THIS.
OR TED NUGENT'S BALL.
Stephen: YOU'RE DON, HE'S DONALD. DOES IT UPSET YOU THAT YOU HAVE THE SAME NAME?
WE'LL SEE WEDNESDAY. I MAY HAVE TO PUT DON IN A DUMPSTER FIRE.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?
FRANK CHEADLE.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT NAME. FRANK, LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION HERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: PASSIONATE ISSUE FOR YOU, ONE DONALD TRUMP SAYS IS A MYTH CREATED BY THE CHINESE, IS GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE. YES. YOU HAVE BEEN NAMED GOOD WILL AMBASSADOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS. DO YOU HAVE DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY? CAN YOU PARK ANYWHERE YOU WANT?
I CAN PARK ANYWHERE THAT'S GREEN.
Stephen: YOU'RE HOSTING NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC'S "YEARS OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY."
YES.
Stephen: AND WENT TO CALIFORNIA'S VALLEY TO INVESTIGATE E DROUGHT.
IT COMES ON WEDNESDAY. IT'S VERY DAUNTING, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE LEARNED, AN CALIFORNIA IS RIGHT NOW EXPERIENCING A DROUGHT THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IN 1200 YEARS, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.
Stephen: SO THE RAINS THIS YEAR DIDN'T HELP.
IT'S THE SNOW PACK, IT DOESN'T GET COLD ENOUGH FOR THE SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS ACTUALLY TO CREATE A SNOW PACK AND THAT'S WHERE THE RUNOFF HAPPENS AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET MOST TO HAVE THE WATER. THEY'VE DEPLETED THE AQUIFERS AND THE GROUND IS SINKING IN SOME PLACES IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ALL THE AQUIFERS HAVE BEEN DEPLETED.
Stephen: SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
WELL --
Stephen: HOW DO YOU FIX IT? I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS ELECTION IS THERE ARE PERSONAL THINGS WE CAN DO, OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WATCH OUR WATER CONSUMPTION AND TRY TO BUY PRODUCTS THAT ARE CLEARLY -- YOU KNOW, WE KEEP GLOBAL WARMING IN MIND AND DO ALL THOSE THINGS, BUT, REALLY, IT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING THE LEADERSHIP THAT MAKES ATE PART OF THEIR PLATFORM, SO NOT JUST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BUT ALL THE WAY DOWN BALLOT, WE HAVE TO GET BEHIND THE PEOPLE WHO WILL MAKE ATE REAL ISSUE AND MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND IT'S SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FOCUS ON. OTHER THAN THAT, ONCE THAT HAPPENS, THEN WE HAVE TO STAY ON THEM.
Stephen: BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE WATER, WE CAN'T STAY ON THE PLANET.
IF WE DON'T HAVE WATER, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT.
Stephen: ELON MUSK SAYS HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO PUT PEOPLE ON MARS IN 20 YEARS. WILL YOU BE THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN ON MARS?
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST BECAUSE IN MOST SPACE MOVIES, THEY'RE THE FIRST ONES TO GO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WEREN'T YOU IN MISSION TO MARS?
YEAH, AND THEY LEFT ME UP THERE. HOW ABOUT THAT?
Stephen: JUST LEFT YOU THERE?
YES.
Stephen: NOT COOL. YEAH.
Stephen: AT LEAST THEY WENT AND GOT MATT DAMON.
THEY CAME LATER.
Stephen: DID THEY COME LATER FOR YOU?
YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO EAT THE POOP POTATOES?
I WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE TO EXPERIMENT WITH POOP POTATOES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOUR KIDS, NOW YOU'RE POLITICALLY ACTIVE. ARE YOUR KIDS POLITICALLY ACTIVE?
THEY ARE, AND WE'VE DRUG THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
Stephen: THEY PREFER TO BE CALLED WOKE.
ACTUALLY, I WAS CHIDED FOR SAYING THAT. THEY SAID WE DON'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. I SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S ALREADY GONE? MY DAUGHTER WAS UPSTAIRS GETTING READY FOR A BUNCH OF FRIENDS AND I SAID ARE YOU GOING TO A CLUB? THEY SAID, NO, A "BLACK LIVES MATTER" RALLY. I SAID, OKAY, WEAR YOUR TENNIS SHOES, KEEP YOUR HEADS ON A SWIVEL, THIS IS A REAL THING YOU'RE DOING. BUT THEY'RE VERY WOKE AND THEY'RE AWARE. IT'S GOING TO BE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE THE HOPE FOR THESE ISSUES. ( APPLAUSE )
