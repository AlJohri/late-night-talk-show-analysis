STEPHEN: HELLO CITIZENS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FINAL ROUND OF THE 2016 "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES. THE CONVENTIONS ARE COMPLETE, LEAVING BEHIND A LOT CONFETTI, AND EVEN MORE REGRETTI. AMERICA HAS SETTLED ON THEIR FINAL ATTRIBUTES -- HILLARY CLINTON VS. DONALD TRUMP. TWO SHALL ENTER. WE ALL MIGHT LEAVE. ANDRO, GIVE ME THE SCISSORS. TIGHTEN THE RIBBON! AND NOW WITH THESE SLIPPERY HANDLED, VERY POINTY, INCREDIBLY SHARP SCISSORS, I WILL NOW CUT THE RIBBON TO DECLARE THE FINAL MATCH OF THE 2016 "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES OFFICIALLY-- OH NO! (SCREAMING) HE DID IT!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES ABBI JACOBSON AND ILANA GLAZER, DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN AND ERIC ANDRE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION -- DEATH, TAXES, HILLARY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: THANKS! WHOO! WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOO! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)
Stephen: HEY CHRIS, TOM, PAUL! WHAT'S GOING ON, MARK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THAT'S NICE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M PROUD TO BE YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT, AND WE ARE LIVE ON NIGHT FOUR OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, WHERE MOMENTS AGO HILLARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO ACCEPT A MAJOR PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) INCREDIBLE! HOWEVER YOU FEEL ABOUT EITHER OF THE CANDIDATES, I GOT CHILL BUMPS. YOU SAID, WHY HASN'T THIS HAPPENED BEFORE? IT'S THE BIGGEST BREAKTHROUGH FOR WOMEN SINCE THEY WON THE RIGHT TO BUST GHOSTS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TOO LONG DENIED. I HAVE TO SAY -- DID YOU GUYS WATCH THE SPEECH? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A GREAT SPEECH. WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT. OF COURSE, HILLARY WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO MADE HISTORY AT THIS CONVENTION. LAST NIGHT, HER V.P. PICK, TIM KAINE, ACCEPTED THE NOMINATION TO BECOME THE 48TH CONSECUTIVE WHITE MALE VICE-PRESIDENT. AND THE STREAK CONTINUES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WAY TO GO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT THERE ARE SOME SPOIL SPORTS WHO ARE DETERMINED TO TRY AND RUIN THIS. BERNIE SUPPORTERS-- AND I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP-- SCARFED DOWN BEANS AND WENT TO THE CONVENTION CENTER AS PART OF A "FART-IN" PROTEST. (LAUGHTER) NOW, SOME MIGHT QUESTION THIS TACTIC, BUT I REMIND YOU IT IS PART OF A LONG TRADITION OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM. IT WAS PATRICK HENRY WHO FAMOUSLY DECLARED, "GIVE ME LIBERTY... OR PULL MY FINGER!" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) NOW, THE THEME OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION WAS "STRONGER TOGETHER. AND NANCY PELOSI THRILLED THE CROWD BY APPEALING TO THEIR SHARED VALUES.
WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE VOICES OF THE VOTERS, NOT THE POCKETBOOKS OF THE POWERFUL. A GOVERNMENT OF THE MANY, NOT A GOVERNMENT OF THE MONEY.
STEPHEN: AND THAT ROUSING CALL TO GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS RESOUNDED THROUGHOUT EVERY CORNER OF THE WELLS-FARGO ARENA, FROM THE CNN GRILL TO THE COMCAST XFINITY LIVE COMPLEX! BECAUSE IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS, WE HEARD FROM EVERY CONCEIVABLE FRINGIEST MINORITY GROUP.
I'M A REPUBLICAN. I KNEW RONALD REAGAN. I WORKED FOR RONALD REAGAN. DONALD TRUMP, YOU ARE NO RONALD REAGAN. (CHEERS)
Stephen: WHOO! WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOO! WHOO! WE'RE DEMOCRATS! WHY ARE WE CHEERING RONALD REAGAN? I DON'T CARE! WHOO! CHELSEA CLINTON, THIS IS TOUCHING, CHELSEA CLINTON CAME OUT AND INTRODUCED HER MOM. FIRST, THEY HAD A BIOGRAPHIC VIDEO.
HILLARY RODHAM GREW UP IN PARK RIDGE, ILLINOIS.
Stephen: YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WAS NARRATED BY GOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HILLARY TOLD THE STORY OF THE FIRST TIME SHE SAW HER FUTURE HUSBAND.
I SAID, WHO IS THAT? SHE SAID, THAT IS BILL CLINTON. HE'S FROM ARKANSAS, AND THAT IS ALL HE TALKS ABOUT. AND THEN I HEARD HIM SAY, WE GROW THE BIGGEST WATERMELONS IN THE WORLD.
STEPHEN: THUS BEGAN A LIFETIME OF BILL CLINTON SAYING THINGS THAT WOULD LATER SOUND REALLY PERVY. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REALLY BIG WATERMELONS! NOW, THE VIDEO WAS VERY LOVELY, VERY MOVING. AND IT WAS FULL OF PERSONAL ANECDOTES THAT REVEAL A SIDE OF HILLARY WE DON'T OFTEN SEE.
HILLARY QUIETLY ATTENDED DEBBIE'S WEDDING.
STEPHEN: THAT'S JUST A LITTLE SOUND BITE FROM AN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND MOVING STORY. AND IT JUST PROVES WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, SHE WILL ATTEND YOUR WEDDING. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A HAPPY COUPLE! THEN HILLARY MADE HER BIG ENTRANCE LOOKING EVERY INCH A PRESIDENT. OR LIKE AN ANGEL IN A MOVIE, WHO SAYS YOU CAN GO BACK TO EARTH AS THE FAMILY DOG. I'M NOT SURE WHAT MOVIE THAT IS BUT I WOULD WATCH IT. (LAUGHTER) THEN, SHE TALKED ABOUT AMERICA'S CORE VALUES.
OUR COUNTRY'S MOTTO IS E PLURIBUS UNUM.
STEPHEN: GREAT, NOW EVERYONE'S SPEAKING SPANISH. (LAUGHTER) TALK IN SPANISH, IS THAT HOW YOU SAY IT? I'M NOT SURE IF I'M TALKING ENGLISH RIGHT NOW. AND THEN IN A KEEPLY MOVING MOMENT, HILLARY CLINTON MADE HISTORY.
AND SO IT IS WITH HUMILITY, DETERMINATION, AND BOUNDLESS CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA'S  PROMISE THAT I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND REMEMBER, AT THAT VERY MOMENT, SOMEWHERE IN THAT ROOM, A SUPPORTER WAS TRYING TO RIP A FART. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY PUTS THE WHOLE THING IN PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. HILLARY DREW A STARK LINE BETWEEN HERSELF AND DONALD TRUMP.
I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.
Stephen: AND YOU KNOW SHE MEANS IT BECAUSE SHE'S WEARING A WHRAB COAT. AND HILLARY, SHE HAD A STERN WARNING FOR THE BIG BANKS.
WALL STREET, CORPORATIONS AND THE SUPER RICH ARE GOING TO START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND I KNOW THEY'RE GOOD FOR IT BECAUSE THEY PAID ME TONS WHEN I SPOKE TO THEM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A GREAT SPEECH, YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT TO HER. HILLARY CLINTON WORKED A LIFE TIME TO ACHIEVE THIS HISTORIC MOMENT. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER) HE IS STILL IN HOT WATER OVER THIS LITTLE COMMENT FROM YESTERDAY.
RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS THAT ARE MISSING. I THINK YOU WILL PROBABLY BE REWARDED MIGHTILY BY OUR PRESS.
STEPHEN: IT WAS A TRULY REAGANESQUE MOMENT. IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN THE GIPPER SAID, "MR. GORBACHEV, RELEASE NAKED PHOTOS OF WALTER MONDALE." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S HOW HE WON IN 1984! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TRUE STORY. TRUE STORY. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET THAT PART OF THE SPEECH. NOW, ENCOURAGING A HOSTILE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS IS AN UNORTHODOX CAMPAIGN STRATEGY KNOWN IN POLITICAL CIRCLES AS "TREASON." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO WITH CRITICISM MOUNTING, TRUMP DID SOMETHING EVEN CRAZIER THAN MAKING A PLEA TO RUSSIAN HACKERS-- HE TOOK IT BACK.
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAID, "THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE NOW. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ANY AMERICAN CALLING FOR A FOREIGN POWER TO COMMIT ESPIONAGE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE PURPOSES OF SOMEHOW CHANGING AN ELECTION, WE'RE NOW IN NATIONAL SECURITY SPACE. YOUR REACTION IN
YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. AND WHEN I'M BEING SARCASTIC WITH SOMETHING...
ARE YOU BEING SARCASTIC?
OF COURSE I'M BEING SARCASTIC.
STEPHEN: SARCASM! HE WAS BEING SARCASTIC! OF COURSE! NOW EVERYTHING HE SAYS MAKES SENSE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH, LET ME TELL YA, YEAH, I'M REALLY GOING TO BUILD A WALL ON THE BORDER, AND, YEAH, MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT." "I'M BANNING ALL MUSLIMS, THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. IT'S A GOOD IDEA." "I'M GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO, IF DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WASN'T CONSPIRING WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND HE WAS JUST BEING SARCASTIC, I WANT HIM TO KNOW, I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU! ♪ STICK AROUND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, JON! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN) OH, FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU. FOLKS, I CAN TELL YOU'RE EXCITED. I'M VERY EXCITED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LADIES FROM "BROAD CITY," ABBI JACOBSON AND ILANA GLAZER OUT HERE LATER. STICK AROUND FOR THAT. BUT FIRST, HILLARY CLINTON MADE HISTORY TONIGHT BY BEING THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF A MAJOR PARTY IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR WOMEN'S EQUALITY. I JUST WISH THE WOMEN WHO HELPED -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I JUST WISH THE WOMEN WHO HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY COULD BE HERE TO SEE IT. WELL, MY WISH IS MY COMMAND. JOINING ME LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM JULY 4, 1776 ARE TWO FEMALE DELEGATES FROM THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESS. PLEASE WELCOME, JOSEPHINE HINDLEY AND ABITHA WHITMORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
HELLO, STEPHEN.
HELLO, FUTURE AMERICANS! OR BRITISH SUBJECTS, IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: OH, DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU HOW IT TURNS OUT?
NO SPOILERS! WE'RE GOING TO WAIT TILL AMERICA'S OVER, THEN BINGE-WATCH.
Stephen: OKAY, WELL, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE BUSY PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, SO I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK. I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT IT'S 2016, AND WE FINALLY HAVE A FEMALE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE!
WELL, BUTTER MY BONNET! THAT'S INCREDIBLE! THAT IS INCREDIBLE! I'M GOING TO CELEBRATE BY MAKING A MEAL FOR MY HUSBAND, AND THEN CLEANING IT UP IMMEDIATELY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEAR THAT, BEN FRANKLIN? WOMEN ARE ON TOP! AND NOT JUST YOUR FRENCH WHORES! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT, IN THE YEAR 1816, WE FINALLY HAVE A FEMALE PRESIDENT! WHOO!
STEPHEN: NO, NO, I'M SORRY--I SAID 2016.
GET THE BUTTER OUT OF THE BARN! ARE YOU TELLING ME IT TAKES US 240 YEARS TO GET A FEMALE PRESIDENT?
STEPHEN: WELL, JUST A NOMINEE. SHE HASN'T BEEN ELECTED OR ANYTHING.
WHAT THE BUTTER IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG? IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE:
"ALL MEN ARE CREATED--" OOOOOH.
YOU KNEW THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN ALL PEOPLE, RIGHT?
STEPHEN: WE FIGURED IT OUT EVENTUALLY. BUT THAT'S NOT HOW WE TOOK IT AT FIRST. BUT YOU LADIES ARE THERE. YOU SHOULD JUST CHANGE THAT NOW.
GREAT IDEA. FIRST THING TOMORROW.
STEPHEN: WHY NOT NOW?
COME ON, IT'S JULY 4 HERE. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PARTIES TONIGHT! COME ON.
TOTALLY, EVERYONE'S GOING TO DO MERCURY SHOTS, AND ABITHA'S GOT SOME DANK HEMP ROPE. IT'S GOING TO BE MOTHER-BUTTER-CRAY-ZAY!

Stephen: SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. ABBI, ILANA GLAZER, DORIS, THANKS FOR BEING HERE ON THIS HISTORIC NIGHT. LO FEELING THE HISTORY OF THIS MOMENT?
WITHOUT A QUESTION. IT'S HISTORIC, RIGHT?
Stephen: YOU'RE THE HISTORIAN, YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.
NONE OF US HERE, NOBODY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS WHOLE NATION HAS SEEN A WOMAN WHO HAS BECOME A NOMINEE OF A MAJOR PARTY. THAT'S HISTORY.
Stephen: NO ONE'S EVEN COME CLOSE.
NO ONE'S EVEN COME CLOSE. THE AMAZING THING IS I THINK IS MAYBE NOW SINCE SHE'S COME SO CLOSE, WE'VE HAD 43 MALE PRESIDENTS, MAYBE THERE WILL BE 43 FEMALE PRESIDENTS COMING.
Stephen: IN A ROW, JUST TO EVEN THINGS OUT.
AND IMAGINE SOME LITTLE BOY WILL BE SAYING, WILL I EVER BE PRESIDENT? (LAUGHTER) I FEEL BAD.
Stephen: NO, I HAVE HOPE FOR HIM. I HAVE HOPE FOR HIM. (LAUGHTER) NOW, ABBI AND ILANA, ARE YOU PEOPLE FEELING THE HILLS? ARE YOU HEADING TO THE HILLS? (LAUGHTER) THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF COMPLAINING OR I'M NOTICING THAT SOME YOUNG WOMEN WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS FEMINISTS, WHO DO YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS FEMINISTS? THAT THEY WERE NOT BEING DRAWN TO HILLARY CLINTON AND SORT OF OBSERVERS OF YOUR GENERATION DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. DO YOU THINK MAYBE THAT'S OVER NOW THAT SHE'S GOT THE NOMINATION?
I HOPE. SO I THINK THERE IS PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. I HOPE SO. I DON'T THINK YOU COULD WATCH TONIGHT AND THIS WEEK FULL OF THESE AMAZING SPEECHES AND NOT FEEL SHE IS JUST THE BEST CANDIDATE AND NOT FEEL LIKE, EVEN IF YOU DID SUPPORT BERNIE, WHICH I LOVE BERNIE, BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW, WATCHING THAT, I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY.
ALSO, IT'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, ABOUT WE'RE NOT -- WE DON'T SUPPORT HILLARY JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN AND IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT HILLARY, THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT A FEMINIST EITHER. YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS LANGUAGE THAT'S MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND SO POLARIZING.
YOU HAVE TO LIKE THIS AND NOT LIKE THIS, AND IF YOU LIKE THIS, YOU DON'T LIKE THIS.
THAT BERNIE STUFF WAS GETTING CRAZY AND OVERLAPPED, LIKE, 90% OF THEIR POLICIES OVERLAP. BUT WE ARE --
I'M HEADING FOR THE HILLS. I'M UP IN THE HILLS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW, HAVE ALL THREE OF YOU MET SECRETARY CLINTON?
I SLEPT OVER WITH HER AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: DO GO ON. HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT? HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
WHAT HAPPENED IS I WAS ON THE RADIO TALKING ABOUT FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT AND HOW I WISH I COULD SEE THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN THEY WERE THRALL AND I HADN'T ASKED LYNDON JOHNSON WHO SLEPT WHERE WHEN I WAS 24 AND UP THERE AND SHE SAID COME AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHETHER EVERYBODY SLEPT. WE FIGURED OUT BILL CLINTON SLEPT IN WINSTON CHURCHILL'S BATHROOM WHICH MEANT -- CHURCHILL'S BEDROOM. WE TALKED ABOUT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, OUR MUTUAL PERSON.
Stephen: I READ SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO COMMUNE WITH ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WHEN SHE WAS FIRST LADY TO FIGURE OUT HOW SHE DID SUCH A GREAT JOB.
ELEANOR WAS A MENTOR TO HILLARY. I THINK IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: WHO'S YOUR MENTOR? AMY POEHLER, BABY.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD MENTOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TO COMPARE COMEDY TO POLITICS, IT SHOULD BE DONE. THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE THAT CAME BEFORE US AND THAT SET THE PATH FOR US AND AMY'S DEFINITELY OURS, NOT JUST FOR OUR SHOW BUT JUST IN GENERAL AS A COMEDIENNE.
Stephen: YOU GUYS MET SECRETARY CLINTON. SHE WAS ON YOUR SHOW, RIGHT?
YES, WE MET HER WHEN WE BEGGED AND STOPPED HER TO BE ON OUR SHOW (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP, THE TWO OF YOU COMING TO HER CAMPAIGN OFFICES TO VOLUNTEER.
YES.
Stephen: JIM? (LAUGHTER)
OH! SORRY, WE ARE JUST SO EXCITED.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.
ONE MORE. (SCREAMING)
THANK, YOU, ILANA, FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
YOU HEARD OF ME? WELL, YOU'RE WEARING A NAME TAG.
ABBI. HELLO. COLLEGE, AQUARIUS. SECRETARY CLINTON, MADAM PRESIDENT. I CAN'T AFFORD TO VOLUNTEER HERE FULL TIME BUT I STILL WANT TO GET THE WORD OUT. SO I VOW TO TWEET ONCE A WEEK, VOTE FOR HILLARY, YES, YES, YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NICE RIDONE. IT WAS A VERY UNREAL EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, I IMAGINE IT WOULD BE.
SHE WAS SO COOL AND HER PEOPLE WERE SO COOL. EVERYBODY WAS REALLY COHESIVE.
Stephen: NOW, DORIS, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY ABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON, THIS GETS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THAT SHE IS THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE TO EVER SEEK THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. IS THAT HYPERBOLE OR TRUE? THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUALIFIED PEOPLE, HAVEN'T THERE?
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT THE OTHER NIGHT, EVEN MORE QUALIFIED THAN BILL OR HIM. SHE'S HAD EXPERIENCE AT ALL SORTS OF LEVELS. THINK ABOUT IT WHEN SHE WAS FIRST LADY IN ARKANSAS SHE SAW IT FROM A STATE LEVEL, THEN SHE WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE SO SHE SAW THE PRECIOUS OF PRESIDENT, THEN SENATOR OF NEW YORK AND SECRETARY OF STATE. SO ALL THE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SHE'S SEEN, SHE'S BEEN A PUBLIC SERVANT. TODAY BEING A POLITICIAN IS NOT LOOKED ON AS AN HONORABLE THING. BUT IF SHE CAN CHANGE THAT PERSPECTIVE AND SAY BEING A PUBLIC SERVANT FOR A LIFETIME. EISENHOWER, THE SAYING FOR HIM WAS "I LIKE IKE BECAUSE IKE IS EASY TO LIKE," SO THAT HELPED HIM A LOT.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IF WE COULD MEMORIZE THAT.
ISN'T THAT THE KIND OF THING YOU WOULD SAY?
Stephen: YEAH, I'M SIMPLE-MINDED.
IF YOU'RE LIKABLE, IT HELPS YOU GET ELECTED, EXPERIENCE HELPS YOU BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL IS TEMPERAMENT, CHARACTER, DISPOSITION, EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, RESILIENCE, THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO CARE ABOUT WITH BOTH OF THESE CHARACTERS.
Stephen: WHAT PRESIDENT -- WHAT MODERN, 20th CENTURY PRESIDENT HAD THE BEST TEMPERAMENT FOR THE OFFICE?
I WOULD SAY F.D.R. THE MIDDLE OF THE DEPRESSION, WHAT DOES HE DO? COME ON TO THE STAGE AND SAY THINGS WILL BE ALL RIGHT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE. HE WAS OPTIMISTIC, COME THROUGH POLIO, HE WAS ABLE TO BECOME A HUGE LEADER WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO WALK ON HIS OWN POWER. THE MINUTE HE GOT ELECTED, PEOPLE WROTE IN SAID, MY ROOF FELL OFF, DOG DIED, WIFE HATES ME BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT'S THE TEMPERAMENT THAT CONNECTS WITH PEOPLE.
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURPRISED, BUT THAT IS A FEELING I HAVEN'T SEEN A POLITICIAN BE ABLE TO CONVEY IN MY LIFETIME.
I THINK THAT'S FAIR.
Stephen: NOT EVEN OBAMA OR BILL CLINTON WHO CONNECTED WELL. MAYBE EVEN REAGAN, ACTUALLY. REAGAN MADE THEM FEEL IT WAS MORNING IN AMERICA OR TOMORROW WAS I GOING TO BE MORE HOPEFUL BECAUSE OF HIS OWN SUNNY DISPOSITION.
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. YOU NEED TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOUR COUNTRY AND WHERE IT'S GOING AND FEEL YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PERSON, BUT THAT PERSON HAS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES. THAT'S KEY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF OR YOU CAN'T PROJECT FUN AND HUMOR, WHEN YOU'RE DOING COMEDY.
Stephen: DO YOU? BECAUSE I FIND INSECURITY MAKES ME BE MORE ACCURATE. WERE YOU GUYS TOGETHER BACKSTAGE BEFORE YOU CAME ON?
THEY SAW ME IN MY CURLERS. WE STOOD IN A CLOUD OF SMOKE TOGETHER.
A REALLY LONG TIME. ALMOST ALL OF US GOT LOST.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE THREE OF YOU WERE STANDING IN THE CLOUD OF SMOKE AND BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE, I HAVE TO ASK YOU, REALLY, DORIS, ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER) YOYOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, ABBI JACOBSON AND ILANA GLAZER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES OF THIS WEEK WAS WATCHING THOUSANDS OF DISAPPOINTED BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS FINALLY COME AROUND TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON. THEY HAD TO MODIFIED "FEEL THE BERN" TO "FEEL THE DENIAL, ANGER, BARGAINING, DEPRESSION, ACCEPTANCE." BUT SOME SUPPORTERS WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON THEIR CANDIDATE. TONIGHT, WE PROFILE A TRUE BELIEVER. JIM?
A FIGHT ISN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER AND I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO COME HERE EVEN THOUGH MY CANDIDATE WASN'T THE GUY. I SUPPORT MARTIN O'MALLEY FOR PRESIDENT. SHE WAS A FORMER GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND, MAYOR OF BALTIMORE, A REAL FIGHTER. I HAD TO MAKE THIS MYSELF. BECAUSE THEY STOPPED SELLING THEM MONTHS AGO. I HAD ONE THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT I WAS CAUGHT IN THE RAIN ONE DAY AND THE COLORS RAN. BUT I'M STILL FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. HEY! WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO START SELLING THESE AGAIN? A REAL GO GETTER. OKAY, HE DROPPED OUT. IN FEBRUARY WHEN HE GOT A THIRD OF THE IOWA CAUCUS, MARTIN O'MALLEY. THE BEST, SPOKE TWICE DURING THE DEBATES. THEY ASKED HIM A QUESTION ONCE BUT HE SPOKE TWICE. YOU DON'T REMEMBER FROM, BALTIMORE, MARTIN O'MALLEY WANTS TO TAX CAPITAL GAINS AS NORMAL INCOME! HE PLAYS ROCK GUITAR! O'MALLEY IS MY PALLY! GIVE ME A HUG, PLEASE. COME ON, BUDDY, GIVE ME SOME SLACK! AMERICA NEEDS IT! I NEED IT! MS. SUSAN SARANDON, YOU DON'T HAVE A MONOPOLY ON SOUR GRAPES. I THINK MY FAVORITE STORY ON MARTIN O'MALLEY IS WHEN HE WAS AT THE STATE HOUSE -- OH, MY GOSH! I'M A MINORITY O'MALLEY SUPPORTER. IF YOU NEED ME TO STAGE A WALKOUT, I'M THERE FOR YOU, SIR.
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM, BUT IT'S TIME TO KNOCK IT OFF. IT'S TIME TO GET BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON, OKAY? STOP, ALREADY AND LET'S BE HONEST. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION. THE COUNTRY NEEDS YOU, RICHARD. BE FOR HILLARY.
I HEAR YOU, SIR. HOW ABOUT IN FOUR YEARS? I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON THIS. I BELIEVE IN THIS. BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA. WHERE DREAMS CAN COME TRUE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'M SORRY, CROWD.
Stephen: DID YOU GO TO THE DEMOCRATIC --
DID GO TO THE D.N.C. WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT A D.N.C. VIDEO.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE VIBE? IT WAS A LITTLE MORE MELLOW. THEY SMOKE A LITTLE MORE WEED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ALLOWED ANYMORE. THE W WORD, THEY SMOKE A LITTLE MORE WEED AT THE BERNIE RALLIES THAN AT THE HELL'S ANGELS FOR TRUMP RALLIES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I TRIED TO GET ON STAGE AT BOTH PLACES. IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO GET ON STAGE AT THE R.N.C. THAN THE D.N.C.
REALLY? WE GOT OUR PASSES REVOKED AT THE R.N.C. SO WE COULDN'T GET NEAR THE D.N.C. WE GOT OUR PASSES THROUGH A COMPANY WHO I CAN'T MENTION.
Stephen: WHY CAN'T YOU MENTION THE COMPANY?
BECAUSE I WILL GET IN TROUBLE AT MY JOB, MR. COLBERT!
Stephen: BUT DON'T YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR A LIVING?
I DO FOR A LIVING BUT NOT WITH THE BRASS AT HEADQUARTERS.

YES.

YES, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED. I DID. I GOT SUSPENDED A LOT FROM SCHOOL. I GOT STRAIGHT As, BUT I ALWAYS GOT --
