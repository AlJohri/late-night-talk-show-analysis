Stephen: HI! BEFORE WE START THE SHOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND, DONALD TRUMP. DONALD IS TURNING 70 TODAY ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T LIKE A DAY OVER... 70'SA ABOUT RIGHT. I WANTED TO GIVE DONALD SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. AFTER ALL, AS A LATE NIGHT HOST, HE'S GIVEN ME SO MUCH. DONALD, FIRST, I'M GIVING YOU AN iTUNES GIFT CARD. IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING YOU GIVE ANYONE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW. THEN, IT'S GOING TO GET CHILLY IN THE WINTER IN WASHINGTON, SO I GOT YOU A PAIR OF GLOVES. THESE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIG. YOU CAN HAVE THEM TAKEN IN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I ALSO GOT YOU THIS SCENTED CANDLE. I EVEN PUT IT IN THE BAG FOR YOU. I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT THE SCENT IS. LET'S JUST SAY, IT'S PUNGENT. DON'T OPEN IT. I'LL LIGHT IT FOR AND YOU LEAVE IT ON YOUR DOORSTEP. JUST MAKE A WISH BEFORE YOU STOMP IT OUT.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES DANIEL RADCLIFFE. GEORGE LOPEZ. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY HINDS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"!  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY! HEY! HEY, UP THERE! WHAT'S UP? THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW, "EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WOMAN TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I AM YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S A VERY EXCITING DAY, BECAUSE TODAY, IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, WASHINGTON, D.C., THEY THELD THE FINAL PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. WE MADE IT! WE MADE IT! THROUGH THE BEGINNING! THERE ARE FIVE MORE MONTHS. THIS WAS PROBABLY THE LAST CHANCE TO SEE BERNIE SANDERS' NAME ON A PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT, AND HE'S GOING OUT STANDING ON PRINCIPLE AND REFUSING TO PANDER.
THE MAJOR POINT THAT I WILL BE MAKING TO THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IS THAT I AM STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF D.C. STATEHOOD.
Stephen: YES. OF COURSE, D.C. STATEHOOD DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY, BUT "DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY" IS SANDERS' CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. ( LAUGHTER ) POSSIBLE. SO JUST IN CASE WASHINGTON, D.C. DOES GAIN STATEHOOD, I'D LIKE TO OFFER RIGHT NOW SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THEIR NEW STATE SYMBOLS. OBVIOUSLY, THEIR LICENSE PLATES WILL NEED A STATE NICKNAME. I SUGGEST "THE FIELD TRIP STATE." AND D.C. WILL NEED A STATE FLAG. HOW ABOUT D.C. GIVING THE MIDDLE FINGER TO PUERTO RICO? AND, OF COURSE, WASHINGTON'S STATE SEAL WILL BE AN EMBARRASSED REDSKINS FAN DEFENDING THE TEAM'S NAME TO A NATIVE AMERICAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYONE HERE A MILLENIAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YEAH! MILLENNIAL.
Stephen: I'M SURPRISED YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO RAISE YOUR ARM BECAUSE ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, MILLENNIALS ARE LOSING THEIR GRIP STRENGTH. THIS IS TRUE. APPARENTLY "IN 1985, MEN IN THEIR 20s HAD AN AVERAGE RIGHTHANDED GRIP OF 121 POUNDS. TODAY, MEN THAT AGE HAD GRIPS OF ONLY 101 POUNDS." IF ONLY THERE WERE A WAY FOR YOUNG MEN TO IMPROVE THEIR GRIP STRENGTH, SOME EASILY PORTABLE TOOL WITHIN REACH, THEY COULD JUST GRAB AND HOLD AND JUST WORK, WORK ALL DAY. THE STUDY CLAIMS THE LOSS IN GRIP STRENGTH IS BECAUSE 30 YEARS AGO, YOUNG PEOPLE WERE WORKING WITH THEIR HANDS INSTEAD OF USING TECHNOLOGY LIKE SMARTPHONES. IT'S TRUE. IN MY DAY, WE CRUSHED OUR CANDY BY HAND. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS TERRIBLE, BECAUSE WITHOUT GOOD GRIP, MILLENIALS WON'T HAVE A FIRM HANDSHAKE. WE COULD LOOK AT A FUTURE WITHOUT A PROUD TRADITION OF DOUCHEBAGS  WHO CRUSH YOUR HAND WHEN YOU MEET THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. "OH, SO YOU'RE BRENDA'S EX-BOYFRIEND. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, MY MAN. YOU'RE SHORTER THAN YOU LOOKED ON FACEBOOK. DO YOU EVEN LIFT? I WANT YOU TO KNOW I STRAINED MY ARM JUST PRETENDING TO SHAKE SOMEONE'S HAND. NOW, I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE NEWS CYCLE IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THERE'S SOME NON-TRUMP NEWS OUT THERE-- FOR INSTANCE, CHRIS CHRISTIE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD TRUMP. ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, DONALD TRUMP USES CHRIS CHRISTIE AS A MANSERVANT TO FETCH HIS MCDONALD'S. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BA-DA-BA-BA-BA! DEMEANING! I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS CHRIS CHRISTIE DIRECTLY FOR ONE SECOND. LISTEN, CHRIS. YOU MIGHT THINK FETCHING MICKEY D'S FOR TRUMP IS A GOOD IDEA. YOU PROVE YOU'RE LOYAL, THEN WHEN TRUMP IS ELECTED, HE'LL MAKE YOU AMBASSADOR TO McDONALD BUT YOU DESERVE BETTER. REMEMBER, CHRIS, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO LOVE YOU. NOT IN NEW JERSEY, BUT SOMEWHERE, SURELY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU KNOW WHO LOVES EVERYONE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI. (BAND PLAYING) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, THE WORLD IS STILL IN SHOCK AFTER THE TERROR ATTACK ON A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO OVER THE WEEKEND. BUT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE HORROR, PEOPLE ALL OVER HAVE COME TOGETHER WITH MOVING EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE AND SOLIDARITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF ORLANDO AND THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY, PROVIDING SOME HOPE THAT IN THE END, FEAR AND HATRED WON'T WIN. BUT DONALD TRUMP MIGHT. AS NEWS OF THE ATTACK WAS STILL COMING IN ON SUNDAY, DONALD TRUMP TOOK TO TWITTER TO EXPRESS HIS SOLIDARITY WITH HIMSELF. TWEETING: "I CALLED IT." IT REMINDS ME OF F.D.R.'S INSPIRING WORDS AFTER PEARL HARBOR.
DECEMBER 7, 1941, A DATE WHICH WILL LIVE IN TOLD YOU SO! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THEN, YESTERDAY, TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH WHERE HE LET THE WORLD KNOW WHO'S TO BLAME FOR THIS LONE MADMAN'S ACT OF VIOLENCE.
HILLARY CLINTON FOR MONTHS, AND DESPITE SO MANY ATTACKS, REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO EVEN SAY THE WORDS "RADICAL ISLAM." THEY HAVE PUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS ABOVE COMMON SENSE. I REFUSE TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT.
Stephen: YES, DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. AND JUST TO BE SAFE, HE REFUSES TO BE CORRECT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND NOT ONLY-- POLITICAL, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S FINE WITH. AND NOT ONLY DOES TRUMP WANT TO KEEP MUSLIMS FAR AWAY. HE ALSO WANTS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM.
WE HAVE TO FORM A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR MUSLIM COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TURN IN THE PEOPLE WHO THEY KNOW ARE BAD, AND THEY KNOW IT. THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THEY KNOW THAT HE WAS BAD.
Stephen: YES, ALL MUSLIMS KNOW WHAT OTHER MUSLIMS ARE THINKING. THEY'RE MAGICAL THAT WAY. TRUMP LEARNED THAT FROM THE DOCUMENTARY "ALADDIN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THIS WHOLE SPEECH-- THIS WHOLE SPEECH, WITH ITS NATIVISM, ITS FEARMONGERING, AND ESPECIALLY ITS SELF-AGGRANDIZING IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY, FEELS LIKE A NEW LOW. IT MAKES ME LONG FOR THE DAYS WHEN TRUMP WAS JUST BRAGGING ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIS PENIS. DONALD, CAN'T WE JUST PUT THE FOCUS OF YOUR CAMPAIGN BACK ON YOUR GENITALS? WHICH, AGAIN, I'M SURE DON'T LOOK A DAY OVER 70. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M GUESSING HE MOISTURIZES. THE MAN HAS GOT A VERY STRONG GRIP. ( APPLAUSE ) MAY BE, MAYBE ALL OF US COULD GET TOGETHER AND DECLARE HOW BIG TRUMP'S PENIS IS, PERHAPS WITH A GIANT MONUMENT TO HIS JUNK. WE DID IT FOR OUR FIRST PRESIDENT. WHY NOT OUR LAST? AND HERE'S THE THING: TRUMP'S SPEECH, UNBELIEVABLY WAS THE LEAST CONTROVERSIAL PART OF HIS REACTION TO ORLANDO. JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
WE'RE LED BY A MAN THAT EITHER IS NOT TOUGH, NOT SMART, OR HE'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND. AND THE "SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND" -- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. PEOPLE CANNOT-- THEY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ACTING THE WAY HE ACTS AND CAN'T EVEN MENTION THE WORDS "RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM." THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. IT'S INCONCEIVABLE.
Stephen: YES, INCONCEIVABLE, ESPECIALLY TO BRIAN KILMEADE. ( LAUGHTER ) "IS HE-- IS HE SAYING WHAT I THINK HE'S SAYING? AND WHAT DO I THINK HE'S SAYING? SOMEONE PLEASE GET THE CAMERA OFF OF ME." NOW, IN HIS DEFENSE, TRUMP DIDN'T COME RIGHT OUT AND CALL THE PRESIDENT A SECRET MUSLIM, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK IT THAT WAY. SO YESTERDAY, TRUMP CLAIRIFIED HIS VAGUE STATEMENT BY MAKING A VAGUER ONE.
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'LL LET PEOPLE FIGURE THAT OUT FOR THEMSELVES, HOWIE. BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THERE CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF ANGER OR PASSION. THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOT A LOT OF ANGER. SO, YOU KNOW, I'LL LET THAT-- WE'LL LET PEOPLE FIGURE IT OUT.
Stephen: YEAH, LET THE PEOPLE FIGURE IT OUT. HE'S JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU CLUES, LIKE THE "$100,000 PYRAMID." YOUR CLUES ARE "OBAMA" AND "SOMETHING'S GOING ON." "OOH, WHAT MY RACIST AUNT WOULD SAY AT A PICNIC?" BUT-- DING, DING, DING! DING, DING, DING! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU HEARD HIM. HE'S GOING TO LET PEOPLE FIGURE IT OUT. AND SINCE I'M A "PEOPLE," I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A STAB AT IT. OKAY, BRING OUT THE FIGURE-IT-OUT-ATRON 5,000, GUYS. HERE WE GO. FIRST OF ALL, BEFORE I FIGURE IT OUT, I HAVE TO THINK LIKE TRUMP. SO FIRST, I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE MY MEDS. OKAY. WHOOOO! AHH! I SEE PATTERNS WHERE NONE EXIST. OKAY, LET'S SEE HERE. OKAY, OKAY, ALL THE OPTIONS HERE. OBAMA, OBAMA, OBAMA, TRUMP IS SAYING OBAMA IS NOT SMART BECAUSE HE WON'T SAY "RADICAL ISLAM." TRUMP-- ( APPLAUSE ) WAIT! I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT! TRUMP THEN SAYS THIS IS "INCONCEIVABLE" SO "SOMETHING MUST BE GOING ON," PROBABLY THAT OBAMA IS A MUSLIM, AND THAT IS A BAD THING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO, THAT CAN'T BE IT. NO, NO, NO, NO. THERE'S NO WAY. THAT CAN'T BE IT. THERE'S GOT TO BE A SIMPLER ANSWER. THERE'S GOT TO BE A SIMPLER ANSWER. THINK, THINK, THINK. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. TRUMP SAYS OBAMA WON'T SAY "RADICAL ISLAM" BECAUSE EITHER OBAMA IS EITHER NOT SMART OR SOMETHING IS GOING ON WITH MUSLIMS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INCONCEIVABLE BAD THINGS. AND THE CENTER OF IT ALL HAS GOT TO BE AN ANSWER. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. BUT I HOPE TRUMP EXPLAINS IT SOON BECAUSE UNTIL HE DOES, THAT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HE'S AN ( BLEEP ). WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DANIEL RADCLIFFE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU MIGHT KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM HIS ROLE AS HARRY POTTER. HE RETURNS TO THE SCREEN AS A TALKING CORPSE IN THE NEW FILM "SWISS ARMY MAN."
NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HER, I CAN'T GET HER OUT OF MY HEAD, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A THING THAT HAPPENS OR IF I'M JUST WEIRD, BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME SHE'S THE ONE I'M SUPPOSED TO BUMP INTO AND SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH. AND MAYBE IF WE CAN JUST FIND A WAY FOR ME TO REMEMBER HER, THEN, BAM, IT WILL ALL COME RUSHING BACK TO ME AND THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF MY NECK WILL STAND UP, AND I CAN SAVE YOU.
WOW, THE TALKING WAS GOOD.
YEAH, SEE, IT'S WORKING ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL RADCLIFFE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: LISTEN TO THOSE PEOPLE!
THAT'S LOVELY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND-- AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S INCREDIBLY KIND. I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO GET CUT BUT THANK YOU FOR WAITING. I'M SORRY I'M LATE AND YOU'VE BEEN KEPT HERE. YOU HAVE LIVES TO LIVE AND I'M SORRY.
Stephen: NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE. WE HAD A LOVELY TIME, DIDN'T WE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME, FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME WHO DON'T KNOW, WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN IN BAD TRAFFIC-- I ASSUME IT'S BAD TRAFFIC.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, FROM THE PUBLIC THEATER WHERE YOU'RE DOING A PLAY AND YOU'RE IN REHEARSAL AND YOU TOOK A BREAK TO BE HERE TONIGHT.
I CAME STRAIGHT FROM THERE. I'M REHEARSING A PLAY CALLED "PRIVACY" OR PRIF-AZ-Y. GLLS YOU USE THE URYAN-AL.
IT'S AA PLAY ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PRIVATE PERSON SINCE SNOWDEN AND iPHONE AND APEXPEL GOOGLE AND ALL THAT FUN, TERRIFYING STUFF. WE'RE MAKING A PLAY ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU IN THE REHEARSAL PROCESS RIGHT NOW? ARE YOU OFF BOOK? STILL DOING TABLE READS?
WE'RE IN THE INTERMEDIATE, TERRIFYING, PANICKY STAGE FOR ME PERSONALLY. THERE ARE SOME PARTS I KNOW REALLY WELL, AND BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING A PLAY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS SO VERY CUR ARNDT, THERE ARE LOTS OF CHANGES GOING ON ALL TIME, AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT THE MOST UP-TO-DATE VERSION IT CAN BE SO WE'RE STILL GETTING SORT OF --
THEY'RE CHANGING LINES ON A DAILY BASIS?
YEAH, BUT EVERY TIME THEY COME BACK THEY'RE EVEN BETTER, WHICH IS A NICE POSITION TO BE IN.
Stephen: STILL, COULD YOU DRIVE YOU CRAZY, THOUGH.
AT THIS POINT I THINK WE HAVE TWO-- TWO AND A HALF, THREE WEEKS LEFT FOR REHEARSAL. SO I'M STILL OKAY FOR NOW PAIN COUPLE MORE WEEKS I'LL BE FREAKING OUT.
Stephen: AS SOMEBODY WHO IS FAMOUS, ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET, I THINK, IT'S SAFE TO SAY BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVES THE HARRY POTTER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAS THIS PLAY TAUGHT YOU ANYTHING ABOUT, LIKE, MODERN PRIVACY? DO YOU THINK IT EXIST?
WELL, I MEAN, I'M NOT ON MUCH SOCIAL MEDIA SO THAT LIMITS MY EXPOSURE TO THOSE THINGS. I TRY-- I THINK BEING IN THE POSITION THAT I'M IN, IT MAKES YOU REALLY VALUE THE PARTS OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN KEEP PRIVATE. SO YOU SORT OF HOLD ON TO THEM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN A WAY THAT, LIKE, MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY WOULDN'T THINK ABOUT, LIKE JUST MAKING A FACEBOOK PAGE OR MAKING A TWITTER PAGE OR WHATEVER. BUT EVEN FOR ANYBODY WHO IS DOING THAT, THERE ARE HUGE IMPLICATIONS TO YOUR OWN PRIVACY THAT --
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS PEOPLE CAN COME AND TURN ON THE CAMERA ON YOUR LAPTOP OR SOMETHING, AND WHILE YOU'RE WORKING ON YOUR GRIP STRENGTH, LET'S SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I ACTUALLY HEARD-- I HEARD THE HEAD OF THE N.S.A. SAY THAT PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO YOU THROUGH YOUR MICROWAVE OVEN, ACTUALLY.
I'M SURE THAT'S-- AT THIS POINT, I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS WE CAN BE SURVEILED--
Stephen: IT ALMOST MAKES YOU NOT WANT TO EAT HOT POCKETS.
NO, THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE.
Stephen: YOU STILL DO IT?
I'LL ALWAYS MAKE THAT TRADE, HOT POCKETS FOR PRIVACY IS FINE.
Stephen: YOU WERE ALSO IN EQUIS ON BROADWAY. ARE YOU NAKED IN THIS PRODUCTION?
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE SHOW IT'S GOING TO BE CHANGING ON A NIGHTLY BASIS BASED ON THINGS THE AUDIENCE IS DOING, SO WHO KNOWS?
Stephen: LET'S JUST SAY IT'S POSSIBLE. AND THAT WILL PUT SOME ASSES IN THE SEATS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: PUT A TOWEL DOWN FIRST, BUT PUT SOME ASSES IN THE SEATS. CONGRATULATIONS ON "SWISS ARMY MAN--" ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON "SWISS ARMY MAN."
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE WHERE, AGAIN, YOU'RE TAKING AN INCREDIBLE-- YOU'RE TAKING A REAL CHALLENGE, A REAL RISK BY PLAYING A CORPSE WHO FARTS A LOT AND HAS ERECTIONSES THAT ACT AS A COMPASS.
YUP.
Stephen: IN THE MOVIE. HONESTLY, YOUR ERECTION IS A COMPASS.
YES, IT IS POINTth WAY HOME.
Stephen: OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YES, YES. THAT'S OFTEN THE FEELING. THAT'S OFTEN THE FEELING. OKAY, AND YOU ARE ACTUALLY TEACHING PAUL DANOS' CHARACTER HOW TO BE A HUMAN BEING AS A CORPSE. YOU CAN EXPLAIN ANY OF THAT TO ME?
NOT REALLY. BASICALLY, PAUL DANOA' CHARACTER IS A DEPRESSED SUICIDAL MAN WHO FINDS A DEAD BODY WHO IS COMING TO LIFE AND THROUGH BECOMING FRIENDS WITH THE DEAD BODY IT BECOMES A DISCUSSION BETWEEN A SUICIDAL MAN AND A DEAD PODDY ABOUT WHETHER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. BUT IT'S SUPER FUN --
BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY!
THAT'S THE THING. THIS FILM, A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF IT AS BEING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THE FARTING ERECTION MOVIE. I'M NOT SHYING AWAY FROM THAT SIDE OF IT. THOSE THINGS EXIST IN IT AND ARE AMAZING AND YOU WILL LAUGH AND THEY'RE INSANE AND THEY-- YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD ON THIS ONE-- THEY BECOME BEAUTIFUL, ALL THOSE BIZARRE MOMENT S.
Stephen:  BEAUTIFUL?
YEAH.
Stephen: FARTING AND ERECTIONS.
YEAH, YOU DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT I PROMISE YOU, THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE WORTH SEEING, LIKE, REALLY. BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE. NONE OF IT SHOULD BE.
Stephen: IT CELEBRATES THE PART OF BEING A HUMAN BEING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
THAT'S WHAT THIS MOVIE REALLY IS I THINK ABOUT, CELEBRATING OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL WEIRDNESS AND ACCEPTING THAT. AND CELEBRATING THERE ARE SOME THINGS LIKE FARTING, WHICH ARE HILARIOUS. AND IT'S KIND OF A GREAT LEVELER.
Stephen: WE UNDERSTAND AT AGE FOUR WE KNOW THAT FARTING IS FUNNY.
AND WE KIND OF KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE, AND EVERYONE DOES IT, BUT WE'RE ALSO SORT OF TAUGHT THAT IT'S NOT GOOD AND THAT, LIKE, IT CAN BE A SHAMEFUL THING. AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FILM IS THE IDEA THAT SHAME OR SHAME FROM YOURSELF IS WHAT KEEPS FRU, LIKE, LOVE.
Stephen: AS A CATHOLIC, I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE FARTED UNTIL EVE GAVE ADAM THE APPLE. THAT'S WHAT STARTED IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, NOT ONLY DO YOU PLAY A CORPSE IN IT, BUT YOU HAVE A CO-CORPSE. THIS WAS A DUMMY, YOUR CHARACTER IS NAMED MANNY. AND THIS WAS A DUMMY MADE FOR THE MOVIE ORIGINALLY, RIGHT, BUT PAUL DANOS DIDN'T USE IT, RIGHT?
PAUL CARRIES MY CHARACTER AROUND ON HIS BACK FOR LOTS OF THE FILM SO I THINK THEY WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE SOMETHING THAT WAS SLIGHTLY EASIER GOING ON HIM. BUT IT ENDED UP ONLY BEING, I THINK, 30 POUNDS LIGHTER THAN I AM. HE WAS LIKE I'LL TAKE THE REAL THING.
Stephen: SO HE LUGS YOU-- WHEN YOU SEE HIM LUG YOU AROUND IN THE MOVIE, THAT'S REALLY YOU.
THAT'S REALLY ME.
Stephen: EASY ON YOU, I BET.
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE VERY MINIMAL AMOUNT OF DUMMY WORK THAT IS IN THE FILM. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: ONE NICE THING IS I KNOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO ON THE WEB SITE AND YOU CAN SORT OF SIGN UP AND BE FRIENDS WITH MANNY AND HE'LL--
SIGN UP.
-- OKAY, SO THERE'S A GAME WHERE YOU GO KGO ONLINE AND THROW MY LIFELESS CORPSE AROUND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT. PLEASE, YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION. DO IT. IT'S QUITE FUN. IF YOU PLAY THE GAME FOR A WHILE IT TELLS YOU TO TEXT A NUMBER. I TEXT IT AND IT ASKS YOU QUESTIONS THAT MANNY ASKS IN THE FILM. I WAS IN REHEARSAL THE OTHER DAY, I DON'T KNOW TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND HEAVY LIKE SNOWDEN AND MY PHONE STARTS VIBRATING WHICH IS EMBARRASSING ANYWAY, BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE IT IT ON, AND IT'S TEXTING ME, "WHAT IS SEX?" IT IS TEXTING ME BIZARRE QUESTIONS.
Stephen: WHAT IS SEX?
I THINK I JUST SAID, "IT'S GREAT, YOU WOULD ENJOY IT." I THINK THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF THE ADVICE I GAVE. I WAS IN REHEARSAL.
Stephen: ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THE CHARACTER MANY AND THE WEB SITE IS GATHERING ON US AS WE TEXT BACK AND FORTH IS THAT ALL BEING GIVEN TO THE N.S.A. AND C.I.A..
YOU HAVE FOUND AN AMAZING WAY OF LINKING THESE THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS TAKING YOUR INFORMATION STRAIGHT TO FACEBOOK AND ALL-- NO, IT'S NOT REALLY. YOU CAN-- YOU CAN DO IT. IT'S VERY PRIVATE.
Stephen: NOW, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU ONE THING BEFORE WE GO HERE. IS HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSE CHILD IS ON STAGE IN LONDON IN PREVIEWS. YOU HAVE SEEN IT?
I HAVE NOT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HERE.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO GO SEE IT?
IT'S-- I FEEL LIKE-- I WANT TO SEE THE SHOW. LIKE, I GENUINELY AM INTRIGUED AND HEARD IT'S FANTASTIC. I JUST FEEL LIKE SITTING IN AN AUDIENCE WHAT WILL FOR THE MOST PART THE NEAR FUTURE BE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC HARRY POTTER FANS MIGHT BE NOT A RELAXING WAY TO SEE A SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I GUESS. SO NOT FOR THE TIME BEING.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BUT --
ANY FEAR YOU WOULD STAND UP AND GO, "THAT'S NOT HOW HARRY WOULD DO IT!"
NO, NOT AT ALL. JAMES PARKER IS A WONDERFUL ACTOR AND I'M VERY, VERY HAPPY SEEING HIM PLAYING ME. AND MAYBE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS CAN SHIFT TO HIM NOW. HE CAN DO ALL THE HARRY PARTS.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE. YOU'RE A WONDERFUL ACTOR AND WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT ACROSS TOWN IN TRAFFIC. DANIEL, LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. "SWISS ARMY MAN" OPENS NATIONWIDE JULY 1. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GEORGE LOPEZ. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST CREATED AND STARRED IN "GEORGE LOPEZ" AND "LOPEZ TONIGHT." HIS LATEST PROJECT IS "LOPEZ." PLEASE WELCOME-- ANY GUESSES? GEORGE LOPEZ! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO, AMERICA!
Stephen: HELLO AMERICA?
YES, BECAUSE AMERICA-- PEOPLE ARE FORGETTING THAT IT'S THE DIVERSITY AND THE RICHNESS OF THE TAPESTRY THAT MAKES AMERICA, AMERICA. LOOK AT YOU AND I. WE'RE BOTH AMERICAN DISPLZ LOOKAL THAT, BOTH OF US.
DIFFERENT SHAIPPEDZ. SO IT TELLS YOU AS AMERICANS, WE'LL SLEEP WITH ANYBODY. LOOK AT THE BAND.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT I'M RIGHT ON BOARD.
THE TAPESTRY.
Stephen: TAPESTRY, WELCOME TO THE TAPESTRY, THE LATE SHOW. IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ARE HAVE WE EVER MET BEFORE?
NO.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID, "AGAIN, "BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY SEE IN ENTERTAINMENT, "NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN."
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO LOSE A GRAMMY TO YOU.
Stephen: IT'S AN HONOR TO DEFEAT YOU.
HOW IS IT DOING.
Stephen: GOOD.
I NEVER KNEE EXWOOU IT. SO CONGRATULATIONS.
Stephen: IT'S WONDERFUL COMPANY.
I'VE OVER IT, I THINK.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TAPESTRY OF AMERICA A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE IN THE CAMPAIGN YEAR RIGHT NOW. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE BEEN FEELING THE BERN, IS THAT TRUE?
WELL, IT STARTED AS A BERN-- ( LAUGHTER ) IT MIGHT BE A SIMMER. IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU COOK ON THE BACK OF THE BURNER, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S HANGING AROUND.
Stephen: HE'S STILL AROUND. HE'S STILL IN THERE.
IT'S A WARMING TRAY.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT BERN GEE IT'S HARD NOT TO LIKE WHAT HE SAYS. FREE COLLEGE. YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FREE HEALTH CARE! FREE WEED! YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HE SAID LIKE RODNEY DANGERFIELD-- WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET LAID!
HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET LAID! MORE TAPESTRY. BUT HE'S LIKE THAT OLD MAN THAT WON'T LEAVE. THE PARTY. YOU KNOW, THE NURSING HOMES-- I GOT AN UNCLE THAT'S IN MY HOUSE WON'T LEAVE. SO IT'S LIKE THAT. BERNIE, HE WON'T LEAVE.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES? AS A MEXICAN AMERICAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL-- ARE YOU FEELING TRUMP AT ALL?
UH... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OR YOU CAN JUDGE HIM FAIRLY? AS A MEXICAN AMERICAN CAN YOU JUDGE HIM FAIRLY AT ALL? ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE YOU KNOW, HE'S BUILDING A WALL.
WELL, LISTEN, HE'S BUILDING A WALL, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT I'VE GOT NEWS FOR EVERYBODY. WE'VE GOT TUNNELS. SO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS A MATTER OF FACT, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I TOOK THE TUNNEL HERE. AND IT LEFT ME BEE THE AMERICAN GIRL STORE.
Stephen: OH, ANOTHER ALL RIGHT. YEAH, YOU GOTTA GET A COMPASS DOWN THERE WHEN YOU'RE DIGGING.
TRUMP IS-- TRUMP, WHEN YOU SAY-- WHEN HE SAYS, "THE MEXICANS LOVE ME."
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS. HE'S GOING TO DO GREAT WITH MEXICAN.
LET ME TELL YOU, I'M MEXICAN. WE DON'T. WE DON'T. IF YOUR PICTURE ISN'T ON OUR TV OR YOUR IMAGE IS ON A BLANKET ON A WALL, WE DON'T KNOW YOU!
Stephen: WHOSE PICTURE IS ON A BLANKET ON THE WALL? CATCH ME UP ON THAT.
KENNEDY, BABY JESUS. FELIX THE CAT. YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I DON'T BUT I TRUST YOU. YOU HAVE THE NEW SHOW "LOPEZ." I UNDERSTAND IN SOME WAYS THIS IS BASED ON YOUR OWN LIFE, A TRUE STORY?
IT'S BASED ON, YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT-- I THINK PEOPLE THINK WHEN YOU MAKE IT THEY THINK YOU HAVE MONEY OR YOU HAVE A SHOW THAT EVERYTHING GOES GOOD, AND IT REALLY DOESN'T. SO THIS SHOW REALLY KIND OF ATTACKS-- IT'S LIKE A WEST COAST LOUIS OR MEXICAN "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM." OR LIKE A SHORTER VERSION OF...
Stephen: I MISSED THAT.
SO IT'S THAT. IT DID WELL. IT GOT RENEWED FOR A SECOND SEASON.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF YOUR CHARACTER-- OF YOU, OF YOU BEING TALKED TO BY HIS PRODUCERS.
I DID FOCUS GROUPING AND WE REALIZED WE CAN MAINLT YOUR CORE AUDIENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS WHILE REACHOUTH TO--
WHITES AND ASIANS.
YOUNG AND OLD.
EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.
ANYWAY, GEORGE YOU'RE OUR PERFECT STORM. I MEAN, IF YOU WERE ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL, YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE HERE. AND IF YOU WERE ANY LESS SUCCESSFUL, WE WOULDN'T UPON YOU.
IT'S A PERFECT FIT.
DID YOU IT AGAIN.
YUP ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IN THIS-- IS THIS BASED ON A TRUE STORY-- YOUR CHARACTER, GEORGE LOPEZ-- HOW DO YOU FEEL PLAYING A CHARACTER WITH YOUR OWN NAME, BY THE WAY? IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.
IT DOES SOUND TERRIBLE BUT I'VE DONE IT FOUR TIMES. I TRY TO KEEP MY HERITAGE-- I THINK EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE LATINO AT SOME POINT. OBAMA, THEY WANTED TO SEE HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE.
Stephen: IS TRUMP LATINO?
YES, HE'S GOT MEXICAN HERITAGE. HE HAS KIDS FROM THREE DIFFERENT WOMEN. HE HAS HIS NAME ON THE SIDE OF BUILDINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE DON'T LIKE TO PAY HIS BILLS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IN THIS, YOUR CHARACTER, GEORGE LOPEZ, SOMEBODY GIVES HIM A VALET TICKET, THINKS HE'S A VALET AT A RESTAURANT. HAS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES. IT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO. I GUY THOUGHT I WAS A BATRIESTA. HE SAID LATTE? AND AT THE DREAM HOTEL IN NEW YORK CITY, AND I HAD SOME SUITS DELIVERED TO ME AND I WAS IN A ROBE, I WAS INSIDE THE ROOM. AND THE GUY SAID, "I THOUGHT YOU WERE HOUSEKEEPING." I SAID, "DUDE, I'M IN THE ROOM. ARE YOU OUTSIDE."
Stephen: HE THOUGHT YOU WERE HOUSEKEEPING.
ONE TIME A LA TINO KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AND I OPENED IT AND SHE SAID, "SOMEBODY IS ALREADY CLEANING THE ROOM." WHAT THE HELL.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW SEASON.
NICE TO SEE YOU, MY MAN.
Stephen: "LOPEZ" AIRS WEDNESDAY NIGHTS ON TV LAND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH AN INTERVIEW THAT ALMOST MADE ME VOMIT.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. REALLY BIG NEWS ABOUT THE INTERNET TODAY. I'M SURE YOU'LL READ ABOUT IT IN TOMORROW IN THE NEWSPAPER. TODAY, A FEDERAL COURT RULED THAT HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICE CAN BE DEFINED AS A UTILITY. YES, THE INTERNET IS A UTILITY, JUST LIKE HEAT OR PLUMBING. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY YOU DO SO MUCH OF YOUR WEB BROWSING ON THE TOILET. THIS RULING MEANS CABLE COMPANIES CAN'T SLOW DOWN STREAMING SERVICES AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. WHATEVER. IT'S A HUGE WIN FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS "NET NEUTRALITY," WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF BEFORE. OKAY.  ( APPLAUSE ) WE HAVE A SMART AUDIENCE. IT IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE INVOLVING EQUAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. WHICH IS IMPORTANT, BUT SUPER BORING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT I REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT TONIGHT. BORING. SO TO KEEP IT INTERESTING, I SAT DOWN WITH COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR TIM WU, THE MAN WHO COINED THE TERM 'NET NEUTRALITY.' AND TO MAKE IT INTERESTING, I SAT DOWN WITH HIM ON THE NITRO ROLLER COASTER AT SIX FLAGS GREAT ADVENTURE. JIM! SO DO YOU LIKE ROLLER COASTERS?
YEAH, I LIKE THEM.
Stephen: I DON'T. OKAY, SO, HERE'S THE THING. NET NEUTRALITY SAY DIFFICULT SUBJECT. IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT ON A LATE NIGHT SHOW. BUT I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT. AND YOU'RE THE GUY TO TALK TO. SO, WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY, AND WHAT THE BASIC ISSUES ARE, PROFESSOR TIM WUUUU!
ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE INTERNET IS THE UTILITY-- ALL TRAFFIC ON THE INTERNET SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME!
Stephen: WHY SHOULD I CARE?
WELL, IF YOU'RE A USER OF THE INTERNET YOU WANT TO GET WHAT YOU ASK FOR AND NOT HAVE IT DECIDED BY A CARRIER.
Stephen: IS THIS ABOUT PORN? ISN'T EVERYTHING ON THE INTERNET REALLY ABOUT PORN?
IT'S ABOUT ALL FORMS OF CONTENT. PORN IS ONE CONTENT.
Stephen: WHAT IS SPEED TRAVELING? IS THAT A METAPHOR? HAS ANYONE EVER CAUGHT YOU THROTTLING YOUR SPEED?
SPEED THROTTLING IS WHEN THEY PROMISE YOU A CERTAIN SPEED OF DELIVERING BUT DON'T GIVE IT TO YOU LATER AND BREAK THE CONTRACT.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU HAVE CALLED--
AAHH!
Stephen: YOU HAVE CALLED NET NEUTRALITY A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.
YES, BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT ANTIDISCRIMINATION. IT'S ABOUT TREATING THINGS THE SAME THAT SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AND NOT OTHER THINGS TO THE FAVOR OF OTHERS.
Stephen: I STAYED WEAK FOR MOST OF THAT. AS FAR AS I COULD TELL, NET NEUTRALITY MEANS THAT I SHOULD BE NEUTRAL ABOUT THE NET. I SHOULDN'T TAKE SIDES.
RIGHT?
NOT QUITE.
Stephen: DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN?
WE MAY HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.
