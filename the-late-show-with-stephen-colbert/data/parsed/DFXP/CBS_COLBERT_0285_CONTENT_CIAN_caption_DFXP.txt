AND WE ALL KNOW WHO PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE ROOTING FOR: RUSSIA. BUT, ALSO, THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS BECAUSE-- AND THIS HAS UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE-- PATRIOTS QUARTERBACK AND EVERY STRAIGHT MAN'S GAY HALL PASS, TOM BRADY IS FRIENDS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. IN FACT, THE TWO PLAY GOLF TOGETHER. I KNOW, THAT'S SURPRISING. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO DEFLATE A GOLF BALL?
Jon: YOU CAN TRY. YOU CAN'T GET IT?
Stephen: AND THAT'S NOT ALL. TRUMP IS ALSO BUDDIES WITH PATRIOTS OWNER ROBERT KRAFT AND COACH BILL BELICHIK, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY KELLYANNE CONWAY SHOWED UP TO TRUMP'S INNAUGRATION DRESSED LIKE THE PATRIOTS' OLD LOGO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ IT'S UNCANNY. THAT'S-- THAT'S REALLY UNCANNY.

WHICH MEANS THE PATRIOTS WIL WIN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
Jon: WHOA!
Stephen: INFORMATION FOLKS-- HEY, THAT'S THE CONSTITUTION. IT'S THE CONSTITUTION.
Jon: THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: PATRIOTS HAVE TO WIN. IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION. FOLKS, OUR SUPER BOWL SUNDAY IS IN DANGER BECAUSE-- BRACE YOURSELF-- ARE YOU BRACED? I COULDN'T HEAR YOU BRACING YOURSELF. BRACE YOURSELF. AMERICA IS FACING A BACON SHORTAGE. OH, MY GOD. I THINK BACON HAS FINALLY GIVEN ME A HEART ATTACK. AND IT'S FROM NOT HAVING ANY! WE CAN'T HAVE A BACON SHORTAGE ON SUPER BOWL WEEKEND. WHAT FOOD WILL WE WRAP ALL THE OTHER FOOD IN? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS ALERT COMES FROM THE OHIO PORK COUNCIL, WHICH IS A NONPROFIT GROUP AND NOT A CINCINNATI SEX PARTY. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. AND THE OHIO PORK COUNCIL SAYS OUR NATION'S BACON RESERVES ARE NOW AT A 50-YEAR LOW. THAT IS SHOCKING NEWS. THAT IS SHOCKING. NOT AS SHOCKING AS THE NEWS THAT WE HAVE NATIONAL BACON RESERVES BUT STILL PRETTY SHOCKING. AND WHERE'S THE BACON GOING? BRACE YOURSELVES AGAIN. TURNS OUT, A QUARTER OF ALL OF OUR BACON IS EATEN BY FOREIGNERS. YEAH. I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO DONALD TRUMP FOR CRITICIZING HIS WALL. WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BUILD IT OUT OF BACON. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, HERE'S SOMETHING. APPARENTLY, MELANIA TRUMP MAY STAY IN NEW YORK PERMANENTLY AND WON'T EVER MOVE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. NOW, THIS IS BEING REPORTED-- THIS IS BEING REPORTED. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN BELIEVE THAT. REMEMBER, LAST YEAR WE WERE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT HER HUSBAND. AND I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT SHE'S NOT GOING TO MOVE-- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TOGETHER, THESE TWO LOVEBIRDS. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THEM-- JUST-- ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE CLAPPING FOR LOVE! WE'RE CLAPPING FOR LOVE! JUST LOOK AT THEM AT THE INAUGURATION. HERE HE IS. BIG SMILE. AND... HELLO DARKNESS, MY OLD FRIEND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M VERY HAPPY-- I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU, HONEY. AND... I VOTED FOR HILLARY. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMEONE WHO IS ENJOYING LIVING IN WASHINGTON, D.C. JUST LOOK AT THIS PHOTOBOMB BY NOTORIOUS SENATE JOKESTER JOHN McCAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS-- BEHIND THE HEAD. BEHIND-- THAT IS McCAIN'S BEST PRANK SINCE NOMINATING SARAH PALIN. YOU HAD US THERE FOR A WHILE. YOU HAD US GOING THERE FAIR WHILE. I JUST WANT TO POINT SOMETHING ELSE. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. YOU'LL NOTICE THOSE AREN'T BUNNY EARS. THEY'RE DEVIL HORNS, BABY! THAT'S JUST A THROWBACK FROM WHEN SENATOR McCAIN PLAYED BASS FOR SLAYER. ( LAUGHTER ) EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT POLITICS THESE DAYS. EVEN MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY IS GETTING POLITICAL. McCONAUGHEY SAY:  YES, HE SAID THAT ABOUT TRUMP. HE'S EVEN SUPPORTING STEVE BANNON. HE SAY THE IT'S TIME FOR US TO EMBRACE THE "ALT-RIGHT ALT-RIGHT, ALT-RIGHT." I REALLY HAVE TO WORK ON MY McCONAUGHEY PROFESSION. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING RIGHT NOW? DONALD TRUMP MIGHT ACTUALLY BE WATCHING THE SHOW. BECAUSE WE KNOW HE WATCHES A LOT OF TV. LAST WEEK, TRUMP TOLD "THE NEW YORK TIMES" "HE RISES BEFORE. 6:00 A.M., WATCHES TELEVISION TUNED TO A CABLE CHANNEL." THEN, AFTER A LONG DAY'S WORK, "MR. TRUMP, WHO DOES NOT READ BOOKS, IS ABLE TO END HIS EVENINGS WITH PLENTY OF TELEVISION." IF ONLY "THE WEST WING" WERE STILL ON. HE COULD LEARN HOW TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF ONLY. IF-- IF-- WE MISS YOU, JOSIAH BARTLETT. AND HE'S A VERY ENGAGED TV VIEWER. AFTER CHELSEA MANNING WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON, TRUMP TWEETED THAT SHE WAS "UNGRATEFUL TRAITOR CHELSEA MANNING." TURNS OUT THAT TWEET CAME MINUTES AFTER FOX NEWS RAN A GRAPHIC CALLING CHELSEA MANNING AN "UNGRATEFUL TRAITOR." WHICH MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN THE PRESIDENT'S FOLLOW-UP TWEET, "15 MINUTES COULD SAVE YOU 15% OR MORE ON YOUR CAR INSURANCE. #TREMENDOUS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO NOTICE THAT YOU CAN TALK TO PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTLY THROUGH THE TV TUBE. LAST WEEK, DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS WENT ON "COFFEE JOE MORNING" AND SAID, "I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING. CALL ME. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU." "HOURS LATER, TRUMP CALLED HIM." AND THE NONPROFIT GROUP STAND UP REPUBLIC WANTED TO REACH TRUMP DIRECTLY, SO THEY ARE AIRING COMMERCIALS ON MORNING JOE. IN TRUMP'S DEFENSE, IT IS HARD TO COME CLEAN AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT MATTRESS. THAT'S-- THAT'S A FINE FAMILY JOKE, FOLKS. THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SHAKE THINGS UP. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND STRANGER AT THE BAR WHO WANTS YOU TO KNOW HE WOULD HAVE LEFT BARBARA ANYWAY, SEAN SPICER, HAS STARTED TAKING QUESTIONS OVER SKYPE FROM ALTERNATIVE MEDIA, LIKE THIS ONE FROM A TALK SHOW RADIO HOST.
I WANT TO GO TO MY THIRD SKYPE SEAT, LARS LARSON OF "THE LARS LARSON SHOW."
COMMANDER SPICER, IT'S A PLEASURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO AMERICA AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I GOT A BROAD QUESTION.
Stephen: YEAH, I HAVE A BROAD QUESTION: HOW ARE WE SEEING YOU WHEN YOUR HEAD IS SO FAR UP SEAN SPICER'S ASS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT WAS-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE HAD-- HE 4 THE HEADPHONES ON. HE ALSO NEEDED A SNORKEL. WELL, HERE WAS LARS'S QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
CAN HE TELL THE FOREST SERVICE TO START LOGGING OUR FORESTS AGGRESSIVELY AGAIN TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR AMERICANS, WEALTH FOR THE TREASURY, AND NOT SPEND $3.5 BILLION A YEAR FIGHTING FOREST FIRES?
Stephen: GOOD POINT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THESE EXPENSIVE FOREST FIRES IF WE JUST GOT RID OF ALL THE FORESTS. AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY RADIO SHOW SPICER'S TAKEN QUESTIONS FROM. HERE'S THE NEXT QUESTION HE TOOK. >
SENIOR SPICER, YOU'RE ON THE RACK WITH ZIGGY.
AND THE GOOCH.
HOW IS TRUMP GOING TO BRING BACK AMERICAN JOBS?
I'D LIKE A JOB, ZIGGY, PREFERABLY ONE FROM A HAND.
BACK TO THE BONER.
YOU KNOW IT!
SPICE MAN, FOLLOW-UP. WHAT IS TRUMP GOING TO DO ABOUT IRAN? IS HE READY TO USE THE NUCLEAR OPTION IF THEY KEEP PROVOKING WITH DANGEROUS MISSILE TESTS.
YOU GOT GOOCHED! ( EXPLOSION ).
YEAH, GOOCH. STICK AROUND. WE'VE GOT PRIYANKA CHOPRA AND I'LL BE BACK WITH IMPORTANT MESSAGES FROM A FURRY HAT. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, THE GREATEST BAND ON TV. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, AS THE HOST OF A TALK SHOW, I'M IN A POSITION OF ENORMOUS POWER, AND YET THERE ARE THOSE EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN I, HISTORY'S MOST FEROCIOUS DESPOTS, LIKE GENGHIS KHAN, KIM JONG UN, AND PHARRELL. YOU WOULD BE WISE TO KEEP HIM HAPPY. ALL OF US HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. WE HAVE ALL COLLABORATED WITH SNOOP, AND WE ALL HAVE A BIG FURRY HAT! ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MY HEAD, ANY AND ALL PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE THUS BEHATTED ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. ( LAUGHTER ) FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD, THE LETTER "E" CAN GO WHEREVER IT DAMN WELL PLEASES. YOUR REIGN OF TERROR IS OVER, "I"! ( LAUGHTER ) EBAY MUST CHANGE IT'S NAME TO THE MORE ACCURATE "DRUNK-BAY." ( LAUGHTER ) HENCEFORTH, ALL APARTMENTS THAT ALLOW CHILDREN MUST ALSO ALLOW PETS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO CAT COULD POSSIBLY BE AS DESTRUCTIVE AS A TWO-YEAR-OLD TWEAKED OUT ON BIRTHDAY CAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) EVERY STUDENT WHO TRIES TO PAD THEIR ESSAY WORD COUNT BY ADDING ADJECTIVES WILL GET A CORPULENT, INAUSPICIOUS, VERMILLION "F." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, SERVICE DOGS ARE ALLOWED TO HUMP YOUR LEG. AND AFTERWARDS, YOU MUST SAY "THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HENCEFORTH, ANYONE WHO MAKE-- I DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE JUST NOW! ( GONG ) NO GONG. HENCEFORTH, ANYONE WHO TAKES A DUCK-FACE SELFIE MAY BE HUNTED DURING DUCK SEASON.

HELLO!
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
LOVELY TO MEET YOU. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. I'M HAPPY YOU'RE IN THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T-- WHO DON'T KNOW THIS, YOU'RE AN ENORMOUS STAR IN INDIA. YOU'VE DONE 50 FILMS OVER THERE. I DON'T THINK DE NIRO'S DONE 50 FILMS.
WELL... YEAH, HE PROBABLY HASN'T. I DO A LOT OF WORK. BECAUSE OF THAT.
Stephen: YOU PROBABLY CAN'T WALK DOWN THE STREET IN INDIA, RIGHT?
YEAH, IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE INDIAN MOVIE STARS ARE REALLY, REALLY LOVED, AND INDIAN MOVIES ALSO HAVE A DIASPORA AROUND THE WORLD, SO EVEN IN AMERICA, I MEAN, WE HAVE SO MANY FANS OF INDIAN MOVIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT IS-- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT-- THAT AMERICANS-- LIKE WE FEEL LIKE WE INVENTED MOVIES AND WE LIKE OUR MOVIES OVER HERE, BUT IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO HOW PASSIONATE INDIANS ARE ABOUT YOUR FILMS.
IT'S-- IT'S REALLY AMAZING. I DON'T THINK ANY ACTOR AROUND THE WORLD WOULD-- I MIGHT GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING THIS-- WOULD UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF LOVE, AFFECTION, THAT WE SEE AND EXPERIENCE. YOU SEE, LIKE, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE JUST OUTSIDE YOUR HOME WAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOUR MOVIE'S RELEASED, AROUND THE WORLD, WHETHER I'M IN CANADA. WHETHER I'M IN NEW YORK, WHETHER I'M IN LONDON, ANYWHERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT COME OUT WITH LOVE, AFFECTION, AND JUST, LIKE, HUGS AND IT'S-- AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY WARM AND INFUSING. IT'S NOT SCARY, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
Stephen:  I WAS A LITTLE BIT.
NO.
Stephen: WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, "HOW MANY ARE OUT THERE THIS MORNING?"
I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN, THOUGH.
Stephen: YES?
YEAH AND THEY ARE.
Stephen: LIKE A FLASH MOB.
PEOPLE ARE NOT DANCING.
Stephen:  THEY'RE NOT DANCING?
THEY'RE NOT.
Stephen: THAT'S TOO BAD. I LOVE HOW YOU SAY "DANCING." SAY IS AGAIN, PLEASE.
DANCING.
Stephen: THAT'S SO ELEGANT.
PEOPLE THINK MY ACCENT IS CONFUSE. SO AM I. I'M NOT SURE ANYMORE WHAT IT IS. IT'S A GLOBAL ACCENT.
Stephen: YOU ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THAT MIGHT BE I UNDERSTAND YOU GREW UP IN NEWTON, MASS, OR SPENT SOME OF YOUR TEENAGED YEARS IN NEWTON, MASS.
FOUR YEARS IN AMERICA, MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU END UP IN NEWTON?
THAT'S A FUNNY STORY. A LOT OF MY MOM'S FAMILY IS HERE, MY MOM'S SISTERS. THEY LIVED HERE. THEIR KIDS WERE AMERICAN. AND I WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND I WAS COMING TO VISIT MY COUSINS, AND I REALIZED KIDS DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A UNIFORM TO SCHOOL IN AMERICA. AND FOR A TEENAGER THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW. VANITY IS LIKE-- ESPECIALLY FOR A TEENAGED GIRL. I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I GET TO WEAR WHATEVER I WANT," WHICH LATER BECAME A PROBLEM BECAUSE I HAD TO FIGURE OUT A NEW OUTFIT EVERY DAY, BUT AT THAT TIME, I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO COME TO NEW YORK-- AMERICA. AND MY MOM SAID, FINE, STAY HERE, AND I DID.
Stephen: WHO DID YOU STAY WITH?
MY AUNT.
Stephen: I THOUGHT SHE JUST CUT YOU LOOSE AND SAID GONE.
SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE. AFTER I CAME BACK FROM AMERICA, I HAD A REALLY AMERICAN ACCENT.
Stephen: NEWTON IS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF BOSTON. DID YOU HAVE A BOSTON ACCENT? GO YOU GO BACK TO INDIA SAYING, "THIS CURRY IS WICKED HOT." WAS IT A PROBLEM.
I DID GOING GBACK TO INDIA. I STUDIED IN QUEENS, NEW YORK, AS WELL, FLUSHING QUEENS.  ( APPLAUSE ) I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THERE. I ACTUALLY HAD A NEW YORK ACCENT WHEN I WENT BACK. YEAH, IT'S-- PLEASE. IT'S SO EMBARRASSING. BUT I WOULD BE LIKE, ," CAN I HAVE SOME CAUF-EE." IT WAS --
Stephen: YOU DON'T LIKE THE TERM BOLLYWOOD?
I DON'T.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU LIKE THE TERM "BOWL WOOD?"
I THINK A LOT OF ACTORS DON'T LIKE THE WORD "BOLLYWOOD." AROUND THE WORLD IT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A ZUMBA CLASS. YOU'RE LIKE, HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHERE BOLLYWOOD IS." AND PEOPLE SAY, "YEAH, I JUST TOOK A CLASS. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME. I'M SO GLAD "LA LA LAND DID SO WELL IN AMERICA.
Stephen: HOW MANY FRIMS MADE OVER THERE A YEAR?
WE HAVE A LOT OF REGIONS. THE FILMS I DO ARE HINDU MOVIES BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER LANGUAGES IN INDIA. MYSTERIES, WE CAN PRODUCE 4,000 TO 5,000 MOVIES A YEAR. WE'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST FILM PRODUCING INDUSTRIES IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: OUR FILM INDUSTRY SHOULD BE NAMED AFTER YOUR FILM INDUSTRY. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
WHAT WOULD IT BE CALLED.
Stephen: IN HINDI WHAT IS IT CALLED?
THE FILM INDUSTRY. HOLLYWOOD IS A MAP. THERE'S NO BOWL WOOD. I'VE NEVER SEEN A PLACE CALLED BOWL WOOD. IT'S MUMBAI.
Stephen: MUMBAI-WOOD. NO?
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE "WOOD?" ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL OF WHAT I SAY ON TV THESE DAYS.

( CHEERS ) YEAH, BECAUSE I'M SUPPOSED TO. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S THE RULE. IT'S THE RULE. BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LIVE IN HARLEM. I LOVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I WORK AROUND WORKING CLASS BLACK POOM PEOPLE. I HAVE JUST ENOUGH WHITE PEOPLE TO HAVE A GOOD GROCERY STORE. THAT'S ALL YOU WANT, THAT'S ALL YOU WANT, IS A GOOD GROCERY STORE. EVERYBODY DESERVES A GOOD GROCERY STORE, RIGHT? YEAH, YEAH. IN FACT, YOU WILL JUDGE A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD BY THAT GROCERY STORE. GIRL, LOOK AT THESE APPLES. LOOK AT THESE APPLES. THEY DON'T HAVE A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM. OH, THAT'S-- YEAH, THAT IS MY THING. THAT'S MY PET PEEVE. I CANNOT STAND A GRIMY GROCERY STORE. YOU KNOW YOUR GROCERY STORE IS BAD WHEN YOU GO ON THE INSIDE AND IT HAS A DARK ALLEY. ( LAUGHTER ) TALK TO THE CASHIER-- "HEY, GUY, WHERE IS THE MUSTARD." "DOWN THERE." "WHY IS THAT BABY STROLLER UPSIDE DOWN?" "WILL YOU MIND WALKING WITH ME?" OH, MY GOD. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE-- THAT'S THE THING, THOUGH. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET WHEN YOU HAVE AN INFLUX OF WHITE PEOPLE THAT MOVE INTO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. YOU NEVER KNOW. IT'S ALWAYS FEAST OR FAMINE. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. HISTORICALLY, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY. YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET SMALL POX OR FRESH STRAWBERRIES. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. LIKE, COME ON STRAWBERRIES, PLEASE, THIS TIME, STRAWBERRIES. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE EASIER TO DATE IN NEW YORK. EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE, RIGHT? I JUST NEED ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) I AM SINGLE, BUT I'M TRYING TO QUIT. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, IT'S HARD, THOUGH. SINGLE OVER 35. THAT IS HARD. SINGLE OVER 35. THAT IS SLIM PICKINGS, PEOPLE, THAT IS SLIM PICKINGS. THAT'S LIKE AN OLD BAG OF HALLOWEEN CANDY. ( LAUGHTER ) AIN'T NO SNICKERS LEFT. AIN'T ME REESE EASE CUPS. JUST BLACK LICK RICH AND CANDY CORN. IT'S A TOOTSIE ROLL IN THERE, BUT IT AIN'T GOT A WRAPPER ON IT. AIN'T GOING TO MEAS WITH IT. I AIN'T GOING TO TAKE A RISK. I AIN'T GOING TO TAKE A RISK. I'LL TELL YOU WHO INSPIRES ME, THOUGH,s THAT'S COUPLES. THEY STILL INSPIRE ME. I WATCH COUPLES, I DO. A LOT. I AM CREEPY WITH IT. I'LL WATCH COUPLES LIKE GUYS LOOK AT CARS.

I CAN'T LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY JUST DID THAT. OH! I AM GOING TO MISS BARACK. THAT WAS JUST SUCH A WIN FOR BLACK PEOPLE.

SOMETIMES I GO PLACES AND I SUPERVISE. I DON'T EVEN WORK THERE. I JUST SHOW UP. LIKE, "WHO WE GOT ON THE FLOOR TODAY? I'M GOING TO NEED SOMEBODY TO PICK UP A SPILL ON AISLE SIX." THEY'RE LIKE, "WHO ARE YOU?" "I AM PROGRESS, THAT'S WHO THE HELL I AM. I AM PROGRESS." ( APPLAUSE ) KEEP TALKING. I'LL TAKE YOU OFF THIS IMAGINARY SCHEDULE. EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE BARACK, IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIS POLITICS, YOU DON'T LIKE HIS POLICIES, YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO ADMIRE THE STORY, PEOPLE. YOU GOTTA ADMIRE THE STORY. THE STORY IS AN AMERICAN STORY. THE STORY IS A STORY OF AN UNDERDOG. THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY THAT A PRESIDENT HAS EVER ADMITTED HE FATHERED TWO BLACK KIDS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
