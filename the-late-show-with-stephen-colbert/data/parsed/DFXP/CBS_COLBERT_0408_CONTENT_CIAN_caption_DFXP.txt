ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE MISSION FOR EXPHIMS FOR HIS REGIME.
HOW DO YOU THINK THOSE WORDS WILL BE RECEIVED BY PRESIDENT KIM JONG-UN? S
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. AND EMMA STONE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. WELCOME TO" THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NICE. WE'VE BEEN OFF ON THE ROAD FOR A WEEK. IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOME. SPEAKING OF TRAVELING, DONALD TRUMP-- TRUMP IS ON A TRIP TO A VERY HOSTILE REGION: NEW YORK CITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'SA HE'S-- ( APPLAUSE ) THEY LOVE A HOMETOWN BOY. HE'S IN TOWN BECAUSE THIS MORNING, HE GAVE HIS FIRST OFFICIAL ADDRESS AT-- I WANT TO SAY, STARFLEET ACADEMY? ( LAUGHTER ) RADICAL KLINGON EXTREMISTS. THEY VIOLATED THE NEUTRAL ZONE. WE HAD NO CHOICE. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT GAVE US A PREVIEW OF HIS U.N. SPEECH YESTERDAY, TELLING REPORTERS HE PLANS TO "MAKE THE UNITED NATIONS GREAT.... NOT AGAIN. MAKE THE UNITED NATIONS GREAT." SO NOT #MAGGA. IT'S NOT THE NAME. IT'S NO SECRET DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER LIKED THE U.N. HE HAS NEVER. BACK IN 2012, HE TWEETED "THE CHEAP 12-INCH SQUARE MARBLE TILES BEHIND SPEAKER AT U.N. ALWAYS BOTHERED ME. I WILL REPLACE WITH BEAUTIFUL LARGE MARBLE SLABS, IF THEY ASK ME." ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT AT THE U.N., RIGHT? THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO SEND SOLDIERS TO UGANDA, NOT SCONCES TO THE LOBBY. OF COURSE, THE U.N. WAS FOUNDED AFTER WORLD WAR II IN THE HOPES OF CREATING A LASTING PEACE. SO, NATURALLY, THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH WAS THREATENING THERMONUCLEAR WAR.
THE UNITED STATES HAS GREAT STRENGTH AND PATIENCE, BUT IF IT IS FORCED TO DEFEND ITSELF OR ITS ALLIES, WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY DESTROY NORTH KOREA.
Stephen: "AND, YES, YES, DESTROYING NORTH KOREA WOULD ALSO DESTROY SOUTH KOREA, WHICH IS WHY I'M ENCOURAGING EVERYONE IN SOUTH KOREA TO EVACUATE TO EAST OR WEST KOREA. ( LAUGHTER ) IMMEDIATELY. AND THE-- AND TRUMP DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS NEW NICKNAME FOR KIM JONG-UN.
ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE MISSION FOR HIMSELF AND FOR HIS REGIME.
Stephen: ROCKET MAN? ( LAUGHTER ) MR. PRESIDENT, DON'T GIVE OUR ENEMIES NICKNAMES THAT MAKE THEM SOUND COOLER! "I WILL DESTROY COMMANDER JETPACK AND ADMIRAL ICE CREAM SEX MACHINE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP HAD A MAJOR COMPLAINT FOR THE U.N.-- WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH.
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OUT OF 193 COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS, AND YET, WE PAY 22% OF THE ENTIRE BUDGET, AND MORE. THE UNITED STATES BEARS AN UNFAIR COST BURDEN. BUT, TO BE FAIR, IF IT COULD ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH ALL OF ITS STATED GOALS, ESPECIALLY THE GOAL OF PEACE, THIS INVESTMENT WOULD EASILY BE WELL WORTH IT.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. WE'RE PAYING TOP DOLLAR, AND WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR WORLD PEACE. I MEAN, I JUST SAW SOME GUY AT THE PODIUM SAY HE'S GOING TO DESTROY NORTH KOREA! ( LAUGHTER ) AND DONALD TRUMP CALLED ON THE WORLD TO LOOK TO AMERICA FOR INSPIRATION.
THE GREATEST IN THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION IS ITS FIRST THREE BEAUTIFUL WORDS.
Stephen: HE'S ONLY READ THE FIRST THREE WORDS. ( LAUGHTER ) "LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE HERE.  . ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT. LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. WE THE PEOPLE-- HOW LONG IS THIS? IS THERE AN AUDIO BOOK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? I'LL PARAPHRASE IT LATER." NOW, THE MOST AWKWARD MOMENT HAD TO HAVE BEEN WHEN HE BROUGHT UP VENEZUELA.
THE PROBLEM IN VENEZUELA IS NOT THAT SOCIALISM HAS BEEN POORLY IMPLEMENTED BUT THAT SOCIALISM HAS BEEN FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED.
Stephen: "I SAID, 'FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED.' IS THIS ON? IS THIS-- IS THIS-- YOU KNOW WHO WAS ALSO THERE AT THE U.N. TODAY, BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE EVERY YEAR. TRUMP'S BUDDIES FROM RUSSIA. AND THERE ARE STUNNING NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INVESTIGATION. WE LEARNED OVER THE WEEKEND THAT TRUMP LAWYERS ARE CLASHING OVER HOW MUCH TO COOPERATE WITH THE RUSSIA INQUIRY. IF ONLY THOSE TRUMP LAWYERS WERE AROUND WHEN DECIDED HOW MUCH TO COOPERATE WITH RUSSIA. RUSSIA FANS! NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: NO SABER DANCE. NO SABER DANCE. THIS BATTLE PITS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AND BASS PLAYER OF YOUR DAD'S BAND, DONALD GOING MAN, AGAINST TRUMP'S PERSONAL LAWYER AND MAN-LEADING ZEPPELIN RACE TO SIAM, TY COBB. COBB WANTS TO GIVE MUELLER AS MANY DOCUMENTS AS POSSIBLE IN HOPES OF GETTING THE INVESTIGATION OVER WITH, WHILE McGANN WORRIES ABOUT "SETTING A PRECEDENT THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE WHITE HOUSE LONG AFTER MR. TRUMP'S TENURE IS OVER." YES, THAT'S HOW TRUMP'S GOING TO WEAKEN THE WHITE HOUSE: TOO MUCH HONESTY. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS KIND OF INTERESTING NEWS. HOW DID WE LEARN THIS? HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS TRULY TRUE? WELL,LY LEARNED IT STRAIGHT FROM THE MOUTH OF TRUMP LAWYER AND FRONTIER DENTIST WHO'S ALL GUSSIED UP FOR THE BARN DANCE, TY COBB. A "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER OVERHEARD COBB TALKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA PROBE AT A WASHINGTON STEAKHOUSE. EITHER THAT, OR THE REPORTER CONFUSED COBB WITH THE STEAKHOUSE'S MASCOT. HOW CARELESS IS THIS GUY? YOU'RE A LAWYER MOUTHING OFF IN PUBLIC WHERE ANYONE CAN HEAR YOU? THAT'S LIKE YOUR THERAPIST GOING OUT IN THE WAITING ROOM AND ANNOUNCING "GUESS WHO'S HAVING SEX DREAMS ABOUT HIS COUSIN AGAIN?" PRETTY RACY STUFF." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT RUNNING HIS MOUTH IN PUBLIC ISN'T THE BIGGEST MISTAKE MADE BY TRUMP LAWYER AND WILFRED BRIMLEY TRIBUTE HEAD, TY COBB. COBB'S BIGGEST BLUNDER IS THAT THE STEAKHOUSE IS "ON THE SAME BLOCK AS 'THE NEW YORK TIMES' WASHINGTON BUREAU." IT'S 171 STEPS AWAY FROM THE WASHINGTON BUREAU OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES." DON'T GO TO THE SAME PLACE THAT PEOPLE EAT WHO ARE OUT TO GET YOU. 3 THAT'S LIKE SHAVING IN A SHARK TANK WHILE WEARING A VEST OF PORK CHOPS. AND THIS IS HUGE. THIS IS HUGE. WE ALSO JUST LEARNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WIRE TAPPED FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT, BEFORE BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SURE, SURE, ABSOLUTELY. YOU APPLAUD UNTIL THEY WIRETAP YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS MEANS MANAFORT WAS UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION WHEN HE INTERVIEWED TO BECOME TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER. "MR. MANAFORT, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS YOUR BIGGEST WEAKNESS?" "WELL, SOMETIMES I THINK I WORK TOO HARD. OH, AND TREASON." NOW, WE ALREADY-- MANAFORT FANS HERE TONIGHT, EVIDENTLY. WE ALREADY KNEW THE F.B.I. CONDUCTED A PREDAWN RAID OF MANAFORT'S HOUSE BACK IN JULY, BUT NOW WE'VE LEARNED THAT INSTEAD OF KNOCKING, "FEDERAL AGENTS PICKED THE LOCK ON HIS FRONT DOOR," WHICH REQUIRED "PROSECUTORS TO PERSUADE A FEDERAL JUDGE THAT MR. MANAFORT WAS LIKELY TO DESTROY EVIDENCE." WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THEY PRESENT TO THE JUDGE TO PROVE THAT, BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT WAS THIS PICTURE. ( LAUGHTER ) "WHO'S THAT?" ( APPLAUSE ) THOSE DOCUMENTS? YES, I THINK I LEFT THEM IN THE FURNACE ROOM. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. NOW, IF THIS SEEMS LIKE AN AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION, ACCORDING TO ONE EXPERT, MUELLER IS "SETTING A TONE. IT'S IMPORTANT EARLY ON TO STRIKE TERROR IN THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON." YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO SET A TONE EARLY IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S WHY, ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE SESSION, MITCH McCONNELL WALKS UP TO THE BIGGEST GUY IN THE SENATE AND SHIVS HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. YEAH. OR ELSE MITCH IS SWEET MEAT, MAN. YEAH. THEY'RE MAKING TURTLE SOUP. ( LAUGHTER ) LEGAL EXPERTS -- LEGAL EXPERTS-- IT'S NOT A METAPHOR. IT'S ACTUAL SOUP. LEGAL EXPERTS SAY MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION IS "MOVING WITH UNUSUAL SPEED." OKAY, THAT'S NICE. HERE'S THE THING. WE DON'T NEED "UNUSUAL SPEED." WE NEED HIGH SPEED. WE NEED MAXIMUM WARP. I'M TALKING, I'M TALKING-- ( APPLAUSE ) CAN TH"STAR TREK" CALL BACK IS T WHAT THAT IS. I'M TALKING "LAW & ORDER" SPEED, LIKE THIS:
SIR, I CAN ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
OF COURSE. FRUIT STAND'S OPEN AT 2:00 A.M., JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT A MAN NAMED PAUL MANAFORT?
MANAFORT? NEVER HEARD OF HIM. OH, WAIT. WAS A GUY COME BY LAST WEEK WITH HIS BUDDY-- DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME. BLOND HAIR, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LAST NAME CLUMP, OR DUMP, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ANYWAY, ON HIS WAY OUT, HE LEAVES BEHIND THIS FILE LABELED, "SECRET RUSSIA COLLUSION PLAN." DON'T ASK ME. I'M JUST A GUY UNLOADING CANTALOUPES."
GUILTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. EMMA STONE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I WILL SIT DOWN WITH HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND, EVERYBODY, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE! JON-- AS YOU GUYS KNOW, AS YOU GUYS KNOW, WE WERE GONE LAST WEEK BECAUSE WE WERE PREPPING FOR THE EMMYS OUT IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, BIG CITY OF DREAMS. AND JON AND THE BAND WERE OUT THERE, TOO. YOU GUYS ACTUALLY WARMED UP THE AUDIENCE. YOU WERE DOING A LOVE RIOT, RIGHT?
Jon: WE WERE DOING A LOVE RIOT MOVING THROUGH THE PRETTY DRESSES AND TUXIEDOZE, JUMPING ON THE SEATS, AND THEN WE STARTED THE SHOW, AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE FUN? DID YOU HAVE FUN?
Jon: I HAD A GREAT TIME. THE WEATHER WAS NICE, BUT I'M GLAD TO BE BACK HERE DOING THE SHOW.
Stephen: I'M GLAD TO BE HERE. IT WAS FUN. IT WAS THE MOST FUN I'VE EVER HAD AT THE EMMYS, AND I'VE WON EMMYS BEFORE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE LOST-- WE LOST THE EMMYS ON SUNDAY NIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE WE LOST TO A DEAR FRIEND, JON OLTERAND "LAST WEEK TONIGHT." THEY'RE AN INCREDIBLE SHOW. IF YOU'VE GOT TO LOSE, YOU HAVE TO LOSE TO SOMEBODY YOU ADMIRE. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THAT CATEGORY I WOULDN'T MIND LOSING TO. AND I KNOW I MADE A JOKE AFTER HE WON, OR THEY WON, WITH JIMMY KIMMEL, WHERE I SAID, "THEY'RE SO GOOD, THEY CAN ONLY DO ONE A WEEK." BUT THE TRUTH IS, THEY ONLY DO ONE A WEEK. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT'S NOT ON THEM. THEY'RE NOT LAZY. THEY'RE WORKING HARD. WE'RE INSANE DOING FIVE A WEEK. WE'VE GOT THE PROBLEM. NOT THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO MWA! YOU'RE THE BEST. OFFICIALLY. ♪ ♪ ♪ PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. FOLKS, I AM TERRIBLY EXCITED BECAUSE SHE WAS FIRST A FIRST LADY, THEN A SENATOR, THEN SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I WOULD HAVE BET ANYTHING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH--
OH, STEPHEN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANKS.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED "WHAT HAPPENED." ( LAUGHTER ) AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO START THIS INTERVIEW, OTHER THAN SAYING WHAT HAPPENED? ( LAUGHTER )
WOW.
Stephen: WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, THAT'S THE QUESTION I TRY TO ANSWER.
Stephen: OKAY.
YEAH, BECAUSE IT WAS A QUESTION I ASKED MYSELF STARTING ON ELECTION NIGHT. AND I STARTED --
Stephen: WHAT TIME ON ELECTION NIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, AS I WRITE IN THE BOOK, MIDNIGHT.
Stephen: YEAH.
MIDNIGHT.
Stephen: I REMEMBER.
THE DARK TIME OF THE SOUL, MIDNIGHT.
Stephen: YEAH. I'M WAITING FOR IT TO NOT BE MIDNIGHT SOON.
YEAH, RIGHT. AND SO I-- I WAS ASKING IT LIKE YOU JUST SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED!" AND I FIGURED, MAKE I'D BETTER TRY TO FIND OUT AND FIGURE IT OUT. SO THAT'S WHY I DOVE INTO THIS BOOK. IT WAS VERY PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT. BUT AT THE END, I REALLY FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE MY VERY BEST TO LAY OUT WHAT HAPPENED SO 9 THAT  DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I MEAN, THAT'S MY PRIMARY GOAL HERE-- THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID, "OH, BOY, I WISH HILLARY CLINTON WOULD JUST GO AWAY."
YEAH.
Stephen: "JUST GO AWAY."
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THEY'D TAKE UP A COLLECTION AND SEND ME SOMEWHERE REALLY NICE.
Stephen: REALLY?
I MIGHT CONSIDER IT.
Stephen: OBAMA'S ON DAVID GEFFEN'S YACHT A LOT. YOU COULD GO WITH HIM.
WELL, I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: BILLION, I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I AGREE. AT FIRST, I COULD UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE CALLS. PEOPLE SAYING, LIKE, ," THE REPUBLICANS ARE TEARING THEMSELVES APART. DON'T GIVE THEM SOMEONE TO RALLY AROUND IN OPPOSITION TO," BECAUSE YOU WERE A CONVENIENT FIGURE FOR THEM TO UNITE AGAINST.
RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT I ACTUALLY DO NOT THINK THAT'S HOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE STOPPED. I THINK IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO BE CIVICALLY ENGAGED AND BELIEVE IN THE PROMISES OF THE PROGRESS OF THE LAST 50 YEARS THAT WILL SAVE THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I AGREE COMPLETELY. ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY.
Stephen: BUT, WAIT A SECOND. IT MUST NOT HAVE BEEN EASY.
NO.
Stephen: IT MUST NOT HAVE BEEN EASY TO WRITE THIS BOOK.
IT WASN'T EASY. IT WAS PAINFUL. IT WAS HORRIBLE RELIVING IT. AND, YOU KNOW, BEING AS CANDID, OPEN AS I COULD BE ABOUT THE MISTAKES I MADE AND TALKING ABOUT THOSE. BUT, ALSO, TRYING TO COME TO GRIPS, AS I WRITE IN THE BOOK, ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM, YOU KNOW, SEXISM AND MISOGYNY, TO VOTER PUSUPPRESSION, TO THE UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR OF THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I., AND THE RUSSIANS, AND THE RUSSIANS. AND YOU HAVE BEEN SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY THAT THEY THINK THEY SUCCEEDED IN MESSING WITH OUR DEMOCRACY. AND I JUST CAN'T ABIDE THAT. SEE --
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY SUCCEEDED IN MESSING WITH OUR DEMOCRACY?
YES, I DO, I DO, I DO.
Stephen: TO WHAT AGREE, INFLUENCING THE VOTE OR INFLUENCING OPINION?
INFLUENCING VOTERS, AND, THEREFORE, INFLUENCING OPINION I THINK IS BECOMING CLEARER AND CLEARER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION-- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION ARE GOING TO FIND. I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR THAT. BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN WITH A STRAIGHT FACE SAY THAT THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SET OUT TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION, AND THEY DID SO. THIS LATEST REVELATION ABOUT THE WAY THEY BOUGHT AD ON FACEBOOK AND TARGETED THEM, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT A LOT MORE, STEPHEN. AND I AM SAYING AS CLEARLY AS I CAN-- I FEEL LIKE I'M A BIT OF A, YOU KNOW, PAULA REVERE. I'M TRYING TO SOUND THE ALARM ABOUT THIS. IS THAT-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PUTIN'S STRATEGY IS. HE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE DEMOCRACY. HE THINKS IT'S AN INCONVENIENT, MESSY PROCESS. AND HE DOESN'T LIKE US, AND HE WANTS TO DESTABILIZE OUR COUNTRY SOW DOUBT ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. THE LATEST REVELATIONS WHERE YOU HAD RUSSIANS PRETENDING TO BE AMERICANS. FAKE AMERICANS WITH FAKE NEWS AND FAKE STORIES AND FAKE DEMONSTRATIONS. THAT WASN'T JUST BECAUSE HE'S BORED AND HAS NOTHING TO DO. HE WANTS TO UNDERMINE HOW WE SEE EACH OTHER, HOW WE RESPECT EACH OTHER, HOW WE SUPPORT OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR SOCIETY. SO I THINK THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY HAD A GOOD OUTING IN 2016, AND I THINK THEY WILL BE BACK IN 2018 AND 2020, UNLESS WE STOP THEM.
Stephen: NOW YOU MENTIONED-- ( APPLAUSE ) ...THAT PUTIN DOESN'T LIKE DEMOCRACY AND HE DOESN'T LIKE AMERICA. PART OF THE SPECULATION IS HE SPECIFICALLY DOESN'T LIKE YOU. DO YOU THINK THIS WAS PERSONAL ON A CERTAIN LEVEL?
I THINK IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT THE ROLE I PLAYED AS SECRETARY OF STATE, WHICH HE DID MORPH INTO A GRUDGE AGAINST ME BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE DESERVE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A DEMOCRACY."
Stephen: QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF HIS ELECTION IN 2011.
THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THAT'S RIGHT. AND SO OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT HE DID HAVE A PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST ME. YOU KNOW, I DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. I THINK IT'S PART OF HIS WORLD VIEW WHICH IS ALL TIED UP WITH HIS ANGER, HIS DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, AND HIS FEELING THAT WE'RE HIS NUMBER ONE RIVAL. HE WANTS TO REALLY UNDERMINE THE EUROPEAN-AMERICAN ALLIANCE. AND SO I SEE IT AS-- YOU KNOW, I WAS DOING MY JOB. I WAS HONORED TO DO MY JOB, TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN VALUES AND OUR DEMOCRACY. AND PARTLY BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN, WHICH DOES SEEM TO GET HIM A BIT AGITATED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND HE ACTUALLY HAS SAID THAT. SOME THINGS ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: DID HE EVER SAY ANYTHING TO YOU PERSONALLY THAT DEMONSTRATED HIS--
WELL, HE DEMONSTRATED-- AS I WRITE IN THE BOOK, YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN EXPRESSION, WE CERTAINLY KNOW IT IN NEW YORK, CALLED "MAN SPREADING." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YES.  ( APPLAUSE )
AND EVERY TIME I MET WITH HIM, IT WOULD BE... OKAY. THE WHOLE DEAL. AND SO I'D GO TO MEETINGS WITH HIM-- ONE IN PARTICULAR, WE WERE IN HIS DACHA OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW. AND THE PRESS COMES IN, AND HE JUST BERATES AMERICA ABOUT ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT ANNOYS HIM ABOUT US. AND THEN THE PRESS LEAVES, AND I'VE GOT FOUR OR FIVE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH HIM AND RUSSIA ON. AND I ALWAYS CAME TO MY MEETINGS WITH HIM TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT I COULD ACTUALLY ENGAGE HIM ABOUT. SO WE WENT THROUGH, YOU KNOW, THE ECONOMY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW, LIKE-- AS PRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE SAID, LIKE THE BORED GUY IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM, COULDN'T CARE LESS. THEN I SAID, "YOU KNOW, I AM REALLY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU CARE ABOUT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, AND THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE SPECIES IN RUSSIA, LIKE SIBERIAN TIGERS AND POLAR BEARS." THEN HE CAME ALIVE. AND THEN WE HAD AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION.
Stephen: "I WRESTLE POLAR BEARS."
NO, HE SAID TO ME-- ( LAUGHTER ) HE SAID, "COME WITH ME." HE TAKES ME DOWNTOWN STAIRS, DOWN THIS CORDO, INTO THE DOOR-- ALL OF HIS SECURITY GUYS ARE JUMPING UP BECAUSE WE WEREN'T EXPECTED-- INTO THIS INNER SANCTUM WITH THIS HUGE DESK AND THE BIGGEST MAP OF RUSSIA, I THINK, EXISTS. AND HE STARTED TELLING ME HE'S GOING HERE TO TAG POLAR BEARS. AND THEN HE SAYS TO ME, "WOULD YOUR HUSBAND LIKE TO COME?" AND I SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I'LL ASK HIM, BUT IF HE'S BUSY, I'LL GO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK, SECRETARY CLINTON AND I MIGHT JUST BREAK OUT THE CHARDONNAY. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH SECRETARY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON TALKING ABOUT HER NEW BOOK "WHAT HAPPENED." NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IS, AS YOU SAID, IT'S CLEAR THE RUSSIANS WERE TRYING TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. YOU SAID WHEN YOU WERE ON WITH TERRY GROSS ON NPR, IF IT'S PROVEN, IF THERE'S A DEEPER CONNECTION, SOME SORT OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA, THAT WOULD BE GROUNDS TO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY QUESTION IS, MY QUESTION IS-- I MEAN, I HAVE THESE FANTASIES, BUT MY QUESTION IS-- SERIOUSLY-- MY QUESTION IS WHAT THEN? THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM TO QUESTION THE ELECTION.
NO.
Stephen: OUR ELECTIONS ARE MESSY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THIS IS JUST WHAT HAPPENED.
SO AS I SAY IN THE BOOK, YEAH, RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT CONTESTING THE ELECTION, INCLUDING ME. BUT I DO THINK-- NO, BECAUSE THERE IS NO MECHANISM.
Stephen: THIS IS SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION, UNLUKE THE GUY WHO GOT THE JOB.
YEAH, THERE IS NO MECHANISM.  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT I THINK LEGITIMACY IS ROOTED IN WHAT COMES OUT OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, BECAUSE IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OF COORDINATION, COMMUNICATION-- WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE-- THEN I THINK MEDICINE OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO SAY, WELL, THOSE RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT LEGITIMACY. NOW, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THOSE QUESTIONS, BESIDES ASK THEM? WHAT YOU DO IS MOBILIZE POLITICALLY TO EXPRESS YOUR WILL AND YOUR REJECTION OF THAT KIND OF RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT AND COORDINATION AT THE BALLOT BOX. I MEAN, THAT IS WHERE WE SETTLE OUR POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THAT'S WHERE IT SHOULD BE.
Stephen: I-- I AGREE. DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH AT THE U.N. TODAY?
I SAW PARTS OF IT, YES.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU-- WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY DARK, DANGEROUS, NOT THE KIND OF MESSAGE THAT THE LEADER OF THE GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE DELIVERING.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU ARE BOTH-- YOU ARE BOTH REQUIRED TO STAND UP FOR THE VALUES OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IN-- DEMOCRACY AND OPPORTUNITY-- AS A WAY TO DEMONSTRATION CLEARLY THE UNITED STATES REMAINS THE BEACON THAT WE WANT IT TO BE, WHILE, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU FACE DANGEROUS SITUATIONS-- LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NORTH KOREA-- TO MAKE IT CLEAR YOUR FIRST APPROACH SHOULD ALWAYS BE DIPLOMATIC. WHAT I HOPED THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SAID WAS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, "WE VIEW THIS AS DANGEROUS OUR ALLIES, TO THE REGION, AND EVEN TO OUR COUNTRY. WE CALL ON ALL NATIONS TO WORK WITH US TO TRY TO END THE THREAT POSED BY KIM JONG-UN." AND NOT CALL HIM "ROCKET MAN" THE OLD ELTON JOHN SONG, BUT TO SAY, CLEARLY, "WE WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY ATTACKS ON OUR FRIENDS OR OURSELVES." BUT YOU SHOULD LEAD WITH DIPLOMACY. YOU SHOULD LEAD WITH THE COMMITMENT OF TRYING TO AVOID CONFLICT, HOWEVER YOU CAN.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY IN THE BOOK IS THAT IN RECOVERING FROM THIS AND WHILE WRITING THE BOOK, YOU LEANED HEAVILY ON CHARDONNAY. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU-- WOULD YOU CARE FOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH, SURE. ABSOLUTELY. WELL, YEAH, YEAH, THERE WERE A FEW OTHER THINGS, BUT THIS HELPED. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING? BECAUSE I DID NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AND I COULD BARELY DO IT. IN 2000-- I DON'T THINK AL GORE SHAVED FOR A YEAR. HOW DID YOU--
YEAH, THAT WASN'T AN OPTION FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, CHEERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE BOOK IS "WHAT HAPPENED." LET'S HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. AVAILABLE NOW. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITHED WITH  STONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "THE HELP," "SPIDER-MAN," AND HER OSCAR-WINNING PERFORMANCE IN "LA LA LAND." SHE NOW STARS AS TENNIS STAR BILLIE JEAN KING IN "BATTLE OF THE SEXES."

NO, I'M A TENNIS PLAYER WHO HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN.

Stephen: EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED.
SO IT TOOK PLACE TOMORROW, SEPTEMBER 20, 1973, 44 YEARS AGO. AND BOBBY RIGGS WAS 55 YEARS OLD. BILLIE JEAN KING WAS 29. SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE NUMBER ONE FEMALE TENNIS PLAYER IN THE WORLD. AND HE CHALLENGED HER TO A TRUE BATTLE OF THE SEXES AND 90 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED. AND IT WAS-- IT WAS AN ENORMOUS TENNIS MATCH. IT WAS, LIKE, A HUGE ENTERTAINMENT SPECTACLE.
