IN THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THE ACTOR JUDE LAW IS REPRESENTED BY TWO SEPARATE BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT GROUPS-- JUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE CRIME, AND THE JUDICIARY WHO PROSECUTE THE OFFENDERS. THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.
Stephen: SKEWS ME. DO YOU KNOW THE WHEREABOUTS OF THIS MAN, JUDE LAW?
THIS MALUK! I SEEN HIM IN THE TRAIL FOR THIS MOVIE "GENIUS" THAT OPENS IN CINEMAS NATIONWIDE ON FRIDAY. BUT I DON'T KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS NOW, FORGET ABOUT IT.
Stephen: THANK YOU, NEW YORK NATIVE.
THIS GUY DISAPPEARS INTO HIS PARTS. UNBELIEVABLE.
Stephen: OH, TRUST ME. I BELIEVE YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JUDE LAW. NORMAN REEDUS. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY. HUNDRED WATERS WITH SKRILLEX FEATURING CHANCE THE RAPPER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY! HEY, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, EVERYBODY DOWN HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON, BROTHER MAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU. HEY, EVERYBODY UP THERE! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE WATCHING THE NEWS. THE ELECTION CONTINUES TO GRIND ON. IT'S A JUGGERNAUT THAT DOESN'T STOP. LAST NIGHT, EVERY MAJOR NEWS OUTLET DECLARED THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAD CLINCHED THE DEEMENT NOMINATION--  ( CHEERS ) MAKING HER THE FIRST WOMAN IN U.S. HISTORY TO BECOME A MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. IT SENDS A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO ALL WOMEN THAT IF YOU JUST WORK HARD, SOMEDAY YOU, TOO, CAN BE VILLIFIED AS AN UNLIKABLE, MACHIAVELLIAN CRONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, IT LOOKS LIKE THE GENERAL ELECTION WILL COME DOWN TO HILLARY CLINTON VERSUS DONALD TRUMP. WHICH IS FITTING, REALLY, SINCE SHE'LL BE THE FIRST, YOU KNOW, FEMALE NOMINEE OF HER PARTY, AND HE'LL BE HIS PARTY'S LAST NOMINEE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, TECHNICALLY, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN TOLD SHE CLINCHED IT, TECHNICALLY FIVE STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, THE MOST POP LUST STATE IN THE UNION, HAD NOT HELD THEIR PRIMARIES, BUT THE MEDIA DECIDED TO CALL HILLARY'S VICTORY YESTERDAY, BASED ON REPORTERS DOING STUFF LIKE THIS.
WE'VE BEEN CALLING SUPER DELEGATES, THE UNPLEDGED DELEGATES, PARTY LEADERS, AND PARTY INSIDERS. WE REACHED THE POINT WHERE HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE SUPPORT OF 2,383 DELEGATES, WHICH IS THE NUMBER NEEDED TO WIN THE NOMINATION AT THE CONVENTION.
Stephen: SO ALL YOU BERNIE SUPPORTERS WHO MAY BE FEELING DISENFRANCHISED, JUST CALM DOWN AND REMEMBER, THE MEDIA AND THE SUPERDELEGATES HAVE BEEN TALKING SECRETLY, AND THEY DECIDED IT'S OVER. THEY KNOW BEST, OKAY. BUT GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS! GREAT JOB! ( LAUGHTER ) THAT SHOULD CALM THEM DOWN. THE CLINTON FOLKS AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT THE MEDIA JUMPING THE GUN ON HER CLINCHING IT. SHE WANTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT AT HER VICTORY REALLY TONIGHT, SO WHEN SHE DOES ANNOUNCE, EVERYONE PLEASE ACT LIKE YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING, OKAY. LIKE WHEN YOU SECRETLY WATCH "GAME OF THRONES" ALONE THEN WHEN YOU REWATCH IT WITH YOUR SPOUSE YOU HAVE TO ACT ALL SURPRISED. ONLY IN THIS CASE, SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED TO A WOMAN. THIS IS A GOOD THING. IT'S A VERY GOOD THING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH "GAME OF THRONES." BAD THINGS HAPPEN. ON THE EVE OF HILLARY'S HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT, A VINTAGE RECORDING HAS SURFACED OF HER 1969 COMMENCEMENT SPEECH TO HER FELLOW GRADUATES AT WELLESLEY COLLEGE. HER CLASSMATES THAT YEAR VOTED AND CHOSE CLINTON TO GIVE THE SPEECH, ALTHOUGH BERNIE SANDERS INSISTS, "THIS ISN'T OVER. I STILL HAVE A PATH TO GIVING THAT SPEECH. I'M BUILDING A TIME MACHINE, AND I PROMISE THERE WILL BE A CONTESTED COMMENCEMENT." YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS ACTUAL TAPE OF CLINTON'S ACTUAL SPEECH IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET RIGHT NOW. TAKE A LISTEN.
WE FEEL THAT FOR TOO LONG OUR LEADERS HAVE VIEWED POLITICS AS THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE. AND THE CHALLENGE NOW IS TO PRACTICE POLITICS AS THE ART OF MAKING WHAT APPEARS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE.
Stephen: AND NOW SHE HAS DONE IT. SHE HAS MADE THE IMPOSSIBLE, POSSIBLE. SHE IS A WOMAN WHO HAS CLINCHED THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D ONLY SEE IN A SCI-FI NOVEL OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S HAPPENED IN A LOT OF PLATES PLACES. HAPPENED IN A LOT OF PLACES. AND EVEN AT THE TENDER AGE OF 22, IT'S CLEAR THAT HILLARY HAD VISION.
ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC THINGS THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, A BEAUTIFUL DAY, WAS THAT I WAS TALKING TO A WOMAN WHO SAID THAT SHE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ME FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. SHE WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE TODAY AND LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT IT IS SHE SEES, BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID.
Stephen: I DON'T BLAME THAT WOMAN IN 1969 FOR BEING AFRAID OF THE FUTURE. THE '70s WERE TERRIFYING-- VIETNAM, GAS LINES, BURT REYNOLDS IN "COSMO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL WHERE THAT BEAR ENDS AND BURT BEGINS. I'M PRETTY SURE CBS IS GOING TO MAKE US BLUR THE ENTIRE BEAR. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, TRUMP HAS CLAIMED THAT A JUDGE WITH MEXICAN HERITAGE CAN'T BE IMPARTIAL IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST HIM. AND THIS MORNING, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, PAUL RYAN, CALLED THAT "THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION OF A RACIST COMMENT." EXCEPT, OF COURSE,-- ( APPLAUSE ) EXCEPT, OF COURSE, IN TEXAS, WHERE THEY CHANGED THAT TEXTBOOK YEARS AGO. ( LAUGHTER ) RYAN JOINS A GROWING GROUP OF REPUBLICAN LEADERS WHO WANT TRUMP TO STOP INSULTING LATINOS. IT'S A GROUP MARCO RUBIO REFERS TO AS, "WHERE WERE YOU GUYS FOUR MONTHS AGO?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S MY IMPRESSION OF MARCO RUBIO BY THE WAY. WHAT? I...
Jon: LIKE MIEP. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO SAY MUCH. BUT RYAN, RYAN, EVEN THOUGH HE HAS SAID THIS IS A RACIST COMMENT, RYAN IS STILL BACKING TRUMP. I GUESS WHAT HE'S SAYING IS, "SURE, TRUMP IS A RACIST, BUT HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD ONES." SPEAKING OF RICH WEIRDOS, HUGH HEFNER HAS SOLD THE PLAYBOY MANSION. THIS IS TRULY, TRULY, THE END OF AN ERA AND CURE FOR SOME SERIOUS STAPH INFECTIONS. THE ASKING PRICE FOR THE MANSION WAS $200 MILLION. BUT IT WAS REALLY ONLY $100 THE OTHER $100 MILLION WENT TOWARD POWER WASHING THE GROTTO. BUT THE MAN WHO BOUGHT IT IS THE CO-OWNER OF THE COMPANY THAT MAKES TWINKIES. THAT MAKES SENSE, SINCE HEFNER IS ALSO A SPONGY, CREAM-FILLED THING THAT WILL LAST FOREVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, FINALLY, HUGE NEWS TODAY OUT OF THE BREAKFAST INDUSTRY, WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INDUSTRY OF THE DAY. GENERAL MILLS CORPORATION HAS ANNOUNCED IT IS RELEASING THEIR FIRST NEW CEREAL IN 15 YEARS. THAT'S RIGHT-- IT TOOK ALMOST TWO DECADES, BUT THEY FINALLY FOUND A NEW WAY TO COMBINE SUGAR AND CORN. THE NEW CEREAL IS CALLED "TINY TOAST." AND IT LOOKS LIKE LITTLE PIECES OF TOAST. IT'S WAY MORE CONVENIENT THAN JUST STANDING FARTHER AWAY FROM YOUR REGULAR-SIZED TOAST. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ME LOOKING AT MY TOAST FROM A DISTANCE. THIS IS MARCO RUBIO LOOKING AT HIS TOAST FROM A DISTANCE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE CEREAL SALES HAVE BEEN DECLINING STEADILY OVER THE PAST DECADE, SO A BRAND NEW FLAVOR COULD BE THE BIGGEST BREAKFAST NEWS SINCE SONNY THE CUCKOO BIRD FINALLY WENT TO REHAB. HE WAS SO COO-COO FOR COCOA PUFFS, LET'S JUST SAY TOUCAN SAM WASN'T THE ONLY ONE "FOLLOWING HIS NOSE." OOOH! OOOH! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS! THAT SOUND CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING. IT'S TIME FOR THE MONOLOGUE REMIX, FEATURING SKRILLEX WITH A SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY CHANCE THE RAPPER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND. SKRILLEX, CHANCE THE RAPPER. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU ALL READY FOR THE REMIX, EVERYBODY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, LET'S REMIX THOSE LAST JOKESES. HERE WE GO.

Stephen: I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT SONG, BUT I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.
Jon: I JUST MADE IT UP. THAT'S JAZZ.
Stephen: WE'VE HAD HIP-HOP, WE'VE HAD JAZZ. WE COVER ALL THE BASES HERE.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I LOVE NEW YORK, BUT IT CAMBRIDGE DANGEROUS PLACE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE ARE STILL A FEW RESTAURANTS IN THE CITY THAT DON'T DISPLAY THEIR SODIUM CONTENT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S GETTING MORE DANGEROUS ALL THE TIME. IN FACT, RIGHT HERE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, THERE IS A VICIOUS TURF WAR GOING ON.
BENEATH THE CHEERY JINGLES, THERE IS A TURF WAR UNDER WAY AMONG THE ICE CREAM TRUCKS OF MID-TOWN MANHATTAN.
MR. SOFTEE AGAINST NEW YORK ICE CREAM-- AN UNLIKELY PAIR OF ENEMIES BUT A FIGHT GOING ON FOR THREE YEARS. MR. SOFTEE DRIVERS WON'T PARK THEIR TRUCKS BETWEEN 34th AND 60th STREET FOR FEAR OF RETALIATION.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. THERE IS A WAR BETWEEN MR. SOFTEE AND NEW YORK ICE CREAM. IT'S JUST LIKE THE WAR BETWEEN THE SHARKS AND JETS, IF BOTH GANGS WERE LOGIE ON SOFT SERVE. THE LEADER IN THIS FIGHT IS NEW YORK ICE CREAM, WHOSE DRIVERS ACTUALLY USED TO WORK FOR MR. SOFTEE. AND WHEN THEY LEFT, THEY TOOK THEIR MR. SOFTEE TRUCKS AND REPAINTED THE MR. SOFTEE LOGO TO SAY "MASTER SOFTEE," WHICH THEY HAD TO CHANGE BECAUSE THAT WAS ALREADY THE TITLE OF THE WORST PORNO EVER. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW MASTER SOFTEE HAS BECOME NEW YORK ICE CREAM, AND ACCORDING TO THE MR. SOFTEE DRIVERS, THEY'RE REALLY INTIMIDATING. THEY'LL SURROUND RIVALS' TRUCKS AND ROUGH UP THEIR DRIVERS. AS ONE MR. SOFTEE DRIVER PUT IT, "LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BUSINESS. EVERY TRUCK HAS A BAT INSIDE." THAT WILL GUARANTEE AN ICE CREAM HEADACHE. ♪ ♪ ♪
HEY, FRIEND, HEY, PAL.
Stephen: HI, I CAN HELP YOU?
I WAS JUST PASSING BY AND COULDN'T HELP OVERHEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT THE ICE CREAM SCUFFLE.
Stephen: I WAS JUST TALKING TO EVERYBODY ABOUT IT.
I WOULD CHANGE THE SUBJECT IF I WERE YOU OR SOMEONE WILL GET TWO SCOOPS WITH THEIR TEETH AS SPRINKLES.
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?
NO, I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF APPLIED CORRECTLY, THE TIP OF A SUGAR CONE CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH YOUR JUGULAR.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE, ICE CREAM MAN.
TROUBLE? I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT ICE CREAM. DID YOU KNOW AN ICE CREAM SCOOPER IS ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE AS A MAN'S TESTICLES? YOU DO THE MATH. ONLY HAVE TO COUNT TO TWO.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT IN HERE, BUT I THOUGHT ICE CREAM MEN WERE WHOLESOME AND FRIENDLY, LIKE THAT SWEET LITTLE ICE CREAM TRUCK SONG.
YOU EVER HEAR THE LYRICS TO THAT SONG? "I FOLLOWED YOU HOME, AND I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. THERE'S A BIG SHALLOW GRAVE IN THE FORREST.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH. SAY GOODBYE TO THE ICE CREAM MAN, EVERYBODY!

Stephen: WELL, LOOK, YOU ARE-- YOU ARE-- YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BETTER THAN YOU WERE IN "JUDE LAW AND ORDER."
I AGREE.
Stephen: I REALLY THOUGHT YOU PLAYING A MULTIPLE CHARACTER WAS FANTASTIC, LIKE ALEC GUINNESS.
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A SERIES THERE.
Stephen: YOU'RE A BUSY GUY.
I CAN SQUEEZE THAT IN.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU SAW FROM THE REACTION OF THE AUDIENCE EVERYBODY LOVES JUDE LAW, BUT THERE ARE SOME PLACE WHERE'S THEY DON'T. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU WERE A LITTLE LATE. YOU WERE A LITTLE LATE ON THAT ONE. BUT THERE ARE SOME PLACES, I UNDERSTAND, WHO DON'T LOVE THE JUDE LAW. IS IT BELARUS? WHAT HAPPENED IN BELARUS GISUPPORT A COMPANY, A THEATER COMPANY WHO HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM BELARUS. BELARUS IS THE LAST DICTATORSHIP IN EUROPE. AND THE PRESIDENT THERE BANNED THIS THEATER COMPANY --
WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY WERE NOT GOOD? WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM?
YEAH-- NO, IT WASN'T THAT REN'T WEREN'T WEREN'TED ANY GOOD ( LAUGHTER ) THEY WERE PUT ON POLITICAL THEATER SO THE HEADS OF THE TWO COMPANIES WERE ACTUALLY KICKED OUT, AND I-- YOU KNOW, I'M A GREAT SUPPORTER OF THEIR WORK AND I BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH --
DO YOU HAVE A BELARUSIAN CONNECTION IN SOME WAY?
NO.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU--
NONE AT ALL.
Stephen: BUT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWSES ABOUT THE WORK OF THEATERS IN BELARUS.
BASICALLY, THEY WERE HOLD AGO THEY WERE PUTTING ON THEIR PRODUCTIONS IN A THEATER IN LONDON, THAT I'M AN ASSOCIATE OF, AND I LOVED THEIR WORK AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SUPPORT, SO TOM STOPPARD, THE WRITER GOT INVOLVED AND I GOT INVOLVED AS AN ACTOR. AND THEY BANNED SOME OF MY FIMEDZ. SOME OF MY FILMS DESERVED TO BE BANNED. BUT THEY BANNED MY FILMS IN THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH-- KEVIN SPACEY GOT INVOLVED IN THIS CAMPAIGN, TOO, AND THEY BANNED HIS FILMS AS WELL.
Stephen: YOU AND KEVIN SPACEY.
SOMEONE JUST TOLD ME THEY BANNED PET SHOP BOYS MUSIC. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THIS MOVEMENT. I FIGURED THE DICTATORS SIMPLY DON'T LIKE THE PET SHOP BOYS.
Stephen: MAYBE NOT.
OR IF YOU'RE A DICTATOR YOU BAN WHAT YOU WANT.
Stephen: MAYBE HE THINKS YOU AND KEVIN SPACEY ARE THE THE PET SHOP BOYS. YOU'RE THAT GOOD. YOU COULD PULL IT OFF. IN THIS YOU PLAY THOMAS WOLF, THE GREAT SOUTHERN NOVELIST-- A NICE SOUTHERN ACCENT, BY THE WAY. I'M FROM NORTH CAROLINA.
I KNOW.
Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE A NORTH CAROLINA ACCIDENT, IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE SHOOTING FOR?
IT WAS.
Stephen: IT'S UNEDUCATED.
I HEARD ABOUT THIS. SOMETHING ABOUT BARK COUP SAUCE.
Stephen: THERE'S A FIGHT BETWEEN NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, ABOUT WHICH IS THE TRUE CAROLINA, AND WE FORGIVE THEM FOR THEIR ARROGANCE.
WHAT IS THE BARBECUE SAUCE INGREDIENT CONTROVERSY.
Stephen: SOUTH CAROLINA IS KNOWN FOR A MUSTARD-BASED SAUCE, AND NORTH CAROLINA IS KNOWN FOR JUST RUINING BARBECUE WITH A VINEGAR. BASED BARBECUE. THEY PUT VINEGAR ON IT. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. IN THIS MOVIE, WOLFE WAS A GENIUS BUT IS HE THE GENIUS OF THIS MOVIE OR IS IT THE EDITOR WHO IS ALSO HEMINGWAY'S EDTO THE.
FAULKNER, HE DISCOVERED HEMINGWAY. THAT IS THE QUESTION OF THE PIECE, WHAT IS IT TO BE A GENIUS? IT'S A WORD THAT'S USED RATHER TOO LIBERALLY I THINK NOWADAYS. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SAID TO BE A GENIUS OF THIS, A GENIUS OF THAT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN CALLED A GENIUS?
I HAVEN'T YET, BUT I'M HOPING.
Stephen: IS THIS-- IS THIS MOVIE JUST FISH AGO EXACTLY. WHO KNOWS? BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S THE RELATIONSHIP. IT'S THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER. THERE'S A GREAT LINE IN THE FILM WHERE STHN DESCRIBES MAX PERKINS AS BEING A GENIUS RELATIONSHIP, A FRIENDSHIP. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL WAY OF USING THE WORD. REALLY THE PIECE WAS LOOKING AT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO CREATE GENIUS.
Stephen: WOW. DO YOU KNOW A GENIUS? YOU CAN SAY, "YEAH, THAT PERSON SAY GENIUS?" HAVE YOU MET SOMEBODY YOU WOULD BE COMFORTABLE TELLING-- IN THE ART WORLD I HAVE BEEN IN, I MET A GENIUS.
THE PERSON THAT SPRINGS TO MIND, AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WORK WITH HIM, SEVERAL YEARS AGO, 15 YEARS AGO, WAS STEPHEN SPIELBERG. HE'S PRETTY CLOSE TO BEING A GENIUS IN MY MIND.
Stephen: PRETTY GOOD, PRETTY GOOD.  ( APPLAUSE ) SO YOU CAN'T PERFORM IN BELL ROUGA. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOME THINGS YOU HAVE REFUSED TO PERFORM YOURSELF. LIKE, YOU WERE OFFERED A ROLE "THE D.C. UNIVERSE," LIKE THE PLUMB ROLE IN THE "D.C. UNIVERSE" AND YOU SAID NO.
THIS WAS A WHILE AGO. THEY REBOOTED "SUPERMAN" NOT THIS LAST TIME WITH HENRY CARVEL. THEY DID IT ONCE BEFORE.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, LIKE 2004, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHEN I WAS, OBVIOUSLY, YOUNG ENOUGH TO PLAY SUPERMAN.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I CAN SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF YOUR CHEST RIGHT NOW, AND I'M THINKING YOU'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THEY ASKED ME-- ( APPLAUSE ) AND --
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. RATINGS, MY FRIEND, RATINGS.
SO I WAS APPROACHED, AND AT THE TIME I DON'T KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T-- IT DIDN'T FLOAT MY BOAT,UN. I JUST DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO GO THERE. FIRST OF ALL, --
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE MAN OF STEEL?
I'M AN ENGLISHMAN AND I-- IT DIDN'T SEEM TO FIT. AND I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT THE OUTFIT, AND I JUST DIDN'T FANCY IT. AND THIS DIRECTOR WAS VERY KEEN TO MEET AND IMPRESS IT UPON ME, AND I WAS ACTUALLY OUT IN CALIFORNIA, AND HE SAID, "LOOK, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS SUIT ON. THE SUIT IS AMAZING. WE REVAMPED THE SUIT." I SAID, "SEND THE SUIT OVER. SEND THE SUIT OVER.
Stephen: DID THEY SEND A GUARD.
OH, YEAH, THERE'S A GUARD AIR, BIG GUARD. AND THE LADY FROM WARDROBE, AND HAY BRING THE SUIT IN. AND I'M LIKE, "I'M NOT GOING TO TRY IT ON IN FRONT OF YOU. I'M GOING INTO THE BATHROOM." I TAKE THE SUIT INTO THE BATHROOM. I'M PUTTING IT INTO I LOOK AROUND, I'M IN THE MIRROR, AND SUDDENLY I'M SUPERMAN, RIGHT? AND THE MUSIC KIND OF COMES IN ♪ TA-TA-TA.  ♪ ♪ I STOOD THERE AND HAD THIS PICTURE OF ME IN THAT COSTUME ON POSTERS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND I SAID NO WAY AND UNZIPPED IT.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T TAKE A SELFIE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
IT'S IN THERE. I WAS SUPERMAN FOR TWO MINUTE. THAT'S ENOUGH.
Stephen: SPEAK OF TWO MINUTE UWE'RE GOING TO TAKE A TWO-MINUTE BREAK. CAN YOU STICK AROUND.
SURE.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JUDE LAW. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WE'RE BACK WITH OUR FRIEND JUDE LAW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, I WAS SAYING HOW YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU,S AS A SERIOUS, DRAMATIC ACTOR, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL, LIKE A DRAMATIC LINE, NO MATTER WHAT SITUATION YOU'RE PLAYING. YOU HAVE PLAYED IN SCIENCE FICTION. YOU'VE PLAYED PERIOD DRAMA BUT YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO SELL THAT DRAMATIC LINE.
IT'S AN ACTOR'S JOB TO DO JUSTICE TO THE SCENE, NO MATTER WHAT THE CONTEXT.
Stephen: SO DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DELIVER SERIOUS, HEAVY DIALOGUE IN ANY SITUATION.
YES, I WOULD SOAP HOE.
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S PUT THOSE ACTING SKILLS TO THE TEST. I HAVE TWO SETS OF PING-PONG BALLS THAT WE HAVE PAINTED EYES ON. YOU AND I WILL EACH GET A PAIR OF THESE, AND WE WILL PERFORM DRAMATIC SCENES FROM STAGE AND CINEMA WHILE WEARING THESE. ARE YOU READY TO TRY THIS, JUDE LAW?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: YOU GOING TO DO BLUE OR BROWN.
BROWN.
Stephen: I'LL DO BLUE. THIS IS "THE LATE SHOW PING-PONG EYEBALL ACTING." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: JUDE?
TO BE OR NOT TO BE? THAT IS THE QUESTION. WHETHER 'TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE, OR TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLES AND, BY OPPOSING, END THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TO DIE, TO SLEEP. NO MORE. AND BY A SLEEP, TO SAY WE END THE HEARTACHE AND THE THOUSAND NATURAL SHOCKS THAT FLESH IS HEIR TO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT WAS AMAZING. IT WAS AMAZING. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DO THE WHOLE PLAY LIKE THIS. IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE. CAN I DO A SCENE WITH YOU?
WHAT SHOULD WE DO.
Stephen: LET'S TRY ANOTHER TIMELESS TALE OF LOVE ON THE THE HIGH SEAS, ""TITANIC." YOU PLAY ROSE, AND I WILL PLAY JACK. THE "TITANIC" HAS GONE DOWN, AND WE FLOAT IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC, CLINGING TO OUR LIVES AND OUR LOVE-- ( LAUGHTER ) LET'S GET A LITTLE BIT WET. LET'S GET A LITTLE WET. OKAY, OKAY. WE'RE DROWNING. WE'RE DROWNING.
IT'S FREEZING.
Stephen: IT'S FREEZING COLD. GET IN CHARACTER. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. AND ACT.
I CAN'T FEEL MY BODY.
Stephen: WINNING THAT TICKET, ROSE, WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. IT BROUGHT ME TO YOU, AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT, ROSE. I'M THANKFUL. YOU MUST DO ME THIS HONOR. YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT YOU'LL SURVIVE, THAT YOU WON'T GIVE UP, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, NO MATTER HOW HOPELESS. PROMISE ME NOW, ROSE, AND NEVER LET GO OF THAT PROMISE.
I PROMISE.
Stephen: NEVER, NEVER LET GO.
I'LL NEVER LET GO, JACK. I'LL NEVER LET GO. JACK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) JACK!
Stephen: AND SCENE!
AND SCENE!
Stephen: INCREDIBLE. YOU AND A GENIUS, AND YOU ARE IN "GENIUS," WHICH PREMIERES THIS FRIDAY. JUDE LAW, EVERYONE! YOU WANT TO TAKE US OUT?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH NORMAN REEDUS. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY NEXT GUEST IS DARYL DIXON FROM "THE WALKING DEAD." HIS NEW SHOW IS CALLED "RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NORMAN REEDUS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, MAN.
Stephen: YOU ARE-- WHAT'S THE WORD-- YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL BAD-ASS, IS WHAT ARE YOU. HOW DOES THAT NEIL? DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?
I'M TRYING TO MASTER THE POACHED EGG RIGHT NOW, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW BAD-ASS I AM.
Stephen: TWO AND A HALF MINUTES. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HOW DO YOU LIKE TO POACH IT?
I'M KIND OF CHEATING. I HAVE THE POT WITH THE CIRCLE THINGS AND CUPS, I CHEAT, I'M KIND OF DOING THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR HOBBY? POACHING EGGS?
I HAVEN'T QUITE GOTTEN TO THE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE AND ALL THAT STUFF.
Stephen: PLEASE COME BACK WHEN YOU DO THAT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'RE KNOWN AS-- CAN-- IS IT ACCURATE TO CALL YOU MANLY? YOU'RE MANLY, RIGHT? HE'S A MANLY MAN.  ( APPLAUSE ) I'M MALE. I'M MALE. OKAY? BUT I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS MANLY. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR A GUY LIKE ME ON HOW TO GO FROM MALE TO MANLY?
I MEAN, DUDE, WE'RE BOTH WEARING MAKEUP RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: YEAH, SO NO MAKE-UP, IS THAT THE FIRST THING? OR AM I WEARING THE WRONG MAKEUP?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I JUST TRY TO BE ME AND DO MY THING.
Stephen: I HEARD YOU TRY NOT TO OVERTHINK THINGS TOO MUCH.
YEAH, I LIKE TO BE IN THE HERE AND NOW, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. YEAH, SO --
WHAT'S THE MOST SPONTANEOUS THING YOU EVER DID?
TALKING ABOUT MOTORCYCLES, I TOOK A RIDE FROM GEORGIA TO NASHVILLE, I WAS WATERING MY PLANTS, AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE MOTORCYCLES, AND I HAD AN AIRLINE TICKET --
YOU WERE SUPPOSED THROOG ANYWAY?
YEAH, TO GIVE AN AWARD AT THE COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
AND I SAID SCREW IT, GRABBED A SUIT, PUT IT IN THE BACKPACK, JUMPED ON THE BIKE AND JUST WENT THERE. BUT I TOOK MY PHONE AND DUCT TAPED IT TO MY GAS TANK. SO IT GOT SUPER HOT --
FOR A G.P.S.?
EXACTLY, FOR G.P.S. AND THEN AND THEN THAT TURNED BLACK BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOT OUTSIDE. AND THEN I WROTE DIRECTIONS ON MY ARM WITH A SHARPIE BUT I KEPT GOING THROUGH THUNDERSTORMS AND IT KEPT WASHING OFF THE WHOLE WAY. BUT THE CRAZIEST PART ABOUT THAT TRIP WAS I'D STOP AT A GAS STATION AND THERE WOULD BE ONE GUY THERE LIKE, I CAN GET A SELFIE?" AND WE'D DO THAT. IS AND THEN I'D STOP AT THE NEXT GAS STATION AND THERE WOULD BE 10 GUYS THERE-- CAN I GET A SELFIE." AND THEN I WENT BY A McDONALD AND ON THE MARQUEE WAS, "I LOVE YOU NORMAN."
Stephen: THEY WERE TRACK YOUR PROGRESS UP I-95 OR WHATEVER IT WAS.
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE FORREST GUMP RUNNING ACROSS COUNTRY. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE WALKING DEAD" FOR A SECOND. THIS IS YOU DELIVERING-- I CALL THEY QUALITY KILL RIGHT THERE.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: CAN YOU BE SAID TO BE KILLING A ZOMBIE BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY DEAD?
YEAH, YOU STAB IT IN THE BRAIN AND THEN YOU GET RID OF IT FOREVER.
Stephen: AFTER ALL THESE SEASONS DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, FAVORITE KILLS YOU STILL REMEMBER, FAVORITE WAY YOU'VE TAKEN THEM DOWN?
I KIND OF REMEMBER ALMOST ALL OF THEM.
Stephen: WOW.
THAT ONE-- THAT ONE OUR HEAD D.P., HE WAS LIKE, "I'VE GOT AN IDEA FOR THIS. I WANT YOU TO JUMP OFF THIS ONE AND COME DOWN LIKE MICHAEL JORDAN." AND I WAS LIKE YEAH. AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITES. AND I LIKE THE HASHBACK I SQUISH. HIS HEAD KIND OF WENT LIKE A GRAPE. THAT WAS FUN.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE FANTASIES BEFORE YOU JOINED THE SHOW? ( LAUGHTER )
I HAVE A LOT OF FANTASIES LIKE THAT NOW.
Stephen: WELL, YOU ARE LIVING A FANTASY. YOU'RE DOING "RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS." SELL ME ON MOTORCYCLES, BECAUSE AGAIN, MALE-MANLY. I DO NOT RIDE A MOTORCYCLE. I RODE MINIBIKES WHEN I WAS A KID IN SOUTH CAROLINA, FLIPPED THEM, GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. SELL ME ON BEING ON A MOTORCYCLE. WHAT'S THE JOY?
YOU MEAN YOU FLIPPED THEM LIKE YOU TOOK THEM APART AND RESOLD THEM?
Stephen: NO, I MEAN I DROVE THEM POORLY AND FLIPPED THEM WHILE I WAS ON THEM. YEAH, CONCUSSION COMES TO MIND. THAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR.
OH, RIGHT.
Stephen: SO WHY GET A MOTORCYCLE? I DRIVE A CAR, WHICH IS LIKE TWO MOTORCYCLES WELDED TOGETHER WITH A ROOF. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW? WHEN IT'S HOT, I'VE GOT AIR CONDITIONING. MY PHONE DOESN'T TURN BLACK. I DON'T HAVE TO WRITE STUFF ON MY ARM. SELL ME ON MOTORCYCLE, MAN.
WELL I MEAN, ONE OF THE RIDES THAT WE TOOK ON THE SHOW, IT WAS ME AND PETER FONDA FROM THE TOP OF FLORIDA TO THE BOTTOM OF FLORIDA. HE USED TO LIVE IN KEY WEST. AND WE WOULD-- WE'D HAVE THESE-- WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM --
HEADSETS?
YEAH, HEADSETS IN OUR HELMETS. AND HE'D BE LIKE,"LOOK AT ALL THESE PIECES AROUND US, THEY'RE TRAPPED IN CAGES, MAN" VERY "EASY RIDER."
Stephen: HE TALKS LIKE THAT?
YEAH, HE'S THE BEST. A SENSE OF FREEDOM. YOU SMELL A TOWN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH IT. YOU FEEL A TOWN WHEN YOU GO THROUGH IT. YOU'RE WIDE WEAK WITH EVERYTHING AROUND YOU. I THINK MOTORCYCLE RIDERS ARE THE SAFEST PEOPLE ON THE ROAD TO BE HONEST.
Stephen: THEY HAVE TO BE. THEY'RE VULNERABLE. AND WE HAVE A CLIP OF THE SHOW RIGHT HERE. JIM.
Stephen: YEAH, THE SAFEST PEOPLE AROUND. ( APPLAUSE )
YOU-- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT'S ROLAND SANDS. HE'S A WHOLE OTHER ANIMAL. HE'S AN AWARD-WINNING FLAT TRACK RACER AND BIKE BUILDER AND HIS FATHER WAS, TOO. HE'S SUPER-- HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL.
