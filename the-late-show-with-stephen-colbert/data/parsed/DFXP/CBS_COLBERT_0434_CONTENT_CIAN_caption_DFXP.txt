THE F.B.I. SAYS PAUL MANAFORT SPENT NEARLY $2 MILLION ON RUGS.
$1 MILLION AT A VIRGINIA DRUGSTORE.
WHAT, ALMOST $1 MILLION ON RUGS.
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT ON ANTIQUE RUGS!
AND NOW A "LATE SHOW" PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.
RUGS:  ALSO KNOWN BY THEIR STREET NAMES-- DEEP PILE, SHAG, INDOOR/OUTDOOR. EVERY YEAR, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS GET HOOKED ON RUGS, THANKS TO RUG DEALERS HANDING OUT FREE CARPET REMNANTS. THE FIRST ONE'S ALWAYS FREE.
IT STARTED WITH WELCOME MATS, BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, I WAS DOING HALLWAY RUNNERS.  ( LAUGHTER )
IT GOT TO THE POINT THAT I WAS HIDING RUGS UNDER MY RUG.  (  LAUGHTER  ) YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T BEAT MY RUGS. MY RUGS BEAT ME.  ( LAUGHTER ).
RUG USERS ALWAYS HAVE AN EXCUSE-- IT WARMS UP THE ROOM. IT GOES WITH MY FURNITURE. MY FEET ARE COLD ON THE HARDWOOD FLOORS, LIKE THIS DEGENERATE.
SURE, A GOOD TIME HAVE, A FEW FRIENDS OVER AND WE'D ROLL UP A FAT ONE, BUT BEFORE I KNEW IT, IT WAS WALL-TO-WALL. I PUT IT IN MY KIDS' ROOM. I LOST EVERYTHING. THAT'S THE POINT I COULDN'T EVEN FOORLD HEROIN ANYMORE. I LOVE HEROIN!  (  LAUGHTER  ).
THIS IS YOUR BRAIN. THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON RUGS. THAT'S NEVER COMING OUT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ANYONE GOT ANY SODA WATERS?
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TRUMP'S TWEET-SPLOSSION. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES: NICOLE KIDMAN. AND JONATHAN GROFF. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT'S UP?
Stephen: RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE! HEY, EVERYBODY! THANKS VERY MUCH. ING WITH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. I AM SO PROUD TO BE COMING TO YOU FROM NEW YORK CITY, WHICH YESTERDAY SAW A COWARDLY TERRORIST ATTACK. NEW YORKERS DON'T NOT TERRIFY EASY. NEW YORKERS GOT BACK TO WHAT THEY DO BEST: DRESS UP LIKE BUZZ LIGHTYEAR AND GET BLACKOUT DRUNK ON A TUESDAY, BECAUSE WE THE HALLOWEEN PARADE MARCHED ON. THE STREETS WERE FILLED WITH SINGING, DANCING, AND VOMIT! YOU CANNOT STOP NEW YORKERS?
WE STILL PUT ON OUR SEXY BUMBLEBEE COSTUMES, AND HOOKED UP WITH A GUY WHO WAS EITHER CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG OR SMOKEY THE BEAR. IT WAS PRETTY DARK IN THAT PORTA POTTY. THE POINT IS WE GO ON. LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT THE ATTACK. LAST NIGHT HE SHARED HIS THOUGHTS AND CONDOLENCES. THIS MORNING IT WAS TIME FOR POLITICS: "THE TERRORIST CAME INTO OUR COUNTRY THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED THE 'DIVERSITY VISA LOTTERY PROGRAM,' A CHUCK SCHUMER BEAUTY. I WANT MERIT BASED." WE ALL WANT MERIT BASED, SIR, BUT YOU'RE STILL THE PRESIDENT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "I-- I-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT JOKE AT ALL. I DON'T GET IT." THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE RESPONSES TO AN ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL SINCE PAUL REVERE'S FAMOUS CRY, "THE BRITISH ARE COMING, THE BRITISH ARE COMING, A JOHN HANCOCK BEAUTY." DONALD TRUMP ALSO TOOK SOME TIME TO TWEET ABOUT HIS PROPOSED TAX CUT: "THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS ARE WORKING HARD-- AND LATE-- TOWARD THE MASSIVE TAX CUTS THAT THEY KNOW YOU DESERVE. THESE WILL BE BIGGEST EVER!" "HARD," "LATE," "BIGGEST EVER"-- OH, HE KNOWS SEX SELLS, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY BUDGET DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY CAME TO WORK TODAY DRESSED LIKE THIS:  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Jon: WHOA! WHOA!
Stephen: HE LOOKS GOOD. SUPER CUT.
Jon: HE'S GREASED UP.
Stephen: HE'S WAXED AND OILED. YOU HAVE TO, IT'S GOOD FOR THE LEATHER. OILY TORSO IS GOOD FOR THE TORSO. YOU RUB IT ON A PIECE OF LEATHER. THAT'S WHY MY COUCH IS SO NICE. FANTASTIC, SLIDES RIGHT OFF. BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE FINALIZING THE BILL. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT TODAY, BUT THEY DELAYED IT TILL TOMORROW. AND NOW WE KNOW WHY-- BECAUSE TRUMP AND LEADERS CAN'T AGREE ON A NAME FOR THE BILL. APPARENTLY, CALLING IT "THE KOCH BROTHERS ALL-AMERICAN, UP-TRICKLIN', CASH-GRAB-A-RAMA" WAS A LITTLE ON THE NOSE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S WHAT IT IS!
Stephen: WHEN THE WHOLE PROCESS STARTED, HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN KICKED THE NAMING OVER TO TRUMP BECAUSE OF HIS PENCHANT TOWARDS BRANDING. YES, HE'S A BRANDING GENIUS. WHERE DOES HE COME UP WITH THESE INVENTIVE NAMES: "TRUMP TOWER," "TRUMP STEAKS," "TRUMP UNIVERSITY," "DONALD TRUMP JR."? HE'S A POETET. HE'S A WEAVER OF DREAMS. SO WHAT DID TRUMP COME BACK WITH? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU THE ACTUAL NAME OUR PRESIDENT PROPOSED FOR HIS TAX BILL: "THE CUT CUT CUT ACT."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT NAME TRULY SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN RESPONSE, PAUL RYAN, NOT BEING INSANE, PUSHED BACK ON THE NAMING OF THE BILL. HOWEVER, TRUMP HAS HELD FIRM AND HAS BEEN INSISTENT THAT THE BILL BE CALLED, ONE MORE TIME, "THE CUT CUT CUT ACT." ALTHOUGH, RYAN DID MANAGE TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT NOT TO SPELL "CUT CUT CUT" WITH THREE Ks.  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, WE-- THANK YOU. VERY NICE. IT'S JUST--
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT THOSE "K"s. I AIN'T MESSING WITH THE "KING"
Stephen: WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE FINAL NAME, BUT IF TRUMP DOESN'T GET HIS WAY THIS TIME, HE'LL INSIST USING HIS CHOICE FOR THE NEXT DEFENSE SPENDING BILL: "THE BOOM BAM CHUCK NORRIS KARATE CHOP HIYAAA! BILL OF 2017." YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THERE'S A SIMPLE RULE IN POLLICES. WE TRY TO LIVE BY IT. EVERYBODY IN WASHINGTON LIVES BY IT. YOU DON'T BRING THE LITTLE KIDS INTO IT. THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T UNLEASHED ALL OF MY SAVAGE BURNS ON ROBERT TODD LINCOLN. BUT, YOU KNOW-- TOO SOON? YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT RULES IN POLITICS? THE TRUMP FAMILY-- SPECIFICALLY, TRUMP'S ELDEST SON AND CLONE OF DON DRAPER WITH THE GAPS FILLED IN BY FROG D.N.A., DONALD TRUMP JR. LAST NIGHT, DON JR. TWEETED A PICTURE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER HOLDING HER CANDY BUCKET AND SAID, "I'M GOING TO TAKE HALF OF HER CANDY TONIGHT AND GIVE IT TO SOME KID WHO SAT AT HOME. IT'S NEVER TO EARLY TO TEACH HER ABOUT SOCIALISM." YES, IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO TEACH KIDS THE DANGERS OF SHARING.  (  LAUGHTER  ) ALSO, IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO LEARN THE PROPER SPELLING OF "TOO."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: BUT THE OTHER "O" ON THERE."
Stephen: I BET THAT OTHER "O" WENT TO A POOR PERSON. BUT WHILE WE'RE AT IT, DON JR, ON HALLOWEEN, KIDS GO TO DOOR TO DOOR TO GET FREE CANDY FROM THE NEIGHBORS, BECAUSE THE KIDS DON'T HAVE IT, AND THE NEIGHBORS DO. THAT'S SOCIALISM. ALSO, "GIVE IT TO SOME KID WHO SAT AT HOME"? YOU KNOW HALLOWEEN IS FUN, RIGHT? NO CHILD IN THE HISTORY OF CHILDING HAS VOLUNTARILY MISSED HALLOWEEN. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT KID WHO DIDN'T GO OUT. WHY? IS HE OKAY? IS THAT CHILD CARING FOR A SICK PARENT? YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A NICE THING TO DO? GIVE HIM HALF YOUR HALLOWEEN CANDY.  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT DON JR. IS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING: THERE'S PLENTY OF ECONOMIC THEORY THAT YOU CAN TEACH USING SWEETS. FOR INSTANCE, YOU, JUNIOR, WERE BORN WITH MANY "HUNDRED GRANDS" ON "FIFTH AVENUE." ALL MOST PEOPLE GET FROM THEIR PARENTS IS KISSES. NOW AMERICANS FIND THEMSELVES BE "TWIXT" TWO CHOICES, BOTH OF WHICH BLOW.  ( LAUGHTER ) WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION OR EMPOWER A NUTRAGEOUS DEMAGOGUE BY HANDING HIM THE WARHEADS. THE TOP 1% "TOBLER-OWN" 99% OF THE WEALTH, WHEN THERE SHOULD BE "GOOD N PLENTY" OF MONEY FOR EVERYONE. IT WAS THIS WAY ON THAT SIDE. WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE UNIVERSAL "HEATH" CARE, WHICH WOULD BE A "LIFESAVER" FOR WORKING PEOPLE. SOCIALIST IDEAS OUTLINED BY THE AUTHORS OF "DOTS" KAPITAL, KARL "MARS," AND FREDERICK "SKITTLES." OR AS YOU "DUM DUMS" LIKE YOU CALL THEM, "NERDS."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW-- I KNOW! I KNOW WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF "SNICKERS" AT YOUR EXPENSE, BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE: YOU'RE A TOTAL "DOUCHE."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. NICOLE KIDMAN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I PONDER BIG QUESTIONS WITH AN EVEN BIGGER STARS.
Stephen: HEY! JON BASTEEFT AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! RIGHT THERE! OH, JON, JON. JON YOU KNOW THIS. I'M A PRETTY DEEP GUY.
Jon: DEEP CAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU. THANK YOU DADDY-O. CAN YOU DIG IT?
Jon: YES.
Stephen: I KNEW YOU COULD. WHICH IS WHY SOMETIMES I'LL PONDER LIFE'S BIG QUESTIONS, LIKE: "WHY AM I HERE?" AND "WHERE AM I, AGAIN?" SOMETIMES I NEED TO EXPRESS THESE THOUGHTS, THOUGHTS THAT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY LYING ON A BEAUTIFUL HILLSIDE AT NIGHT, WHILE LYING NEXT TO A DEEP "A-"LIST CELEBRITY. IT'S TIME FOR: "BIG QUESTIONS WITH EVEN BIGGER STARS!"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW, THE STARS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SHHH! THEY SURE ARE.
Stephen: HEY, NICOLE KIDMAN?
HEY, STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: DON'T YOU JUST LOVE
AHHHH, YEAH STUDIO AIR.
Stephen: HEY, NICOLE?
YEAH, STEPHEN?
Stephen: DO YOU THINK GOD COULD MAKE A ROCK SO HEAVY, HE HIMSELF COULDN'T LIFT IT?
I DON'T KNOW. BUT WHY IS HE MAKING MORE ROCKS? WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROCKS. WAHT WE COULD USE IS ANOTHER OPRAH.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, NIC?
YEAH, STEVE?
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU GET IF YOU COMBINED "BIG LITTLE LIES" AND "PRETTY LITTLE LIARS"?
"PRETTY LITTLE BIGGIES."
Stephen: I'D WATCH THAT. I'D WATCH THAT.
HEY, STEVIE?
Stephen: YEAH, NIKKI?  (  LAUGHTER  )
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG BANG?
Stephen: OH, I THINK FEWER PEOPLE WATCHED CBS.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
YEAH! GORGEOUS.
Stephen: HEY, N.K.?
YEAH, S.C.?
Stephen: DO YOU THINK ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL EVER CONQUER HUMANITY?
I ASKED MY ALEXA THAT, AND SHE JUST LAUGHED.  (  LAUGHTER  ) STEVARINO?
Stephen: NICKELODEON?  (  LAUGHTER  )
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT DIFFERENTIATES US FROM ANIMALS?
Stephen: OH, OUR COMPLEX EMOTIONS, OUR LOVE OF ART, OUR IMMORTAL SOULS. ALSO, WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LICK OUR GROINS IN PUBLIC.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN PUBLIC.
YEAH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) HOW WOULD DO YOU THAT?
Stephen: HEY, HEY, HEY.
YES.
Stephen: ACADEMY AWARD WINNER NICOLE KIDMAN?
YES, ACADEMY AWARD VIEWER STEPHEN COLBERT?  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHY DO THEY CALL AUSTRALIA "DOWN UNDER"?
NOT SURE. BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF STUPID THING PEOPLE SAY "UP OVER."  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: HEY NIC-AT-NIGHT?
YES, STEVE-IN-THE-EVENIN'?
Stephen: WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT'S BAD?
ROTTEN TOMATOES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHICH REMINDS ME, STEE?
Stephen: NEE?
IF YOU WIN AN OSCAR BUT ACCIDENTALLY LEAVE THE STATUE IN AN ARBY'S BATHROOM, YOU STILL WON IT, RIGHT?  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: I THINK SO.
I'M JUST ASKING FOR A FRIEND. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IS IT REESE WITHERSPOON?
YES, YES.
Stephen: HEY, NICOLE, IF YOU COULD BE ANY SUPERHERO, WHO WOULD YOU BE? BATMAN? SUPERMAN?
I'D BE KID-MAN.
WHAT ARE KID MAN'S POWERS?
THE MIND OF A CHILD AND THE BODY OF AN ADULT.
Stephen: WOW, YOU COULD BE PRESIDENT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, STEE-BEAR?
Stephen: YEAH, COLE-KID?
WE'RE BOTH CATHOLIC.
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
IF GOD IS IN CHARGE OF THE UNIVERSE, WHAT'S JESUS'S JOB?
Stephen: THAT'S EASY. JESUS IS LIKE VICE GOD. HE SUPPORTS EVERYTHING GOD SAYS AND WALKS OUT OF FOOTBALL GAMES.  (  LAUGHTER  ) HEY, HEY, WHY DO YOU THINK GOD HAS A LONG WHITE BEARD?
SO SHE WON'T GET HARASSED ON THE SUBWAY.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICOLE KIDMAN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE OF HER, NICOLE KIDMAN!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST IS AN OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR AND PRODUCER WHO JUST WON TWO EMMYS FOR "BIG LITTLE LIES." PLEASE WELCOME, NICOLE KIDMAN! HELLO! NICE TO SEE YOU. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE ) BOTH CHEEKS!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WOW!
Stephen: HEY!
THANK YOU, YEAH.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, TOO, BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT REMEMBER THIS, BUT WE COSTARRED IN A MOVIE TOGETHER ONCE. DO YOU-- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? YOU DON'TUE DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU ARE.  (  LAUGHTER  )
I ACTUALLY DID FORGET. BUT --
Stephen: THE MOVIE WAS "BEWITCHED."
YES, YES.
Stephen: OKAY. AND YOU PLAYED SAM, THE WITCH.
YES.
Stephen: AND I PLAYED ONE OF THE WRITERS OF THE SHOW, "BEWITCHED." AND HERE IS OUR-- THIS IS OUR LOVE SCENE RIGHT HERE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) THERE'S SOME REAL CHEMISTRY THERE. THERE'S SOME ELECTRICITY IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH. YOU REMEMBER THAT? YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT SCENE?
I HAVE THE WORST MEMORY, SO I'LL JUST--  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: I THINK YOU PROBABLY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD MEMORY.
VAGUELY.
Stephen: IN THIS SCENE, I CAME OVER AND SAID, "THEY'RE READY FOR YOU ON SET." THAT WAS IT. THAT WAS OUR BIG SCENE TOGETHER.
YEAH. I VAGUELY REMEMBER THAT. I HAVE, LIKE, A DISTANT, KIND OF... BUT ANYWAY.  ( LAUGHTER ) ALL GOOD.
Stephen: I HAVE THAT EFFECT ON A LOT OF WOMEN. "I HAVE A VAGUE, MURKY..."
NO, NO.
Stephen:... "KIND OF SAD MEMORY OF YOU IN GENERAL." YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON I EVER-- A TRUE MOVIE STAR THEY EVER SAW WORK ON CAMERA. BECAUSE I REMEMBER THE FIRST SCENE I GOT TO SEE YOU SHOOT WITH WILL, I THINK, IS WHEN YOU GUYS ARE RUNNING A SCENE IN CHARACTER AS DARIN AND SAM.
RIGHT WILL FARRELL.
Stephen: SORRY, WILL FARRELL. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY WIL. COULD HAVE BEEN WILL FARRELL.
WILL SMITH.
Stephen: WILL SMITH, THAT'S TRUE. WHAT OTHER WILLS?
Stephen: WILLS? THERE ARE NO OTHER WILLS. AND I REMEMBER WHEN YOU TURNED TO HIM IN THE SCENE AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO TBAWL FALLIN LOVE WITH YOU, AND YOU TURNED ON SOME LIGHT IN YOUR BODY, AND-- AND EVERYONE ON SET FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU AT THAT MOMENT.
NO!
Stephen: NO, I'M NOT JOKING. AS SOON AS THE SCENE WAS OVER, WILL CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID, "DID YOU JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENED?
STOP!
Stephen: TRUE STAR POWER.
YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP.  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I PROMISE YOU, I'M NOT. I PROMISE YOU I'M NOT.
I WISH THAT WAS TRUE. BUT, ANYWAY... WHAT'S NEXT?  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SO ARE YOU-- ARE YOU THE ONE-- ARE YOU THE ONE ACTOR ON THE PLANET WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO BE COMPLIMENTED? BECAUSE I LOVE IT.
I'M AUSTRALIAN. WE DON'T DO WELL WITH COMPLIMENT.
Stephen: DO YOU NOT?
NO, YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT OUR CULTURE?
Stephen: THAT IS ALMOST ENGLISH OF YOU TO NOT THINK WELL OF YOURSELVES.
WELL A LOT OF US HAVE ORIGINATED FROM ENGLAND OR IRELAND.
Stephen: IERL, TOO. YOU'RE A CATHOLIC AND I'M A CATHOLIC.
THAT'S VERY GOOD LATIN.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I STUDIED LATIN AT SCHOOL.
Stephen: SO DID I?
DID YOU? GOSH, WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.
Stephen: DID YOU DO CAESAR'S GARLIC WARS? I THINK SO. I WASN'T VERY GOOD.
Stephen: I WAS TERRIBLE. BUT I LIKE TO PRETEND I WAS GOOD AT MOMENTS LIKE THIS.
THE CONJUNCTIONS.
Stephen: THE CONJUNCTIONS ARE TERRIBLE, TORTURE! ABSOLUTELY CHILD ABUSE.
OH, MY GOSH! THAT'S SO GOOD. THAT'S LOVE IN LATIN.
Stephen: THAT IS LOVE IN LATIN. THAT'S AS LOVING AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY BE.
BUT IT HELPS YOU WITH YOUR ITALIAN AND SPANISH, RIGHT?
Stephen: DO YOU SPEAK ITALIAN AND SPANISH.
POCO.O. ( SPEAKING ITALIAN."
SHOW OFF!
Stephen: I KNOW. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE TWO EMMYS.
GRATSY.
Stephen: BOOM! A TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCE ON A WONDERFUL SHOW. DEEPLY AFFECTING. AND AN IMPORTANT STORY TO BE TELLING RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT SO MANY WOMEN COMING FORWARD TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN STORIES OF ABUSE, AND CERTAINLY YOUR CHARACTER SUFFERED, YOU KNOW, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: YOUR COSTAR REESE WITHERSPOON SAID YOU HOPE THIS BRINGS WOMEN TO THE FRONT OF THEIR OWN STORIES. HOW DO YOU THINK HOLLYWOOD CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT?
WELL, I MEAN, FOR US, THIS WAS-- YOU KNOW, THIS WAS A SITUATION WHERE WE WERE FRUSTRATED, BOTH REESE AND I, AT THE THINGS WE WERE BEING OFFERED. SO WE WERE ABLE TO GO-- THERE'S THIS GREAT BOOK AND WE SHOULD OPTION IT AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET IT MADE AND CREATE SOME GOOD ROLES FOR OURSELVES AND OUR FRIENDS. AND SUDDENLY THE WHOLE THING SNOWBALLED AND WITHIN A YEAR WE WERE IN PRODUCTION ON THIS FEMALE-DRIVEN DRAMA THAT TOOK OFF. AND IT WAS SO EMBRACED BY THE AUDIENCE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: TRULY AMAZING STORY.
BUT IT'S A GREAT STORY TO TELL, AND PARTICULARLY FOR OTHER WOMEN BECAUSE YOU GO, "OKAY, WELL, WE CAN KIND OF-- OUR POWER TOGETHER IS STRONG" YOU KNOW. WE BOTH TRIED INDIVIDUALLY-- REESE FAR MORE SUCCESSFULLY THAN ME. AND SHE HAD DONE "WILD" WITH THE DIRECTOR WE WENT WITH ON "BIG LITTLE LIES." BUT TO JOIN OUR SOURCES TOGETHER WAS REALLY, REALLY FUN AND GAVE US FAR MORE OPPORTUNITY. AND THAT'S A GREAT THING TO BE TELLING, PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGER GENERATION AS WELL. YOU CAN DO IT!  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, IS THERE-- IS THERE-- IS THERE GOING TO BE A SECOND SEASON? BECAUSE THERE'S A RUMOR THERE'S GOING TO BE A SECOND SEASON?
I MEAN, WE WANT TO. WE'RE INCHING OUR WAY FORWARD BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO BE GOOD, BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY-- I MEAN, IT'S-- IT'S NOW MOVING FAR MORE RAPIDLY THAN WE-- THAN, LIKE, SIX MONTHS AGO. AND WE'RE ALL-- WE'RE ACTUALLY-- PART OF IT IS WE WANT TO EXPLORE THESE WOMEN AND THEIR STORIES FURTHER. BUT ALSO WE WANT TO GIVE MORE ROLES TO OTHER-- OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SERIES, AND PARTICULARLY--  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. SO WE'RE, LIKE, LET'S GO FOR IT.
Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU WON AN OSCAR FOR "THE HOURS." AND YOU WON TWO EMMYS FOR THIS.
I WAS SO GLAD TO WIN THE TWO EMMYS.
Stephen: REALLY?
BECAUSE I HAVE THE DAUGHTERS, AND TO TAKE HOME ONE AND GO, "YOU'VE GOT TO SPLIT THIS." IT WAS AMAZING TO TAKE HOME TWO AND GO, "YOU GET ONE EACH."
Stephen: RIGHT. AND YOU CAN FIGHT WITH THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE-- THEY'VE GOT THOSE WINGS. WHICH WAS SWEETER, WINNING THE OSCAR OR WINNING THE EMMYS, OR IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT FEELING?
I TO SAY, WHEN I WON MY OSCAR, I WAS PROBABLY NO-- I WAS NOT IN A GREAT PLACE IN MY LIFE. I DIDN'T HAVE A PARTNER TO SHARE IT WITH. I WAS SORT OF-- I WAS FLAILING EMOTIONALLY AND PERSONALLY, SO TO WIN AN EMY AND BE IN LOVE AND HAVE MY FAMILY AND-- OH!  ( APPLAUSE ) BUT IT MAKES-- IT'S AMAZING! BECAUSE KEITH AND I WERE ABLE TO GO HOME, AND I ALWAYS SAID WHEN I WON MY OSCAR, I WENT HOME AND I WAS ALONE. AND I SORT OF ORDERED SOME ROOM SERVICE, AND THAT WAS IT-- WHICH I KNOW IS LIKE "OH!" BUT THERE'S SOMETHING INCREDIBLE ABOUT GOING HOME AND GOING, "BABY! WE DID IT!"  ( APPLAUSE ) AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
Stephen: YOUR LOVED ONE IS KEITH URBAN, COUNTRY MUSIC STAR. AND YOU GUYS LIVE IN NASHVILLE TOGETHER, I UNDERSTAND.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND DO YOU LIKE BARBECUE AND BEER AND (BLEEP) KICKING? WHAT DO YOU DO IN NASHVILLE?
I LIKE BARBECUE, AND I LOVE THE PREDATORS. I GO AND JUMP UP AND DOWN. I LOVE ICE HOCKEY.
Stephen: YEAH.
AND SO OUR TEAM WAS SO GREAT LAST YEAR. SO... WE'RE HOPING FOR MORE THIS YEAR.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU ALSO--
I JUMP UP AND DOWN AND EAT HOT DOGS AND, YOU KNOW. I DON'T DRINK BEER.
Stephen: YOU DON'T DRINK BEER?
NO.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE FROM AUSTRALIA DON'T YOU LEGALLY HAVE TO DRINK BEER?
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I DON'T DRINK BEER. WE GREW UP DRINKING SHANDIES. DO YOU KNOW WHAT A SHANDY IS?
Stephen: WHAT'S A SHANDY?
IT'S LEMONADE AND BEER. AND IT'S WHAT I WOULD BE GIVEN AS A KID.
Stephen: IN AMERICA WE CALL THAT BUD LIGHT LIME, IT'S TRADITIONAL. WE GIVE IT TO OUR CHILDREN, HERE, TOO. LEGALLY I CAN'T SAY THAT.
NO, I NEVER HAD A SHANDY WHEN I WAS UNDER 21.
Stephen: NO, I UNDERSTAND IT'S DRINKING AGE CAN'T BE 21 IN AUSTRALIA AUSTRALIA.
IT'S 18. I STILL HAD IT UNDER 18.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW DPIM CALLED "THE KILLING OF A SCARED DEER." THIS IS BY YORGOS LANTHIMOS. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY HIS NAME. HE'S THE GUY WHO DID--
HE'S GREEK.
Stephen: "THE LOBSTER. OF THE.
YES.
Stephen: A HILARIOUS MOVIE, VERY DARK BUT VERY FUNNY
AND HE DID ANOTHER FILM, WHICH IS FAR MORE OBSCURE "DOG TOOTH."
Stephen: WHAT IS "THE KILLING OF A SCARED DEER" ABOUT?
WELL, IT AIN'T "BAMBI. OF THE IT'S-- GOSH, IT'S ABOUT-- IT'S ABOUT MANY THINGS. I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT. BUT I'M IN IT.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S VERY --
Stephen: YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT AND YOU'RE IN IT. WE HAVE A GREAT SCENE HERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: OF YOU WITH COLIN FARRELL WHO IS ALSO IN "THE LOBSTER." YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS SCENE? YOU'RE BOTH IN THE KITCHEN TOGETHER.
YUP.
Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW?
NO, I WOULD WATCH THE SCENE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WE WILL DISCOVER IT TOGETHER. JIM.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN CRAVING? MASHED POTATO. WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SOME TOMORROW?
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HANDS. I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE. EVERYONE'S BEEN TELLING ME LATELY WHAT BEAUTIFUL HANDS YOU HAVE, AND NOW I CAN SEE FOR MYSELF-- NICE AND CLEAN. BUT SO WHAT IF THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL? THEY'RE LIFELESS. SOMETIMES, STEPHEN, UNIFORM JUST AN INCOMPETENT MAN WHO GOES ON AND ON SAYING STUPID THINGS LIKE, "LET'S DO A SCAN. LET'S DO AN ULTRASOUND. LET'S WEAR BROWN SOCKS. LET'S MAKE MASHED POTATOES. LET'S GO TO THE BEACH HOUSE."
EXCUSE ME.
OUR TWO CHILDREN ARE DYING IN THE OTHER ROOM, BUT, YES, I CAN MAKE YOU MASHED POTATOES TOMORROW.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOT HAPPY. NOT HAPPY.
NO!
Stephen: HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET BACK TO AUSTRALIA, BY THE WAY?
ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES A YEAR. I MEAN --
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN. WHERE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND I GO?
OH, THERE ARE SO MANY BEAUTIFUL PLACE S.
Stephen:  IT'S A BIG PLACE, I REALIZE.
SYDNEY SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST PLACE.
Stephen: IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE FROM?
YES. BONDI BEACH.
Stephen: "THE KILLING OF A SCARED DEER" IS OUT FRIDAY. NICOLE KIDMAN, EVERYBODY WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JONATHAN GROFF. STICK AROUND.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS A GRAMMY-WINNING ACTOR YOU KNOW FROM "HAMILTON," "GLEE," AND "FROZEN." HE NOW STARS IN NETFLIX'S "MINDHUNTER." PLEASE WELCOME JONATHAN GROFF!  ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
SO NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE IT WAS A DIFFERENT WORLD. IT WAS DECEMBER OF 2015.
CORRECT.
Stephen: GETTING ON TWO YEARS LATER. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN GOOD.
Stephen: YOU LEFT "HAMILTON" SINCE THEN. YOU WERE FAMOUSLY KING GEORGE III IN "HAMILTON." HUGE KING GEORGE FANS TONIGHT.
HUGE KING GEORGE FANS.
Stephen: DO YOU MISS IT? NOW YOU'RE DOING THIS GREAT TV SHOW "MINDHUNTER" THAT EVERYBODY SAYS IS SO GREAT ON NETFLIX. BUT AFTER YOU FINISH SHOOTING, IT'S NOT LIKE "HAMILTON," AND YOU DON'T GO BACK TO YOUR DRESSING ROOM AND BEYONCE IS WAITING THERE. IT WAS, RIGHT? I TALKED TO THE CAST MEMBERS THEY'D BE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, BARACK OBAMA IS IN MY DRESSING ROOM." DO YOU MISS THAT?
IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IN "HAMILTON," WE WOULD HAVE ALL THESE FAMOUS PEOPLE COMING BACK AFTER THE SHOW. AND EVEN AS KING GEORGE, I WAS ONLY ON STAGE FOR NINE MINUTES.
Stephen: NINE GOOD MINUTES.
NINE GOOD MINUTES, BUT IT WAS A VERY SOCIAL EXPERIENCE PER ME. THE CAST WOULD COME IN, WE WOULD HANG --
Stephen: YOU GOT TO HANG BACKSTAGE. WHILE THEY'RE ALL RAPPING YOUR HEARTS OUT--
I'M THE WHITE DUDE, JUST CHILLING IN THE BACKGROUND.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN-- AND THEN "MINDHUNTER" WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. I WAS LIVING IN PITTSBURGH, AND WE HAD GREAT, LONG HOURS OF SHOOTING, AND THEN I WOULD JUST KIND OF COME HOME AND EAT A PIECE OF GRILLED CHICKEN, LEARN MY LINES AND GO TO SLEEP. SO IT WAS TOTALLY OPPOSITE BUT I REALLY ENJOYED IT.
Stephen: THAT'S A GLAMOROUS HOLLYWOOD LIFE. GRILLED CHICKEN AND GO BACK TO SLEEP.
IT WAS GREAT TO GO FROM SUCH A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF WORK-- NINE MINUTES TO THE EXTENT THAT WAS "MINDHUNTER."
Stephen: LET ME ASK ONE MORE QUESTION ABOUT "HAMILTON." DID YOU EVER GO BACKSTAGE AND SAY, "I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH A FAMOUS PERSON RIGHT NOW. WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY? "I'M GLAD YOU LIKED THE SHOW?" WAS IT EVER AWKWARD.
NO.
Stephen: YOU LIKED IT WHEN PEOPLE VISITED YOU BACKSTAGE?
YEAH, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR, ESPECIALLY FAMOUS PEOPLE AND ARTISTS AND POLITICIANS AND ALL THESE PEOPLE YOU ADMIRED COMING BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: WHO IS THE LEAST LIKELY PERSON WHO CAME AND SAID I HAD?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LEAST LIKELY?"
Stephen: SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T BE COMING BACKSTAGE AT A BROADWAY SHOW.
GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW., LIKE STEPHEN HAWKING. I JUST DON'T SEE HIM COMING BACKSTAGE TO LIKE, YOU KNOW, SAY, "YOU WERE FANTASTIC. I'M SUCH A FAN BOY." SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAYBE THERE WERE NONE. MAYBE IT WAS ALL THAT MAIX SENSE TO ME.
ALL OF THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES CAME.
Stephen: ALL THE ONCE.
THEY SAT IN THE FRONT ROW. THEY ACTUALLY WON THE LOTTERY.
Stephen: THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS INTERESTING, IS "HAMILTON" WAS SUCH AN MEMORY EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE, SO THE THING THAT WAS COMPLICATED AT THE END WAS YOU HAD TO HANDLE PEOPLE COMING BACK JUST SOBBING. YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE-- AND YOU WERE SORT OF CONTAINING, SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE JOB OF POSTSHOW WAS CONTAINING PEOPLE'S EMOTION S.
Stephen:  THERE WAS THE SOBBING AND PEOPLE COMING IN SAYING, "WHY AM I CRYING ALEXANDER HAMILTON." I WAS COMPLETELY MOVED. I DID NOT EXPECT TO GET HERE FROM THE GUY ON THE 10?
YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH. NOW YOU'RE DOING "MINDHUNTER." YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHAT "MINDHUNTER" IS.
YEAH, SURE.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU HUNTING WITH YOUR MIND?  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN THE SHOW.
OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. IT'S BASED ON A BOOK BY JOHN DOUGLAS CALLED "MY. IT'S DAVID FINCHER'S NEW NETFLIX SERIES. THE BIRTH OF ROFILING IN THE 70.
WHAT KIND OF PERSON IS THIS, AND BY DOING THIS FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY ON THIS PERSON, KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE AND CATCH THEM THAT WAY.
EXACTLY. MY CHARACTER HOLDEN IS INSPIRED BY JOHN DOUGLAS WHO HAD THIS IDEA IN THE LATE 70s TO GO INTO THESE JAIL CELLS AND INTERVIEW THESE INCARCERATED CRIMINALS TO SEE IF THEY CAN GLEAN INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND THEIR THOUGHTS AND THEIR FEELINGS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THEIR MURDERS TO HELP PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING. IT WAS KIND OF THE BIRTH OF THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE UNIT AND CRIMINAL PROFILING AS WE KNOW IT.
Stephen: THE THING IS THAT IT'S-- THE SHOW IS GREAT. IT'S A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK OF YOU AS A BROADWAY MUSICAL STAR AND NOT AS A DRAMATIC ACTOR. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF TRYING TO BRING THOSE TWO WORLDS TOGETHER, MAYBE DRAMATIC ACTING AND BROADWAY MUSIC AT THE SAME TIME?
YEAH, IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE DAVID FINCHER, WHO IS OUR GENIUS, THE SHOW RUNNER OF OUR SHOW AND OUR DIRECTOR, HE'S FAMOUS MOSTLY FOR BEING A FILM DIRECTOR. AND THEN HE REVOLUTIONIZED ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH TELEVISION WITH NETFLIX, THROUGH "HOUSE OF CARDS" AND NOW "MINDHUNTER." AND HE AND I BECAME REALLY CLOSE ON THE SET IN PITTSBURGH DOING "MINDHUNTER." AND HE ACTUALLY TALKED A LOT ABOUT HIS DESIRE TO BREAK INTO THEATER AND TO MUSICAL THEATER. AND SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN COLLABORATING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS ON DEVELOPING "MINDHUNTER" INTO A MUSICAL FOR BROADWAY.
Stephen: WOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU IN THE PROCESS? IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD HEAR SOME OF THAT?
WELL, IT'S EARLY WORKSTOP STAGES. BUT, ACTUALLY, JON HAS BEEN THERE WITH US. HE'S HELPING US DEVELOP THE MUSIC. SO I DON'T KNOW, WE COULD DO THE --
Stephen: I KNOW WHAT THIS IS. YOU GUYS WORKED THIS OUT THIS AFTERNOON.
YEAH.
