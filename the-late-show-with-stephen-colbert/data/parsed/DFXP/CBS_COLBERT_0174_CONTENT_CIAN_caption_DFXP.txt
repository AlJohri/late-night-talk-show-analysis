Stephen: OH, HI. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT FROM THE SHOW YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW. AT THE TOP OF LAST NIGHT'S SHOW, I WISHED THE CHICAGO CUBS GOOD LUCK ON THEIR HISTORY-MAKING SEASON BY RUBBING VARIOUS LUCKY ITEMS, INCLUDING THREE OF THE CHICAGO CUBS THEMSELVES. WELL, FUNNY STORY, WE TAPED THAT BIT ON JUNE 30th, AND THEY HAVE LOST NINE OF ELEVEN GAMES SINCE I TOUCHED THEM. SO, OBVIOUSLY, I FEEL TERRIBLE. SO I WANT TO MAKE IT UP TO THEM TONIGHT BY RUBBING MY LUCKY RABBITS FOOT AGAIN. OKAY. I JUST NEED TO FIND IT. IS IT -- NO, NOT UNDER THE -- OH, I KNOW. I PROBABLY LEFT IT IN MY UMBRELLA. NOPE! NOT IN THERE. OH! IT'S UNDER THE LARD. SORRY! IT'S UNDER THE LADDER!
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS DOWN THERE. OH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS. I KEEP IT BEHIND THE MIRROR (CRASHING, BREAKING GLASS SOUNDS) HUH, IT'S NOT IN THERE. WAIT A SECOND! IT WAS IN MY POCKET THE WHOLE TIME. SORRY! GOOD LUCK, CUBBIES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪

THAT IS A LOVELY CROWD! EVERYBODY FEELING ALL RIGHT TONIGHT? DOING GOOD? WHAT? NO? I HEARD A NO. HEY, HERE'S SOMEBODY NOT FEELING THAT GREAT. REMEMBER THAT BREXIT THING? WELL, THE GUY WHO'S FAULT IT IS, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON, RESIGNED YESTERDAY, AND I THINK HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT THE DECISION.
I EXPECT TO GO TO THE PALACE TO OFFER MY RESIGNATION. SO WE'LL HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER, IN THAT BUILDING, BEHIND ME, BY WEDNESDAY EVENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( SINGING ) ♪ DOOT DOOOO, DOO DOO... RIGHT.

I'VE BEEN A VERY NAUGHTY PRIME MINISTER! I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEONE SO HAPPY TO QUIT THEIR JOB SINCE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER ARRIVED TO ANNOUNCE HE WAS STEPPING DOWN.
ZIP-ADEE-DOO-DAH, ZIP-A-DEE-AY, MY, OH MY, WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WHAT IS IT ABOUT TRYING TO GOVERN THE WESTERN WORLD RIGHT NOW THAT MAKES OUR LEADERS RACE FOR THE EXITS WITH A SONG IN THEIR HEART? WHAT DO THEY KNOW THAT WE DON'T? I MEAN, IN JUST A FEW MONTHS, THEY COULD BE WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRU -- OH.
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS WATCH "THE BACHELORETTE?" (CHEERING) I'M A BIG FAN. THERE'S NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A WOMAN FINDING HER TRUE LOVE AMONGST TWO DOZEN GREASED-UP MEAT SLABS. (LAUGHTER) SHAVED AND GREASED. THEN LOWERED INTO THEIR SUITS. OF COURSE, THE SHOW IS KNOWN FOR ITS RACY ANTICS, AND LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE DELIVERED WHEN JOJO TOOK ALEX TO ARGENTINA.
LOOK HOW CONNECTED THEY ARE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS.
SEEING THIS MAN WORK WITH THIS HORSE. I'M WATCHING HIM STROKE THIS ANIMAL. SLOWLY THIS HORSE JUST STARTS TO GIVE INTO HIM.
STEPHEN: C'MON, MAN. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW THE RULES. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL THE FANTASY STABLE! AND LEST YOU THINK ALEX AND JOJO WERE FEELING LEFT OUT, DON'T WORRY-- AFTER THAT GAUCHO PUT HIS HORSE IN THE MOOD, EVERYBODY SADDLED UP.
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE, I'M FEELING PERFECT. I FEEL THE WAY THAT I THINK LOVE IS SUPPOSED TO FEEL. ( WHINNY ) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DEAR GOD! BUY A GAL SOME OATS FIRST! LOOK AT THE POOR HORSE. IT'S THINKING, "FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TURN ME INTO GLUE. I THINK MY LEG JUST BROKE... SHOOT ME." BY THE WAY, SHE BROKE UP WITH HIM ANYWAY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I FOE. IT'S SAD, ISN'T IT? IT'S SAD THAT YOU CARE. (LAUGHTER) NOW SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

Stephen: WELL, FOLKS, I'VE GOT A QUICK PROGRAMMING NOTE BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER. THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION IS NEXT  WEEK. QUICK PROGRAMMING NOTE -- THE "LATE SHOW" WILL BE LIVE EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. SO TUNE IN FOR A MOCKERY OF OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM -- AND THEN WATCH THE "LATE SHOW!" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ OF COURSE, CONVENTIONS MEAN THAT THE PRIMARY SEASON HAS FINALLY COME TO AN END. WHAT A LONG, STRANGE TRIP IT'S BEEN. WE IN THE MEDIA HAVE ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS KNOCK-DOWN, DRAG-OUT FIGHT, REVELING IN THE POLITICAL FISTICUFFS LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF VICIOUS BLOOD SPORT-- LIKE IT'S THE "HUNGER GAMES." NO, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. IT'S... THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES! HA HA! WELCOME TO THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES! TRIBUTES, ASSEMBLE! ( CLAP CLAP ) OH, SO FEW REMAIN. BUT THE BAR IS CLOSING AND AMERICA HAS TO GO HOME WITH SOMEONE. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE CANDIDATES NUMBERED 23? HELLO. HI. BACK THEN YOU COULDN'T SWING A DEAD CAT WITHOUT HITTING ONE! AND ONE OF THE CANDIDATES WAS A DEAD CAT. WE MISS YOU, SENATOR TUMMYFUZZ! STILL DID BETTER THAN BOBBY JINDAL. BUT, AH, FRIENDS. SADLY, TODAY WE LOST THE BRAVEST TRIBUTE OF ALL. A MAN WHO WE ACTUALLY LOST MONTHS AGO, BUT WHO COURAGEOUSLY KEPT PRETENDING NOT TO BE DEAD BECAUSE, TODAY, BERNIE SANDERS ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON.
SECRETARY CLINTON HAS WON THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATING PROCESS. ( HUGE APPLAUSE ) AND I CONGRATULATE HER FOR THAT.
Stephen: YES, HE CONGRATULATES HER -- FOR THAT! VERY CONVINCING ENDORSEMENT. REMINDED ME OF ANOTHER MAN WHO FORCED HIMSELF TO ENDORSE A CORONATION IN HOPES OF HEALING A RIFT.
GEOFFREY BARATHEON IS THE RIGHTFUL AND TRUE HEIR TO THE IRON THRONE.
STEPHEN: BERNIE, DON'T FORGET TO DUCK. YOU'LL NOTICE THE SLOGAN ON THE PODIUM WAS "STRONGER TOGETHER," BECAUSE BERNIE REJECTED HILLARY'S ORIGINAL IDEA: "IT'S ABOUT (BLEEP) TIME." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO IT HAS FINALLY COME TO PASS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO, BERNIE SANDERS HAS FALLEN, AND LIKE MANY SENIORS, HE CANNOT GET UP. (LAUGHTER) OH, BERNIE, YOU WERE A WORTHY ADVERSARY OF WE, THE ELITE. AND IN YOUR HONOR, I'M GOING TO EAT YOUR NAME IN CAVIAR. (LAUGHTER) MM-MM-MM, MMM! MM-MM-MM, MMM! MMM, MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! I'M GOING TO REGRET THAT. (LAUGHTER) MMM! MMM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE WORD SALTY IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, FRIENDS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) MY KIDS KIDNEYS ARE SHUTTING DOWN AS WE SPEAK. MMM! BUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, BERNIE SANDERS' CAMPAIGN WAS REMARKABLE. THE FIRST REMARK -- "WHO IS BERNIE SANDERS?" BECAUSE BACK IN APRIL 2015, BERNIE ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY TO A TINY CROWD, AND HALF OF THEM THOUGHT HE WAS THE INSTRUCTOR FOR TAI CHI IN THE PARK. HA HA! STAND LIKE A TREE, EVERYONE! THE ANNOUNCEMENT AIRED ON C-SPAN 3-- WHICH COVERS NEWS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR C-SPAN 2, WHICH HANDLES THE STORIES TOO SMALL FOR C-SPAN 1, WHOSE HIGHEST RATED SHOW IS EMPTY CHAIRS IN THE SENATE. BUT SOMEHOW BERNIE BECAME POPULAR WITH HIS PLATFORM OF GIVING EVERYONE EVERYTHING THEY WANT, AND HE EXCITED YOUNG VOTERS WITH HIS PURE SEX APPEAL. HE HAD BEDROOM EYES AND BEDROOM HEAD. AND SOON TRIBUTE SANDERS WAS FILLING ENTIRE STADIUMS. HE WAS LIKE THE ROLLING STONES, BUT YOUNGER. (APPLAUSE) AND HE PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A SERIOUS CANDIDATE. EVEN AFTER HE SAID THIS:
BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU DO DO. WHAT YOU DO DO--
STEPHEN: DOO-DOO TWICE! IMPRESSIVE FOR A MAN HIS AGE. HA HA! ROUGHAGE. (LAUGHTER) IN THE END, BERNIE RECEIVED OVER 12 MILLION VOTES AND WON 22 STATES, AND HE STAYED IN THE RACE SO LONG, AFTER BEING MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED, THAT HE ALSO WON THE STATE OF DENIAL. (LAUGHTER) HA-HA! A LONG WALK, BUT WE GOT THERE TOGETHER! SO HERE'S TO YOU, BERNARD. WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW WE FEEL AFTER LOSING YOU. SO, IN YOUR HONOR...

WHAT'S UP, MAN? HOW YOU DOING?
Stephen: SO LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
YOU, TOO.
Stephen: AS I SAID TO YOU BACK STAGE, YOUR PERFORMANCE IN "MAD MAX:  FURY ROAD" AS ONE OF THE WAR BOYS -- WHAT WAS YOUR NAME?
KNOX. THE SECOND I START ANSWERING QUESTIONS, MY MIND GOES BLANK. I COULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER MY CHARACTER.
Stephen: JUST MAKE IT UP, I'LL BELIEVE YOU. HIS NAME WAS ALAN. THAT PERFORMANCE, SUCH A CRAZY MOVIE, OVER THE TOP, EFFECTS ON HOW KEYED UP IT WAS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT TO DO A PERFORMANCE SO HEARTBREAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND ON SUCH A SMALL HUMAN SCALE WAS SO AMAZING AND THE ANCHOR OF THAT MOVIE. CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING IMMENSELY TALENTED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M A HUGE FAN.
I WAS VERY LUCKY WITH THE ROLE AND THERE WAS GREAT PEOPLE AROUND ME.
Stephen: THERE'S THE WAR BOY RIGHT THERE. YOU PLAYED ANOTHER BOY BEFORE THAT. THIS IS HOW MOST OF US GOT TO KNOW YOU. THIS IS FROM ABOUT A BOY IN 2002. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW DID YOU GET INTO ACTING? HOW OLD WERE YOU HERE WHEN YOU WERE DOING THIS?
11. BUT I DID MY FIRST PLAY WHEN I WAS THREE.
Stephen: WHAT PLAY ARE YOU DOING WHEN YOU ARE THREE? I WAS MACBETH! (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS THE CAUCASIAN CIRCLE WHICH I PLAYED THE KID IN IT. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING APART FROM WE DID A POST-ER SHOOT AND I HAD TO STAND IN A CHALK CIRCLE AND PEOPLE WERE GRABBING MY HANDS FROM THE SIDE AND IT GOT PAINFUL AND THEY GAVE ME BISCUITS AND JUICE. I LITERALLY WORK ON A TREATS-BASED METHOD. WHEN WE WERE PERFORMING EQUALS, IF I DID A GOOD TAKE, I COULD GO TO THE DIRECTING STATION AND HE WOULD GIVE ME NUTS. AND IF IT WASN'T UP TO PACE, THEN HE WOULD BE LIKE, NO NUTS FOR YOU THIS TIME, GO DO IT AGAIN.
Stephen: THAT'S HOW YOU TRAIN AN ANIMAL, YOU REALIZE. THAT'S PAVLOVIAN! WOW! HOW DO YOU GET IN AGE THREE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THEY DON'T SCOUT YOU AT A GYMBOREE.
MY MOM WAS THERE AND SOMEONE WAS WATCHING H ME AND SAID YOUR SON CAN CONCENTRATE WELL FOR A THREE-YEAR-OLD.
Stephen: CAN YOU STILL CONCENTRATE?
NO, IT'S WORSE.
Stephen: DO YOU PLAY VIDEO GAMES?
NO, I CAUGHT A SPIRO IN THE CAR.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE YOUR POKEÉMON WITH YOU?
IT WAS SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE CAR. DIDN'T LOOK TOO HAPPY TO BE COMING.
Stephen: THAT WAS ON THE WAY HERE TODAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RIGHT THERE. WOW. DID HE SPLIT THE FARE WITH YOU?
TRAIN THAT UP AND I WILL BE BACK.
Stephen: THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED EQUALS.
THAT'S THE PHOTO THAT CAME UP, MAYBE.
Stephen: YOU NEVER KNOW. DO YOU HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF NUDE PHOTOGRAPHY ON YOUR PHONE? YOU'RE A CELEBRITY, OF COURSE. THAT'S THE ONE QUESTION I WANT TO GET TO BEFORE WE GO ON IS HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY GO FROM CHILD STAR TO ADULT STAR WITHOUT GOING CRAZY? BECAUSE IT'S -- THERE ARE A LOT OF PIT FALLS IN BETWEEN THIS.
NOT LIVING IN HOLLYWOOD PROBABLY HELPS.
Stephen: SO YOU STAYED IN LONDON?
YEAH, I STAYED IN THE U.K. AND IN SCHOOL TILL I WAS 17 AND JUST DID NORMAL STUFF.
Audience: GUESS.
Stephen: DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE?
SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE YOU GUYS ON THE WAY OUT. II WAS TOO NERVOUS.
Stephen: THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I LIKE THE --
I KNOW.
Stephen: I CAN GO IF YOU GUYS JUST WANT TO -- VERY NICE PEOPLE. DO YOU PLAY AN INSTRUMENT YOURSELF?
I TRY TO PLAY A GUITAR. KRISTEN BOUGHT ME A GUITAR FOR A PRESENT FOR THE FILM.
Stephen: DO YOU REALLY PLAY?
NO, I'M WATCHING YOUTUBE STRUMMING AWAY. I COULDN'T BE ONE OF THE GUYS THAT HAD THE GUITAR IN THE ROOM AND DIDN'T PLAY IT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT HELPS? HAVE A WOMAN BREAK YOUR HEART. EVERYTHING I LEARNED ON THE GUITAR AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT WELL, BUT EVERYTHING I LEARNED WAS IN H THE SIX MONTHS AFTER A GIRL BROKE MY HEART.
WHAT WAS THE TOP SONG?
Stephen: A LOT OF SAD, FOLKY STUFF THAT MADE ME SOUND LIKE I SUFFERED MORE THAN I ACTUALLY HAD.
WE SHOULD JAM AND SIT THERE AND CONSOLE EACHOUT SNORE THAT WOULD BE FUN.
YEAH.
Stephen: IN THE NEW MOVIE "EQUALS" WITH KRISTEN STEWART, IT'S A FUTURISTIC WORLD, WHAT WE'RE SEEING THERE. WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS YOU'VE CAUGHT A DISEASE, MY UNDERSTANDING IS, THAT MAKES YOU FEEL EMOTION BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE DON'T HAVE EMOTIONS.
YEAH, ESSENTIALLY THEY ERADICATE EMOTIONS BECAUSE WHEN HUMANS FEEL THINGS THEY INEVITABLY SCREW THINGS UP, ACT IRRATIONALLY. I LOVE THE CAMERON CLIP WITH HIM -- DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO!
Stephen: I'VE DESTROYED THE EUROPEAN UNION, DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! (LAUGHTER) HOW DO YOU ACT WITHOUT EMOTION? ISN'T ACTING ALL ABOUT SHOWING EMOTION?
YEAH, IT'S REALLY WEIRD AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO BASE FORM. THESE HUMANS DON'T FEEL ANYTHING BUT WHEN THEY GET S.O.S., SWITCHED ON SYNDROME, THEY HAVE NIGHTMARES, HEADACHES, AND MY CHARACTER GETS IT AND HE SPOTS KRISTEN'S CHARACTER AND GOES, HMM, HANG ON, WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? (LAUGHTER) AND THEN IT OBVIOUSLY GOES TERRIBLY WRONG AND WHEN YOU GET THAT DISEASE YOU END UP IN THE DEN WHICH IS FOR TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU DIE FROM EMOTIONS?
THEY KIND OF TRY AND TREAT YOU BUT THEN IT GOES WRONG AND THEY KIND OF -- PUT YOU DOWN? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHAT IF YOU SHOW NO EMOTION, THEY GIVE YOU NUTS.
I'LL BE BETTER.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS, IT'S LOVELY TO MEET YOU. GOOD LUCK ON THE MOVIE, "EQUALS" IS IN THE THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. THE GREAT NICHOLAS HOULT, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS THE REASON YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES ARE YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES! PLEASE WELCOME, JOHN TURTURRO! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HI.
Stephen: HI. IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU. I ALREADY MET YOU ONCE BACKSTAGE BUT IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.
WELL, I TRY.
Stephen: YOU SUCCEED MULTIPLE TIMES! YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK. I LOVE SEEING YOU ON CAMERA. I'M GOING TO LOOK AT YOU ON CAMERA HEIGHT RIGHT HERE.
THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU ARE REALLY GIVING ME THAT JOHN TURTURRO THING RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) YOUR NEW SHOW IS CALLED "THE NIGHT OF" ON HBO.
RIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S GETTING INCREDIBLE REVIEWS.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU PLAY JOHN STONE. WHO IS JOHNSTONE?
I'M A NIGHT TROLLER, AMBULANCE CHASER, ECZEMA-RIDDEN DEFENSE ATTORNEY WHO WEARS SANDALS, AND I STUMBLE ON TO THIS KID WHO IS BEING ACCUSED OF MURDER. I DON'T KNOW THAT, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A CLIENT, AND THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE KID THAT RIZ AHMED PLAYS THAT, I DON'T KNOW, HE HAS AN EXTINCTION CHIEWL FEELING THAT HE'S INNOCENT, AND THAT'S INVOLVED IN THIS WHOLE CASE. IT'S ABOUT A GUY WHO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GOOD LAWYER, BUT HE'S UNABLE TO COMPARTMENTALIZE HIS FEELINGS GOING TO TRIAL, AND HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE BELIEF IN THE SYSTEM THAT WAY, AND THEN HE GETS INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING THAT HE HASN'T BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME, A MUCH BIGGER CASE AND CRIME, AND THE WHOLE SERIES IS ABOUT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND THE COST OF BACKACCUSED OF A CRIME, BEING -- OF BEING ACCUSED OF A CRIME, BEING PUT INTO THE SYSTEM, WHAT IT DOES TO THE KID ACCUSED, HIS FAMILY, THE DEFENSE, PROSECUTION, THE POLICEMAN INVESTIGATING HIM.
Stephen: WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP HERE OF YOU TALKING TO YOUR CLIENT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.
OKAY, NOW, LISTEN TO ME. DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY ANYMORE. ANYONE ASKS YOU ANYTHING, HOW YOU DOING, ISN'T IT A NICE DAY? SAY, I DON'T KNOW, TALK TO MY LAWYER. OKAY? SAY IT.
OKAY. SAY THAT TO ME. I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW. TALK TO -- MY LAWYER. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? SEEING IF I CAN GET YOU OUT OF HERE. SHORT OF THAT, GET YOU A PHONE CALL.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING I DID?
I DON'T AND I DON'T CARE. UNTIL THEY CHARGE YOU, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. GUARD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DID YOU GO TO RIKERS ISLAND?
RIKERS ISLAND, TO THE TOMBS, TO COURT, I HUNG OUT WITH A LOT OF LAWYERS. IT WAS BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN BY RICHARD PRICE AND STEVE ALSO DIRECTED. SO WE REALLY WERE IN GREAT HANDS BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE M MINUTIA OF A CRIME.
Stephen: COULD AN ACTOR BE A GOOD LAWYER?
WELL, IF YOU DO THE HOMEWORK AND YOU'VE DONE THE STUDYING. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE DEALING WITH A JURY, YOU COULD CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. BUT THE KEY TO DEALING WITH A JURY IS BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE 12 MEMBERS ON THAT JURY AND KNOWING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEM.
Stephen: HAVE YOU SAT IN A JURY?
I HAVE BEEN SELECTED TWICE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. (LAUGHTER) IT'S REALLY NERVE RACKING WHEN, FOR JURY DUTY YOU GO THERE. AND THE LAWYERS ARE REALLY BORING. YOU FALL ASLEEP. THEY GO ON AND ON. THEY SAY, IF I DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE, WOULD YOU CONVICT THE PERSON? YOU'RE LIKE, NO, I WOULDN'T DO THAT. THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE A REAL STAGE PRESENCE AND THEY ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO KEEP YOUR ATTENTION. AND THAT'S REALLY THE ACTOR'S FIRST JOB, AS YOU WELL KNOW, IS TO KEEP PEOPLE AWAKE.
Stephen: RALPH RICHARDSON SAID THE ART OF ACTING IS TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM COUGHING.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: THIS IS ON HBO AND TAKING OVER THE SLOT "GAME OF THRONES" IS IN. SO LET'S PUT SOME ASSES IN THE SEATS HERE. ARE THERE ANY DRAGONS? DO YOU GET NAKED IN THIS?
THERE IS NAKEDNESS. THERE'S EMOTIONAL NAKEDNESS.
Stephen: IS THERE PHYSICAL ENACT NAKEDNESS? DO YOU GET PHYSICAL NAKEDNESS AT ALL?
YEAH, THERE IS NAKEDNESS.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE NAKED ON CAMERA?
IT'S VERY INTERESTING. THE SEX SCENE WILL BE NAKED.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE IT ONE STAGE AT A TIME. FIRST LET'S GET NAKED TOGETHER. I HAVE BEEN NAKED ON STAGE BUT NEVER ON FILM.
YOU HAVE BEEN NAKED ON STAGE, OKAY. HOW DID YOU FEEL?
Stephen: I WAS YOUNG AND NEEDED THE MONEY. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT HARD. IF YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THE CREW. IF YOU'RE NOT FRIENDS WITH THE CREW, THEN YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT WEIRD. IF THE OTHER PERSON'S NAKED --
Stephen: THAT HELPS, TOO. THAT HELPS A LOT.
Stephen: HOW DOES IT HELP IF THE CREW YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH GO, LIKE, GO FOR IT, JOHNNY! (LAUGHTER) HOW'S THE SEX SCENE?
IT'S LIKE BEING IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE, YOU KNOW REECIALTIONLY. IT'S SO UNSEXY.
Stephen: I'VE HAD SOME VERY SEXY HSEXY HYGIENISTS.
I'VE HAD SOME VERY STRANGE ENCOUNTERS IN THESE SITUATIONS BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SHOW THEIR BREASTS, AND THEY HAVE TAPE ON AND YOU'VE NEVER MET THE PERSON BEFORE.
Stephen: DO YOU A SOCK ON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
IT DEPENDS. IT'S REALLY A STRANGE SITUATION BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE ACTING IN THE SCENE, IF IT'S THE SEDUCTION SCENE LEADING TO IT, THAT CAN BE SEXY. BUT IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY HAVING SEX, YOU REALIZE WHAT AM I ACTUALLY DOING, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT REALLY ACTUALLY DOING IT AND SOMETIMES YOU COME OUT AND HAVE A HEADACHE.
Stephen: BUT YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR BEST ANYWAY.
WELL, YOU TRY TO MAKE YOUR PARTNER FEEL COMFORTABLE, AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE SAYING AM I TOO HEAVY OR THINGS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.
I ASK THEM TO PUT MUSIC ON SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A DRINK, YOU KNOW. ONE TIME I DIRECTED A SEX SCENE IN A MOVIE AND I REALIZED THE PEOPLE COULDN'T REALLY -- THEY WERE GOING TO BE TOO INHIBITED AND I DECIDED TO TAKE JAMES OUT OF THE SCENE AND I PUT KATE ON A BOUNCY BALL, SO SHE WAS ON THE BOUNCY BALL -- (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S ACTING! AND THE PROBLEM WAS, WHEN WE DID JAMES, HOW TO CONNECT THEM, SO I TOOK KATE'S WIG, AND AS JAMES WAS HAVING SEX, I THREW KATE'S WIG IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. AND I HAVE TO SAY, IF YOU WATCH THE SCENE, IT'S REALLY SEXY, BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPLETELY FREE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
Stephen: RIGHT. I'VE HAD THAT KIND OF SEX, TOO. (LAUGHTER) CONGRATULATIONS, THANK YOU SO MUCH! "THE NIGHT OF" AIRS SUNDAY NIGHTS ON HBO. JOHN TURTURRO, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BRET BAIER.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CHIEF POLITICAL ANCHOR FOR FOX NEWS AND WILL BE CO-HOSTING THEIR COVERAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC CONVENTIONS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BRET BAIER! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YA?
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU! THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. THAT JOHN TURTURRO INTERVIEW WAS A LITTLE SURREAL.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT PART OF IT? THE DESCRIPTION OF KATE WINSLET HAVING SEX ON A BOUNCING BALL?
I THINK THAT'S ONE.
Stephen: ANYTHING ELSE? JUST THE OBSESSION WITH HIM AT THE BEGINNING.
Stephen: YEAH? I'M JUST AS OBSESSED WITH YOU, SIR.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I'M CONTROLLING AND I'M BACKING YOU DOWN RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) HAVE YOU EVER DONE A NUDE SCENE?
NEVER ONCE.
Stephen: THAT LEADS ME TO THE FIRST QUESTION. YOU GUYS OVER THERE ARE MAKING SOME NEWS I'M SURE YOU DON'T WELCOME. GRETCHEN CARLSEN ACCUSED YOUR BOSS AND THE GENIUS ROGER AILES ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. WHAT'S THE MOOD LIKE OVER THERE? WHAT'S THE RESPONSE INTERNALLY THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING?
LISTEN, I'VE WORKED THERE 19 YEARS. THE ROGER I KNOW IS SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN AMAZING TO ME, AMAZING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AT FOX WHO HAVE COME OUT PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY SUPPORTING HIM, HE'S BEEN FANTASTIC TO MY FAMILY. HE'S ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO CALLED WHEN MY SON HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY, NOT ONCE BUT THREE TIMES. HE IS -- THAT'S THE ROGER I KNOW. SO THESE HEADLINES ARE FOREIGN TO ME. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT TO FOCUS ON. WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DOO, AND THAT'S WHAT --
Stephen: THAT MUST BE HARDER TO DO WHILE YOU GUYS ARE THE STORY. THAT'S SOMETHING I ASSUME A NEWS ORGANIZATION DOESN'T LIKE BEING.
LISTEN, FOX HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE HEADLINES ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, I THINK UNJUSTLY SOMETIMES, BUT THE NEWS SIDE OF THE HOUSE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE A LOT COMING UP. THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WILL FIND OUT ABOUT A VP NOMINEE FOR DONALD TRUMP IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. I HAVE A DONALD TRUMP INTERVIEW TOMORROW.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ASK HIM?
WHAT WOULD YOU ASK HIM?
Stephen: I WOULD ASK HIM TO DEFINE THE WORD "GREAT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND IN HIS ANSWER, HE CAN'T USE THE WORDS "TREMENDOUS," "FANTASTIC" OR "TOTALLY BELIEVE ME."
I COULD ASK HIM IF HE'S EVER HAD A SEX SCENE -- OR MAYBE NOT.
Stephen: (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HE MIGHT. IT STARTS NEXT WEEK, THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. IT'S LIKE A BLACK BOX. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY HAVEN'T REALLY RELEASED WHO THE SPEAKERS ARE GOING TO BE. DO YOU HAVE ANY ACCEPTS OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE REPORTING SON? BECAUSE IN YEARS PAST, YOU GUYS REPORTED ON THINGS YOU ALREADY KNEW WERE HAPPENING.
LISTEN, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF DRAMA. I DON'T THINK THEY WILL TAKE HIM OUT OF NOMINATION EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS ALL THIS TALK ABOUT A TED CRUZ --
Stephen: A FEDERAL JUDGE RULED DELEGATES AREN'T NECESSARILY BOUND TO VOTE ON THE FIRST BALLOT.
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THE DELEGATES TO VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE.
Stephen: WHO'S REALLY BEHIND THAT? BECAUSE YOU HEAR THE DUMP TRUMP PEOPLE AND I THINK WHO'S THE RINGLEADER OF ALL THAT? IS IT TED CRUZ WITH A CRYSTAL BALL?
THERE ARE CRUZ PEOPLE AND THERE ARE NEVER TRUMP PEOPLE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS TO BE ABLE TO GET AN ACTUAL VOTE AND RIGHT NOW, MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY WILL.
Stephen: HE SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THE GREATEST REALITY SHOW OF ALL TIME, IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME HOLLYWOOD. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
I HAVE NO CLUE. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE. I THINK THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF PROTESTS IN CLEVELAND AND PHILADELPHIA AND I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN FOR EVERYBODY THERE.
Stephen: I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE IN THE REAL PRESS AND THEY'RE BEING ISSUED GAS MASKS. (AUDIENCE REACTS) (APPLAUSE) NOT YOU! WHAT I MEAN IS -- REALLY, NO. I WISH I THOUGHT OF THAT JOKE.
MAN!
Stephen: BUT I MEAN I'M NOT REAL PRESS, PEOPLE MISTOOK ME FOR IT FOR YEARS, BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE ISSUED GAS MASKS BEFORE THEY GO TO CLEVELAND. ARE YOU TAKING PRECAUTIONS LIKE THAT?
YES, WE HAVE EQUIPMENT, GAS MASKS, SECURITY.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN THE SKY BOX IN THE ARENA.
ALONGSIDE MEGYN KELLY, IMAN ANCHORING THE COVERAGE. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AND THIS ELECTION THAT IS PROVEN THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NEXT.
Stephen: OKAY. WELL, GOOD LUCK NEXT WEEK AND THE WEEK AFTER. WE'LL BE LIVE, TOO. , SO YOU KNOW, I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.
AND THE REAL PRESS WILL BE THERE.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU SAY? THE REAL PRESS WILL BE THERE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THE REAL PRESS WILL BE THERE, BUT I WON'T. BRET BAIER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. "SPECIAL REPORT" IS ON FOX NEWS, AND WATCH HIS LIVE CONVENTION COVERAGE THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. BRET BAIER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY "YOUNG GREATNESS."
