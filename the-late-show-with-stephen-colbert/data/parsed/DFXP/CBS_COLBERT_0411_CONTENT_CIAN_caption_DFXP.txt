WE HERE AT "THE LATE SHOW"" ARE BIG FANS OF AMAZON, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, OF $5 BILLION. SO MR. BEZO, IS, WE'D LIKE TO THROW OUR HAT SPOT RING TO BE YOUR NEW HEADQUARTERS, BY OFFERING YOU THIS ENTIRE OFFICE, WHICH YOU WILL SHARE WITH KEITH.
I AM NOT TAKING DOWN MY POSTERS.
THAT'S RIGHT, FOR ONLY $5 BILLION YOU GET THIS ENTIRE OFFICE COMPLETE WITH DESK, LIGHT, WASTE BASKET, AND, OF COURSE, KEITH.
I EAT A LOT O QUINWA, AND IT MAKES ME GASSY.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT'S TOP STORY, TRUMP TAKES ON NORTH KOREA. PLUS "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS," WITH HILLARY CLINTON. AND STEPHEN WELCOMES BOBBY MOYNIHAN AND TATIANA MASLANY, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE VERY KIND. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT IS-- AS YOU CAN TELL BY THIS CROWD, IT IS FRIDAY.  ( CHEERS )
Jon: IT'S A FRIDAY CROWD.
Stephen: THAT'S A FRIDAY REACTION RIGHT THERE. OF COURSE, IF YOU'VE BEEN IN NEW YORK CITY, YOU KNOW THAT THE U.N. HAS BEEN IN TOWN ALL WEEK. DIPLOMATS FROM EVERY NATION ON THIS PLANET HAVE GATHERED IN NEW YORK TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE OF, "WE CAN PARK ANYWHERE WE WANT." HOPEFUL.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND THE HIGHLIGHT WAS TRUMP'S BIG SPEECH, WHERE HE THREATENED TO "TOTALLY DESTROY" NORTH KOREA. THAT DIDN'T GO OVER BIG WITH NORTH KOREA WHO FIRED BACK. EARLIER THIS WEEK, THEIR FOREIGN MINISTER, RI YONG HO, CALLED TRUMP'S SPEECH NOTHING MORE THAN THE SOUND OF A DOG BARKING. ( LAUGHTER ) PRETTY SICK BURN ON OUR PRESIDENT, TO WHICH I HAVE TO SAY:  KNOCK IT OFF, NORTH KOREA, NOKO. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO INSULT OUR LEADER LIKE THAT. SURE, I'VE HAD MY PROBLEMS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, SUCH AS EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID AND DONE. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND LET SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY TALK SMACK ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT! WE CAN DO IT, OKAY? MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT? THAT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION! IF I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR PRESIDENT IS A LUMP OF UNCOOKED PUMPKIN BREAD DOUGH WITH A RUSTY BRILLO PAD BALANCED ON TOP, THAT IS MY RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.
Stephen: I'M ANGRY. THAT IS WAY OUT OF LINE. THIS GUY ALSO SAID, "IF TRUMP WAS THINKING HE COULD SCARE US, THAT'S REALLY A DOG'S DREAM." FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND DOGS? IS NORTH KOREA TOO POOR TO AFFORD ANOTHER METAPHOR? APPARENTLY, "IN KOREAN, A DOG DREAM IS ONE THAT IS ABSURD AND MAKES LITTLE SENSE." OH, REALLY? WELL, IN AMERICA, SOMETHING THAT'S ABSURD AND MAKES VERY LITTLE SENSE IS CALLED "EVERY DAY SINCE NOVEMBER 8." AND AGAIN-- AGAIN, I-- ( APPLAUSE ) I AM ALLOWED TOW SAY THAT. YOU'RE NOT! AS AN AMERICAN, I HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP LOOKS LIKE A ROTTING HAYSTACK MADE OF MEAT, BUT YOU CANNOT. AND THE WORST PART IS THE FOREIGN MINISTER MADE THESE REMARKS OUTSIDE OF HIS HOTEL IN NEW YORK. YOU COME TO MY HOUSE AND INSULT MY PRESIDENT? WHO, GRANTED, I THINK ISN'T FIT TO SIT IN A WHITE CASTLE, LET ALONE A WHITE HOUSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT-- BUT-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU DON'T SEE ME GOING AROUND SAYING YOUR LEADER, KIM JONG-UN, LOOKS LIKE IF THE KID FROM "UP" ATE THE OLD MAN FROM "UP!" ( LAUGHTER ) SO BACK OFF, NORTH KOREA! DOES "THE LATE SHOW"" HAVE NUKES? DO WE HAVE NUKES? WE NEED TO GET NUKES. OKAY. AND NORTH KOREA WASN'T THE ONLY JITTERY NUCLEAR POWER THAT TRUMP POKED WITH A STICK. HE ALSO LASHED OUT AT IRAN. YOU SEE, OBAMA SIGNED A DEAL WHICH REDUCED SANCTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR IRAN CURBING ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM BACK IN 2015, WHICH FEELS LIKE 80 YEARS AGO. AND HERE'S WHAT TRUMP SAID ABOUT THE DEAL AT THE U.N.:
FRANKLY, THAT DEAL IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE UNITED STATES, AND I DON'T THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE LAST OF IT. BELIEVE ME.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T TRUST? PEOPLE WHO END THEIR SENTENCES WITH "BELIEVE ME." ( LAUGHTER ) "YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS CAR. GREAT GAS MILEAGE, AND IT'S NEVER HAD A CORPSE IN THE TRUNK. BELIEVE ME." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE THING IS-- YOU'LL NEVER FIND ANY BLOOD. LEMON JUICE AND SODA WATER. LEMON JUICE AND SODA WATER. THE THING IS, IF TRUMP WANTS TO PULL OUT OF THE DEAL, HE HAS TO PROVE THAT IRAN IS NOT COMPLYING WITH IT. ONE PROBLEM: "THE LATEST INSPECTIONS FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT THE COUNTRY IS BREACHING THE AGREEMENT." THAT'S RIGHT, SIR. YOU ACTUALLY NEED A REASON TO BACK OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU CAN'T DO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU MET A HOTTER, YOUNGER TREATY. BUT-- BUT THERE ARE SIGNS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PULL OUT. FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S VICE PRESIDENT AND MAN-MAYONNAISE HYBRID, MIKE PENCE, WHO SAID SAID ON CBS THIS MORNING ON CBS YESTERDAY MORNING THIS:
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE HIS VIEW OF THE IRAN DEAL VERY CLEAR BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY THIS WEEK. HE CONSIDERS IT NOTHING SHORT OF AN EMBARRASSMENT, THE WORST ONE-SIDED DEAL PERHAPS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Stephen: PERHAPS. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T COUNT NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY. THEN, WITH THE DEAL UP IN THE AIR, IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI SAID THIS TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY:
IT WILL BE A GREAT PITY IF THIS AGREEMENT WERE TO BE DESTROYED BY ROGUE NEWCOMERS TO THE WORLD OF POLITICS.
Stephen: ROGUE NEWCOMER?! AGAIN, FOREIGNERS. WE CAN DO IT. YOU CAN'T. IF I WANT TO CALL TRUMP "JABBA THE HUTT'S OUT-OF-SHAPE STUNT DOUBLE," THAT'S WHY I PAY TAXES. DON'T MAKE ME TELL YOU AGAIN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, FOLKS, WITH ALL THAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD, I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS NOT THE NUMBER ONE STORY, BUT IT IS THE NUMBER TWO. JIM?
A FAMILY HAS HAD ENOUGH. THEY SAY A WOMAN IS DEFECATING ON THEIR SIDEWALK NEAR BREYERGATE AND UNION IN COLORADO SPRINGS. THE FAMILY SAYS THEY'VE CAUGHT HER IN THE ACT TWICE NOW.
Stephen: TWICE? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: "POOP ON MY SIDEWALK ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. POOP ON MY SIDEWALK TWICE, REALLY? YOU'RE POOPING ON MY SIDEWALK AGAIN?" ARE YOU OKAY? SEE SOMEONE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, THIS IS SERIOUS. THIS IS MY SERIOUS FACE! THIS IS SERIOUS! THIS IS SERIOUS! THIS WOMAN IS STILL AT LARGE, AND THE NEWS MEDIA HAS DUBBED HER "THE MAD POOPER." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY I DON'T THINK THE "MAD" IS NECESSARY. THAT'S LIKE CALLING SOMEONE THE "CRAZY" CHAINSAW MURDERER. "NO, THIS GUY'S A CHAINSAW MURDERER, ONLY HE'S NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD!" UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE EYEWITNESSES:
PANTS AROUND ANKLES IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. HER KIDS SAW IT HAPPEN FIRST.
THEY'RE LIKE, "THERE'S A LADY TAKING A POOP!" AND SO I COME OUTSIDE, AND IT'S LIKE "OH, DEAR GOODNESS!" AND SO I WAS LIKE, "ARE YOU SERIOUS? ARE YOU REALLY TAKING A POOP RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF MY KIDS?" AND SHE WAS LIKE "YEAH, SORRY!" ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT "SORRY" JUST CAN'T FIX: LYING TO A FRIEND, AND POOPING ON THE SIDEWALK. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE AT HIGH ALERT. ONE SERGEANT SAID, "IT'S ABNORMAL. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'VE SEEN IN MY CAREER, FOR SOMEONE TO REPEATEDLY DO SUCH A THING. IT'S UNCHARTERED TERRITORY FOR ME." NEVER SEEN IT IN HIS CAREER. HARD NOT TO FEEL SORRY FOR THIS SERGEANT. I BET HE'S JUST WEEKS AWAY FROM RETIREMENT AND HE'S GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS (BLEEP). ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DIDN'T WIN THE EMMY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ( LAUGHTER ) HARD-HITTING STUFF. LISTEN, STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THIS STORY. IN THE MEANTIME, OFFICERS, DO YOUR DUTY! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO HERE'S THE THING-- HERE'S THE THING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS, YET ANOTHER PUBLIC MELTDOWN TAKING PLACE ACROSS AMERICA. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LEAKED VIDEO OF MSNBC ANCHOR AND SMUG MANNEQUIN, LAWRENCE O'DONNELL. THIS WEEK, SOME FOOTAGE WAS LEAKED OF LAWRENCE GETTING A LITTLE TESTY DURING A TAPING.
BUT HE DID BRING A HAT, A HAT THAT IS FOR SALE.
15 SECONDS.
WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY AM I LOSING THIS? WHY DON'T I HAVE SOUND? WHO'S ASKING FOR A LABOR DAY RUNDOWN IN MY EAR?
20 SECONDS.
(BLEEP). DAMN IT.
10 SECONDS.
THERE'S INSANITY IN THE CONTROL ROOM TONIGHT. SOMEONE IN THAT CONTROL ROOM IS OUT OF CONTROL. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WOW! HE WENT FROM ZERO TO "DAD ON DAY THREE OF ROADTRIP" LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WITH O'DONNELL ALREADY FURIOUS ABOUT THE TALKING IN HIS EAR, THE CREW PICKED A BAD TIME TO START RENOVATING THE STUDIO.
COMING UP: IS DONALD TRUMP GOING TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY TO CONGRESS? MICHAEL ITZKOFF HAS THE LATEST ON THAT. STOP THE HAMMERING. STOP THE HAMMERING OUT THERE. WHO'S GOT A HAMMER? WHERE IS IT? WHERE'S THE HAMMER? IS IT ON THE-- GO UP ON THE OTHER FLOOR. SOMEBODY GO UP THERE AND STOP THE HAMMERING. STOP THE HAMMERING! I'LL GO DOWN THERE TO THE GOD (BLEEP) FLOOR MYSELF AND STOP IT.
Stephen: FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, WHILE THE FOOTAGE IS NOT FLATTERING, AS A BROADCASTER, I REALLY FEEL FOR LAWRENCE IN THAT CLIP. HOSTING A TELEVISION SHOW IS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL AND THESE GUYS KNOW IT IS HARD TO DO WITH ANY DISTRACTION. ♪ ♪ ♪
Jon: YEAH. YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. I'M GLAD YOU AGREE. ♪ ♪ ♪ THANK YOU. THIS CAN HAPPEN TO THE BEST OF US. I HAD A MELTDOWN OF MY OWN RECENTLY. SO THAT'S WHY, IN SOLIDARITY WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL AND JUST TO GET AHEAD OF THE STORY BEFORE IT BREAKS, I'M RELEASING MY OWN TAPE. ALSO, MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT'S THE CAPITAL OF NAMBIA ANYWAY, COVFEFE? WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY EARPIECE? SOMEONE'S HITTING BUTTONS IN MY EARPIECE. WHY IS A WOMAN TALKING ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN MY EARPIECE RIGHT NOW. SHE'S LITERALLY DESCRIBING CHRISTMAS TRADITIONS. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? (BLEEP) AND THAT'S WHY HE SHOULD BE BROUGHT-- GREAT (BLEEP). THIS WOMAN IS BACK IN MY EAR. NOW SHE'S RINGING SLEIGH BELLS AND RECITING "THE 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS." ♪ GOLDEN RINGS ♪ DAMN IT! ( LAUGHTER ) WHO'S DRILLING? WHERE'S THE DRILLING-- ( LAUGHTER ) WHERE'S THE DRILLING COMING FROM? STOP THE DRILLING! STOP IT! I'LL STOP THE DRILLING MYSELF! WHERE IS THE DRILLING! I'LL COME THERE MYSELF AND STOP THE DRILLING! I'VE GOT YOUR POWER TOOL RIGHT HERE? WAIT! IS THAT A HORSE? WHERE'S MY CHAIR? ( APPLAUSE ) WHO TOLD YOU-- I TOLD YOU (BLEEP) AMATEURS NO HORSES IN HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) AARRGGH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. BOBBY MOYNIHAN IS HERE. BUT IT'S FRIDAY. WE'VE GOT A VERY SPECIAL "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS" WITH HILL ROAD RODHAM CLINTON. STICK AROUND. SO MUCH TO CONFESS TO. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE.
Jon: HEY, HEY!
Stephen: WELL, FOLKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YESTERDAY WAS ROSH HASHANA. L'SHANA TOVA, EVERYBODY. EITHER I JUST SAID "HAPPY NEW YEAR" IN HEBREW, OR I ORDERED HUMMUS. I'M NOT SURE. ROSH HASHANA, OF COURSE, BEGINS THE JEWISH DAYS OF REPENTANCE, DURING WHICH JEWISH PEOPLE PRACTICE "T'SHUVAH." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SERIOUSLY, WHERE'S MY HUMMUS? ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT YOM KIPUR PRESENT LOOK NO FURTHER THAN "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." ABSOLUTELY. BUY THIS BOOK BETWEEN ROSH HASHANAH AND YOM KIPPUR, OR YOUR NAME WILL NOT BE PUT DOWN IN THE BARNES & NOBLE OF LIFE. HERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO ATONE FOR, SHAMELESSLY PROMOTING MY BOOK "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS THINGS TO CONFESS TO. ON MY SHOW ON TUESDAY, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON ALSO NEEDED TO UNBURDEN HERSELF. JIM. I HAVE A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED TO CONFESS BEFORE WE DID CONFESSIONS TONIGHT.
OH, I'M SURE I DO, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH YET. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, I MEAN, YOU COULD JUST TELL THE AUDIENCE. THEY WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT? >
Audience, OF COURSE, NOT.
WELL, OKAY. NOW DONALD TRUMP HAD IT ALL WRONG. IT WAS ACTUALLY ME WHO WAS BORN IN KENYA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

( ORGAN MUSIC ) ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME AUDIENCE, WHEN PEOPLE BRING A BOTTLE OF WINE TO MY HOUSE, I RUN INTO THE NEXT ROOM TO GOOGLE HOW MUCH IT COST. ( LAUGHTER ) ON A FORM, WHEN THEY ASK FOR MY BLOOD TYPE, I SAY "WET." ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, WHEN I'M TOO LAZY TO READ YOUR TEXT, I JUST TYPE "HA-HA." ( LAUGHTER ) "HA-HA." AGAIN, NEIL, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR AUNT. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE TIME, ONE TIME, I PULLED THE FIRE ALARM AT MY KID'S SCHOOL BECAUSE THE TALENT SHOW WAS SO BORING. ( LAUGHTER ) IF I'M EVER ON DEATH ROW, MY LAST MEAL IS GOING TO BE ENDLESS SHRIMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) I TELL MY DENTIST I FLOSS EVERYDAY, BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS WEARING A THONG. ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER MY LAST TRIP TO THE ZOO, I REALLY HOPE IT'S JUST AN OLD SAYING THAT ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET. ( LAUGHTER ) I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT THAT ONE, TOO. STEALING CANDY FROM A BABY ISN'T AS EASY AS I WAS PROMISED. ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVE AN ELEVENTH TOE. IT'S NOT MINE. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M RUNNING OUT OF CLEVER WAYS TO PLUG MY NEW "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS" BOOK.

Stephen: YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, THERE'S A PURPOSE TO MY WORK."
YEAH, YEAH, I'M JUST GLAD I DIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE HIM OR BALD AT IMPRESSIONS. THANK GOD I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT. SORRY, ALEC.
Stephen: NINE YEARS THERE. THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN SOME SKETCHES OR SOME CHARACTERS THAT YOU BELIEVED IN, BUT THEY WERE LIKE, "WE'RE NEVER GOING TO DO THAT."
MILLIONS, A BUNCH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: IF YOU HAD YOUR DRUTHERS, "WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT."
I THINK I TRIED AND FAILED ABOUT 10 TIMES TO GET ON THIS CHARACTER NAMED BURL. PIFS A 900-POUND MAN WHO HAD JUST-- WAS HAVING A PARTY BECAUSE HE HAD JUST LOST 19 POUNDS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE WAS-- HE WAS FINALLY 900 POUNDS, SO HE WAS HAVING A PARTY.
Stephen: HE WAS 919 POUNDS AND LOST--
HE LOST THAT 19. HE WAS AT HIS GOAL WEIGHT OF 900 POUNDS.
Stephen: AND WAS HE UPSET THAT NO ONE WAS CELEBRATING WITH HIM?
WELL, NO, HE WAS MORE JUST CONTENT TO BE ALIVE. IT WAS MORE THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM CELEBRATING. I DON'T THINK I SAID A SINGLE WORD IN THE SKETCH. I SAT THERE AND THAT WAS IT. THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T MAKE IT ON.
Stephen: NOW, YOU DID IMPROV BEFORE.
YEAH, I STILL DO.
Stephen: DID YOU GET NERVOUS WHEN YOU STARTED OFF? WOULD YOU IMMEDIATELY WANT TO DO IT. "I THINK I HAVE TO DO THIS BUT I'M TERRIFIED?"
NO, I THINK I WAS THE OPPOSITE. I WAS LIKE, "LET'S DO IT." UPRIGHT CITIZENS BRIGADE, ONE OF THE BEST PLACES IN THE WORLD TO DO IMPROV COMEDY.
Stephen: EXTRAORDINARY.
YEAH. AND SO MANY WONDERFUL, STUPID, SILLY PEOPLE THERE AND REALLY, REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE. NO, WE GOT UP THERE-- I WOULD GET NERVOUS AT TIMES. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF MOMENTS. I HAD A COUPLE OF INJURIES ON STAGE.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
OH, YEAH. I REMEMBER A SHOW, I WAS ON A TEAM CALLED "POLICE CHIEF RUMBLE," AND THE SUGGESTION WAS DOLPHIN, AND ONE OF THE GIRLS IN THE GROUP IMMEDIATELY JUMPED AND KICKED ME RIGHT IN THE GROIN. WENT BACKSTAGE, THREW UP, AND THEN DID A LITTLE IMPROV.

Stephen: ARE YOU ME, MYSELF, OR I? WHICH ONE ARE YOU?
EXACTLY. TUNE IN TO FIND OUT. I THINK I'M PROBABLY MYSELF JUST BECAUSE I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AGES. BUT --
Stephen: IT TAKES PLACE IN '92?
1991, I BELIEVE, AS A 14-YEAR-OLD. I PLAY A GUY NAMED ALEX REILLY WHO IS AN INVENTOR AND IT'S KIND OF A STORY OF THIS GUY'S WIFE. YOU SEE HIM IN 1991, PLAYED BY JACK DILLON GRAZER, WHO WAS JUST IN "IT." I PLAY ALAN AT 45. AND YOU KIND OF SEE HIS LOVE FOR INVENTING AND KIND OF HIS HOPE AND HIS PASSION AND THEN WHEN HE'S 40, HIS LIFE IS NOT GOING SO HOT. HE'S LIVING IN HIS BEST FRIEND'S GARAGE. HE'S A SINGLE DAD. AND HE CAN'T THINK OF THAT INVENTION. AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE HIM IN 2042, JOHN LAROQUET'S TIME LINE, HE HAS INVENTED SOMETHING AMAZING. WE DON'T KNOW YET BUT HE IS LIVING THE DREAM.
Stephen: WERE YOU UPSET WHEN THEY SAID, WE SEE YOU AS THE LOSER ONE?"
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. I THINK THIS IS YOU DEMONSTRATING ONE OF YOUR INVENTIONS.
YES, THIS IS ME AND JULIA WHITE PITCH AGO I'M KIND OF OUT OF IDEAS AND I'M SCRAMBLING AND THIS WAS AN IDEA I HAD AS A KID AND DECIDED TO BRING IT OUT.

I'M GREATLY HONORED TO HOST THIS LUNCH, TO BE JOINED BY THE LEADERS OF ETHOPIA, GHANA, GUINEA, NAMBIA. NAMBIA'S HEALTH SYSTEM IS INCREASINGLY SELF-SUFFICIENCY.
Stephen: NOW, THERE IS NO SUCH COUNTRY AS NAMBIA. ( LAUGHTER ) DESPITE THAT, THEY WILL SOON HAVE A BETTER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAN WE DO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I MIGHT MOVE TO NAMBIA. OF COURSE, EVERYONE IS STILL TALKING ABOUT HIS BIG SPEECH TO THE U.N. YESTERDAY. AND REPUBLICANS LOVED IT. LET'S SEE HOW CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY FELT. HERE HE IS LISTENING TO TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHEN I SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO UNDO THAT HARD-WON PROGRESS FOR THE 50th OR 60th TIME WITH BILLS THAT WOULD RAISE COSTS OR REDUCE COVERAGE OR ROLL BACK PROTECTIONS FOR OLDER AMERICANS OR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT IS AGGRAVATING.
Stephen: SIR, I KNOW YOU'RE FAMOUSLY EVEN KEELED, BUT AMERICANS ARE MORE THAN AGGRAVATED. I'M POURING BOURBON ON MY BREAKFAST, AND MY BREAKFAST IS SCOTCH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) UH-HUH. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID "OH, BOY I WISH HILLARY CLINTON WOULD JUST GO AWAY. JUST GO AWAY."
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THEY'D TAKE UP A COLLECTION AND SEND ME SOMEWHERE REALLY NICE.
Stephen: REALLY?
I WOULD CONSIDER IT. BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT.
I GET A CHANCE IT MEET HILLARY CLINTON, WHICH IS UNFATHOMABLE AND INCREDIBLE. AND I LOOK LIKE I'M NUDE.
Stephen: THIS IS-- THIS IS THE TWO OF THEM BACKSTAGE HOLDING UP THESE COMMEMORATIVE T-SHIRTS IN FRONT OF THEM. AND IT DOES-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT DOES LOOK LIKE YOU'RE TOPLESS. IT JUST CAME OUT THAT MUELLER REQUESTED DOCUMENTS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE RELATED TO 13 DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING INFORMATION, INCLUDING SOME OF THE BIGGEST STORIES SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. CLASSICS LIKE THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LAWYER: AND SO MUCH MORE. IT'S ALL COLLECTED HERE ON "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL COLLUSION, VOLUME 45." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO RELAX YOUR WAY. SO NOW WE'VE GOT IT-- DO I NEED TO DIVIDE THAT?
DIVIDE THAT IN HALF.
Stephen: DIVIDE THIS IN HALF, OKAY.
ROLL ONE OF THOSE INTO A BALL, YOUR FAVORITE PART, YEAH, YEAH, WITH YOUR HANDS-- LIGHTEN UP! STEPHEN, YOU'RE TOO TENSE, MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M TALKING ABOUT CHILLING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PENETRATION. ♪ OH, MY LOVE ♪
PINCH, PINCH.
MY FATHER WOULD GET ODD JOBS WRITING SOFT-CORE PORN AT DIME STORE NOVELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: ANYTHING I WOULD KNOW?
JUST THINGS. YOU KNOW, LIKE "SUPER DOLL" AND TURN THE OTHER CHIC" AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: "TURN THE OTHER CHEEK" IS THAT SOFT-CORE PORN WITH AN ARAB SHEIKH?
YES! DID YOU READ IT!
Stephen: NO.
