Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! "RUSSIA WEEK"! ( RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYING ) STEPHEN WELCOMES KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, CILLIAN MURPHY, JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," AND STEPHEN WITH THE LATE-NIGHT SPECIAL IN ST. PETERSBURG. LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! HOW ARE YA? THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ( PIANO RIFF ) THANKS, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW," I'M I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS, I KNOWATES COMEDY SHOW BUT I HAVE SOME SAD NEWS TONIGHT. AS OF 10:48 P.M. EASTERN LAST NIGHT, THE G.O.P. HEALTHCARE BILL WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD OF TERMINAL SUCKING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. I CLAP WHEN I'M HEART BROKEN, TOO. YOU COVER THE PAIN. IT WAS ALWAYS A LONGSHOT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL ONLY ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT ( LAUGHTER ) CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO DO EVERYTHING. THE FINAL BLOW WAS DELIVERED LAST NIGHT, WHEN UTAH SENATOR AND MAN FAILING TO GET ANYONE TO RAISE THE ROOF, MIKE LEE, AND KANSAS SENATOR AND GREY ALIEN WHO FOUND A CAN OF BRONZER, JERRY MORAN, RELEASED STATEMENTS OPPOSING THE BILL AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. IT WAS THE RARE SIMULTANEOUS NO-GASM. ( LAUGHTER ) IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE THE LEVEL OF FAILURE HERE. THE G.O.P. CRUSHED THEIR CAR AT 90 MILES AN HOUR INTO A CLIFF WITH A GRIN ON THEIR FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE IF BATMAN VS. SUPERMAN TOOK A PONTIAC AZTEK TO BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO TO RENT "THE LONE RANGER" AND WATCH IT ON LASER DISC. THAT'S HOW BADLY THEY FAILED. ( LAUGHTER ) REPUBLICANS SAID ONE THING FOR THE LAST FOUR ELECTIONS:
WE NEED TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.
REPEAL AND IMMEDIATELY REPLACE THE FAILURES OF OBAMACARE.
REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.
REPEAL OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT.
WE WILL REPEAL AND WE WILL REPLACE.
REPEAL OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT.
REPEAL AND REPLACE.
REPEAL AND REPLACE.
REPEAL AND REPLACE IT.
STEPHEN: IT WAS YOUR ONE JOB. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S YOUR TAGLINE, IT'S YOUR MOTTO, IT'S PAUL RYAN'S "REPEAL AND REPLACE" TRAMP STAMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) HE LOOKS GOOD.
Jon: GOT THAT FOOTAGE, BOY! ♪ OH, YEAH!♪  .
Stephen: LOOKS GOOD. AND IT WASN'T JUST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE, IT WAS ALSO THE CHUCKLEHEAD IN CHIEF.
THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, I'M GOING TO ASK CONGRESS TO PUT A BILL ON MY DESK  BECAUSE WE WILL TERMINATE OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT, BELIEVE ME, WITH SOMETHING GOOD. BELIEVE ME.
STEPHEN: I DON'T. ( LAUGHTER ) BELIEVE ME, I DON'T. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) NOT THEN, NOT NOW. NEVER! HEY, REMEMBER, TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN TRUMP AND THE G.O.P. THREW AN OLD WHITE GUY PARTY CELEBRATING WHEN THE HOUSE PASSED THEIR VERSION OF THE BILL. "GUYS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY CHICKENS. LET'S START COUNTING!" NOW, THAT CELEBRATION SEEMS ALMOST AS EMBARRASSING AS LYNDON JOHNSON'S "VICTORY IN VIETNAM" LUAU. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A GREAT BACKUP PLAN. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND MAN DESCRIBING THE SIZE OF HIS PROSTATE, MITCH MCCONNELL, CAN INTRODUCE A BILL SIMPLY REPEALING OBAMACARE WITH NO REPLACEMENT. YOU KNOW, JUST TAKE IT AWAY AND DON'T FIX IT. YOU KNOW, HOW WHEN YOUR CAR GETS A FLAT TIRE, YOU REMOVE IT, THEN CUT THE BRAKES AND LET IT ROLL INTO A CROWD OF UNINSURED OLD PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: TRUMP LIKES THE PLAN, TWEETING, "AS I HAVE ALWAYS SAID, LET OBAMACARE FAIL AND THEN COME TOGETHER AND DO A GREAT HEALTHCARE PLAN. STAY TUNED!" "YES, STAY TUNED." BECAUSE REPEALING YOUR HEALTHCARE IS THE HOTTEST NEW REALITY SHOW: NO SURVIVOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO IT'S DECIDED. THE WHOLE LEADERSHIP GOT TOGETHER AND DECIDED IT. THIS MORNING, THEY ANNOUNCED THEY'RE GOING TO REPEAL NOW AND REPLACE LATER. AND TONIGHT...IT'S DEAD. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, MITCH MCCONNELL CAN'T BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS. CAN WE GET A LOOK AT MITCH? NAH, HE LOOKS GOOD. THAT'S HIM HAPPY, I THINK.
Jon: WOW, WOW.
Stephen: THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO REMIND YOU THAT WHEN THEY KNEW BARACK OBAMA WOULD VETO IT, THE G.O.P. VOTED MORE THAN 60 TIMES TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. BUT NOW THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT, THEY DON'T HAVE THE BALLS. ALL THOSE TIMES THEY VOTED, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN YANKING THEIR OWN LEVER. BUT, NOW, WHEN THEY HAVE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, THEY CAN'T GET THEIR VOTE UP. SO TRUMPCARE IS DEADER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE IF TRUMPCARE PASSED, -- WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IF TrumpCare PASSED. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD SOME INTERESTING MATH TO TURN THIS INTO A WIN.
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, 48-4. THAT'S A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE VOTE BY ANY STANDARD... AND YET YOU HAVE A VOTE OF 48 TO 4 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND YOU NEED MORE? THAT'S PRETTY TOUGH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: 48 TO 4? THAT ADDS UP TO 52, NOT 100. YOU JUST IGNORED ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES. EVERYTHING'S A SUCCESS BY THAT LOGIC. "IF YOU JUST TAKE OUT THAT ONE ICEBERG, THE TITANIC HAD A FANTASTIC MAIDEN RUN. ( LAUGHTER ) FASTEST TRIP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN EVER. ALL RIGHT? TREMENDOUS BOAT." ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT PERHAPS THE BEST PART OF TRUMP'S REACTION WAS THIS REAL, ACTUAL SCREENGRAB FROM FOX NEWS WITH THE LOWER THIRD "TRUMP: EVENTUALLY WE WILL GET SOMETHING DONE." ( LAUGHTER ) SO, EVENTUALLY, WE WILL GET SOMETHING DONE. SO, ONCE AGAIN, IT'S TIME TO UPDATE THE HAT. EVENTUALLY SOMETHING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO ALL THEIR PLANS COME TO NAUGHT AND ALL THEIR LIES. THEY LIED TO THEIR VOTERS AND PEOPLE WHO TRUSTED THEM. SO THEY DON'T REPEAL AND REPLACE, AND REPEAL AND DELAY IS ALREADY DEAD. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN? WELL, TRUMP HAS ONE, TELLING REPORTERS THIS AFTERNOON --
I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY IN THAT POSITION WHERE WE'LL LET OBAMACARE FAIL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO OWN IT. I'M NOT GOING TO OWN IT.
Stephen: NO, NOT GOING TO OWN IT. VERY PRESIDENTIAL, EXPLAINS THE SIGN ON TRUMP'S DESK THAT SAYS "WHOSE BUCK IS THIS? I THINK OBAMA LEFT THIS HERE." ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, LIKE POLITICS, SHOW BUSINESS IS TOUGH. STARS RISE AND FALL, FRIENDS BECOME ENEMIES, NOBODY BUYS YOUR CONTEMPORARY COUNTRY ALBUM. IT'S PAINFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, RIGHT NOW, NO ONE KNOWS BETTER HOW CUTTHROAT SHOW BUSINESS CAN BE THAN THE MUPPETS. BECAUSE "KERMIT THE FROG AND DISNEY ARE SPARRING OVER THE PERFORMER'S UGLY 'MUPPET' FIRING." MAKES SENSE THAT THERE'D BE TROUBLE. I MEAN, KERMIT DOES COME TO WORK NAKED EVERY DAY. H.R. CAN'T LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BOTH SIDES ARE ANGRY. THE PERFORMER, STEVE WHITMIRE, CALLED HIS DISMISSAL A BETRAYAL AFTER A CAREER DEVOTED TO CARRYING ON THE LEGACY OF JIM HENSON. AND DISNEY FIRED BACK BY DESCRIBING WHITMIRE AS "HOSTILE TO CO-WORKERS AND OVERLY DIFFICULT." AND JIM HENSON'S DAUGHTER CHERYL SAID, "STEVE PERFORMED KERMIT AS A BITTER, ANGRY, DEPRESSED VICTIM." ( LAUGHTER ) SO HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO VOICE KERMIT THE FROG ANYMORE, BUT HE SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR SEAN SPICER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BITTER? SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THIS FIRING FOLLOWS FRAUGHT BUSINESS MEETINGS, WHERE THE KERMIT PERFORMER "PLAYED BRINKMANSHIP VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS." AND IT'S TRUE. IT GOT BAD. IN FACT, WE AT THE "LATE SHOW" HAVE ACTUALLY ACQUIRED FOOTAGE -- EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE -- OF KERMIT'S CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS.
GENTLEMEN, WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER A LONG TIME AND I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE ENTER THESE DELEGATE NEGOTIATION. I AM KERMIT KERMIT THE FREAKIN' FROG! I'LL MAKE A CONNECTION WITH MY FOOT TO YOUR AS! THIS COMES DOWN TO ONE QUESTION, DO I LOOK LIKE A PITCH? WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SCREW ME? LOOK INTO MY EYES. LOOK AT ME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, DON'T DO IT!
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. KEEGAN MICHAEL KEY IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'VE GOT MORE OF MY TRIP TO RUSSIA. WE TALK TO THE PEOPLE! STICK AROUND! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, MATTIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, FOLKS, WE'RE TERRIBLY EXCITED AROUND HERE BECAUSE IT IS DAY TWO OF "RUSSIA WEEK" AT "THE LATE SHOW." YESTERDAY, WE KICKED THINGS OFF BY SHOWING MY COLLUSION WITH A RUSSIAN LATE NIGHT HOST ON STATE RUN T.V. SO FAR, NOBODY HAS ASKED ME TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS, AND, I HAVE TO ADMIT, I'M A LITTLE HURT. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER CHRIS ORIGINALLY PITCHED THE IDEA OF US TRAVELING TO RUSSIA, I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE STORY WOULD'VE BLOWN OVER BY NOW. HA HA. ( LAUGHTER ) TURNS OUT, AMERICANS ARE MORE SUSPICIOUS OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT I WANTED TO HEAR WHAT EVERYDAY RUSSIANS THINK ABOUT THE SCANDAL. DO THEY BELIEVE RUSSIA TAMPERED WITH OUR ELECTION? AND WHAT DO THEY THINK ABOUT AMERICANS IN GENERAL? DO THEY LIKE US? DO THEY "LIKE" LIKE US? ( LAUGHTER ) IF SO, WHY HAVEN'T THEY ASKED US TO WINTER FORMAL YET? SO I TOOK TO THE STREETS OF ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA'S FORMER CAPITAL AND CURRENT WEIRDER PRAGUE TO TALK TO ORDINARY RUSSIANS. JIM?
STEPHEN: HACKING OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS. SECRET BACKCHANNELS. PEE PEE TAPES. THERE ARE A LOT OF ALLEGATIONS SWIRLING AROUND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. SO I FLEW TO ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA ON THE SUMMER SOLSTICE FOR THE WHITE NIGHTS FESTIVAL TO SEE HOW THE PEOPLE FELT ABOUT THOSE ACCUSATIONS AND TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND. HIGH FIVE! HIGH FIVE! HIGH FIVE! HIGH FIVE! HIGH FIVE! SUP? I'M STEPHEN.
MISHA, NICE TO MEET YOU.
STEPHEN: MAY I STROKE YOUR BEARD?
DO WHATEVER, UP TO YOU. THANK YOU.
STEPHEN: I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSE PRETTY FAST. OKAY, ARE YOU A HACKER?
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.
STEPHEN: YOU'RE NOT A HACKER. IF YOU WERE A HACKER, WOULD YOU ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A HACKER?
WELL, I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT.
STEPHEN: YOU WOULDN'T ADMIT IT IF YOU WERE? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THAT'S AS GOOD AS ADMITTING IT RIGHT NOW. I'M HERE WITH MARIA AND VITALY, AND THEY JUST GOT MARRIED. CONGRATULATIONS. I'M GOING TO GIVE EACH OF YOU A POTATO. I'M GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT AND, IF YOU AGREE, HOLD UP YOUR POTATO.
OKAY.
STEPHEN: PLEASE DO NOT EAT THE POTATO BECAUSE I WILL NEED THOSE BACK. DO YOU THINK THAT OFFICIALS IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION COLLABORATED WITH RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTION. NO POTATO, NO POTATO ON THAT ONE. OKAY, DO YOU THINK IT'S ALL JUST AMERICA BLAMING EVERYTHING ON THE RUSSIANS? UNANIMOUS POTATO, THAT'S THE RARE UNANIMOUS POTATO. ♪ ♪ WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT. WE HAVE RIVERFRONT DOUCHEBAGS WHERE I COME FROM, TOO! ALEXEI, BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING CAMOUFLAGE, I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOU AT SOME POINT DURING THIS INTERVIEW.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. I'M A VERY SMALL, STEALTHY PERSON.
STEPHEN: WHO'S TALKING? I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE, BUT I CAN'T SEE HIM! THE CAMOUFLAGE IS TOO GOOD! WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
I'M A MATHEMATICIAN.
STEPHEN: A MATHEMATICIAN. THAT'S A NATURAL FOR A HACKER. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT A HACKER?
QUITE SURE.
STEPHEN: QUITE SURE OR COMPLETELY SURE? ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TWO, HOW SURE ARE YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT A HACKER?
WELL, TWO IS...UHH?
STEPHEN: TWO IS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A COMPUTER IS. ONE IS, YEAH I DID IT, I'M A HACKER.
WELL, OH, MAYBE FOUR.
STEPHEN: FOUR? THAT'S OFF THE SCALE. THAT'S NOT IN MY SCALE. THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HAVE ADDED A FOUR TO MY SCALE IS IF YOU HACKED IT. SHOW OF POTATOES -- HAVE YOU HEARD OF DONALD TRUMP? WE HAVE POTATOES. OKAY. WOULD YOUR POTATO BE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN DONALD TRUMP? ( LAUGHTER ) HALF A POTATO-- WE'RE GOING HALF A POTATO ON THAT ONE. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD A BORDER WALL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU GUYS BUILT A REALLY GOOD ONE IN BERLIN, AND YOU'RE NOT USING IT ANYMORE, CAN WE HAVE IT?
NO, I THINK THE GERMAN TOOK IT.
STEPHEN: THE GERMANS TOOK IT? THAT'S SO LIKE THEM. SHOW OF POTATOES-- DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT PUTIN, HAS INFLUENCE OVER OUR PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP? I'M GONNA GO POTATO. DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
YEAH I KNOW. MAY I...
STEPHEN: WHO AM I? WHO AM I?
YOU ARE VERY COOL GUY FROM U.S.A.
STEPHEN: DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
JIMMY COLBERT?
STEPHEN: IT'S IVAN AND JIMMY COLBERT! ( APPLAUSE ) BEFORE I LEFT, THERE WAS ONE LAST THING I HAD TO DO. I'LL HAVE ONE CORN PLEASE-- ONE. AND IF YOU HAVE IT, I'LL ALSO TAKE THE PEE-PEE TAPE. ( JAZZ PLAYING ) THIS IS A GAME THEY PLAY HERE IN THE SUMMERTIME. THIS IS CALLED "GUESS THE JAZZ MAN." WHERE A FAMOUS JAZZ MUSICIAN, HIDES BEHIND A WOK, I THINK IT'S JOHN COLTRANE. I LOVE RUSSIA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, ST. PETERSBURG! JOIN US TOMORROW FOR MY INTERVIEW WITH A REAL-LIFE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH, MIKHAIL PROKHOROV. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KEEGAN- MICHAEL KEY. STICK AROUND! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM THE COMEDY SERIES KEY & PEELE. HE'S NOW ONSTAGE IN "HAMLET." PLEASE WELCOME, KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
JIMMY COLBERT! STEPHEN FALLON! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER AROUND TOWN BUT WE'VE NOT SAT DOWN IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY SINCE LAST SUMMER.
SINCE LAST SUMMER, YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE ON ONE OF OUR LIVE CONVENTION SHOWS, THE G.O.P.
THAT'S RIGHT, YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE DONALD TRUMP'S ONE BLACK DELEGATE.
ONE BLACK DELEGATE, YES. AND I THINK I WAS FROM SOMEPLACE CRAZY LIKE MAINE, OR WISCONSIN.
Stephen: EXACTLY. AND YOU GOT ARRESTED. AND HOW HAS THE YEAR BEEN? HOW HAS THE YEAR BEEN FOR YOU?
THE YEAR'S BEEN VERY GOOD. I MEAN, I SPENT IS IT MAJORITY OF IT IN A DEEP FOG, IN A PROFOUND DEPRESSION. NO, WE WERE WORKING ON "FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE" WHEN THE ELECTION HAPPENED.
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR NETFLIX SERIES.
THE NETFLIX SERIES I'M ON NOW. WHAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE END OF THAT DAY WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE WERE SHOOTING, IT WAS SO FUNNY, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE, LIKE, LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM. AND, CUT, AND EVERYONE WOULD RUN TO A TV AND WATCH THE TV. NO, WHAT -- IS THIS FICTION? WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE WATCHING! YOU WOULD BE LITERALLY IN A SCENE ACTING AND SOMEBODY WOULD WHISPER, HE JUST WON NORTH CAROLINA! WHILE YOU'RE IN THE SCENE, I LOVE YOU SO -- HUH? I LOVE YOU --
Stephen: AND HE'S STANDING OVER THERE GOING, HE JUST WON NORTH CAROLINA! I FIND JUST CRYING ON AIR HELPS.
YES.
Stephen: JUST LET IT OUT. IT'S FOR EVERYBODY.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. WHAT A PRIVILEGE AND HONOR IT IS TO BE IN "HAMLET."
ABSOLUTELY? YOU'RE IN "HAMLET" AT THE PUBLIC THEATER, YOU'RE PLAYING HORATIO, WHICH IS HAMLET'S BUDDY.
HIS BEST FRIEND, YES. I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO IS SAYING, REALLY, THAT AMAZINGLY FUNNY GUY IS DOING THE TRAGEDY. WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO TRAGEDY BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GUYS I KNOW.
IT'S FUNNY. MY ENTIRE CAREER --
Stephen: NO, ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION. WATER IS FOR CLOSERS. I'M SORRY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
IT'S ABC, NOT ABD! ALWAYS BE CLOSING, NOT ALWAYS BE DRINKING! GET IT TOGETHER! I WAS A DRAMATICALLY-TRAINED ACTOR, A SHAKESPEAREAN-TRAINED ACTOR AND THAT WAS ALWAYS THE PLAN, AND MY CAREER WENT ON A 19-YEAR DETOUR INTO SKETCH COMEDY.
Stephen: WOW. I'VE WANTED TO PLAY HORATIO FOR ABOUT 23 YEARS. WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL I REMEMBER SEEING THE BIG HAMLET IN THE MOVIE THEATERS AND I WANTED TO PLAY HORATIO SO BAD.
Stephen: YOU TINTED WANT TO PLAY HAMLET?
I LIKE TO KEEP MY EXPECTATIONS RIGHT HERE SO THERE'S NO DISAPPOINTMENT.
Stephen: AT A CERTAIN POINT DID YOU THINK I'LL NEVER GET BACK THERE BECAUSE I'M A COMEDY GUY?
I DID. THE TEAM HAS MADE A REAL EFFORT TO TURN THE SHIP BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NEE. JORDAN PEELE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE IN THIS ENDEAVOR. HE'S, LIKE, GO GET YOUR DRAMA ON, BRO! GET YOUR DRAMA ON! THAT'S HOW JORDAN TALKS, GET YOUR DRAMA ON! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO YOU'RE DOING IT WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED OSCAR ISAACS.
YES.
Stephen: WHO IS JUILLIARD-TRAINED.
YES. COULD I GO ON RECORD WITH THE JUILLIARD, STEPHEN. HE WENT TO JUILLIARD AND GOT HIS LITTLE DEGREE. I HAVE A MASTERS DEGREE! I HAVE A MASTERS DEGREE! I HAVE A MASTERS DEGREE IN THEATER! I LEARNED A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF IN SCHOOL AND THEY ONLY LEARNED ACTING!
Stephen: WOW, YOU'RE A MASTER IN ACTING.
I'M A MASTER IN FINE ARTS AND ACTING. NO, BUT HE'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN I. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: PRINCE HAMLET HAS WHAT WE AND THOSE IN SHAKESPEARE CIRCLES HAS (BLEEP).
OSCAR IS SO GOOD AT MAKING EVERYTHING REALLY CLEAR. IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HAMLET, THIS WOULD BE THE PRODUCTION TO SEE BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE IS SO ACCESSIBLE WHEN HE SAYS IT. I GET A LITTEN ENVIOUS HE GETS THESE MONOLOGUES, AND I ENJOY THEM, BUT HE ALSO MAKES THEM VERY FUNNY. IT'S THE FUNNIEST PRODUCTION OF HAMLET YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THERE IS LOTS OF COMEDY IN HAMLET. PEOPLE THINK THERE ISN'T. YOU GO, WHY AM I LAUGHING? BECAUSE HE'S SO WITTY NORTHBOUND HUMOROUS AND THAT'S PART OF THE APPEAL.
Stephen: HAMLET IS SMARTER THAN EVERYBODY AROUND HIM.
EVERYBODY AROUND HIM. HE'S A MORALLY KIND OF AMBIGUOUS CHARACTER AT TIMES, BUT HE'S SO WITTY. HE'S MUCH LIKE A YOUNG AND IMPEACHOUS STEPHEN COLBERT. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, BUT HE'S GREAT. I MISS THE MONOLOGUES.
Stephen: HORATIO HAS MONOLOGUES.
HE HAS A FEW MOMENTS. THERE'S A GREAT MOMENT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PLAY WHEN THE GHOST OF HAMLET'S FATHER LEAVES AND HORATIO AND FRIENDS SEE HIM AND HE TAKES OFF. HE SEES THE SUN COME UP AND GETS SCARED AND HAS TO GO BACK TO PURGATORY. SO I USED TO HAVE A SPEECH WHERE --
Stephen: USED TO? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I HAD THIS SPEECH AND IT STARTED AS A GUILTY THING UPON A FEARFUL SUMMONS. I HEARD HIM AND IN THE SEA AND FIRE ON EARTH AND AIR THE EXTRAVAGANT SPIRIT ADDS TO THE CONFINED AND ADDS TO TRUTH HEREIN THIS OBJECT MADE PROBATION. AND THE DIRECTOR SAID, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE GOING TO CUT THAT. I WAS, LIKE, I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT IT MEANT!
Stephen: THERE ARE SO MANY AMAZING QUOTES, LINES, PHRASES THAT COME FROM HAMLET.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE, LIKE --
DO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE. WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE'S TO THE MANNER BORN. THE LADY DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH, WE THINK. KNOCK, KNOCK, WHO'S THERE -- THAT'S LITERALLY FROM MACBETH. WEAR YOUR HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE IS FROM ATHEMO. I DON'T KNOWCRATY BUT I KNOW CRAZY, JAMES BROWN. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, THAT'S A VERY LITERATE JAMES BROWN. THERE IS, OF COURSE, TO THE WINDOW, TO THE WALL, TO THE SWEAT DROP FROM MY (BLEEP), YEP, I THINK THAT'S IN HENRY THE 5th.
Stephen: RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO TO THE BREACH.
RIGHT BEFORE ST. CHRISPIN'S DAY. SHE WAS BLEEDING OUT OF HER EYES, SHE WAS BLEEDING OUT OF HER WHATEVER.
Stephen: SHAKESPEARE. IT WASN'T SHAKESPEARE. IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S VLADIMIR PUTIN. THAT'S WHO IT WAS.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
OR SOMEBODY WHO WORKS FOR HIM.
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE, YOUR SERIES ON NETFLIX YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. I UNDERSTAND YOU BROUGHT A CLIP HERE TODAY AND IT'S ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AFTER --
TEN OR 15 YEARS. SINCE THEY GRADUATED IN COLLEGE, THEY'RE EITHER 40 OR RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF 40 AND ALL LIVING TOGETHER BACK IN NEW YORK CITY, AND THE CLIP WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE IS A CLIP WITH ME AND FRED SAVAGE. I PLAY AN AUTHOR AND FRED SAVAGE IS HIS AGENT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS FOR A NEW Y.A. NOVEL AND THEY'RE SPEAKING TO A YOUNG LADY WHO'S PART OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS, WHAT WOULD APPEAL TO YOU.
Stephen: OKAY. JIM?
I'M (BLEEP) FRANKENSTEIN. WHAT IF HE'S A HODGEPODGE OF SEXY BODY PARTS? CHANNING TATUM.
ALL RIGHT, CHANNING TATUM. I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL. STEPHEN COLBERT, THOUGH. WHAT? HE'S, LIKE, THE MOST NORMAL VERSION OF EVERY PART OF A PERSON.
WHAT PART OF I (BLEEP) STEPHEN COLBERT AREN'T YOU GETTING?
YOU'RE AN OUTLIER IN YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT SHOW! THAT'S A DAMN GOOD SHOW AS FAR AS I COULD TELL! ( LAUGHTER ) DID SHE WRITE THAT IN JUST TO PLAY ON THE SHOW TONIGHT?
WE FILMED THAT CLIP JUST FOR TODAY.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. BACK WITH MORE KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )( BAND PL
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND THE MAGNIFICENT KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY! LISTEN, MAN, I MISS SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU AND JORDAN DO TOGETHER. WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH DONALD TRUMP.
YES, I KNOW YOU ARE.
Stephen: AND IS HE FUN FOR YOU?
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE IT'S HARD WHEN A PERSON IS THE MOST IDEAL COMIC VERSION OF THEMSELVES. IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO GO, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE FUNNY -- OH, HE JUST DID THAT? HE DID IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE WOULD NEVER DO -- OH, HE DID THAT AS WELL? IT'S REALLY HARD TO CATCH UP.
Stephen: IT'S HARD TO LEAPFROG THAT.
IT'S HARD TO LEAPFROG THE COMEDY CALVE SAID THAT'S HIM ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T GET CRAZIER FROM THAT.
WE'VE GONE FROM THE RIDICULOUS TO THE SUE BRIM AND BACK TO THE RIDICULOUS.
Stephen: SPEAK TO HAVE THE SUBLIME, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS VERY MEASURED.
LEADS A VERY CONSIDERED LIFE.
Stephen: EXACTLY. AND YOU PLAYED LUTHER FOR MANY YEARS, OBAMA'S ANGRY TRANSLATOR.
I DID. YES, I DID.
Stephen: IF YOU DON'T MIND, I GOT YA RIGHT HERE, THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA SINCE HE LEFT OFFICE, LITERALLY JUST A COUPLE OF SENTENCES OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT POLICY. I WAS WONDERING WHETHER I COULD READ WHAT OBAMA HAS SAID AND LUTHER COULD TRANSLATE THAT FOR ALL OF US?
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO BE FEELING SOMETHING.
THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING BREWING UP IN LUTHER.
Stephen: READY? YEAH.
Stephen: THIS WAS ON JUNE 22nd.
YEP, MM-HMM.
Stephen: THIS IS A PLEA TO SAVE HEALTHCARE ON FACEBOOK. HE SAID, SIMPLY PUT, IF THERE'S A CHANCE YOU MIGHT GET SICK, GET OLD OR START A FAMILY, THIS BILL WILL DO YOU HARM.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) COME ON PEOPLE, TRUMP CARE? MORE LIKE TRUMP DON'T CARE. DON, T, CARE. DON'T CARE. I FOUGHT FOR THE A.C.A. TO HELP PEOPLE. I ALSO SPENT A YEAR IN OPEN BIPARTISAN SESSIONS, AND EVERYBODY HAD A SAY. ALL THE REPUBLICANS, ALL THE DEMOCRATS! SO WHAT YAWL HIDING, HUH? NOW WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE 'CAUSE Y'ALL DON'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE THAT YOU JUST COOPED IN A DUNGEON OVER A KETTLE MAKING UP A POTION WITH BAT WING AND EYE OF NEWT? Y'ALL GONNA KILL SOME PEOPLE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU RUNNING OUT OF HELP. 'CAUSE MOST FOLKS WANT THIS COUNTRY TO STILL HAVE PEOPLE "LIVING" IN IT. I WOULD SAY, "YOU PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK" BUT I CAN'T AFFORD THAT 'CAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE NO DAMN HEALTH INSURANCE. ( BLEEP ). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ON MAY 25 -- ( LAUGHTER ) IS HE STILL HERE? IS HE STILL HERE?
HE'S STILL HERE.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD. ON MAY 25 IN GERMANY, IN AN EVENT WITH ANGELA MERKEL, HE SAID IN THIS NEW WORLD WE LIVE IN, WE CAN'T ISOLATE OURSELVES, WE CAN'T HIDE BEHIND A WALL.
I SPENT 8 YEARS TEARING DOWN WALLS. AND THIS MOTHER ( BLEEP ) WANTS TO PUT UP A WALL? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I MEAN -- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? OBAMA'S TRYING TO BREAK 'EM DOWN AND HE'S TRYING TO PUT 'EM UP! AND NOW HE WANTS TO MAKE IT SEE THROUGH SO WHEN PEOPLE THROW 60 POUND BAGS OF DRUGS OVER THE WALL YOU WON'T GET HIT ON THE HEAD. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT THE (BLEEP) IS THAT?! I SEEN A LOT OF MOVIES FROM THE '80S AND AIN'T NEVER SEEN NOBODY DIED FROM A HEAD INJURY. LET ME SEE, SCARFACE-- NOPE, LESS THAN ZERO-- NOPE. CHEECH AND CHONG? DRUGS, YES. BUT HEAD INJURIES? NO. NO. NO. AND 60 POUNDS, WHO THEY GOT THROWING THESE THINGS? WHAT, JON CENA GOT A MEXICAN COUSIN? JUST BACK THERE CHUCKING BAGS?

HEY, I THOUGHT I WAS ON A FORCED RETIREMENT. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE OBAMA STILL NEEDS ME. AND I AM BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LUTHER! HAMLET IS AT THE PUBLIC THEATER. "FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE" ON NETFLIX. KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE BACK WITH CILLIAN MURPHY! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."
THANK YOU.
Stephen: MEE NICE TO MEET YOU YOU, TOO.
Stephen: I'M A FAN OF YOUR WORK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: I DID NOT KNOW YOU'RE IRISH.
OH, REALLY?
Stephen: YOUR AMERICAN ACCENT WAS SO GOOD YOU FOOLED ME.
THANK YOU INTO CAN YOU BE FOOLED BY PEOPLE DOING AN IRISH ACCENT?
OCCASIONALLY, YEAH. I GUESS, YEAH.
Stephen: BUT MOST OF THE TIME NOT?
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SUCCESSFUL IRISH ACCENTS I GUESS IN THE COURSE OF CINEMA HISTORY.
Stephen: LUCKY CHARMS GUY, OBVIOUSLY.
OBVIOUSLY IS THAT DO YOU GET LUCKY CHARMS IN IRELAND?
LUCKY CHARMS DON'T EXIST IN IRELAND.
Stephen: THE LEPRECHAUNS HIDE THEM FROM YOU.
YEAH.
Stephen: THE TRIX RABBIT? I DON'T KNOW HIM.
Stephen: WHO WOULD DO A BETTER IRISH ACCENT. ARE YOU WILLING TO NAME NAMES.
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL LIVE IN IRELAND?
I LOVED IN LONDON THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND WE MOVED BACK TO DUBLIN.
Stephen: NICE TOWN. WE JUST WENT THERE.
ARE YOU IRISH?
Stephen: ALL IRISH. COLBERT, I DON'T PRONOUNCE THE "T" TO SOUND MORE PRETENTIOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) ACTUAL CATHOLIC EDUCATION?
YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO TAKE LATIN.
DID THAT FOR ONE YEAR.
Stephen: DIDN'T TAKE? NOT REALLY, NOPE.
Stephen: DID YOU STUDY OVER THERE? DID YOU STUDY AT THE GATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NEVER STUDIED AS AN ACTOR. STARTED OFF DOING THEATER.
Stephen: I THOUGHT YOU HAD A BAND TO START OFF.
YEAH, I HAVE A FAILED CAREER AS A MUSICIAN.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I REALLY WANTED TO BE A MUSICIAN FOR YEARS AND YEARS, AND THEN THE THEATER JUST BECAME MORE, I SUPPOSE, LIKE THAT WAS THE FORM OF EXPRESSION THAT BECAME MORE RELEVANT OR WHATEVER.
Stephen: WHEN SPHWROAG GROWING UP, DID YOU SING TRADITIONAL IRISH TUNES, BALLADS AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
NOT REALLY.
Stephen: THAT'S THE STEREOTYPE.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE DOWN AT THE PUB SINGING.
YEAH, WE WERE DOWN TO THE PUB, NOT NECESSARILY SINGING. JUST DRINKING.
Stephen: WELL, THE NEW MOVIE "DUNKIRK" IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW IT. STRANGELY ENOUGH, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THIS STORY. IF WE CAN PUT A MAP UP HERE, JIM. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BATTLE OF DUNKIRK? YOU CAN SEE IT BEHIND YOU.
OH, BEHIND ME. YEAH WOW, YOU'RE PUT MEG ON THE SPOT HERE. WELL, IT'S BEFORE AMERICA CAME INTO THE WAR, IT'S 1940, AND IT'S BASICALLY A RETREAT, AN EHAVING WEIGHS, AND THERE'S LIKE 400,000 MEN ON THE BEACH IN DUNKIRK.
Stephen: THE BRITISH FORCES ARE TRAPPED.
EXACTLY. THEY HAVE BEEN PICKED OFF FROM THE SKY BY THE GERMAN AIR FORCE.
Stephen: AND IF THIS FORCE IS DEFEATED, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR ENGLAND?
IF IT HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY, WE WOULD ALL LIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT SOCIETY TODAY. THAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY, AND IT HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN DEALT IN MODERN CINEMA. THERE'S A FILM WITH JOHN MILLS AND DICK ATENBERG BUT RECENTLY NOT BEEN DEALT WITH, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: AND ONE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS IS PEOPLE USE THEIR ORDINARY BOATS.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOT NAVAL VESSELS BECAUSE IT WAS SHALLOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO THE NAVAL VESSELS COULDN'T PICK PEOPLE UP SO ORDINARY PEOPLE WENT OUT IN THEIR BOATS.
THAT'S THE THING THAT MAKES IT SO EXTRAORDINARY IN TERMS OF MILITARY HISTORY IS THAT THE DESTROYERS COULDN'T GET IN BECAUSE THE WATER WAS SO SHALLOW, SO ALL THESE, LIKE, NORMALCY VILIAN PEOPLE TOOK THEIR HOLIDAY VESSELS AND WENT OVER AND PICKED THESE GUYS UP. THEY GOT 300-PLUS THOUSAND SOLDIERS OFF THE BEACH.
Stephen: AND ONLY 26 MILES FROM DOVER TO DUNKIRK.
THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH COULD SEE ENGLAND BUT COULDN'T GET TO IT.
YEAH, IT WAS A CRAZY TIME.
Stephen: NOW YOU PLAY A BRITISH SERVICEMEMBER WHO IS FLOATING IN THE CHANNEL, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: GETS PICKED UP. WHAT'S THE CLIP WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE?
SO MY CHARACTER, WE SEE HIM AFTER SOME SORT OF UNKNOWN CATASTROPHE AND HE'S SITTING INSIDE THE HULL OF, LIKE, A BORDER SECURITY AND THEN HE'S PICKED UP BY THIS VESSEL CALLED THE MOON STONER, AND MARK IS THE CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT, AND HE'S PICKED UP AND REALIZES QUICKLY THAT RATHER THAN GOING HOME HE'S GOING BACK INTO DUNKIRK AND HE'S PRETTY MESSED UP.
Stephen: JIM? WE HAVEN'T TURNED AROUND.  A JOB TO DO. A JOB -- THIS IS A PLEASURE YACHT. YOU'RE WEEKEND SAILORS, NOT THE BLOODY NAVY, AND A MAN YOUR AGE.
MEN MY AGE DICTATE THIS WORLD, WHY SHOULD WE BE ALLOWED TO SEND OUR CHILDREN TO FIGHT IT?
YOU SHOULD BE AT HOME! THERE WON'T BE ANY HOME IF WE ALLOW THEM TO CROSS THE CHANNEL.
Stephen: A LOVELY MOVIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen:
STEPHEN: "DUNKIRK" OPENS THIS FRIDAY, CILLIAN MURPHY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
