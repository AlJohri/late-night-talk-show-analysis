DOCTOR LECTER, MY NAME IS CLARICE STARLING. MAY I SPEAK TO YOU?
YOU'RE ONE OF ROBERT MUELLER'S, AREN'T YOU?
I AM.
MAY I SEE YOUR CREDENTIALS?  (  LAUGHTER  ) IMPRESSIVE. SAM'S CLUB CARD.
I LIKE TO BUY MY HAND LOTION IN BULK. IT PUTS THE NIVEA ON THE SKIN.  (  LAUGHTER  )
YOU'RE WEARING LAVENDER AND PEACH BLOSSOM PERFUME.
NO, SIR. I THINK THAT'S THE GLADE PLUG-IN YOU'RE SMELLING.  (  LAUGHTER  )
AH, YES, FRESHNESS ALL DAY. STILL HUNTING PRESIDENT TRUMP?
DO YOU KNOW HIM?
I DO. WE WERE GOLFING BUDDIES ONCE. WE ATE OUR CADDY, TURNED HIM INTO A TACO BOWL WITH A NICE DIET COKE. PF-PF-PF-PF-PF.
DOCTOR, WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE PRESIDENT?
YOU ALREADY HAVE THE ANSWERS. WHAT IS HIS NATURE? WHAT DOES HE DO, THIS MAN YOU SEEK?
HE'S-- HE'S AN IDIOT WHO SAYS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND.
NO, THAT IS INCIDENTAL. QUID PRO QUO, CLARICE. TELL ME YOUR WORST MEMORY OF THE ELECTION.
ONE NIGHT, ON A TUESDAY, DONALD TRUMP WON THE PRESIDENCY, AND THEN I HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. IT SOUNDED LIKE A SCREAM, LIKE SOME KIND OF SCREAMING...
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I CREPT INTO THE LIVING ROOM. THE TV WAS ON. I WAS SO SCARED. SO SCARED. MSNBC, THE ANCHORS, THEY WERE CRYING. THEY WERE CRYING.  (  LAUGHTER  )
THANK YOU, CLARICE.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN, DOCTOR, QUID PRO QUO. WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE ON DONALD TRUMP SO FAR?
THE 12 INDICTMENTS AGAINST MANAFORT AND GATES. MICHAEL FLYNN PLEADING GUILTY. KREMLIN INTERMEDIARIES REACHING OUT TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THE MEETING BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP JR. AND THE RUSSIAN LAWYER. THE MESSAGES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP JR. AND WIKILEAKS. TRUMP CALLING ON RUSSIA TO FIND CLINTON'S MISSING EMAILS.
WAIT, WHAT? SERIOUSLY. YOU HAVE ALL THAT ALREADY? WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR?
I WANT TO COME IN THERE WITH YOU.  (  LAUGHTER  )
YOU KNOW I EAT PEOPLE, RIGHT? IT'S KIND OF MY THING.
YEAH, BUT IT SEEMS SAFER IN THERE THAN IT DOES OUT HERE.  (  LAUGHTER  )
VERY WELL. CAN I EAT YOUR KIDNEY?
I GOT TWO. I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.
OKAY, GREAT, I'LL FIRE UP THE GRILL!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TRUFLT OF TRUMP VRLS INTELLIGENCE. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES JODIE FOSTER WITH A SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY TOM HANKS. AND RUN THE JEWELS FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU! HEY, EVERYBODY! PLEASE, YOU'RE VERY KIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. VERY NICE, VERY NICE GROUP OF PEOPLE. HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. DOESN'T IT FEEL GREAT?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GETTING SO CLOSE. GETTING CLOSE TO THE END OF THE YEAR. AND EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON THEIR RESOLUTIONS. MINE IS FOR AMERICA TO KNUCKLE DOWN AND MAKE PICK OUR OWN PRESIDENT NEXT TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DONALD TRUMP-- DONALD TRUMP-- DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO DENY ANY RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION. NOW, "THE WASHINGTON POST" PUBLISHED A MASSIVE ARTICLE YESTERDAY, AND WE LEARNED THAT IN JANUARY TRUMP'S ADVISERS BEGGED HIM TO ACCEPT THE FINDINGS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE. AS ONE AIDE REMEMBERS, "THIS WAS PART OF THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS. THERE WAS A BIG EFFORT TO GET HIM TO BE A STANDARD PRESIDENT." GOOD LUCK.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO ACCEPT THAT RUSSIA HACKED THE ELECTION, SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO ACCEPT WHO WON THE CIVIL WAR. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE. I'M NOT SURE. BUT TRUMP IS FAR FROM STANDARD. HE'S ONE OF A KIND. THOUGH, I WILL SAY, ERIC DOES LOOK KIND OF LIKE A FAILED CLONE, MAYBE SOMEONE SPILLED A LITTLE BLEACH IN THE PETRI DISH. AFTER TRUMP WAS TOLD HIS OWN CABINET MEMBERS HAD ALREADY BACKED THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT, "TRUMP SHOT BACK, 'SO WHAT?' ADMITTING THAT THE KREMLIN HAD HACKED DEMOCRATIC PARTY EMAILS, HE SAID, WAS A "TRAP." AND MITCH McCONNELL AGREED.
IT'S A TRAP!  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH. GOT TO. GOT TO. HE LOOKS GOOD! I GOTTA SAY, HE LOOKS GOOD.
Jon: HE LOOKS GOOD.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. HE GOT A TAN SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. AND NEARLY A YEAR INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, TRUMP HAS NEVER CONVENED A CABINET-LEVEL MEETING ON RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE OR WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT-- THOUGH, HE AND MICHAEL FLYNN DID GET TOGETHER TO SHOP FOR THANK YOU CARDS. I'VE GOT ONE RIGHT HERE. "THANK YOU FOR 'PUTIN' ME IN OFFICE."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NICE. THAT'S VERY NICE. "THE POST" ARTICLE ALSO CLAIMS THAT PRIVATELY, VLADIMIR PUTIN IS THRILLED. FOR ONE, IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE WHOLE PLAN COST LESS THAN $500,000 TO EXECUTE. THAT IS NOTHING TO HIM. PUTIN IS REPORTEDLY THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD. HE SPENDS MORE THAN THAT ON CHEST WAX AND NIPPLE SHARPENERS.  (  LAUGHTER  ) , OF COURSE,-- HE CAN KILL YOU WITH HIS NIPPLE. DON'T-- DON'T-- DON'T THINK THAT'S NOT TRUE. OF COURSE, THERE MAY BE A REASON TRUMP DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PRESERVING OUR DEMOCRACY. IT'S THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO VOTE. SEE LAST MONTH IN NEW YORK, HERE IN THE CITY, WE HAD AN ELECTION FOR MAYOR, AND THE PRESIDENT VOTED ABSENTEE, BUT HIS BALLOT DID NOT COUNT BECAUSE HE GOT HIS OWN BIRTHDAY WRONG. "I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I WAS BORN. I DEMAND THAT I RELEASE MY LONG-FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE. I THINK I WAS BORN IN KENYA. THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING. PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME. IT'S GOT TO BE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I-- I GOT-- I DON'T-- I-- I-- I--" NO IDEA IF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT. NOW, HERE'S THE THING, TRUMP WAS BORN ON JUNE 14, 1946, BUT HIS BALLOT APPLICATION LISTS HISSING ABOUT THE AS JULY. SO HE MADE HIMSELF A FULL MONTH YOUNGER. WATCH OUT, LADIES! SERIOUSLY, WATCH OUT. HE'S A MONSTER. DON'T GO NEAR HIM. HE'LL GRAB YOU.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT HERE'S THE CRAZY THING: TRUMP ISN'T THE ONLY MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO VOTE BECAUSE MELANIA, IVANKA, AND JARED'S MAYORAL ELECTION VOTES ALSO DID NOT COUNT BECAUSE MELANIA INCORRECTLY WROTE IN HER ADDRESS. UNDER "COUNTY," THE FIRST LADY WROTE IN "U.S.A." RATHER THAN "NEW YORK." SHE THEN FAILED TO SIGN THE INNER ENVELOPE-- NOT TO MENTION WHAT SHE PUT ON THE OUTER EVELOPE.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) LIKE THOSE NOTES YOU GET IN CHINESE TOYS. AND IVANKA DID NOT MAIL HER BALLOT UNTIL ELECTION DAY. "I'M SURE THEY'LL GET IT IN TIME, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MAIL WORKS." I MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DO AN IMPRESSION OF HER, NONE AT ALL. AS FOR JARED KUSHNER, HE "FAILED TO EVEN BOTHER TO SEND HIS IN." IT'S TOO BAD. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS LAST CHANCE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T LET YOU VOTE FROM PRISON.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO THAT? I DON'T THINK THEY DO.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THEY DO.
Stephen: OF COURSE, THE HOLIDAYS ARE UPON US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS IS CHRISTMAS MOVIES, WHETHER IS CHRISTMAS MOVIES, WHETHER IT'S "MIRACLE ON 34th STREET," OR "A CHRISTMAS STORY," OR MARTIN SCORSESE'S "SHUTTER ISLAND." THEY NEVER EXPLICITLY SAY IT DOESN'T TAKE PLACE DURING CHRISTMAS. AND IN RECENT YEARS, THERE'S BEEN A SLEW OF NEW CHRISTMAS CINEMA. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ROMANTIC TV MOVIES PUT OUT BY LIFETIME AND HALLMARK WITH TITLES LIKE "HITCHED FOR THE HOLIDAYS," "12 DATES OF CHRISTMAS," "A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS," "A BRIDE FOR CHRISTMAS," AND "A BOYFRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS." IF YOU WATCH THEM ALL IN A ROW, YOU MIGHT NEED "A LOBOTOMY FOR CHRISTMAS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR BINGE BECAUSE NETFLIX HAD A VIRAL TWEET ABOUT THEIR OWN FILM, WRITING, "TO THE 53 PEOPLE WHO'VE WATCHED 'A CHRISTMAS PRINCE' EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST 18 DAYS: WHO HURT YOU?"  (  LAUGHTER  ) THEY-- THEY-- THAT'S-- THAT IS-- THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THEY WATCH EVERYTHING WE DO. BUT I MEAN, I GET IT. IT WOULD BE CRAZY FOR SOMEONE TO WATCH "A CHRISTMAS PRINCE" EVERY DAY. I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU NEED TO SEE THE STORY OF AMBER, A CAREER-ORIENTED YOUNG JOURNALIST WHO TRAVELS TO THE EUROPEAN NATION OF ALDOVIA AND GOES UNDERCOVER AS A TUTOR FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY'S YOUNG DAUGHTER, ONLY TO FIND HERSELF FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE MISUNDERSTOOD AND SENSITIVE PRINCE WHO SHE LOVES FOR WHO HE IS, UNLIKE THAT AMBITIOUS LADY SOFIA. AND, OH, MY GOD, IT'S MAKEOVER TIME! AND AMBER LOOKS SO GORGEOUS IN HER BALL GOWN, BUT OF COURSE SHE'S WEARING SNEAKERS UNDERNEATH BECAUSE SHE'S STILL A LITTLE BIT ROCK 'N' ROLL. AND THEN THE CHRISTMAS PRINCE FINDS OUT SHE'S REALLY A JOURNALIST, AND SHE GETS CAUGHT UP IN ALDOVIA'S BITTER SUCCESSION SCANDAL, WHICH IS THE STORY OF THE CENTURY. BUT SHE CAN'T USE THE CHRISTMAS PRINCE TO FURTHER HER CAREER, AND IT'S, LIKE, WILL SHE CHOOSE HER JOB OR THE CHRISTMAS PRINCE OR CAN SHE HAVE IT ALL?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ MY HEART IS RACING. YOU CAN'T-- YOU'D HAVE TO BE CRAZY TO BE OBSESSED WITH THAT. BUT THE NETFLIX TWEET WENT VIRAL, SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE OTHER BIG COMPANIES START USING OUR INFORMATION TO MAKE FUN OF US. PRETTY SOON, WE'LL GET A TWEET FROM AMAZON THAT SAYS, "DAVE JOHNSON OF EAU CLAIRE, WISCONSIN, JUST ORDERED A SUBPAR LEAF BLOWER. WHAT A DINGUS."

THAT'S A NICE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: THEY ARE A LOVELY AUDIENCE.
NOT LIKE SOME OF THOSE OTHER PLACE S.
Stephen:  OH, NO, NO, THIS IS THE BEST AUDIENCE IN TELEVISION RIGHT HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
WOW.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. IT'S LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
OH, MY GOSH, SO MUCH FUN. I'M A BIG FAN. I WATCH YOU ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS AS WELL.
MOSTLY ON MY PHONE. I WATCH MOST OF IT ON MY FON. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO THESE DAYS.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER AND LOOKS LIKE I LOST WEIGHT. A LOT OF PEOPLE-- I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU IN THE PUBLIC EYE SINCE-- YOU WERE THE COPPERTONE BABY?
I WAS AT THREE.
Stephen: AT THREE YEARS OLD.
I WAS. WELL, I JUST DID THE COMMERCIAL IN THE 60s AND THERE-- YOU KNOW, THE ADVERTISEMENT WITH THE LITTLE GIRL-- I'M NOT A BILLBOARD. JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT.
I'M JUST THE TELEVISION BABY.
Stephen: JUST THE TELEVISION BABY. OKAY, WELL, COULD HAVE GOTTEN IT.  ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR, YOU KNOW, IN VARIOUS FORMS ON VARIOUS MEDIA FOR 50 YEARS. THE MOVIE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM, BEST GOT TO KNOW YOU WAS "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS" WHICH WAS MADE IN 1991.
YUP.
Stephen:  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHEN IS THE LAST YOU WATCHED THAT MOVIE?
AH, I GUESS IT WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. MY SONS HADN'T SEEN IT. THEY WERE HAVING SOME KIND OF CELEBRATION, AND THEY-- THEY HAD A 35-MILLIMETER PRINT IN A BEAUTIFUL OLD THEATER SO WE ALL SAW IT IN THE REAL THEATER.
Stephen: HAD THEY NOT SEEN IT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM TO SEE THIS MOVIE OR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE?
THEY WERE TOO YOUNG. MY OLDER ONE, I THINK, HAD SNUCK IN, WAS ABLE TO SEE IT, BUT MY LITTLE ONE --
Stephen: BECAUSE IT'S REALLY SCARY.
I GUESS IT IS. I GUESS SO.  ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY.
Stephen: YEAH.
I DON'T SEE IT. BUT, YES.
Stephen: YOU DON'T SEE THE SCARY PART.
NO.
Stephen: AT NO POINT. BECAUSE OF JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE IN IT AND YOU SAW HOW IT WAS MADE AND YOU WERE LIKE, "NO, I GET HIM IN THE END."
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT.
Stephen: WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET HIM IN THE END AND WE ALL THINK IT'S SCARY, RIGHT?
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE'S LESS VIOLENCE AND BLOOD AND ALL THAT OTHER KIND OF STUFF THAN YOU SEE NORMALLY THESE DAYS BUT IT GETS YOU.
Stephen: HANNIBAL LECTER DOES CUT A MAN'S FACE OFF AND WEAR IT AS HIS OWN FACE. IT'S NOT EXACTLY DISNEY.  ( LAUGHTER ) ANTHONY HOPKINS, OF COURSE, IS HANNIBAL LECTER, A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE. WAS HE-- WAS HE INTIMIDATING ON SET? WAS HE, LIKE, KIND OF METHOD, ALWAYS SORT OF IN HIS CREEPY CHARACTER?
WELL, HE SCARED ME TO DEATH MOSTLY BECAUSE HE-- I-- I DID THE FIRST PART MOVIE WITHOUT HIM THERE. SO I HAD NEVER REALLY MET HIM. I HAD ONLY MET HIM AROUND A TABLE AND WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO TALK AND HAVING HEARD HIM DO A REHEARSAL, I JUST NEVER WANTED TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN.  ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEY HAD THESE-- THIS GLASS PARTITION BETWEEN LECTER AND CLARICE.
Stephen: SURE.
SO THEY HAD TO SCREW HIM IN TO HIS CELL BLOCK ON THE VERY FIRST DAY, SO I NEVER GOT TO TALK TO HIM. AND WE DID THE VERY FIRST SCENE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER, AND HE REALLY SCARED ME AGAIN. SO THEN I WAS JUST WAS LIKE-- WE NEVER SPOKE TO EACH OTHER DURING THE SHOOT, REALLY.
Stephen: AND WHEN YOU SEE HIM NOW?
WELL, THE LAST DAY OF SHOOTING, I WAS EATING A TUNA FISH SANDWICH-- WHICH IS THE PART I REMEMBER-- AND HE SAID EYE SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU SCARED ME." AND HE SAID, "YOU SCARED ME!"  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: WHY DID YOU SCARE HIM? DO YOU WANT?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE. I'M NOT SURE. MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE TELLING OF ANTHONY HOPKIN S.
Stephen:  HE MAY BE AFRAID OF WEST VIRGINIA ACCENTS.
Stephen: AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN THE SOUTH, THAT ACCENT IS SPOT ON.
IS IT.
Stephen: IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN KUDOS FOR THAT, RIGHT?
I GUESS SO. CHARACTER IS A FULL THING-- IT'S THE LITTLE SWEATER, BIG HAIR.
Stephen: I HAVE TO WRITE THAT DOWN, "LITTLE SWEATER..."  (  LAUGHTER  ) SO YOU'VE BEEN MAKING MOVIES FOR OVER 50 YEARS. DO MOVIES STILL WOW YOU? YOU'RE A DIRECTOR YOURSELF NOW. YOU'VE BEEN AN ACTOR FOR MANY YEARS OR DO YOU LOOK AT THE MOVIE AND GO, "I KNOW HOW THEY MADE THAT."
NO, I'M ESPECIALLY WOWED BY ACTORS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT. EVERY TIME I DO A MOVIE AS A DIRECTOR AND MY ACTORS COME FORWARD AND THEY JUST BRING SO MUCH TO THE TABLE. I'M ALWAYS JUST-- I'M IN AWE OF WHAT THEY DO, AND THEN I FORGET THAT I DO THAT, TOO.
Stephen: FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT, BECAUSE I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET ANTHONY HOPKINS IN LOS ANGELES THIS FALL FOR JUST A MOMENT. WE TALKED FOR MAYBE 10 MINUTES. AND I IMMEDIATELY ASKED HIM ABOUT HOW HE START OFFSIDE. AND HE TOLD ME ABOUT DOING "THE LION IN WINTER" WHICH WAS HIS FIRST MOVIE WITH PETER O'TOOLE AND KATHARINE HEPBURN. AND THE VERY FIRST SCENE, KATHARINE HEPBURN SAID, "DO YOU WANT ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO ACT?" AND SHE GAVE HIM ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO WORK ON CAMERA. DO YOU DO THAT? DO YOU WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN ON CAMERA BEFORE AND SAY, "THIS IS HOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT."
I WORK WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ON CAMERA. I NEVER WENT TO JUILLIARD. I FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE ANY CREDENTIALS AS AN ACTRESS.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ONLY WORK.
YEAH! THAT'S IT. I SORT OF LEARNED ON THE JOB. AND I HAVE MY OWN WAY OF DOING THINGS. AND I-- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES MY ADVICE IS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE YOU SIT DOWN BECAUSE IF YOU STAND UP FOR TOO LONG, YOUR FEET ARE GOING TO HURT."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE.
Stephen: "WELCOME TO MY MASTER CLASS."
PRETTY MUCH.
Stephen: YOU'RE A PRIVATE PERSON, WHICH IS A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE IN THE PB EYE TO KEEP YOUR PERSON LIFE PRIVATE. BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND ME GETTING A LITTLE PEEK IN THERE. WHAT DO YOU DO FOR FUN? WHAT'S JODIE FOSTER DOING FOR FUN?
WHAT DO I DO FOR FUN? I REALLY LIKE FOOTBALL.
Stephen: REALLY?
WHICH IS STRANGE. I'M ALMOST EMBARRASS.
Stephen: WHAT POSITION DO YOU PLAY?
AH. I TRY NOT TO PLAY. I DO-- YOU KNOW, I HAVE A BUNCH OF NERF BALL THEY SAY THROW AROUND.
Stephen: WHO IS YOUR TEAM?
GREEN BAY. NOT HAVING A GREAT YEAR.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO GREEN BAY?
I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE TOO PERSONALLY, ACTUALLY.  ( LAUGHTER ) I REALLY LOVE THE CHEESEHEADS. I LIKE TO WEAR THOSE.
Stephen: SURE, WHO DOESN'T?
AND, YOU KNOW, I LIKE FANTASY. I LIKE THE FANTASY. I LIKE ALL THE ALERTS IN MY POCKET, I LIKE STRATEGIZING.
Stephen: DO YOU PLAY FANTASY FOOTBALL?
YES. I DIDN'T PLAY THIS YEAR. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN POLITICS AND THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY ANXIETIES AND EMERGENCIES I CAN HANDLE. SO I WAS DEDICATING MYSELF TO--  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: AND FOOTBALL WAS YOUR WAY AWAY FROM THAT.
YEAH, SO I JUST WANTED TO HAVE THIS-- THIS YEAR FOOTBALL IS SECOND AND, YOU KNOW, TRUMP-LANDIA IS FIRST.
Stephen: YOU WENT TO A SCHOOL WHERE YOU HAD TO LEARN FRENCH WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, DIDN'T YOU?
YES.
Stephen: WAS THAT SACRED HEART.
IT WAS IN LOS ANGELES.
Stephen: THAT'S FANCY. DO YOU KEEP IT UP?
I DO. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE THERE, AND MY NIECES AND 97 USE LIVE THERE, SO I SPEAK FRENCH WITH THEM. I MEAN, THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO IN LOS ANGELES SPEAKING FRENCH UNLESS YOU RUN INTO FRENCH PEOPLE. MAYBE WHEN I'M PLAYING FOOTBALL ALL BY MYSELF I ( SPEAKING FRENCH ).
Stephen: HAVE YOU SEEN TRANSLATIONS OF YOUR MOVIES INTO FRENCH AND GONE, "THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S LIKE AT ALL?
I ACTUALLY DUBBED MY MOVIES IN FRENCH MOST OF MY LIFE.
Stephen: YOU DO YOUR OWN HOW DO YOU SAY-- "SILENCE OF THE LAMS" IN FRENCH?" ( SPEAKING FRENCH ).
Stephen: IT'S NOT AS SCARY. SOUND LIKE A DELICIOUS DISH. "TONIGHT, WE HAVE THE SILENCE OF THE LAMS. THE LAMB IS VERY QUIET BECAUSE IT IS DEAD. BUT SO DELICIOUS."  ( APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JODIE FOSTER. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE BACK WITH OUR FRIEND JODIE FOSTER. YOU GREW UP IN THE PUBLIC EYE. YOU GREW UP IN HOLLYWOOD. THERE IS SORT OF A PUBLIC AWAKENING BECAUSE OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT AND SOME OF THE ABUSES IN HOLLYWOOD. DO YOU SEE THIS AS A MOMENT THAT YOU THINK CAN CHANGE WHAT THE CULTURE IS LIKE IN MAKING MOVIES, MAKING TELEVISION, AND THE WAY WOMEN ARE TREATED OR MARGINALIZED OR OBJECTIFIED?
WELL, IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT IN HISTORY. IT REALLY IS. IT'S A WATERSHED MOMENT. AND NOT JUST AFFECTING THE FILM INDUSTRY.  OF COURSE, IT'S EVERY INDUSTRY, EVERY WORKPLACE. I REALLY HATE SOUNDBITES. I'M NOT GOOD AT SOUNDBITES. I'M SOMEBODY WHO TALKS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME, HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS. SO I HAVEN'T REALLY WANTED TO ADD YET ANOTHER OPINION INTO THE MIX BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE NOW WE REALLY NEED-- PEOPLE NEED TO-- I'D LOVE TO HEAR COMPLEXITY ABOUT IT. AND--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I FEEL LIKE THERE'S --
Stephen: WHAT IS THE COMPLEXITY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT--
WELL, WHAT NOW? WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP? I THINK JUSTICE VIA TWITTER WAS IMPORTANT IN THE BEGINNING, AND CERTAINLY TO FINALLY HEAR VOICES OF WOMEN MOVING FORWARD AND EMBRACING FEMINISM AND. BUT NOW I REALLY WANT TO HEAR-- I WANT TO HEAR THE NEXT STEP ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? HOW ARE WE ALL --
Stephen: WHAT IT SHOULD BE? IF YOU COULD WAVE A WAND WHAT, WOULD THE NEXT STEP BE?
I THINK IF WE'VE LEARNED FROM OTHER SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS, YOU CAN'T ATTACK A PROBLEM BY DOING JUST ONE THING. IT CAN'T JUST BE LEGISLATION. IT CAN'T JUST BE RULES. SOMEBODY GETS A RULE, A RULE THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, BLACKS CAN VOTE," AND THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, WELL YESTERDAY THEY COULDN'T. I DON'T ACCEPT THAT." I THINK THAT THERE'S-- I THINK THAT YOU HAVE-- HAVE TO HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE CULTURE CHANGES. SO IF THERE WAS, LIKE, A SUMMIT WHERE WE ALL GOT TOGETHER AND SHARED ALL OF OUR STORIES AND WERE ABLE TO, IN A REALLY COMPLICATED WAY, TALK ABOUT THE DYNAMICS THAT WE'VE ALL GROWN UP WITH, THAT THE THINGS THAT MADE US WHO WE ARE, THAT MADE US MEN, THAT MADE US WOMEN, I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING.  THING.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S A LONG PROCESS.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT WILL BE A LONG, LONG PROCESS.
IT'S A LONG PROCESS. BUT, YOU KNOW, I REALLY-- I REALLY LOVE-- I REALLY ADMIRED DESMUND TUTU TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION AFTER APARTHEID, THAT IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, THE INJUSTICES HAD HAPPENED FOR SO LONG, AND THEY'D BEEN SO DEEP, AND HAD SO MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS, THAT THE KIND OF HEALING THAT YOU NEEDED TO HAVE, HAD TO HAPPEN BETWEEN PEOPLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS AND PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AND TELLING BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY. AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK SOMEBODY IN THE FACE AND HOLD THEIR HAND, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING, REALLY, IS A-- THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW WE'RE HEARING SOME OF THE TRUTH. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE RECONCILIATION HAPPENS.
YEAH, ME, TOO.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE ROAD TO RECONCILIATION? BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS SOMEONE IS CREDIBLY ACCUSED, THANKFULLY THE WOMEN ARE BELIEVED, AND THEN-- AND PRESENTLY, THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED OF IT, FOR ALL WE KNOW, HAS JUST DISAPPEARED. WHERE DOES THE RECONCILIATION HAPPEN?
WHEN WE SAW ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL NARRATIVES BY INCREDIBLY ARTICULATE ACTRESSES, FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS JUST SO PROUD OF THE WOMEN AND, YOU KNOW, REALLY SEEING THE DETAILS OF HOW THEY PROCESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. AND I WOULD LOVE IT SEE THE MEN ON THE OTHER SIDE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HOW THEY COULD PROCESS UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR PART IN ALL OF THIS WAS.
Stephen: WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW CERTAINLY AND THE VOLUME IS HEARTENING AND THE SPEED MIGHT BE TROWLG OVER A PROBLEM AGAIN.
RIGHT. I MEAN, THERE ISN'T PROBABLY A WOMAN IN THIS ROOM, CERTAINLY OR IN THE WORLD WHO DOESN'T HAVE A #METOO STORY. AND PROBABLY-- I'M JUST GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB HERE-- I THINK MOSTLY WHAT WOMEN WOULD LIKE DOOB WOOIVE JUST FOR IT TO STOP. THEY WOULD JUST LIKE IT TO NOT HAPPEN.  ( APPLAUSE ) SO THAT THEY CAN-- SO THAT-- THAT WE CAN ALL GO ON AND DO THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WIN NOBEL PRIZES AND --
Stephen: DIRECT MOVIES.
DIRECT MOVIES AND BE PARENTS AND HAVE FUN WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH, THE GUYS THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH. THEY WOULD JUST THRIEK TO STOP.
Stephen: WELL, YOU HAVE DIRECTED SOME GREAT MOVIES AND NOW YOU'RE DIRECTING AN EPISODE OF "BLACK MIRROR."
WHERE IS!
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. BEFORE WE RUN THE CLIP CYOU TELL US WHAT THE EPISODE IS ABOUT?
OH! UH-OH! YES. LAUGH THE EPISODE IS ABOUT, LIKE A LOT OF "BLACK MIRROR," ALL AROUND THE THEME OF TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS A MOTHER-DAUGHTER STORY. A MOTHER WOULD LIKE TO KEEP HER CHILD SAFE. SHE HAS ALL OF THE PARANOIAS THAT SOMETIMES NEW PARENTS HAVE, AND SHE WOULD LIKE-- SHE FINDS THIS DEVICE THAT ALLOWS HER TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO KEEP HER CHILD SAFE, AND IT MAY REQUIRE AN IMPLANT!
Stephen: AND SHE IS GOING RIGHT NOW--
SHE'S GOING FOR IT.
Stephen: AND SHE'S GOING RIGHT NOW TO THE COMPANY TO HAVE HER CHILD EN-CHIPPED.
YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION. SHE WILL BE PART OF THE TRIAL PERIOD.
IT'S BEEN TESTED, RIGHT?
OF COURSE,.
SHE'S NOT LIKE A GUINEA PIG.
IT'S TESTED AND SAFE. THIS IS THE FINE TUNING BEFORE THE FULL LAUNCH.
LOOK AT THE KIDS.
WE'RE GETTING FEEDBACK ON WITH WHICH FEATURES THEIR CUSTOMERS USE MOST IN THE REAL WORLD. YEAH! RESPONSE SO FAR IS JUST INCREDIBLE, SENSE OF SECURITY, PEACE OF MIND. I MEAN, THE STORIES WE'VE BEEN HEARING, THEY ARE TRULY INSPIRATIONAL.
OKAY, THEN.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, AS A PARENT-- YEAH, IT'S CREEPY. YEAH, IT'S CREEPY. BUT AS A PARENT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE DRAW, RIGHT?
SURE!
Stephen: RIGHT.
G.P.S. THE KID, SURE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT CELL PHONES ARE FOR.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: JUST TELL THEM YOU'RE ALWAYS USING FIND MY IPHONE.
"BLACK MIRROR" IS BEAUTIFUL, A BEAUTIFUL SHOW. IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE "TWILIGHT ZONE" EACH IS A DIFFERENT STORY. THIS PARTICULAR ONE REALLY FEELS LIKE AN INDY FILM. MY PARTICULAR EPISODE FEELS LIKE A VERY SMALL INDY FILM ABOUT THE COMPLICATED LITTLE DETAILS BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER.
Stephen: WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "BLACK MIRROR" RETURNS TO NETFLIX DECEMBER 29. JODIE FOSTER, EVERYBODY! FAN OF COMPLEXITY. STICK AROUND BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GET INSIDE A BOX WITH TOM HANKS. SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU!  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: OH, RIGHT. YOU PROBABLY THINK I'M SUCKING UP TO THE CROWD FISAY IT ON THE SHOW.
Stephen: NOT AT ALL. IT'S THE SORT OF THING THEY MIGHT WANT TO HEAR. DO YOU WANT TO TELL THEM?
NO, LET'S KEEP THAT BETWEEN YOU AND ME.
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU SOME PERSONAL, PRIVATE QUESTIONS?
SURE, BRING THEM ON.
Stephen: YOU HAVE MADE A LOT OF EMOTIONAL MOVIES.
WELL, THAT'S PARENT OF THE GIG, YEAH.
Stephen: YEAR, IT'S ALL ABOUT EMOTIONALITY. HAVE YOU EVER CRIED AT ONE OF YOUR OWN MOVIES?
WELL, IN ALL HONESTY, YEAH. I-- I MADE A MOVIE CALLED--  (  LAUGHTER  ) A LOT OF TIMES I'M IN MOVIES BUT I DON'T SEE THE WHOLE OTHER ASPECTS OF IT BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE IN IT.
Stephen: RIGHT.
I MADE A MOVIE CALLED "CLOUD ATLAS" THAT HAD ALL THESE OTHER SCENARIOS, AND I FOUND THAT VERY EMOTIONAL EVERY TIME I SAW IT. THAT REALLY GOT ME.
Stephen: THAT'S A REALLY GOOD MOVIE, AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.
I'M THROWING A KOWTOW RIGHT NOW. IT'S A MAJOR TRUE-TRUE.
OF.
Stephen: YOU CAN CRY A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW, JUST LET IT OUT, JUST CRY A LITTLE BIT?
AT CHRISTMASTIME I WAS THINKING ABOUT...  (  LAUGHTER  ) ALL THE-- ALL THE DOGS I'VE HAD THAT HAVEN'T MADE IT TO DECEMBER.
Stephen: IT'S TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE.
I'M THINKING OF MONTY. BIG SOFT EYES. WHAT A BOY HE WAS. I MISS HIM EVERY SINGLE DAY.
YOU KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENS?
THEY'RE NOT LIKE MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY. THEY'RE PART OF YOU! YEAH.  ( LAUGHTER )

AND I WENT UP-- I WAS HUNGRY. I HAD THE KIDS WITH ME. AND THEY WERE ALL ASKING-- THEY WANTED SOME GULLA SHRIMP, VERY SPICY, HOT IN THE MOUTH SHRIMP THEY CALL IT DOWN IN THE GULLA ISLANDS.
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
I SAID I KNOW WHERE TO GET THAT. WE CLIMBED THE STAIRS UP TO A BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP-- IS THIS A TRUE STORY?
YEAH, THEY LOOKED RIGHT AT ME AND SAID, "IT WILL BE A 45-MINUTE WAIT, MR. HANKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN ALL HONESTY, THEY WERE CROWDED.
Stephen: OKAY.
THEY OFFERED US SOME FREE SWEET TEA.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT ANOTHER MINT?
I COULD USE ONE.
Stephen: SURE, HOLD ON.
OH, GREAT. GOT IT.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
WOW! YOU KNOW WHAT? IT SMELLS LIKE CHRISTMAS IN HERE NOW, DOESN'T IT?
UH-HUH.
Stephen: OKAY, BIGGER HERO, JIM LOVELL FROM APOLLO 13, BEN BRADLEE "THE POST."
OH, MAN. WELL, I WILL SAY BECAUSE-- ONLY BECAUSE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, JIM LOVELL COULD HAVE BURNED UP INTO A BILLION PARTICLES DURING HIS FIERY 250,000-MILE-AN-HOUR REENTRY FROM OUTER SPACE INTO EARTH, TO SPLASHDOWN INTO AN OCEAN. I WOULD SAY THAT IS SLIGHTLY MORE BAD-ASS.
THAN PUBLISHING "THE PENTAGON PAPERS."
YEAH, RISKY BOTH SIDES. RISKY BOTH SIDES.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT SULLY OR WOODY? BIGGER HERO?
WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL. WOODY IS A PACIFIST, BECAUSE THERE IS NO GUN IN THAT HOLSTER.
Stephen: DID SULLY HAVE A GUN?  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S THE IMPLICATION OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.  (  LAUGHTER  )
THERE'S SOME THINGS I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCLOSE TO YOU.
Stephen: YOU UNDERSTAND. LAST QUESTION.

Stephen: ANSWER ON THREE. DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS BOX? ONE, TWO, THREE.
I'D LIKE TO STAY RIGHT HERE FOR JUST A COUPLE MORE MINUTES.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GOTTA-- I DON'T HAVE-- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU PER SE.
Stephen: OKAY.
