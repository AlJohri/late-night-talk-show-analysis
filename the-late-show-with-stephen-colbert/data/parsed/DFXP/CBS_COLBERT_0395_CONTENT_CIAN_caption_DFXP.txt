ACCORDING TO "USA TODAY," PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SENT PRIVATE MESSAGES TO RUSSIA'S SPECIAL COUNSEL, ROBERT MUELLER. TRUMP'S LAWYER REFERRED TO THEM AS MESSAGES OF, "APPRECIATION AND GREETINGS."
ARE YOU BEING INVESTIGATED FOR CONSPIRING WITH A FOREIGN POWER, BUT YOU STILL WANT TO LET THAT SPECIAL PROSECUTOR KNOW THAT THEY'RE SPECIAL? WELL, NOW YOU CAN WITH HALLMARK'S NEW LINE TRUMP INSPIRED GREETING CARDS. EACH CARD LETS THE CERTAIN SOMEONE INVESTIGATING YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THEM, LIKE "I'M GUILTY... OF THINKING YOU'RE GREAT." "ROSES ARE RED, VIOLATES ARE BLUE... I WOULDN'T MIND COLLUDING WITH YOU." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "YOU PUT THE CUTE IN PROSE-CUTE." "I DIDN'T COLLUDE ON PORPOISE. WHALE YOU DROP THE INVESTIGATION?" "HERE'S MY FACE ON A PENNY, BECAUSE I'M IN-A-CENT." AND, OF COURSE,, "I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. SLEEP LIGHTLY." ORDER NOW WHILE SUPPLIES AND PRESIDENCIES LAST.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ROBERT PATTINSON. DAVID TENNANT. AND NIECY NASH. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE TONIGHT, GREAT TO BE HERE. ACTUALLY, IT'S GREAT TO BE ANYWHERE TONIGHT. BECAUSE TENSIONS ARE BUILDING BETWEEN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND NORTH KOREAN AND DISAPPOINTED VOLLEYBALL KIM JONG-UN. NOW, THIS IS THE TENSION I'M TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS, I HOPE IT'S LINED WITH LEAD, BECAUSE THIS PAST WEEKEND, THE U.N. IMPOSED HARSH SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA TO TRY TO GET THEM TO CURB THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. NORTH KOREA RESPONDED BY THREATENING REVENGE ON THE U.S., SO RENOWNED DEAL ARTIST, DONALD TRUMP-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU HEARD OF THIS GUY. FANS. TRUMP FANS. DONALD TRUMP SAW THEIR THREAT OF APOCALYPSE AND RAISED THEM ONE ARMAGEDDON.
NORTH KOREA BEST NOT MAKE ANY MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE, FURY AND, FRANKLY, POWER THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
Audience: OOOOH!
Stephen: OH, WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE'VE SEEN? YOU USING THAT PHRASE.
WE HAVE A MOVEMENT, THE LIKES OF WHICH THIS WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WE WILL UNLEASH AN ENERGY REVOLUTION, THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, MASSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEALS, THE LIKES OF WHICH THERE HAS NEVER BEEN. I LAND AT AIRPORTS, THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU'VE NEVER SEEN.
Stephen: THAT IS EMPTY RHETORIC, THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU ALWAYS USE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S GOOD TO KNOW-- IT'S GOOD TO KNOW OUR PRESIDENT SEES THE FIRE OF NUCLEAR WAR AS BEING ON THE SAME LEVEL AS A NICE AIRPORT HE WENT TO. "I HAD A MEAL AT CHILI'S, TOO, THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE." NOW, IF THREATENING NUCLEAR WAR SEEMS A LITTLE SEAT OF THE GIANT PANTS, THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS. APPARENTLY, TRUMP IMPROVISED "FIRE AND FURY" BECAUSE THE PAPER HE HAD IN FRONT OF HIM WAS AN OPIOID FACT SHEET. ( LAUGHTER ) LOOK, I GET IT. I'VE DONE IMPROV. IT CAN BE TOUGH. HE SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITH A SUGGESTION FROM THE AUDIENCE. "CAN I HAVE A GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND A WAY THE WORLD WILL END? OKAY? I THURSDAY SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THOROUGHLYO NUCLEAR CONFLICTS." AND TRUMP'S MESSAGE OF "DON'T THREATEN US OR WE WILL RAIN DOWN FIRE AND FURY" WAS SO INTIMIDATING THAT NORTH KOREA IMMEDIATELY THREATENED A MISSILE STRIKE ON THE U.S. TERRITORY OF GUAM. LOOK, NORTH KOREA, LEAVE GUAM OUT OF THIS! THEY'RE A U.S. TERRITORY. THAT MEANS THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS! THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP. JUST LIKE MOST OF AMERICANS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) INNOCENT! BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. HERE'S WHY IT'S A LITTLE SPOOKY. NORTH KOREA NOW CLAIMS TO BE ABLE TO REACH GUAM WITH THEIR MISSILE AND DESTROY IT WITH "ENVELOPING FIRE." "ENVELOPING FIRE"? IS KIM JONG-UN LAUNCHING A MISSILE OR A SERIES OF EROTIC NOVELS? ( LAUGHTER ) HE LOOKS GOOD. HE LOOKS-- HE LOOKS GOOD. I MISJUDGED HIM. NOW, SOME ARE SAYING THAT TRUMP'S "ATOMIC IMPROV" MADE THINGS WORSE. BUT SECRETARY OF STATE AND PROUD EYEBROW AMERICAN, REX TILLERSON, IS STANDING BY HIS MAN.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING WAS SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA IN LANGUAGE THAT KIM JONG-UN WOULD UNDERSTAND. I THINK AMERICANS SHOULD SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT.
Stephen: WHY? WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THE DAY? WHAT AREN'T YOU TELLING US? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT OKAY, OKAY. GRANDPA WANTS US TO SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT, WHICH IS WHY HE'S COME OUT WITH A NEW BOOK, "REX TILLERSON'S SLEEPY TIME TALES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY. HERE WE GO. OVER HERE? "THERE ONCE WAS A BADGER, AND HE WAS THE ELECTED LEADER OF THE WHOLE MEADOW, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THE MEADOW DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. HE HAD WEIRD HAIR AND TINY LITTLE PAWS, AND HE WAS OBSESSED WITH THE LOCAL FOX AND ALL OF HIS FRIENDS. LIKE, HE WATCHED THE FOX AND FRIENDS WAY TOO MUCH, TO THE POINT WHERE FOLKS WERE LIKE, 'DON'T YOU HAVE BADGER STUFF YOU SHOULD BE DOING? '. THEN, ONE DAY, THE BADGER GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH A PUDGY WOLF, WHO WAS SOMEHOW EVEN CRAZIER. AND BOTH OF THEM HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND DISTANT, UNPLEASABLE FATHERS, AND..." UUUH... YIKES! AH, IT'S JUST A BOOK. WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE FINE. ANYWAY, SLEEP TIGHT, KIDS! AND SAY YOUR PRAYERS. NOT THAT DONALD TRUMP NEEDS YOUR PRAYERS BECAUSE.  ( APPLAUSE ) HE DOESN'T NEED YOUR PRAYERS, THOUGH. NOT THAT TRUMP NEEDS IT. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO TRUMP EVANGELICAL ADVISER AND STRONG ARGUMENT FOR BEARDS, PASTOR ROBERT JEFFRESS, "GOD HAS GIVEN TRUMP AUTHORITY TO TAKE OUT KIM JONG-UN." "TAKE OUT"? "TAKE OUT"? IS THAT HOW GOD TALKS? "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, GET MY DONNIE BABY HANDS ON THE PHONE. I WANT HIM TO TAKE OUT KIM JONG-UN, SAME WAY WE TOOK OUT SODOM AND GOMORRAH-- FIRE AND FURY. I WANT HIM TO SLEEP WITH THE LOAVES AND THE FISHES." I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M DOING. KIND OF CHICAGO, A LITTLE-- LITTLE MOOCH. AND JEFFRESS IS ON SOUND THEOLOGICAL GROUND HERE. AS JESUS SAID IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT, "BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS. BUT JUST IN CASE, LET'S NUKE THE BASTARDS." OF COURSE, PASTOR JEFFRESS GAVE THE SERMON AT TRUMP'S PRIVATE INAUGURATION DAY SERVICE WHERE HE SHARED A VISION HE HAD AT HIS FIRST MEETING WITH TRUMP. "I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO THIS WEEKEND THAT I WAS WITH YOU ON YOUR CITATION JET FLYING AROUND IOWA BEFORE THE FIRST CAUCUS OR PRIMARY VOTE WAS CAST. AFTER OUR WENDY'S CHEESEBURGERS, I SAID THAT I BELIEVED THAT YOU WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES." AND LO, IT HATH COME TO PASS, JUST AS THE WENDYS BACONATOR HATH PROPHESIED! ( LAUGHTER ) IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE BIGGIE FRIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW-- ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, I HADN'T HEARD THAT GOD WAS PRO NUCLEAR WAR. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S TRUE. IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY WE COULD CHECKIN WITH THE LORD TO FIND OUT.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN, HEY BUDDY. I'M RIGHT HERE!
Stephen: HEY! IT'S OUR OLD FRIEND, GOD. GIVE IT UP FOR GOD.
HEY, WHAT UP? HOW IT HANGETH?
Stephen: LISTEN, LORD, IS IT TRUE THAT YOU GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE OUT KIM JONG-UN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS?
OH, YEAH. ALWAYS ON AMERICA'S SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO BLOWIN' STUFF UP.
Stephen: BUT THAT GOES AGAINST YOUR WHOLE MESSAGE OF PEACE AND FORGIVENESS.
I NEVER SAID THAT. THAT WAS MY HIPPIE SON. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE SEMESTER AT LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN ITS "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR" AND "QUINOA IS A SUPERGRAIN."
Stephen: IT IS DELICIOUS.
I PREFER THE BACONATOR.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU LIKE THE WENDY'S BACONATOR?
OH, IT'S THE BEST.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS HERE, LORD. WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CIVILIZATION?
EH, HUMANS HAD A GOOD RUN. WHY NOT LET GIANT RADIOACTIVE TOADS HAVE A TURN?
Stephen: BUT, GOD, IF YOU GIVE WORLD LEADERS THEIR AUTHORITY, AREN'T YOU IN CHARGE OF KIM JONG-UN, TOO?
I ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH. I'M TRYING TO LEARN KOREAN WITH ROSETTA STONE, BUT I JUST COULDN'T GET IT. I'M LEARNING TOAD NOW.
Stephen: GOD, EVERYBODY! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. ROBERT PATTINSON IS HERE! BUT WHEN WE RETURN, PAUL MANAFORT IS IN A WHOLE HEAP OF TROUBLE. STICK ANDERSON. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE. SHOW THEM THE LOVE. SHOW THEM THE LOVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS IS NICE.
Jon: YES!
Stephen: WE GOT-- JON, I WANT TO POINT OUT, YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE SUIT ON TONIGHT. I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE TIE.
Jon: I KNOW, MAN. I LOVE WHEN WE'RE COORDINATED.
Stephen: THAT'S JUST KISMET.
Jon: IT IS.
Stephen: THAT'S GOD WINKING AT YOU.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. AND WE KNOW HE LOVES PURPLE AND THE BACONATOR.
Stephen: JON, I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT OUR FIRST GUEST ROBERT PATTINSON.
Jon: MATTY IS EXCITED, TOO.
Stephen: MATTY, ARE YOU EXCITED? ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT ROBERT PATTINSON.
THAT WAS A SECRET, JON.
Stephen: ARE YOU TEAM EDWARD?
I DON'T LIKE THOSE MOVIES. I'M A FAN OF HIS OTHER WORK.
Stephen: I WON'T TELL HIM THAT PART. SO YOU'RE A CEDRIC DIGGERY FAN? IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON.
Jon: OH, MY GOODNESS!
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE I'M EXCITED ABOUT, JON, IS WE JOKE AROUND HERE A LOT ABOUT LIKE EXCLUSIVES -- THIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW OR THAT EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW, WHEN IT'S NOT REALLY AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW. WE'RE JUST DOING A TV SHOW HERE. I HAVEAB AN ANNOUNCEMENT RIGHT NOW OF AN ACTUAL EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MONDAY. EVERYBODY WANTS THIS FELLA. EVERYBODY WANTS HIM, BUT NOBODY GOT HIM, BUT US. ON MONDAY, I WILL BE SITTING DOWN HERE, TALKING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI WILL BE SITTING RIGHT THERE. THE MOOCH! MOOCH! RIGHT THERE! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! WE GOT THE MOOCH. WE SET OUT A MOOCH TRAP. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S RIGHT IN IT. IT'S GOING GOING TO BE FUN. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING. I'M GOING TO ASK, LIKE, WHAT IT'S LIKE INSIDE THERE? HOW LOYAL HE FEELS THE PRESIDENT IS NOW.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: WE'LL DO SOME FRONT STABBING. IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN. ANYWAY, MOOCH, I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY. IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN. MEANWHILE-- AM I STILL HERE OR HERE. GOOD NEWS, BY THE WAY. I BURIED THE LEAD HERE. AMERICA MADE IT THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL BREAK. BUT OUR PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER REASON TO END THE WORLD. IT'S THE ONGOING RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BY FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR AND MAN WITH A D-CUP JAW, ROBERT MUELLER. BECAUSE WE LEARNED TODAY THAT "THE F.B.I. CONDUCTED A PRE-DAWN RAID OF FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT'S HOME." USING A "NO-KNOCK WARRANT." YEAH, NO KNOCK. ( APPLAUSE ) NO KNOCK! IT IS THE SAME KIND DONALD TRUMP USED AT THE MISS UNIVERSE DRESSING ROOM. JUST NO KNOCK! HELLO! THAT MEANS-- THAT MEANS, OKAY, THAT MEANS INVESTIGATORS DON'T TRUST PAUL MANAFORT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. JUST LOOK AT HIM. "YES, OFFICERS. "YES, OFFICERS, COME RIGHT IN. FEEL FREE TO LOOK AROUND MY LAIR. PLEASE, DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT. AND IGNORE THE GOLD BULLION AND THE AGENT STRAPPED TO THE LASER TABLE." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS COULD BE SERIOUS, BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS THAT ROBERT MUELLER MAY BE INVESTIGATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND "CRIMINAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE FEDERAL BANK SECRECY ACT, WHICH REQUIRES AMERICANS TO REPORT THEIR FOREIGN BANKING ACCOUNTS." "UHH...DOES IT COUNT AS A FOREIGN BANK IF IT'S JUST A MEAT LOCKER FULL OF CASH IN A UKRAINIAN DISCO?" AND WHILE THIS IS GOING ON, WE LEARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS EXCHANGED PRIVATE MESSAGES WITH ROBERT MUELLER. NOW, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP SAID IN THESE MESSAGES. ARE THEY TROUBLING, LIKE HIS PRIVATE MESSAGES WITH JAMES COMEY? OR ARE THEY INNOCENT, LIKE HIS PRIVATE MESSAGES WITH BILLY BUSH? WE DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL WE KNOW SO FAR IS, ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS, THE MESSAGES EXPRESSED "APPRECIATION AND GREETINGS. "APPRECIATION AND GREETINGS." WHICH MUST HAVE LOOKED PRETTY STRANGE SCRAWLED ACROSS A HORSE'S HEAD. I HAVE TO SAY--
Jon: THAT MOB STUFF.
Stephen: YEAH, TAKE HIM OUT. I HAVE TO SAY, IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT TRUMP WOULD BE COMPLIMENTING MUELLER IN PRIVATE, SINCE PUBLICLY HE'S CALLED THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION "THE SINGLE GREATEST WITCH HUNT IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY." UNLESS "WITCH HUNT" IS ALSO INTENDED AS A COMPLIMENT. "SUPER GREAT WITCH HUNT, BOB. I HOPE YOU THROW ME IN THE RIVER. I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT IF I FLOAT." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROBERT PATTINSON. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT ROSE TO FAME AS EDWARD IN THE "TWILIGHT" MOVIES. HE'S NOW RECEIVING RAVE REVIEWS FOR HIS PERFORMANCE IN "GOOD TIME." PLEASE WELCOME, ROBERT PATTINSON! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY. I'M FINE. HOW IS IT GOING FOR YOU?
IT'S GOING OKAY.
Stephen: YEAH.
I HAD A PREMIERE LAST NIGHT SO I'M AT ABOUT 10% FUNCTIONALITY.
Stephen: THE PREMIERE WAS HERE IN NEW YORK. WAS THERE A PARTY YOU WENT TO?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU CAME STRAIGHT HERE FROM THE PARTY FROM LAST NIGHT?
WELL, I-- AFTER A BUNCH OF DISASTROUS PRESS ALL DAY AS WELL.
Stephen: DISASTROUS PRESS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN DISASTROUS PLEAS?
I'VE BEEN BANGING OUT BAD ONES, BAD INTERVIEW AFTER BAD INTERVIEW.
Stephen: THAT ENDS RIGHT HERE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT INTERVIEW, GREAT INTERVIEW. WOW, WHO ELSE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH TODAY? I'M NOTUE KNOW, I'M NOT PROUD. WHO ELSE HAVE YOU BEEN-- PRESS, TV? ANY OTHER TV?
NOT ANY OTHER TV.
Stephen: THEN I DON'T CARE. YOU BUT YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED, RIGHT?
I'M GOOD. IT'S FREEZING COLD IN HERE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY WE KEEP IT SO COLD BECAUSE WE THINK OF OUR GUESTS AS JUST MEAT. WE HAVE TO KEEP YOU FRESH. YOU STARTED OFF IN LONDON, I UNDERSTAND, YOUR FIRST PLAY WAS IT "OUR TOWN?"
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU WERE GEORGE IN "OUR TOWN."
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT A SWEET, SMALL, NONSHRIEKING CROWD TO PLAY. WHAT COULD BE LESS FAMOUS THAN PLAYING GEORGE?
I'M DESPERATELY TRYING TO EVEN REMEMBER WHAT "OUR TOWN" IS ABOUT. I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT. IT'S ABOUT A TOWN --
Stephen: IT'S VAMPIRES AND WOLVES WHO, IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, KILL A GIRL NAMED EMILY. IT'S-- IT'S ABOUT GROVER'S CORNER, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IT'S THE GREAT REDESTRUCTION OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE ABOUT HOW EVERY SIMPLE INDIVIDUAL LIFE OF THE ORDINARY LIFE IS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE THE BEAUTY AND THE NEEDS OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIP.
WOW. I LITERALLY THE ONLY THING I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT WAS THE FACT THAT I GOT TO KISS HELEN ZIEGLER, WHO WAS PLAYING EMILY. AND THAT'S LITERALLY-- WAS HER NAME-- THAT'S THE REASON --
Stephen: THAT'S HOW THEY GOT YOU INTO A PLAY BECAUSE YOU COULD KISS A GIRL.
THAT'S REASON I'M AN ACTOR.
Stephen: KISSING THE GIRLS? HOW IS THAT WORKING OUT. YOU HAVE ENOUGH AT THIS POINT? NOW, BESIDES DOING CEDRIC DIGGERY IN THE HEARTY POTTER FILMS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU MET-- HAVE YOU MET OUR GUITARIST MATTY RICE OVER THERE? HAVE YOU MET--
A HARRY POTTER FAN.
Stephen: A BIG HARRY POTTER FAN. NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR WORK BUT A VERY BIG HARRY POTTER FAN. AND, OBVIOUSLY, THE "TWILIGHT" MOVIES. YOU HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY DONE FASCINATING INDEPENDENT MOVIES, "COSMOPOLIST" AND "MAPS OF THE STAR." YOU WORKED WITH VERNER HERZING ON, ONE OF THE MOST INDY OF ALL INDY DIRECTORS. SO WHY NOT ANOTHER BLOCKBUSTER? WHY DO YOU LIKE THE SMALL STUFF?
I HAD THE LUXURY OF KIND OF NOT HAVING TO KEEP WORKING CONSTANTLY, SO I'VE KIND OF BEEN ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT I WANTED TO DO, AND IT'S BEEN WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I MEAN THE SCRIPTS-- I MEAN, I SEE EVERYTHING AS A BLOCKBUSTER. YOU HOPE IT WILL BE A BLOCKBUSTER AFTERWARDS. YOU HOPE AT LEAST SOMEONE WILL SEE IT. BUT, YEAH, YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.
Stephen: WELL, THE NEW FILM, YOU'RE WONDERFUL IN THE FILM. IT'S GOTTEN GREAT REVIEWS. IT GOT A SIX-MINUTE STANDING OVATION AT CANNES THIS YEAR. YOU PLAY CONNIE WHO IS FROM QUEENS, A SMALL-TIME CROOK FROM QUEENS.
YEAH.
Stephen: WAS IT HARD FOR YOU TO GET A QUEENS ACCENT DOWN?
UM, I MEAN, NOT REALLY. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF-- IT'S, YOU KNOW, I THINK WHEN YOU DO, LIKE, A NEW YORK MOVIE, THERE'S SOMETHING SO CINEMATIC ABOUT GENERAL NEW YORK ACCENT. BUT IF YOU REALLY-- LIKE, A QUEENS ACCENT IS KIND OF-- IT'S QUITE SPECIFIC. AND I ALWAYS FIND IT KIND OF INTERESTING TO-- TO GET SOME KIND OF REGIONAL DIALECT. IT MAKES THE PART SEEM MORE SPECIFIC.
Stephen: WAS THERE A HOOK OR SOMETHING THAT GETS YOU INTO A NEW YORK ACCENT? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO SAY FIRST SORT OF TO FIND IT?
UM, I MEAN, THERE WAS-- WELL, I'M BASICALLY DOING, TO MY EAR, I'M DOING THE DIRECTOR'S ACCENT. SO I'M KIND OF DOING THAT ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: DOES HE KNOW THAT?
HE ALWAYS SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT PLAYING ME. STOP TELLING PEOPLE YOU'RE PLAYING ME, BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING A PSYCHOPATH." ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THERE IS A HOOK YOU USE.
OH, THERE WAS A THING-- IT'S THIS DOCUMENTARY-- DO YOU KNOW JOHN ALPERT? HE DID THIS AMAZING DOCUMENTARY CALLED "THE YEAR IN THE LIFE OF CRIME" AND IT'S ABOUT SOME PETTY CRIMINALS, TWO YEARS OVER THE LIFE. AND YOU SEE THESE GUYS AND THERE'S AN INNATE CHARISMA, AND GUYS WHO ARE BASICALLY LIVING FROM SHOPLIFTING, AND THEY'RE JUST SO CINEMATIC. AND THERE'S SOMETHING-- THERE'S SOMETHING-- THEY'RE SO CHARISMATIC. AND THAT WAS REALLY WHAT GOT ME AND THE WAY THEY SPEAK AND THE WAY THEY MOVE. THAT WAS KIND OF IT.
Stephen: NOW, I HAVE A CLIP HERE. YOU HAVE A BROTHER, YOUR BROTHER IN THIS IS-- HAS MENTAL IMPAIRMENT. HE'S-- HE'S DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. AND YOU GUYS -- WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED HERE? YOU GUYS HAVE JUST TRIED TO--
I AM GIVING HIM A LIFE EXPERIENCES, AS A GOOD BIG BROTHER DOES, WHICH MEANS TAKING HIM OUT OF HIS PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE AND TAKING HIM IMMEDIATELY TO ROB A BANK.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T-- IT DOESN'T GO WELL.
NO, IT DOESN'T GO WELL.
Stephen: OKAY, JIM.
WHAT THE (BLEEP) ARE YOU DOING?
COME OUT! FIVE SECONDS, I CALL THE POLICE!
MY BROTHER IS MENTALLY HANDICAPPED. I'M GOING TO COME OUT IN ONE SECOND. IT'S AN EMERGENCY, ALL RIGHT. PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THEM OFF RIGHT NOW. SWEAT PANTS UNDERNEATH. THAT'S WHY YOU WORE THEM. HURRY UP ( KNOCKING ON THE DOOR ).
YES! PLEASE!
Stephen: IT'S THAT INTENSITY. THAT INTENSITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IT'S THAT LEVEL OF INTENSITY THE ENTIRE MOVIE. IT'S A KIND OF-- I THINK ME AND THE DIRECTORS HAVE COINED A NEW GENRE, WHICH IS JUST CALLED "PANIC." AND IT'S JUST PANIC. IT'S A PANIC-- IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE WHAT A 90-MINUTE PANIC ATTACK IS AT THE CINEMA, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
Stephen: WONDERFUL. BEFORE WE GO, CONGRATULATIONS, VERY NICE. THIS IS THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE OF "GQ" THERE YOU ARE. AND I JUST HAVE TO ASK YOU, HAVING YOU HERE, HAVING YOU HERE, AND HAVING THIS COVER RIGHT HERE, I JUST HAVE TO ASK, DO YOU OWN A COMB? ( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I WAS JUST-- I WAS BACKSTAGE. I JUST-- THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE.
Stephen: I WISH-- I WISH MINE COULD DO IT. ANYWAY, ROBERT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "GOOD TIME" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. ROBERT PATTINSON, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DAVID TENNANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY!
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOLKS, YOU HAVE SEEN MY NEXT GUEST IN ALL YOUR FAVORITE IMPORTS FROM ACROSS THE POND:  "DOCTOR WHO," "HARRY POTTER," AND "BROADCHURCH" PLEASE WELCOME DAVID TENNANT. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME-- NICE TO MEET YOU. THANKS FOR BEING ON THE SHOW.
PLEASURE, PLEASURE.
Stephen: IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS ROBERT PATTINSON WAS LEAVING, CEDRIC DIGGERY WAS REALLY SET UP TO BE KILLED BY YOUR CHARACTER, MARPTY CROUCH JR. IN "HARRY POTTER."
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS -- IS THERE ANY BAD BLOOD THERE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?
HE SEEMED FINE JUST THEN.
Stephen: HE WAS ALREADY. HE GOT DEAD BUT HE GOT OVER IT. SPEAKING OF, YOU KNOW, GREAT BRITISH TRADITIONS, YOU WERE THE TENTH "DOCTOR WHO."
THIS IS TRUE.
Stephen: WHICH IS AN AMAZING HONOR, I'M SURE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOW DO YOU FEEL, OR DO YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS ABOUT JODIE WHITTAKER OF BREAKING THE GLASS CEILING BECOMING THE FIRST FEMALE? WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?
I'M DELIGHTED. SHE'S BEEN ON "BROADCHURCH" FOR THREE SEASONS. I KNOW HER VERY WELL. SHE'S A MATE OF MINE. A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE IT'S ANNOUNCED I GET A PHONE CALL FROM HER AND SHE'S IN A SORT OF TUNNEL OF EXCITEMENT AND PANIC. BUT IT'S BRILLIANT. I CAN'T THINK OF SOMEONE BETTER TO JOIN THE GANG AND TO BE POISED TO TAKE IT TO, YOU KNOW, A WHOLE NEW LEVEL IS GREAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: MOST PEOPLE ARE THRILLED ABOUT IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU SURPRISED-- ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY BACKLASH AT ALL?
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER THE DOCTOR CHANGES THERE'S A BACKLASH BECAUSE THAT'S A CHARACTER PEOPLE LOVE. SO PEOPLE GET VERY AFFECTIONATE ABOUT DOCTORS THEY KNEW GLFS THE BACKLASH FOR JEW OH, SURE. THEY WERE LIKE, "WHO'S THE WEASLEY LOOKING GUY? WHO'S THIS? I LIKED THE LAST GUY. THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR ME. THIS SHOW IS DEAD TO ME! I RESIGN FROM THE INTERNET! SEND." AND THAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME. AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A SHOW THAT HAS A LOT OF ENTHUSIASTIC FOLLOWERS. YOU KNOW, SURE, SURE, JULIE IS FROM A DIFFERENT GENDER THAN ANYONE WHO HAS DONE BEFORE. BUT THAT WILL BE IRRELEVANT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ONCE SHE TAKES THE PART.
Stephen: THE DOCTOR IS AN ALIEN.
THE DOCTOR CAN BE WHATEVER HE NEEDS TO BE. IT'S ABOUT FINDING THE RIGHT PERFORMER AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THAT'S JULIE WITHOUT A DOUBT.
Stephen: DID YOU WATCH "DOCTOR WHO" GROWING UP?
IT WAS HUGELY IMPORTANT TO ME. IT WAS THE SHOW WHERE THE HEROs WASN'T A JOKE. AND AS SOMEONE SITTING IN PAISLEY WITH A SNOTTY NOSE AND GLASSES WITH TAPE. THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
Stephen: BOND IS A JOCK.
EXACTLY. I LOVED BOND, TOO, BUT I COULD BE THE DOCTOR. TURNS OUT I WAS.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ).
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. NOW "BROADCHURCH--" GO AHEAD.
BECAUSE IT'S-- AND THE WORLD HAS DEFINITELY MOVED ON. I WAS DOWN AT COMIC-CON A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, AND IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A BIG THING. THIS WHOLE GENRE STUFF IS SO MASSIVELY IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD AND THE ENTERTAINMENT WORLD. HOLLYWOOD COMES TO SAN DIEGO TO BEG FOR THE ATTENTION OF THESE PEOPLE. AND YOU LOOK OUT AND YOU THINK, THE GEEKS HAVE INHERITED THE EARTH. THIS IS WHAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS WHAT I WAS DREAMING OF.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, "BROADCHURCH," THIS IS THE-- THE THIRD SEASON.
YES, IT IS.
Stephen: LAST SEASON.
IT IS.
Stephen: WHY NOT JUST KEEP RIDING THIS PONY? IT'S A GREAT SHOW, DO 22 SEASONS. DO SPIN-OFFS, "CSI:  BROADCHURCH," "BROADCHURCH MIAMI."
IT'S A PECULIAR BRITISH THING. WE SEE SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND WE RUN FROM IT. YOU HEARD OF BREXIT.
Stephen: I DID. I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO. IF IT'S WORKS AND IT'S SOLAND I HAD MAKES MONEY AND IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONE IN IT, ABANDON IT IMMEDIATELY.
Stephen: WELL, HERE'S ONE OF THE GREAT, EXCITING PROJECTS ON YOUR HORIZON. HAVE YOU STARTED THIS YET?
WE'RE ON SEASON TWO.
Stephen: SEASON TWO, ARE YOU SCROOGE McDUCK IN THE REBOOT OF "DUCK TAILS."
THANK YOU.
Stephen: QUITE AN HONOR. YET ANOTHER, "DOCTOR WHO," AND SCRIEWJ McDUCK.
Stephen: I'M RACKING UP THE ICONS.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU PREP TO BE SCROOGE McDUCK. DO YOU WALK AROUND WITH NO PANTS IN A TOP HAT? WHAT IS IT? HOW DO YOU PREP TO PLAY A DUCK?
WELL, I ONLY HAD A FORTNIGHT SO I NESTED WITH SOME MALLARDS FOR A WHILE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
AND I SAT ON SOME EGGS. THERE'S NOT A LOT YOU CAN DO. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RESEARCH. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF BILLIONARY DUCK S.
Stephen:  YOU ALREADY HAVE THE McDUCK ACCENT. YOU HAVE THE SCOTTISH ACCENT DOWN.
THE ACCENT DOES COME FREE FOR ME, YES. SO I HAD THAT.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE NOTICED ABOUT SCROOGE McDUCK IS HE A BILLIONAIRE TYCOON AND HIS NAME IS ON A LOT OF BRANDS AND HE EMPLOYEEAISE LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS. AND THAT SOUNDED FAMILIAR TO US.
WELL, IT'S FANTASY. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: IT'S TOTAL FANTASY. EXACTLY. WE HAVE SOME QUOTES HERE. SOME OF THE QUOTES ARE BY SCROOGE McDUCK, AND SOME OF THE QUOTES ARE BY DONALD TRUMP. AND I WAS HOPING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.
SURE, SURE.
Stephen: IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, IF YOU WOULD JUST READ THEM AS SCROOGE McDUCK.
SURE, SURE,.
Stephen: AND I WILL IDENTIFY WHO IT IS AFTER.
YOU'RE GOING TO GUESS, WILL YOU?
Stephen: I KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE THE TEACHER'S TEST OVER HERE.
WHERE SHOULD I LOOK.
Stephen: THAT LOOKS GOOD RIGHT THERE.
Stephen: NUMBER ONE.
MY MONEY'S THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD.
Stephen: THAT IS SCROOGE McDUCK. OKAY? NEXT ONE.
THE POINT IS, YOU CAN'T BE TOO GREEDY.
Stephen: THAT'S DONALD TRUMP.
OBVIOUSLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY, NEXT ONE.
YOU'RE FIRED. AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU'VE DISCOVERED THE JOY OF THE ENCHANTMENT, THE SHEER ECSTASY OF MAKING BIG BUCKS.

I DID GET TO TRAVEL WITH MY HUSBAND A LITTLE BIT WHICH WAS NICE. WE WENT-- WAIT, WAIT. STOP IT! I'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT! WHERE DID WE GO? OH, NO, NO, NO. WE WENT TO MEXICO. YEAH, WE WENT TO CANCUN, AND WE GOT TO SWIM IN THE UNDERGROUND CAVES.
Stephen: THAT'S DANGEROUS.
YOU'RE TELLING ME! YOU KNOW BLACK PEOPLE DON'T SWIM! I WAS SO NERVOUS!
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT, ACTUALLY.
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT. GOOD TO KNOW.
FUN TRIVIA FACT.

BOOM.
Stephen: WE FIRST GOT TO KNOW-- I FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOUR WORK IN "RENO 911". ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT SHOW, GREAT SHOW, WAS ON FOR SHEERS. AS RANESHA--
WILLIAMS.
Stephen: THAT SHOW, A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT WAS IMPROVISED, WASN'T IT?
THE WHOLE SHOW WAS IMPROVISED, HOWEVER IT WAS MY FIRST TIME DOING IT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IMPROV WAS, AND I'M FROM LOS ANGELES, BUT I'M FROM ALL THE RADDEDY PARTS. I NEVER HEARD OF GROUND LINGS OR SECOND CITY. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IMPROV WAS. BUT I CALLED MY FRIEND BIG GEORGE, AND I SAID, WHAT THE HECK DO I HAVE TO DO? WHAT IS IMPROV? WHAT IS SKETCH?" AND HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO. AND I WENT AND I DID IT. BUT I LIED, YOU KNOW. BECAUSE WHEN THEY CALL AND THEY SAY, "DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT?" YOU KNOW WHAT YOU STAY,"OF COURSE!"
Stephen: THEY SAID DO YOU IMPROVISE?
AND I SAID, OF COURSE. I DO ALL OF IT. AND THEN I CALL SOMEBODY AND GOT A REAL QUICK LESSON ON WHAT I HAD TO DO.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT? I WOULD LOVE A REFRESHER COURSE?
HE SAID YOU HAVE TO DO CHARACTER AND YOU HAVE TO THINK-- YOU KNOW, IMPROV YOU MAKE THE WORDS UP AS YOU GO, OFF THE CUFF. AND I SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE. I'VE BEEN ARGUING WITH MY EX-HUSBAND FOR YEARS. I KNOW HOW TO THINK ON MY FEET. I'M GOING TO GET THAT DAMN JOB!"
Stephen: SOMETHING NICE THAT CAME OUT OF THAT. YOU STARTED OFF AS A SERIOUS ACTOR, RIGHT?
NO I WANTED TO BE A VERY SERIOUS ACTOR, BUT NO ONE WOULD TAKE ME SERIOUSLY. I WANTED TO DO DRAMA. THEY SAID, "OH." "THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M OKAY. I STILL GOT SOME WORK YOU ALL. BUT NO ONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY. I WOULD GO INTO AUDITIONS WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DRAMATIC, AND THEY WOULD LAUGH. THEY THOUGHT I WAS SO FUNNY. AND ( LAUGHTER ) SEE? BUT HERE'S THE THING. BEING FUNNY WAS NOT A GOOD THING IN MY HOUSE. OKAY?
Stephen: GROWING UP?
RIGHT. BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET REWARDED FOR THAT. I GOT PINCHED IN CHURCH. AND I WOULD COME HOME WITH "TALKS TOO MUCH" ON MY REPORT CARD. AND MY WORTH WAS LIKE, "WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" "I WAS TELLING JOKES." SHE SAID, GO GET THE BELT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S FUNNY." THAT'S BACK WHEN YOU COULD STILL WHIP YOUR KIDS AND IT WAS ALL RIGHT. IT WASN'T A GOOD THING, SO I DIDN'T KNOW BEING FUNNY WAS A THING.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD MAKE MONEY DOING THAT?
I DID NOT. WHO KNEW.
Stephen: IT'S A PRETTY GOOD LIVING--
THE SAME FOR YOU.
Stephen: WHAT?
I HEARD THE SAME FOR YOU, THAT YOU WANTED TO DO DRAMA?
Stephen: SURE, I WANTED TO BE HAMLET. NO ONE WANTED TO PAY ME TO DO THAT, THOUGH, STRANGELY. I KEPT ON GETTING CHECKS TO DO COMEDY. AND I WENT, "I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN TO BE ABLE TO EAT."
SEE, SEE? I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
Stephen: THERE WAS A REASON BEFORE I WENT INTO COMEDY I WEIGHED 135 POUNDS.
AND LOOK AT US NOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I GOT THE THICKNESS. I GOT THE THICKNESS.
YES!
Stephen: NOW, "CLAWS" ON TNT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU!
Stephen: BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, IT TAKES PLACE-- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A SALON OF YOUR OWN. YOU WERE IN THE BEAUTY BUSINESS FOR A LITTLE BIT YOURSELF, WEREN'T YOU? DIDN'T YOU DO HAIR?
OKAY, "BEAUTY BUSINESS" IS A STRONG TERM, OKAY? LET'S JUST BE CLEAR. I BOUGHT MY BOOKS IN COLLEGE BY BEING WHAT I CALLED A "KITCHEN BEAUTICIAN." WHICH MEANS YOU DO HAIR AND MAKEUP FOR PEOPLE-- AT LEAST I DID-- WITHOUT A LICENSE. DON'T JUDGE ME. I WAS-- I WAS HUNGRY.
Stephen: SURE.
RIGHT! AND I NEEDED BOOKS. SO THAT'S WHAT I DID. AND ONLY ONCE DID I HAVE A BAD ACCIDENT WHERE-- ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. STOP IT! EVERYBODY, STOP IT! OKAY, SO, DO YOU KNOW-- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEN A BLACK WOMAN GETS A WEAVE.
Stephen: I HAVE A GENERAL IDEA, A GENERAL IDEA.
OKAY, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU HOW YOU KNOW OFF CAMERA. BUT HERE'S THE THING.  ( APPLAUSE ) HEY!
Stephen: I WAS YOUNG. OKAY.
BUT THE LADY HAD THE BRAIDS UNDERNEATH, AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO TRY TO TAKE THEM OUT, YOU KNOW, SO I COULD PUT THE EXTENSIONS ON. BUT I CUT THE BRAID IN HALF. SO WHEN I TOOK IT OUT, A BIG THING OF HER HAIR CAME OUT.
Stephen: WAS JUST GONE?
RIGHT. AND I BECAME AN ACTOR ON THE SPOT. ( LAUGHTER ) I SAID, "GIRL, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TO YOUR HAIR?" "MY. I'M GOING TO GET YOU SOME CREAM BECAUSE-- ARE YOU STRESSED? YOU STRESSED OUT? YOU DONE BROKE YOUR HAIR DOWN TO THE NUB." YEAH, I JUST BLAMED IT ON HER.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE WHAT "CLAWS" IS ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS IN "CLAWS"?
OKAY, "CLAWS--" I PLAY A WOMAN WHO-- I RUN A NAIL SALON, BUT I'M-- LAUNDERING MONEY FOR THE DIXIE MAFIA. THERE, I SAID IT.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE "DIXIE MAFIA?" THEY MAKE ALL THEIR MONEY OFF OF CUPS? WHAT IS DIXIE MAFIA?
WELL, IT'S LIKE-- A MAFIA FOR REDNECKS.
Stephen: OH, OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SOUTHERN --
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
FOLK.
Stephen: SURE, YEAH.
AND I'M LAUNDERING MONEY FOR THE DIXIE MAFIA. I WANT TO GET OUT.
Stephen: BUT?
BUT THEY KEEP --
Stephen: PULLING YOU BACK IN.
PULLING ME BACK IN, YES.
Stephen: EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE CLAWS.
WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT'S THE VOICE? I NEVER-- OKAY, WAIT. CLAAAW.
Stephen: THEY LOOK DANGEROUS ALMOST. ON THE SHOW-- ON THE SHOW, THESE ARE QUITE LOVELY. ON THE SHOW THEY'RE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS LOOKING.
OH, VERY MUCH. BUT I'M GOING TO BORROW THAT FROM YOU-- CLAAAWS.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NICE TO SEE YOU. THE "CLAWS" SEASON FINALE AIRS THIS SUNDAY ON TNT. NIECY NASHEVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. LATE SHOW."
