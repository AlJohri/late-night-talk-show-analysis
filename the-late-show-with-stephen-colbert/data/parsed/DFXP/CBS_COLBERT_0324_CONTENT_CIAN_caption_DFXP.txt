Stephen: HEY, HEY, IT SAYS HERE STEVE MARTIN IS TEACHING A MASTER CLASS IN COMEDY. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO LEARN FROM THE BEST. I'M SIGNING UP RIGHT NOW, AND MASTER.
HI, I'M STEVE MARTIN. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS, IT MEANS I AM DEAD.
Stephen: WHAT! OH, MY GOD!
OH, SORRY, THAT'S A DIFFERENT VIDEO. YEAH, SO YOU WANT TO BE A MASTER COMEDIAN.
Stephen: YEAH, I DO.
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT COMEDY-- SETUPS, PUNCH LEANS, FUNNY CONSONANTS LIKE "K," AS IN KAKA. DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: I HOST "THE LATE SHOW"" ON CBS.
WE CAN FIX THAT.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
NO, I DON'T WANT TO. LET'S GET A LITTLE BUSINESS OUT OF THE WAY. TYPE IN YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER.
Stephen: OKAY.

Stephen: REALLY?
COMPANY NEEDS IT. NAME OF YOUR FIRST PET. COMPANY NEED IT. URINE SAMPLE.
Stephen: COMPANY NEEDS IT?
NO, THAT'S FOR ME. FOR YOUR FIRST LESSON ON BEING A GREAT STAND-UP COMEDIAN.
Stephen: SHOULD I STAND UP.
WHY.
Stephen: IF I WANT TO BE A STAND-UP COMEDIAN, I THINK I SHOULD STAND UP.
NEVER HEARD OF THAT, BUT, HEY, GIVE IT A TRY.
Stephen: HOW'S THIS?
HMMM, NOT SO GOOD, NOT SO GOOD.
Stephen: STEVE MARTIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE GITOOK THE LIBERTY OF SIGNING YOU UP FOR THE DELUXE PACKAGE.
Stephen: HOW MUCH IS THAT?
YOU HAVE A LIFETIME TO PAY FOR IT.
Stephen: SHOULDN'T I KNOW THE PRICE.
AM I! I LIKE THE IDEA OF STANDING UP. LOOKING GOOD, LOOKED GOOD. ARCH THE BACK A LITTLE BIT. BRING THE ARM OUT, RELAX THE HAND. LOOK AT ME, BEND THE KNEES, A LITTLE BIT LOOSE.
Stephen: IS THIS RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT?
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT? WHO'S THE MASTER HERE.
Stephen: YOU ARE, STEVE.
NOW YOU'RE READY TO MAKE YOUR FIRST WITTICISM, SOMETHING I THINK VERY UNIVERSAL, SOMETHING THAT WORKS IN ALL AGES AND ALL ACROSS THE EXPANSE OF THE UNIVERSE, BUT ALSO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY LOCAL AND NARROW. YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: I THINK SO SO.
OKAY, GOOD, GIVE IT A SHOT.
Stephen: IF DOGS ARE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND AND DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND, THEN A DOG MADE OF DIAMONDS MUST HAVE SOIM FRIENDS.
WHOA! OUCH! NOW, LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. ONE PIECE AT A TIME.
Stephen: IF DOGS ARE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND.
DOGS ARE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND!
Stephen: IF DOGS ARE A MAN'S BEST FRIEND!
GOOD.
Stephen: AND DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.
AND DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.
Stephen: DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND!
WATCH THE ELBOW.
Stephen: THEN A DOG MADE UP OF DIAMONDS MUST HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS!
WOW, STEPHEN, THE STUDENT HAS BECOME THE MASTER ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: REALLY? YOU MADE ME A MASTER THAT FAST?
MY LITTLE BABY IS ALL GROWN UP. WELL, I GOTTA GO.
Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I'M GOING TO HELP SEAN SPICER ABOUT HIS IMPRESSION OF MELISSA McCARTHY. SEE YA!
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY IT'S STEPHEN  COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, CHRIS! HEY, PAUL! LOVELY GROUP OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW JON, YOU CAN BACK ME UP ON THIS. A LOT OF THINGS WE TALK ABOUT ON THIS SHOW. A LOT OF THINGS I COME HERE AND SPOKE ABOUT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, OVER THE LAST 300 SHOWS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, FROM THE START OF THE SHOW. THERE'S ONE THING I HAVEN'T DONE ON THIS SHOW AND THAT'S TALK ABOUT BILL O'REILLY. HE COMES ON THE SHOW, WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. WE HAVE NICE CONVERSATIONS, BUT I TALKED ABOUT HIM FOR, LIKE, 10 YEARS, AND I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH. BUT I DO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND TODAY THE TWO WORLDS COLLIDED WHEN TRUMP STUCK HIS, LET'S SAY FINGER, INTO O'REILLY'S STICKY SITUATION. SEE, ON SATURDAY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED THAT FOX NEWS HAS SPENT MORE THAN $13 MILLION TO SETTLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUITS AGAINST BILL O'REILLY, ALTHOUGH O'REILLY SAYS THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM ARE WITHOUT MERIT. OKAY, "NEW YORK TIMES"? WHAT HAPPENED TO INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN TO HAVE $13 MILLION? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT, BUT, THAT'S $13 MILLION-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S $13 MILLION MORE INNOCENT THAN I AM, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. BUT $13 MILLION MIGHT JUST BE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG-- THOUGH THE TIP IS THE MOST SENSITIVE PART OF THE ICEBERG-- ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY? ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY OVER THERE? JUST KEEP BREATHING, JON. HERE WE GO. BECAUSE MORE THAN 30 COMPANIES HAVE WITHDRAWN THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS FROM "THE O'REILLY FACTOR," INCLUDING ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BMW, MERCEDES BENZ, UNTUCKIT SHIRTS, AND A MARKETING SERVICE CALLED CONSTANT CONTACT. WHO HAVE NOW HAD TO CHANGE THEIR NAME TO "CONSTANT CONSENSUAL CONTACT." HERE'S WHERE THE WORLDS COLLIDE. O'REILLY'S IN A REAL PICKLE, BUT TODAY DONALD TRUMP'S GOT HIS BACK. THE PRESIDENT TOLD THE "TIMES," "HE IS A GOOD PERSON. I THINK HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SETTLED. I DON'T THINK BILL DID ANYTHING WRONG."
Audience: BOOO!
Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT-- HOLD ON. MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO REMIND YOU, YOU JUST DECLARED APRIL SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH. AND THERE ARE TWO ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT I'M AWARE OF: BILL O'REILLY, AND YOURS. SO MAYBE-- I'M GOING OUT ON A LIMB HERE-- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT THE PERFECT PERSON TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ONE. DO YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT BE BETTER? YOUR DAUGHTER IVANKA SEEMS TO HAVE A VERY ENLIGHTENED APPROACH TO THESE ISSUES. I LIKE WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. THIS MORNING, IVANKA TRUMP APPEARED ON "CBS THIS MORNING," AND GAYLE KING ASKED HER ABOUT HER RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER FATHER'S POLICIES.
YOU HEAR THE PHRASE "COMPLICIT," THAT JARED AND IVANKA ARE COMPLICIT IN WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. CAN YOU JUST WEIGH IN ON HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
IF BEING COMPLICIT IS WANTING TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD AND TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT, THEN I'M COMPLICIT.
Stephen: NOPE, THAT'S NOT WHAT "COMPLICIT" MEANS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, LET ME SEE HERE. I HAVE A DICTIONARY RIGHT HERE. I HAVE A DICTIONARY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE HERE. COLLABORATIONIST, COWARDLY-- HERE WE GO-- COMPLICIT: "INVOLVED WITH "INVOLVED WITH OTHERS IN AN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY OR WRONGDOING." OH, WAIT, IT DOES HAVE "BEING A FORCE FOR GOOD AND MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT," UNDER "COMPLICIT, COMMA, TOTAL OPPOSITE OF." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) OKAY, YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T JUST REVERSE THE DEFINITION TO MAKE YOURSELF SOUND BETTER. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "IF BEING A NAZI MEANS FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, THEN, YEAH, I'M A HUGE NAZI." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THERE'S NO WAY! THERE'S NO WAY WHAT I SAID WILL EVER BE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT, RIGHT? OKAY, I'M SAFE. THEN IVANKA ELABORATED ON THE KIND OF INFLUENCE SHE HAS ON THE PRESIDENT.
CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH HIM ON AND THAT YOU THINK THAT BY SPEAKING UP TO HIM, IT MADE HIM CHANGE HIS POSITION OR SOFTEN HIS POSITION? ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?
I THINK THAT FOR ME THIS ISN'T ABOUT PROMOTING MY VIEWPOINTS. I WASN'T ELECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE PRESIDENT.
Stephen: TO BE FAIR, YOUR FATHER WASN'T ELECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EITHER-- JUST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S PRESIDENT. I'M NOT SAYING HE'S NOT PRESIDENT, BUT WE DIDN'T-- YOU-- DO THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A DIVIDED NATION. THAT IS CLEAR. WE HAVE A DEEPLY DIVIDED NATION. BUT TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE HAS COME TOGETHER TO JOIN THE PROTEST AGAINST THE NEW PROTEST AD FROM PEPSI. HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN IT? HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THE AD? LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH IT. IT STARTS WITH A THRONG OF BEAUTIFUL, MULTIETHNIC PEOPLE PROTESTING IN THE STREETS OF, I'M GOING TO GUESS NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND. ( LAUGHTER ) SO FAR, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS CAUSED ALL OF AMERICA'S HOT EXTRAS TO TAKE TO THE STREETS, BUT I'M GUESSING IT'S A PROTEST FOR "ATTRACTIVE LIVES MATTER." ( LAUGHTER ) HAVE YOU SEEN THIS THING? AND THE SIGNS THEY'RE HOLDING AREN'T MUCH HELP FIGURING THINGS OUT. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE"PEACE," AND THE PEACE SYMBOL, AND "JOIN THE CONVERSATION." "JOIN THE CONVERSATION." THAT'S THE MOST CORPORATE MESSAGE OF ALL TIME. THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE HOLDING SIGNS THAT SAY, "WE ARE ALL THE CORE DEMOGRAPHIC." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. BUT AT FIRST-- STOP IT! BUT AT FIRST, A FIRST THIS WAS A MOVEMENT WITHOUT A LEADER UNTIL THE PROTEST ROUTE JUST HAPPENED TO PASS BY KENDALL JENNER DOING A FASHION SHOOT FOR ALUMINUM SIDING. THEN SHE MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH A CUTE BOY WHO BROUGHT HIS CELLO TO A PROTEST. THIS PROMPTS HER TO RIP OFF HER BLONDE WIG, GIVE IT TO HER ASSISTANT, AND JOIN THE CONVERSATION. JIM, CAN WE GET A CLOSE OF THE ASSISTANT SHE GIVES THE WIG TO? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OH, SHE IS NOT THRILLED ABOUT BEING KENDALL'S WIG CADDY. SHE MIGHT WANT TO JOIN A CONSERVATION WITH HER AGENT ABOUT FINDING A BETTER ACTING JOB. ONCE KENDALL JENNER HAS MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE OF WIPING OFF HER LIPSTICK, IT'S SUPER FUN, UNTIL THE MARCH MEETS THE WORLD'S LEAST-INTIMIDATING POLICE FORCE. THEY'RE ALSO EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE. WATCH OUT, KENDALL. THOSE UNARMED COPS MIGHT START STRIPPING! ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ LUCKILY-- YOU CAN'T AFFORD ME! ( LAUGHTER ) LUCKILY, MS. JENNER, A WEALTHY, YOUNG, WHITE WOMAN, KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO HANDLE POLICE AT A PROTEST. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: YEAH! THEY DID IT! YES, WE CAN, OF PEPSI! THIS COMMERCIAL ENDS WITH A MESSAGE EVEN MORE PROFOUND THAN "JOIN THE CONVERSATION": "LIVE FOR NOW." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK I'M READING THAT CORRECTLY. IS THAT HOW YOU'RE-- FOR NOW?
Jon: FOR NOW.
Stephen: YES, "LIVE-- LIVE FOR NOW," ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PEPSI'S MARKETING DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOR LONG. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SIGOURNEY WEAVER IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL HELP YOU DO YOUR TAXES. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND AND JON BATISTE!
Jon: HEY! HEY!

BECAUSE TAX TIME IS HERE, IT'S SOMETHING IN AMERICA THAT EVERYONE HAS T IN AMERICA WHO ISN'T THE PRESIDENT HAS TO DO. FOR MY TRAINING I SAT DOWN WITH 27-YEAR VETERAN AND DIRECTOR OF H&R BLOCK, BRUCE DESMOND. WHAT IS H&R BLOCK?
WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE TAX FIRM IN THE COUNTRY. WE DO MORE TAX RETURNS THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
Stephen: I BLACKED OUT THERE. WHEN YOU SAID TAX RETURNS, WHAT DOES H&R BLOCK DO?

UH-HUH, NO, WE TEND TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE, I BELIEVE.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE RULES ABOUT SLEEPING WITH CLIENTS?
NOT ALLOWED.
Stephen: NOT ALLOWED OR FROWNED UPON?
I WOULD HAVE TO ASK OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN AFFAIR WITH A CLIENT?
NO.
Stephen: YOU'RE UNDER OATH. I REMIND YOU, YOU'RE UNDER OATH.
I'M 30 YEARS MARRY GLD WELL, I DIDN'T ASK THAT, BRUCE. DIDN'T ASK THAT. OKAY. ARE WE ALLOWED TO EVEN DATE THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE HELPING?

OKAY, I'M SURE YOU'LL DO A GREAT JOB.
Stephen: THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. BUT FIRST, THE GLAM SQUAD HAD TO MAKE ME UNRECOGNIZABLE TO CUSTOMERS. SO I BECAME TAX PROFESSIONAL OTOSANCHEZ. I SLIPPED INTO THE H&R BLOCK THAT WOULD BECOME MY OFFICE, UNDETECTED, AND I WAS READY TO START HELPING. LILY?

IT'S MUTUAL.
Stephen: IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. LOVELY TO HAVE YOU BACK.
YES, IT'S BEEN SO LONG!
Stephen: YOU WERE HERE FOUR, FIVE MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
I THINK SO.
Stephen: I THINK IT WAS AFTER TRUMP HAD BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
YES, IT WAS.
Stephen: BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN THE OVAL OFFICE. YOU WERE A LITTLE ANXIOUS AT THE TIME?
REALLY.
Stephen: YES. ( LAUGHTER ) ARE YOU STILL ANXIOUS, OR ARE YOU HEAVILY MEDICATED? AND FOLLOW-UP QUESTION-- DID YOU BRING ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DEALING WITH IT, MISS WEAVER?
ANXIOUS AND HEAVILY MEDICATE GLD OKAY, GOOD, GOOD. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DEALING WITH IT?
ACTUALLY, I FINISHED A JOB AND WENT ON VACATION IN HAWAII.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE.
WITH MY HUSBAND, AND WE HAD A KIND OF HEALTH BREAK FROM THE NEWS. WE HAD A KIND OF M.O.T.-- MET OUT TRUMP RESPITE, WHICH ACTUALLY AS MADE ME FEEL MUCH BETTER. I KNOW IT'S SELFISH, AND I'M IN DENIAL.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T LEAVE US HERE ALONE. NO GETTING-- NO ONE HERE GETS OUT, SIGOURNEY WEAVER.
BELIEVE ME, IT CATCHES UP VERY QUICKLY.
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU GO TO GET AWAY?
WE WENT TO HAWAII.
Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT'S STILL IN THE UNITED STATES, RIGHT? HE'S STILL PRESIDENT OF THERE, TOO.
HE MAY NOT KNOW THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AFTER-- AFTER THEY ALSO BARRED HIS LAST BAN, HE MAY JUST GET RID OF THEM.
Stephen: THEY MIGHT JUST SAW HIM OFF AND PUSH HIM OUT TO SEA. HOW LONG WERE YOU OFF THE GRID THERE?
WELL, ACTUALLY, LIKE, A MONTH. THAT'S LIKE THE LONGEST TIME.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LOVELY?
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I WAS ALMOST ARNTION FRAYED TO COME BACK. I WAS NOT SURE I COULD FUNCTION.
Stephen: WHAT PERIOD OF TIME?
I JUST GOT-- I CAME BACK FOR YOU.
Stephen: OH, WOW. WHAT AN HONOR. WHAT AN HONOR.
OKAY.
Stephen: SO WHAT ARE YOU-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEXT? ARE YOU GOING SOMEPLACE ?ELS I UNDERSTAND YOU JUST WENT TO CUBA.
I DID JUST GO TO CUBA!
Stephen: I WENT TO CUBA, TOO.
WOW!
Stephen: IT'S FASCINATING DOWN THERE.
AMAZING.
Stephen:  WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS-- WELL, I WAS WITH MOSTLY MUSICIANS BECAUSE I WENT DOWN WITH RECORD ARVHIVISTS THAT I MET AT MY LOCAL RECORD STORE EYE KNOW THERE WEREN'T MANY. SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT REALLY-- IT WAS A GLORIOUS PLACE, AND SUCH AMAZING PEOPLE.
Stephen: I CAN ASK YOU JUST-- WHAT DID YOU EXPECT BEFORE YOU WENT THERE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT YOU SAW?
I-- I-- I CERTAINLY KNEW THAT THERE WAS-- THAT THEY HAD A VERY FINE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT A CLASSICAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THEY HAD, ESPECIALLY FOR ARTISTS. ALL MUSICIANS AND PAINTERS. THEY'RE ALL GIVEN A VERY SERIOUS CLASSICAL EDUCATION. ACTUALLY, IT'S IN AN ART SCHOOL BUILT ON THE GOLF COURSE THAT THEY GOT RID OF THE GOLF COURSE AFTER THE REVOLUTION, AND BUILT THIS BIG, WOMB-LIKE-- IT'S LITERALLY, YOU KIND OF WALK INTO THE VAGINA-LIKE OPENING. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GO IN --
Stephen: I DID NOT GET THIS TOUR. TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOUR.
AFTER, LIKE, 10 YEARS, THEN YOU EMERGE FULL GROWN AS AN ART GLIFT AND YOU CAN GO TO ANY LEVEL OF EDUCATION YOU WANT AND THEY'LL PAY FOR IT.
I THINK SO.
Stephen: AND HAVANA IS LIKE 1957.
I KNOW. DID YOU GET IN ONE OF THOSE GLARS, OF COURSE, ABSOLUTELY.
OURS STALLED AND WE HAD TO GET OUT AND ALL GIVE A PUSH.
Stephen: AGAIN, I THINK YOU BOT A BETTER TOUR THAN I DID. THAT SOUNDS LEAK A LOT OF FUN.
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE MY RECORD STORE IS AND YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR NEXT YEAR.
Stephen: THAT SOUTHBOUND LIKE FUN. HAVE YOU STARTING SHOOTING THE NEW "AVATAR" YET?
NO.
Stephen: JAMES CAMERON IS NOT OUT THERE A A PISTOL. YOU CAN TELL ME. THERE'S NO RED DOT ON YOUR FOREHEAD. HAVE YOU STARTED SHOOTING THE "AVATAR" MOVIE, SENATOR YES OR NO?
I HAVE NOT. AND IF I SAID THAT YESTERDAY IN AN INTERVIEW, I WAS WRONG.
Stephen: OH, YOU SAID-- I UNDERSTAND.
WE HAVE NOT STARTED.
Stephen: BUT YOU WILL START AT SOME POINT.
I'M SURE WE WILL START AT SOME POINT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. AND IT'S GOING TO BE FABULOUS.
Stephen: I KNOW. OF COURSE IT IS. IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, YOUR NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THE ASSIGNMENT," WHICH TOOK DECADES TO MAKE. IT'S A BIT AFTERNOON ODD STORY. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. YOU CAN SET UP THE CLIP AND SOMEWHAT EXPLAIN WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT?
SO IT'S A-- A NOIR FILM, AND IT'S-- IT'S MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ PLAYS A HIT MAN NAMED FRANK WHO JUST KILLS PEOPLE, AND HE IS SORT OF THE DREGS OF HUMANITY.
Stephen: AS THEY ARE.
EXPHEEFS AN ORPHAN AND HE NEVER HAD AN EDUCATION.
Stephen: DON'T MAKE EXCUSES. ( LAUGHTER ).
ANYWAY, HE KILLS MY CHARACTER'S BROTHER, ASSASSINATES HIM. SO MY CHARACTER IS A VERY FINE SURGEON WHO DOES GENDER REPLACEMENT SURGERIES, AND THAT IS SORT OF HER LIFE AND WHAT SHE DOES. AND SHE'S SO KIND OF BROKEN BUT WHAT FRANK DOES TO HER BROTHER, THAT SHE EXACTS REVENGE. SHE HAS HIM KIDNAPPED AND TURNS HIM INTO A WOMAN. PARTIALLY TO SEE IF THAT WILL CHANGE HIS CHARACTER, BUT ALSO BECAUSE SHE'S QUITE UNSTRUNG HERSELF. SHE'S IN AN INSANE ASYLUM. IT'S A DARK-- IT'S A DARK-- ( LAUGHTER ) A DARK, JUICY, GORGEOUS "B" MOVIE, AND MICHELE JUST ROCKS IT. SHE IS SO AWESOME AS FRANK AND WHATEVER-- I CAN'T-- FRANCESCA.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE WHERE I THINK YOUR CHARACTER IS EXPLAINING HER MOTIVATION.
I'M HUGELY SYMPATHETIC TO THOSE WHO WANT AND CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN GENDER REASSIGNMENT. BUT NORMALLY, THAT WOULD NEVER INCLUDE FRANK. HE WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE TYPE OF MAN WHO REVELED IN MURDEROUS ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS HIS MASCULINITY. BUT AS TIME WENT BY, THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT THE SITUATION, I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT THE MAN. HE WAS AN ABANDONED CHILD WHO HAD BECOME A WARD OF THE STATE, CONDEMNED TO LIVE ON THE STREETS AT AN EARLY AGE. I HAVE THE TRADITIONAL, ROMANTIC, NOSTALGIA FOR THE IDEA THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SECOND CHANCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOT THE SECOND CHANCE HE WAS LOOKING FOR.
NO, NOT WHAT HE IMAGINED. BUT IT'S A WALTER HILL MOVIE, WHO IS ONE OF OUR GREAT DIRECTORS AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO SEE IT.
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU AS USUAL. I HOPE WE CAN GET TOGETHER AND HAVE SOME MOHEATOS NEXT TIME.
I HOPE SO. I BECAME VERY FOND OF THEM.
Stephen: THEY SERVE THEM FOR BREAKFAST OVER THERE. "THE ASSIGNMENT" IS IN SELECT THEATERS AND AVAILABLE ON DEMAND THIS FRIDAY. SIGOURNEY WEAVER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SOME COMPLAINTS BY YOUR FAVORITE CELEBRITIES. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S NO SECRET THAT WE HERE AT THE "LATE SHOW" A LOT OF FAMOUS PEOPLE COME THROUGH, AND THEY USUALLY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TIME. BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT UPSET EVEN THE FAMOUS. WE LET THEM GET THOSE OFF THEIR CHESTS IN OUR SEGMENT, CELEBRITY PET PEEVES.
I HATE IT WHEN SOMEONE SITS RIGHT NEXT TO ME AT THE MOVIES WHEN THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER SEATS AVAILABLE. LIKE, I GET IT-- YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND, BUT I WANT MY OWN ARMREST.
I HATE IT WHEN COPS PULL ME OVER AND SAY, "MA'AM, YOU CAN'T BE OUT ON THIS HIGHWAY WITHOUT A CAR."
ONE TIME I WAS AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE, AND I WAS AFRAID OF HIS COFFEE TABLE. ( LAUGHTER ).
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASSUME THAT I'M JUST LIKE TAMMY TAYLOR, FROM "FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS" BUT I'M NOT BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY REALLY MORE LIKE LANDRY, AND THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE WE BOTH KILLED A GUY AND COVERED IT UP. ( LAUGHTER )
I REALLY HATE IT WHEN I GO OVER TO OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND THEY HAVE COFFEE TABLES THAT ARE MADE OF GLASS BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO BRACK IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
IT IRKS WHEN PEOPLE COME UP AND SAY, "ARE YOU CHARLIE ROSE?" WELL, NO, I'M NOT. THAT'S JUST MY TV NAME. IN MY PERSONAL LIFE, I GO BY CHUCK ROSE.
I'VE OFTEN FOUND MYSELF AT OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES TRYING NOT TO DESTROY THEIR COFFEE TABLE.
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE ASSUME JUST BECAUSE I'M BRITISH THAT I'M FRIENDS WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY. THAT IS AN OFFENSIVE STEREOTYPE. NOW, DO I SIT WITH THE QUEEN OCCASIONALLY AND BREAK OPEN HALF A BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY AND WATCH "DR. WHO?" YES, BUT WE HATE EACH OTHER. WE HATE WATCH. WE BOTH LOVE "DR. WHO" BUT WE HATE EACH OTHER. s WOMAN IS A STRAIGHT-UP BITCH. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE HOSTS OF "POD SAVE AMERICA." ♪ ♪ ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUESTS ARE THREE FORMER OBAMA STAFFERS WHO NOW HOST ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PODCASTS IN THE NATION. FROM "POD SAVE AMERICA," PLEASE WELCOME JON FAVREAU JON LOVETT, AND TOMMY VIETOR! JON. THERE YOU GO. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. JON FAVREAU, BUT NOT THE JON FAVREAU. JON LOVETT, BUT NOT THAT JON LOVETT, AND TOMMY VIETOR, BUT THAT ONE OVER THERE. YOU GUYS FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW WHO HAVEN'T HEARD YOUR GREAT PODCAST, YOU GUYS WERE SPEECH ITS WRITERS AND A SPOKESMAN. YOU GUYS WERE SPEECHWRITERS AND YOU WERE A SPOKESMAN FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.  ( APPLAUSE ) WE ARE-- YOU GUYS ARE AN EASY BAIT. ( LAUGHTER ) SO YOU GUYS HELPED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, OBAMA, EXPRESS HIMSELF AND GET HIS IDEAS AND HIS POLICIES ACROSS. WHAT IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP YOU WERE ASKED TO WRITE A SPEECH ABOUT TO TRY TO SELL? BECAUSE THERE HAD TO BE TIMES YOU WERE LIKE, "REALLY? WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS SOUND GOOD?"
REMEMBER THE OIL SPILL.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, THE GULF OIL SPILL.
SO THE OIL'S COMING OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND IT WON'T STOP, AND WE CAN'T FIX IT. AND SOMEONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE GETS A BRIGHT IDEA TO DO AN OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS AS IF THAT'S GOING TO STOP THE OIL SPILL. SO SENDING THE PRESIDENT OUT TO GIVE A SPEECH TO THE NATION WHILE THE OIL IS STILL COMING OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO-- IT DIDN'T WORK THAT WELL.
Stephen: SO HE COULD INSPIRE THE OIL TO STOP GUSHING? HE COULD SHAME IT INTO BEING CLEAN?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE NOBEL ACCEPTANCE SPEECH? THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A CHALLENGE? YOU PUT YOUR FINGERS ON THE EXPEEBD GO, "SOME THINGS CAN'T BE EXPLAINED."
NO, HE KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING OF THAT SPEECH, HE SAID, "LOOK, I AM THE COMMANDER IN THE CHIEF IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO WARS AND I JUST GOT THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, AND THIS HAS TO BE A SPEECH ABOUT WAR AND PEACE AND WHY WAR IS NECESSARY SOMETIMES EVENS AWE TRY TO ACHIEVE PEACE."
I THINK HE WAS PRESIDENT FOR SEVEN RECORDS. HIS REACTION WAS, "YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME," IN MORE COLORFUL LANGUAGE.
Stephen: WOW. SO SPEAKING OF "YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME," WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT. -- ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ON THE INSIDE OF THE-- OF A WHITE HOUSE, INSIDE OF AN ADMINISTRATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR COMMUNICATION AINLT OF ABILITIES, GETTING THEIR IDEAS OUT, OR THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF? ( LAUGHTER ).
AAHH! ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IT'S HARD-- LOOK, I'M NOT SYMPATHETIC BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR BARGAIN, BUT IT'S NOT EASY TO, LIKE, WORK FOR, LIKE, A FASCIST HAMBURGLAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE ADDLED, RACIST, NARCISSISTIC MIND, LAST, LIKE, PICKED UP SOME INFORMATION FROM "THE NO, POST" IN 1987--
WE'RE ON THE FENCE. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO IT'S-- SO IT'S LIKE I GET WHY SEAN SPICE SER IN A BAD MOOD MOST DAYS.
Stephen: YEAH, IT SEEMS TO BE SHRINKING HIM. IT'S ACTUALLY-- HE'S GOING TO BE A DIAMOND FROM THE PRESSURE BY THE END OF THE WEEK.
I MEAN THE CHALLENGE IS WHEN YOU GO OUT AND SAY THINGS LIKE HE DID THE OTHER DAY, LIKE IF CHINA DOESN'T SOLVE NORTH KOREA, WE WILL, THAT HAS TO BE BACKED UP BY SOME SORT OF ACTION.
Stephen: BUT IT SOUNDS BAD-ASS, MAN. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY "DIRTY HARRY." WOULDN'T YOU HAVE LOVED TO WRITTEN THAT LINE?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. SO --
Stephen: OKAY, THAT'S AN OPENING LINE.
OPTIMISM.
Stephen: THAT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT PICKUP LINE.
TRUMP'S PRESIDENT, THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: TOMMY, YOU WERE THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen: THE AGENCY, THE N.S.A.
N.S.C.
Stephen: BANNON JUST GOT KICKED OFF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YUP. THAT'S A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, BUT HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THERE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE THAT SENDS TO, LIKE, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF WHO IS REMOVED FROM THE N.S.C., THE SAME DAY, SAYS POLITICS IS AT THE HEART OF POLICY DECISION MAKING. AND I WAS IN HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF SITUATION ROOM MEETINGS AND WE NEVER, EVER TALKED ABOUT POLITICS BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T MATTER. YOU SHOULD MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BASED ON THE MERITS AND NOT BASED ON REA RE-ELECTION.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK OBAMA AND CLINTON SHOULD BE DOING, YOU KNOW-- SHE DIDN'T GET INTO OFFICE AND HE'S OUT OF OFFICE? SHOULD THEY JUST LAY BACK, OR DO YOU THINK IT'S PROPER FOR THE OPPONENT AND THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT TO BE OUT THERE AND VOCALLY OPPOSING THE ACTIONS OF THE SITTING PRESIDENT?
HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOING TO PICK HIS BATTLES AND WHEN THEY'RE IMPORTANT HE'S GOING TO STIP. AND I THINK HILLARY HAS BEEN SPEAKING MORE LATELY, AND I THINK THAT'S GOOD. I DO THINK THAT, LIKE, IF THERE'S ONE THING WE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY FROM TRUMP BEING PRESIDENT WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE, LIKE, POLL-TESTED, CAREFUL SENTENCE. EVERYBODY HAS TO SAY WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS. I'M SORT OF DONE WITH TALKING POINTS. WE'RE DONE-- TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT. GO BANANAS.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE.
YOU CAN LIE. YOU CAN MAKE STUFF UP. THERE ARE NO RULES ANYMORE.
NOT RECOMMENDING THAT.
I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULD DO IT. I'M SAYING IT IS ALLOWED NOW.
Stephen: YOU HEARD IT HERE FOR. THEIR PODCAST IS "POD SAVE AMERICA." JON FAVREAU, JON LOVETT, AND TOMMY VIETOR, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW."
