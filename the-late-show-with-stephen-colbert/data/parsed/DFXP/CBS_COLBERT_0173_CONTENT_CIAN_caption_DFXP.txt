I DID, I LIKED THE CARTOON SHOW A LOT THOUGH. I USED TO WATCH THE SHOW. PIKACHU.
Stephen: YEAH. I THINK YOU MIGHT BE A POKEMON, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE-- ANYWAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW, THIS NEW THING, IT IS A VIDEO GAME WHERE YOU WALK AROUND AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR PHONE WHICH IS USING ITS CAMERA, AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR PHONE AND IN THE REAL WORLD, YOU SEE LITTLE POKEMON LIKE THIS FELLA SITTING ON A ROCK IN CENTRAL PARK. AND IT IS REVOLUTIONIZED THE WAY PEOPLE ALMOST GET HIT BY CARS STAIRING AT THEIR PHONES. (LAUGHTER) THEY-- TRUE BASED ON A TRUE STORY. IT'S CALLED AUGMENTED REALITY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN ACTUAL REALITY. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S TRUE. NOW AS JON WAS SAYING, YOU HAVE TO BE WALKING TO USE THE APP, MEANING DEVELOPERS HAVE NOW DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE. DESIGNED A GAME THAT YOU CANNOT PLAY ON THE TOILET. (LAUGHTER) WHILE POKEMON GO IS GETTING PEOPLE EXCITED, IT IS ALSO CAUSING SOME USERS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT FATIGUE AND SOAR LEGS. OKAY, POKEMON PLAYERS, DO NOT BE ALARMED, THAT IS A SYMPTOM OF A CONDITION KNOWN AS WALKING. AND IT IS CURABLE. IT IS CURABLE. THIS THING IS HUGE, OKAY. EVERYBODY IS PLAYING IT, IN ALL THE MEDIA.

Stephen: YEAH, WE'RE ALL APPLAUDING AND THANK YOU FOR APPLAUDING SOMETHING, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY. WE'RE INTRODUCING TONIGHT OUR OWN COLLECTIBLE CREATURES RIGHT HERE ON THE LATE SHOW. OF COURSE POKEMON IS SHORT FOR POCKET MONSTERS. SO WE'RE CALLING OURS TROB GOBS, WHICH IS SHORT FOR TROWSER GOBLINS. TROWSER GOBLIN, TROB GOBS. NOW WHERE DOES THE "B" IN TROB COME FROM, YOU'RE ASKING, IT'S TROWSER, WHY TROB, WELL, THE B IS FROM GOBLINS, IT JUST COMES EARLY. YOU PUT IT IN THE FIRST WORD AND IT APPEARS IF GOBLIN LATER. IT ALSO MIGHT BE A MIXTURE OF TROWSER AND THROB, I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE. WHATEVER IT IS, KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED DURING THIS SHOW ALL WEEK BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE HIDDEN APPEARANCES FROM ALL YOUR FAVORITE TROB GOBS LIKE PRAWNQUISTADOR AND GIMPAPOTAMUS. EVERYBODY LOVES GIMPAPOTAMUS, VERY POPULAR.
Jon: THAT IS A CLASSIC, FAVORITE.
Stephen: GOT TO CATCH THEM ALL, GOT TO CATCH THEM ALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW IF YOU SAW ONE ON THE SHOW, TAKE A SCREEN SHOT AND TWEET IT AT ME WITH THE HASHTAG TROB GOBS. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO THAT, NEVER KNOW, WE JUST STARTED. HEY, HERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED. LAST TUESDAY THE FBI ISSUED ITS REVIEW OF HILLARY CLINTON'S USE OF PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER. AND THE BIG HEADLINE IS HILL ROE WILL NOT BE INDICTED. BUT SHE MIGHT-- YEAH, HOLD OFF. SHE MIGHT BE EMBARRASSED BECAUSE SHE WAS SLIGHTLY CAUGHT WITH HER HAND IN THE, YOU KNOW, STRETCHING-- SHE LIED. SHE LIED A LOT. SHE SAID UNDER OATH THAT SHE RETURNED ALL OF HER WORK E-MAILS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT. BUT THE FBI SAID YES, THAT'S TRUE EXCEPT FOR THE THOUSANDS YOU DIDN'T. (LAUGHTER) SHE ALSO CLAIMED REPEATEDLY OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT SHE NEVER E-MAILED ANY CLASSIFIED MATERIAL, BUT THE FBI SAID, AND I QUAWT, YAY HUH. AND WILL ARE, THERE IS A LIST, LIKE TEN THINGS SHE SAID SHE DID OR DIDN'T DO, THAT SHE DIDN'T OR DID DO. AND AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING SHE SAYS IS TRUE. I MEAN AFTER ALL, WAS SHE LYING WHEN SHE SAID THIS.
SECRETARY CLINTON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WAS IT? WAS IT GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ME? I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE SHE CAN UNION FIE THE COUNTRY THROUGH HER DISHONESTY. AFTER ALL, THE PEOPLE WHO HATE HER SAY SHE'S ALWAYS LYING. WHILE HER SUPPORTERS SAY SHE'S ALWAYS LYING. BUT YOU KNOW WHO I BELIEVE CAN UNION FIE THIS COUNTRY? JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. SAY HI! (APPLAUSE). ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY. SO HONESTLY, JON, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW GLASSES?
Stephen: I REALLY LIKE-- .
Jon: I REALLY LIKE THMENT. YOU GOT A GOOD VIBE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE VIBE, DOES IT MAKE ME SEEM SMARTER. DOES IT MAKE ME SEEM YOUNGER? WHAT IS THE VIBE? AND THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER, JON, YOU CAN BE HONEST. WHAT IS THE VIBE?
Jon: THE VIBE IS IT MATCHES YOUR HAIR. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A VIBE.
Jon: THAT'S A GOOD VIBE. YOU DON'T SEE THAT ALL THE TIME. WHERE THE HAIR AND THE GLASSES ARE SIN CRONNIZED, YOU KNOW? AND THEN WHEN YOU GOT IT HAPPENING LIKE THAT, IT CHANGES YOUR VIBE.
Stephen: OKAY. MY LAST GLASSES HAD NO FRAMES.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: SO TO MATCH I WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE SHAVED MY HEAD.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THIS IS MUCH EASIER. BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I WANT TO TAKE A SECOND HERE, ARE WE DOING IT OVER HERE? WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND YOU KNOW, HAVING SOME FUN WITH THE IDEA THAT SHE WASN'T HONEST. BUT I JUST WANT TO REVISIT THAT FOR ONE SECOND. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WHILE SHE MAY HAVE, YOU KNOW, NOT NECESSARILY TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HER E-MAIL SERVER, WHERE IT WAS, HOW IT WAS USED, WHETHER IT COULD BE HACKED, ANY OF THAT STUFF, I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, IF I'M HONEST WITH MYSELF, THAT SECRETARY CLINTON ONLY USED THAT PRIVATE SERVER BECAUSE SHE KNEW HER POLITICAL ENEMY WAS PUT HER ENTIRE LIFE UNDER A MICROSCOPE, AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE, THE LAST 25 YEARS. AND I MEAN, IT'S NATURAL TO EXPECT THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO PROTECT-- YOU KNOW WHAT, [BLEEP] IT, I GOT TO TAKE THE GLOVES OFF.
Stephen: ROUND ONE, DING DING. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU ARE SO UNTRUST WORTHY THAT BEYONCE IS WORKING ON A CONCEPT ALBUM ABOUT YOU. COME ON! COME ON, HILLARY. YOU KNEW THAT PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE UNTRUST WORTHY AND THEN YOU DID SOMETHING UNTRUST WORTHY? THAT'S LIKE RICHARD GERE GOING TO THE PET STORE AND HOVERING AROUND THE GERBIL AISLE. OKAY. YOU LOOK SO SHADY RIGHT NOW THAT FIFA WANTS TO HIRE--   HIRE YOU. SECRETARY CLINTON, SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU'RE SO RECKLESS ON THE INTERNET THAT AOL HAS ASKED FOR ITS 43 HOURS BACK. I MEAN, HOW TOP SECRET? I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HANDLE POP SECRET. I WOULDN'T TRUST YOU WITH SECRET DEODORANT. SECRETARY CLINTON, YOU LIED SO MUCH THAT KIDS ARE NOW CHANTING "LIAR, LIAR," PANTSUIT ON FIRE. YOU'RE SO BAD I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE SO BAD AT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAT I ALMOST REMEMBERED WHO MARTIN O'MALLEY IS. SINCE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY BAD AT LYING, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT. I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON. YOU WERE SO VULNERABLE TO HACKERS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK YOUR E-MAIL SERVERS FOR FORTUNE COOKIES BECAUSE I AM GUESSING THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CHINESE TAKEOUT. YOU'RE SO BAD AT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THAT THE ONLY PERSON YOU COULD BEAT IS DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER) YEAH! YOU'RE SO DISHONEST, HILLARY 16 IS THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BRYAN KRANSTON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE).

Stephen: I HAVE HEARD OF IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YOU GAVE ME THE SCARY LOOK THERE.

SO I SMUGGLED IT INTO CALIFORNIA AND I THOUGHT, DURING OUR CHILI COOKOFF, I FORGOT TO TELL THE REST OF THE FOLKS, HEY WE'RE HAVING FIREWORKS. COME ON OVER OR SEE THEM FROM THE PATIO. THEY WILL SEE THEM ANYWAY. SO I WAS SETTING UP, MY WHOLE THING. I GOT THE PUNK LIGHT, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING ISED ARE. AND I GOT MY FAMILY OUT THERE IN THE CHAIRS.

OR THE BATTLE OF FORT SUMPSTER, THIS TIME WE WIN. DID YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE TO CELEBRATE LIKE.

AND THERE IS ROLLING A HUGE BEACH BALL DOWN. IT'S FUN.
Stephen: I THINK THIS IS WHAT THE-- WITHIN THE FORE FATHERS DID.
Stephen: NO, THE NAVY SEALS.
AND THEN THE NAVY CEILINGS ALSO STOPPED FOR A WATERMELON EATING CONTEST. POWERING THROUGH THAT. AND I WAS THE ANCHOR LEG ON MY TEAM. WE A ESSENTIALED A TEAM OF MI DAUGHTER AND NEICE AND HER FRIEND CALLED MASTERS OF STUPIDITY. AND I DO WANT TO GO ON RECORD TO SAY WE WEREN'T AMATEURS AT STUPIDITY.

Stephen: SURE, EXCELLENT, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR SHOULDERS, THOUGH. ANYTHING CAN BE DONE FOR THAT.
AMPUTEE. I COULD JUST-- NO, IT'S JUST-- 60 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: YOU JUST CELEBRATED YOUR 60th BIRTHDAY.
I DID.
Stephen: WOW, GREAT. ARE YOU EMBRACING THE 60NESS OF BEING 60? YOU LOOK FANTASTIC FOR 60.
YOU THINK SO.
Stephen: FOR ANY AGE. BUT FOR 60.
I'M EMBRACING IT. I HAVE REALIZED THAT ONCE YOU HIT 60, YOU WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER. TAKE A NAP. TAKE A BATH. YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I'M THE ONE WHO KNOCKS HAS BECOME I'M THE ONE WITHOUT NAPS.
A LITTLE SLEEPY EYED.
Stephen: IS BATHING AND OLD THING TO DO BECAUSE I LOVE BATHING. AM I OLD BECAUSE I LIKE TO BATHE? I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT-- SHOWERING TOOK THAT MUCH EFFORT.
I WOULD SAY IT TAKES MORE TIME, SO IT IS LUXURIOUS, RIGHT. AND IF YOU HAVE TIME TO LUXOR YAIT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU NOT DOING. I DON'T KNOW, I WAS RAISED, YOU KNOW, WORK, WORK, WORK, WORKING CLASS MENTALITY, GET IN THE SHOWER, GET OUT OF THE SHOWER, LET'S GO.
Stephen: IN THE NEW MOVIE "THE INFILTRATOR" YOU ARE PLAYING A REAL PERSON NAMED ROBERT MAZUR, A GUY WHO INFILTRATES THE COLOMBIAN CAR TELL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND THIS GUY WAS TAKING HIS LIFE IN HIS HANDS.
YEAH, HE WAS AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER WITH CUSTOMS. AND FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS HE WENT UNDERCOVER LAUNDERING MONEY FOR THE CAR TELL. ACTUALLY HAVING TO DO THAT CRIME IN ORDER TO GET DEEPER AND DEEPER KKED TO THE CARTEL. AND ONCE THEY GOT UP AS HIGH AS PABLO ESCOBAR'S LAWYER, AND THE OTHER THING THAT THEY DID THAT WAS SO EFFECTIVE IS THAT IT BROUGHT DOWN THE 7th LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD AT THE TIME, BCCI. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
Stephen: NOPE.
OKAY. WELL, YOU'RE NOT 60. (LAUGHTER) CUZ I REMEMBER.
Stephen: I REMEMBER NOW, YEAH.
I NEED TO GET ONE OF THOSE HORNS, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S AMAZING-- .
Stephen: ONE OF THE BICKEST DRUG BUSTS OF ALL TIME.
85 ARRESTS WITHIN TWO HOURS. AND IT REALLY TOOK A DENT OUT OF THE CARTEL. WHAT REALLY FASCINATED ME ABOUT MAZUR'S STORY IS THAT HE WAS UNDERCOVER IN TAMPA BAY AREA. AND HE ALSO LIVED IN TAMPA. SO HE WOULD CHECK OUT, FINISH FOR THE DAY BEING THIS UNDERCOVER BAD GUY, AND GO HOME AND BE BOB MAZUR WHO WAS A DAD AND A FATHER AND HELPED THE KIDS WITH HOMEWORK, TAKE OUT THE TRASH AND DO NORMAL THINGS.
Stephen: DID YOU MEET HIM?
OH YEAH, IN FACT, HE'S HERE. HE'S HERE. I CAN'T POINT HIM OUT. HIS SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT.
Stephen: STILL.
OH YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO.
HE WON'T ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED OR VIDEOTAPED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE HE PUT 85 BAD GUYS IN JAIL. AND THEY DON'T FORGET.
Stephen: HE'S IN DANGER ALL THE TIME.
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DANGER. HE HIDES IN PUBLIC.
Stephen: ARE WE IN DANGER BECAUSE HE'S HERE NOW.
WE'RE AT A RED LEVEL.
Stephen: THERE A CLIP HERE WHERE THE DEAL THAT HE IS MAKING WITH THE COLOMBIAN CARTEL IS IN A LITTLE BIT OF A HICCUP BECAUSE ALL THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN FROZEN BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND YOUR CHARACTER CANNOT ACTUALLY GIVE THEM THEIR MONEY BACK AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.
THAT'S RIGHT. I NEED TO RETURN THIS MONEY TO THEM OR ELSE IT IS NOT GOOD NEWS FOR BOB MAZUR.
Stephen: JIM.
THE $10 MILLION IS FROZEN WHICH IS ACTUALLY PABLO ESCOBAR'S MONEY AND HE DOESN'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS THAT OUR GOVERNMENT DID IT HE WANTS HIS MONEY AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OVER UNTIL THEY GIVE IT.
THE SENATE INVESTIGATION INTO NORIEGA, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE MONEY T WENT THROUGH PANAMA, FROZEN IS FROZEN. ACCEPT IT. -- OUR OPERATION.
WE NEED YOU TO FIX THIS FOR US.
HOW AM I GOING TO FIX THIS?
WANT ME TO CALL SAM.
JOHN, COULD YOU DROP YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT THE PRESIDENT SANCTIONED BECAUSE MY FRIEND BOB'S GETTING REALLY UPSET. REAGAN WANTS NORIEGA HE'S, ASS.
YOU KNOW WHAT-- SAID, THAT'S NOT A-- THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE, MY FRIEND, OKAY.
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT FOR.
DID HE THREATEN YOU?
NO.
DID HE PUT YOUR NECK IN THE NOOSE.
NO, AND HE SQUEEZED IT, NO, HE DIDN'T, ROBERTO DIDN'T SAY THAT,nd WE SANT TA THAT WITH ITS IT'S ESCOBAR.
WAIT A SECRETARY, BOB, ARE YOU IN DANGER FROM PAN LO ESCOBAR IF HIS MONEY DOESN'T COME THROUGH? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: MR. MAZUR, WHEREVER ARE YOU, STAY SAFE AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE BRYAN CRANSTON. (APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. HERE'S HERE WITH OUR FRIEND BRYAN CRANSTON. NOW BRYAN, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ANY SECRET THAT I'M ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST FANS, YOU ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU, YOU PLAY COMPLEX, MULTIFA SETTED CHARACTERS LIKE WALTER WHITE OR DONALD TRUMBO OR ROBERT MAZUR IN THE NEW MOVIE THE INFILTRATOR.
THANK YOU.
I LOVE THE SUBTLETY AND COMPLEXITY THAT YOU REVEAL THINGS.
THANK YOU FOR SAY THATTING, I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO PLAY THESE COMPLEX CHARACTERS AND I LOVE HOW THEY SUBTLY REVEAL THEMSELVES TO THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: OF COURSE I THINK THE TEST OF A GREAT ACTOR IS CAN YOU PLAY THE OPPOSITE, A POORLY WRITTEN CHARACTER, THAT JUST KIND OF LIKE WALKS IN AND AWKWARDLY ANNOUNCES HIS ENTIRE BACK STORY. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
I THINK I WAS BORN THINKING I COULD-- I CAN HANDLE THAT.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR. THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHY IS THAT?
Stephen: WHY? WHY IS THAT? I WILL TELL YOU WHY THAT IS. BECAUSE THIS IS THE LATE SHOW PRESENTS TOO MUCH EXPOSITION THEATRE.
THE LATE SHOW BEGINS TOO MUCH EXPOSITION THEATRE. (APPLAUSE)
WHAT'S THIS? I HAVEN'T HAD A VISITER SINCE BEING BETRAYED BY MY DEEF YUTION HALF BROTHER BETRAM CHEVALIERS WHO CHORUS GIRL MOREIT HAD A TORRID AFFAIR WITH MY LATE MOTHER ON THE BEACHES OF MARRAKESH.

Stephen: I HAD NO CHOICE AFTER THE TWO OF YOU PISTOL WHIPPED MY BEEKEEPER HIGGINS McTAVISH AND CONVINCED HIS STEPDAUGHTER AUDREY TO JOIN THAT HUNGARIAN NUNNERY.
WELL, AUDREY HAD NARY A CHOICE AFTER CONTRACTING MALL AR WHY-- MALL ARIA ON A CAN U-- CAN U TRIP TO CICELY AND LOSING HER RARE STAMP COLLECTION IN THAT SUBTERRANEAN POKER GAME.
I TRUST THAT YOU REFER TO THE SAME POKER GAME IN WHICH OUR THIRD COUSIN LUCRECIA THREW HER GLASS EYE AT THAT CORSICAN MATADOR.

THE AFOREMENTIONED BEEKEEPER'S DAUGHTER.
YES.
AFTER SHE LEFT, YOU FELL INTO DEEP DESPAIR, FROM WHICH YOU ARE JUST NOW ONLY BECOMING TO SEE A GLIMMER OF HOPE. HOPE, THAT WAS CRUSHED THE MOMENT YOU HEARD MY KNOCK ON THE DOOR.
