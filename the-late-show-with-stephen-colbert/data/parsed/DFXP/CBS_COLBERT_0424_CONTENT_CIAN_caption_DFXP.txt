THOSE PANTS LOOK GOOD ON YOU.
COME ON, BLUE KHAKIS. I DON'T KNOW, THEY'RE SO BOLD. I MISS MY PLEATS.
IT'S THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
WHAT'S THAT?
THAT'S AN AWFULLY HOT COFFEE POT SHOULD I DROP IT ON DONALD TRUMP? PROBABLY NOT.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THE PARKING GARAGE.
WHO IS THAT GUY IN THE HOOD? IS THAT MACKLEMORE?
I THINK IT'S MACKLEMORE.
A DAMN APACHE WITH A TOMAHAWK.
I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS, HE'S IN THE WAY AND IF WE DON'T GET OUT OF HERE IN TWO MINUTES WE GET CHARGED EXTRA FOR PARKING.
THERE'S A GENTLEMAN IN BACK.
I'M GOING TO BEEP MY HORN.
WE BETTER GIVE OBAMA PROPS.
GET OUT OF THERE! MOVE IT!
THE DRAMA POPS--
IT IS INFECTIOUS, THOUGH.
QUIET DOWN!
WE'RE WITH YOU, MACKLEMORE!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, TRUMP SUPERSIZES THE STOCKPILE. PLUS STEPHEN WOMANS: ANDREW GARFIELD. TRACEY ULLMAN. AND MUSICAL GUEST WOLF WHAT RAID. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS COMING! YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS COMING. HEY, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, VERY NICE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, HEY, REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN REX TILLERSON CALLED DONALD TRUMP A MORON? LAYOFF LAUGH WE WERE SO YOUNG BACK THEN. WELL, NOW WE KNOW WHY TILLERSON SAID IT. WE KNEW IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MILITARY OR THE PENTAGON. IT WAS KIND OF VAGUE, BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. APPARENTLY, OVER THE SUMMER, TRUMP MET WITH TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS AND SAID HE WANTED A NEARLY TENFOLD INCREASE IN THE U.S. NUCLEAR ARSENAL. A TENFOLD INCREASE? EXCUSE ME WHILE I ONE-FOLD INTO THE FETAL POSTION. ( LAUGHTER ) HE KNOWS WE CAN ALREADY END ALL LIFE ON EARTH, RIGHT? THE COCKROACHES WILL SURVIVE, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR STEVE BANNON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT 10-FOLD? A 10-FOLD INCREASE. WHY TEN-FOLD. WHY NOT 1,000-FOLD? IS TEN JUST HOW HIGH HE CAN COUNT? "I WANT IT MORE BY THIS MANY." THIS MANY RIGHT HERE. THIS MANY. HOW MANY IS-- GOTTA GET IN THE LIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S HOW WE SHAMBLED TOWARD THE BRINK THIS TIME. THIS SUMMER, THE MILITARY BRASS SHOWED THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF A CHART ILLUSTRATING "THE STEADY REDUCTION OF U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS SINCE THE LATE 1960s. TRUMP INDICATED HE WANTED A BIGGER STOCKPILE, NOT THE BOTTOM POSITION ON THAT DOWNWARD-SLOPING CURVE." "I AM NOT THE BOTTOM OF ANY CHART, OKAY? I WANT MOST NUKES, HIGHEST SEA LEVELS, BIGGEST MISTAKES, I WANT THE WHITEST SUPREMACISTS AVAILABLE. MARCHING IN-- I WANT IT. THEY'RE SAYING I'M GOING TO HAVE IT. THEY'RE SAYING I'M GOING TO HAVE IT." I'M SWATTING AT FLIES MOST OF THE TIME. I THINK THERE ARE FLIES AROUND ME." NOW, SOME PEOPLE IN THE MEETING SAY "THEY DID NOT TAKE TRUMP'S DESIRE FOR MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BE LITERALLY INSTRUCTING THE MILITARY TO INCREASE THE ACTUAL NUMBERS." OKAY, SO HE WASN'T SPEAKING LITERALLY. HE WAS SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY. "WE MUST INCREASE THE NUCLEAR STOCKPILES IN OUR HEARTS SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DROP WARHEADS OF COMPASSION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND TURN EVERY NATION INTO A SMOLDERING PILE OF LOVE." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS MORNING, TRUMP DENIED HE EVER SAID ANY OF THAT STUFF, TWEETING: "FAKE @NBCNEWS MADE UP A STORY THAT I WANTED A 'TENFOLD' INCREASE IN OUR U.S. NUCLEAR ARSENAL. PURE FICTION, MADE UP TO DEMEAN. NBC EQUALS CNN!" "NBC EQUALS CNN, WHICH IS THE SQUARE ROOT OF ABC DIVIDED BY QVC TO THE POWER OF BET, AND BY THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY THAT MEANS VH1 IS NOW ANIMAL PLANET." THAT'S SCIENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S-- THAT'S-- ♪ ♪ ♪ SCIENCE! ANYWAY, IT'S A LONG WALK. THAT WAS A LONG WALK. SORRY. THEN LATER, LATER-- SAME DAY, SAME INTERVIEW. LET'S JUST SAY LATER. TRUMP REAFFIRMED HIS COMMITMENT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
IT'S, FRANKLY, DISGUSTING THE WAY THE PRESS IS ABLE TO WRITE WHATEVER THEY WANT TO WRITE AND PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK INTO IT.
Stephen: SIR, FOR THE RECORD, PEOPLE DID LOOK INTO IT. IN FACT, "WE THE PEOPLE" LOOKED INTO IT AND THOUGHT, "YEAH, THEY SHOULD WRITE WHATEVER THEY WANT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY SHORT READ. BUT, EVIDENTLY, "HIM THE PEOPLE," FEELS DIFFERENTLY, TWEETING: "WITH ALL OF THE FAKE NEWS COMING OUT OF NBC AND THE NETWORKS, AT WHAT POINT IS IT APPROPRIATE TO CHALLENGE THEIR LICENSE?" INTERESTING QUESTION. I HAVE TWO FOLLOW-UPS: WHEN IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR TWITTER TO DEACTIVATE THE ACCOUNT OF A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND CAN THAT BE YESTERDAY? COULD THAT-- TRUMP ALSO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALM A WORRIED NATION, ABOUT, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY DYING.
I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ATTITUDE ON NORTH KOREA THAN OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE, AND I LISTEN TO EVERYBODY. BUT, ULTIMATELY, MY ATTITUDE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS, ISN'T IT? I THINK PERHAPS I FEEL STRONGER AND TOUGHER ON THAT SUBJECT THAN OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I LISTEN TO EVERYBODY AND, ULTIMATELY, I WILL DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES AND, REALLY, WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE WORLD.
Stephen: "WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN, BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE JUST TOO DARN CLOSE TO WHERE WE'RE GOING TO, YOU KNOW. ( IMITATING BOMB EXPLODING ) SAD." ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE COULD BE REACHING A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF ANGRY TRUMP BECAUSE A REPORT OUT TODAY SAYS PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENT SAY HE IS UNSTABLE, LOSING A STEP, AND UNRAVELING. SO KEEP IN MIND THAT MEANS, UP TILL NOW, HE'S BEEN "RAVELED." ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS THE FULL UNRAVELING. TO RAVEL OR UNRAVEL. ( APPLAUSE ) SO WHY IS HE UNRAVELING? WELL, HE REPORTEDLY TOLD HIS LONGTIME PERSONAL SECURITY CHIEF, "I HATE EVERYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE!" MR. PRESIDENT, I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT-- DISLIKE. NOT HATE, DISLIKE INTENSELY. BUT HERE'S THE THING-- THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE MAY BE A POWERFUL GUY, BUT YOU REALLY NEED THE STAFF ON YOUR SIDE WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT BECAUSE A FEW MONTHS AGO FORMER CHIEF STRATEGIST STEVE BANNON, TOLD TRUMP THAT THE RISK TO HIS PRESIDENCY WASN'T IMPEACHMENT, BUT THE 25th AMENDMENT-- THE PROVISION BY WHICH A MAJORITY OF THE CABINET CAN VOTE TO REMOVE THE PRESIDENT. BUT WHEN BANNON MENTIONED THE 25th AMENDMENT, TRUMP SAID, "WHAT'S THAT?" ( LAUGHTER ) I'M GUESSING IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE'S EVER LOOKED AT STEVE BANNON AND SAID, "WHAT'S THAT?" ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING-- GOT A LITTLE-- WHAT'S THE? IT'S WEARING A SUIT. SPEAKING OF STAFFING ISSUES, LAST NIGHT, AROUND 9:00, TRUMP TWEETED, "THE FAKE NEWS IS AT IT AGAIN, THIS TIME TRYING TO HURT ONE OF THE FINEST PEOPLE I KNOW, GENERAL JOHN KELLY, BY SAYING HE WILL SOON BE DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT," "DOT, DOT, DOT-- FIRED. THIS STORY IS TOTALLY MADE UP BY THE DISHONEST MEDIA. THE CHIEF IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB FOR ME AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR THE U.S.A.!" YES, VERY IMPORTANT YOU CLEAR UP THE JOHN KELLY WORKS FOR THE U.S.A., BECAUSE SO MUCH OF TRUMP'S STAFF WORKS FOR RUSSIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT HERE'S THE THING--
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: I'M RIGHT, RIGHT? BUT HERE'S THE THING: TRUMP WAS VERY UPSET BY RUMORS THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO FIRE KELLY, "EVEN THOUGH THERE APPEARED TO BE NO SUCH REPORTING BY THE NATIONAL MEDIA." OH, MY GOD! THE FAKE NEWS IS COMING FROM INSIDE HIS HEAD! GET OUT OF THERE! "THE FAKE NEWS IS AT IT AGAIN, COMING IN MY DREAMS-- GIANT SPIDER WITH MY FATHER'S FACE ON IT, MAKING MY TEETH FALL OUT, VERY UNFAIR." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TRUMP MIGHT BE REACTING TO A "VANITY FAIR" ARTICLE: "AMID A WIDENING RIFT, JOHN KELLY HAS A MAR-A-LAGO STRATEGY TO CONTAIN TRUMP," IN WHICH THEY SAY, "TO PREVENT TRUMP FROM SOLICITING ADVICE FROM MEMBERS OF MAR-A-LAGO AND FRIENDS, HE WILL ATTEMPT TO KEEP TRUMP 'OUT OF THE DINING ROOM.'" TRUMPS' JUST GOING TO WANDER AROUND THE DINING ROOM GETTING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVICE. "WHADDYA THINK I SHOULD DO? THINK I OUGHT TO NUKE NORTH KOREA? SHOULD I BOMB FRANCE. BY THE WAY, IT'S GOING TO BE TELL YOU WHAT, I'M GOING TO COMP YOUR MEAL. BY THE WAY, IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR LAST." ENJOY! ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK TRUMP'S JUST MAKING THIS UP, FRANKLY. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAID THIS. I THINK HE JUST TWEETED THIS TO GET THE STORY OUT THERE BECAUSE NOBODY IS SAYING TRUMP IS GOING TO FIRE JOHN KELLY, BUT TRUMP. "LOOK, JOHN, I THINK YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB, BUT I'M SEEING ON TWITTER THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING-- THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'M GOING TO FIRE YOU. I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE, BUT IT'S OUT THERE. BUT IT'S OUT THERE NOW. DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. YOU'RE FIRED." THE ARTICLE ALSO REVEALED SOMETHING WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED ABOUT KELLY. A SOURCE CLOSE TO HIM SAYS, "HE DOESN'T LOVE THIS JOB." NO ONE KNOWS WHO THE SOURCE IS, BUT I'M GUESSING IT'S EVERYONE WITH EYEBALLS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT TRUMP'S NOT BUYING THAT KELLY'S UNHAPPY. ON SATURDAY HE SAID-- I'M SORRY, I'M A LITTLE PARCHED. CAN I HAVE A BOTTLE OF WATER? I'M SORRY, HE SAID THIS:
JOHN KELLY IS ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER WORKED WITH. HE'S DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. AND HE TOLD ME FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS, HE LOVES IT MORE THAN ANYTHING HE HAS EVER DONE. HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. HE WILL BE HERE, IN MY OPINION, FOR THE ENTIRE SEVEN REMAINING YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW! REMAINING YEARS! IT HASN'T BEEN SEVEN YEARS ALREADY? ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, EVERYBODY. ANDREW GARFIELD IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, THE N.F.L. TAKES A STAND ON KNEELING! STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! OH, JON, OH, JON.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: I AM SUPER EXCITED-- I AM SUPER EXCITED BECAUSE OUR FRIEND ANDREW GARFIELD IS GOING TO BE OUT HERE IN A LITTLE WHILE.
Jon: HE'S A GOOD GUEST.
Stephen: LAST TIME HE WAS HERE WE MADE OUT A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: I REMEMBER.
Stephen: TOTALLY PLATONIC, WE KEPT IT BUSINESS. TOMORROW NIGHT WE HAVE THE ONE, THE ONLY, THE IMIMMABLE BILL MURRAY. THE ONLY THING MORE SATISFYING THAN COMING OUT HERE EVERY NIGHT AND STICKING IT TO THE MAN IS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I'M THE MAN, AND I DO THIS SHOW FOR CASH. WHICH MEANS, OCCASIONALLY, WE DO SOMETHING CALLED "PRODUCT INTEGRATION," WHERE WE SEAMLESSLY BLEND A CORPORATE PRESENCE INTO THE SHOW, BUT IN SUCH A SUBTLE WAY THAT YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN NOTICE WE HAVE DONE SO. FOR INSTANCE, I BET YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THERE IS A BOTTLE OF VODKA ON MY DESK RIGHT NOW. I'LL GIVE YOU A SECOND TO SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT IT. IT'S RIGHT HERE! NOW, YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY IT'S DRESSED LIKE IT'S GOING TO A BACHELORETTE PARTY IN BRANSON, MISSOURI. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS ABSOLUT'S HOLIDAY SEQUIN BOTTLE. IT HAS ALL THE THE FUN YOU ASSOCIATE WITH ABSOLUT VODKA. PLUS THE DESIGN SENSE OF YOUR BACHELOR UNCLE WITH A BEDAZZLER. AND IT'S A LIMITED EDITION. THESE ARE STRICTLY LIMITED TO AS MANY AS YOU WILL BUY. NOW, WHY, YOU ARE SAYING TO YOURSELF, WHY-- COMMA-- DID THEY PUT THESE SEQUINS ON THEIR BOTTLE, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING. BECAUSE THIS. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUB THESE UP. THE POTLE TURNS SILVER. THAT TURNS SILVER AND THEN YOU CAN RUB IT DOWN LIKE THAT. OKAY. NOW, IMAGINE, IMAGINE, THAT'S A DRESS. YOU'VE JUST DONE THAT. NOW, REPORT YOURSELF TO H.R. REMEMBER, PLEASE, PLEASE, DRESS YOUR VODKA RESPONSIBLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, WE TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ENOUGH-- ( APPLAUSE ) WE DON'T TALK ABOUT LIQUOR ENOUGH ON THIS SHOW. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ON THIS SHOW, BUT LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BREAK AND TALK ABOUT SPORTS. ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON POST," DONALD TRUMP "HAS SCORED A WIN IN THE CULTURE WAR AS THE N.F.L. SEEKS TO ENSURE PLAYERS STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM." OKAY, MR. TRUMP! YOU WON A WAR! NO NEED TO START ANY NEW ONES. SOMEONE SEND HIM THE LOMBARDI TROPHY, AND TELL HIM IT'S FROM NORTH KOREA. ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, N.F.L. COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL SENT A LETTER TO ALL N.F.L. TEAMS SAYING THAT "THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE ANTHEM IS A BARRIER TO HAVING HONEST CONVERSATIONS AND MAKING REAL PROGRESS ON THE UNDERLYING ISSUES." YEAH, COME ON, GUYS. THAT PROTEST YOU'RE DOING TO GET US TO TALK ABOUT RACISM IS KEEPING US FROM TALKING ABOUT RACISM. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIX THE PROBLEM IF YOU KEEP REMINDING US WHAT THE PROBLEM IS? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, STANDING FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM ISN'T OFFICIALLY-- ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. NOW, STANDING FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM ISN'T OFFICIAL N.F.L. POLICY YET. BUT "TEAM OWNERS WILL DISCUSS A PLAN WHEN THEY MEET NEXT WEEK." WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF. IF A ROOM FULL OF RICH, WHITE MEN CAN'T SOLVE RACISM, NOBODY CAN. NOW TURNING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TURNING FROM FOOTBALL TO FUTBOL, SOME SAD NEWS. THE UNITED STATES MEN'S SOCCER TEAM WILL MISS THE WORLD CUP AFTER LOSING TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. WELL, OF COURSE WE LOST. WE HAD TO PLAY AGAINST TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO? THAT'S NOT FAIR. THAT'S DOUBLES. THAT'S AUSTRALIAN RULES DOUBLES. IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE U.S. MEN'S TEAM HAS FAILED TO QUALIFY SINCE THE 1986 WORLD CUP. OF COURSE, BACK THEN, OUR TEAM WAS SERIOUSLY SLOWED DOWN BY THEIR PARACHUTE PANTS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT EVEN AFTER LOSING, THE U.S. STILL HAD A SLIM CHANCE TO QUALIFY. WE JUST NEEDED MEXICO TO TIE HONDURAS, AND IT ALMOST HAPPENED. MEXICO HAD A LAST-SECOND FREE KICK, BUT "THE SHOT DIDN'T MAKE IT PAST THE DEFENSIVE WALL." SO SAD. MEXICO WANTED TO HELP, BUT THERE WAS A WALL IN THE WAY. NOTHING TO READ INTO THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT JUST-- IT HAPPENS. AND NOW-- AND NOW WE'RE PAYING FOR IT. NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS, BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE MAYBE TOO DISAPPOINTED.
THIS WAS A HEARTBREAKER. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1986, THE U.S. WILL NOT BE IN SOCCER'S WORLD CUP.
AFTER A 2-1 LOSS TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, THE NATIONAL TEAM WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR SOCCER'S BIGGEST TOURNAMENT.
WELL, SORRY TO BREAK IT, BUT TEAM U.S. WILL NOT BE IN THE 2018 WORLD CUP.
Stephen: HOLD ON. LET'S BE CLEAR: THE MEN'S TEAM WILL NOT BE IN THE WORLD CUP. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE U.S. WILL NOT BE IN THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE THE WOMEN'S TEAM HAS QUALIFIED FOR ALL OF THE WORLD CUPS. AMERICA'S SOCCER WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS OUTSHONE THE MEN. WE ALL REMEMBER WHEN BRANDY CHASTAIN TORE OFF HER SHIRT AFTER WINNING IN 1999. NO ONE REMEMBERS WHAT ERIC WYNALDA'S SPORTS BRA LOOKED LIKE. WHO'S ERIC WYNALDA? EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SURE HE'S A NICE GUY, BUT THE WOMEN'S TEAM HAS WON THE CUP THREE TIMES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THREE! COUNT THEM, THREE, THREE! DO YOU KNOW-- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THE MEN'S TEAM HAS WON THE WORLD CUP? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT: IT RHYMES WITH HERO, WHICH IS WHAT OUR WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM IS MADE UP OF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANDREW GARFIELD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST PLAYED AN AMAZING MEDIC IN "HACKSAW RIDGE," A SPECTACULAR PRIEST IN "SILENCE," AND HE WAS ALSO SPIDER-MAN. HE NOW STARS IN "BREATHE." PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW GARFIELD. ♪ GIVE IT UP FOR ANDREW GARFIELD GIVE IT UP FOR ANDREW GARFIELD ♪ GIVE IT UP FOR ANDREW GARFIELD GIVE DID UP FOR ANDREW GARFIELD ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ GIVE IT UP FOR ANDREW GARFIELD GIVE IT UP ♪
I LIKE THAT SONG! I LOVE THAT SONG!
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT SONG CALLED, JON? ♪ GIVE IT UP FOR ANDREW GARFIELD
Stephen: IT'S GOING TO BE A HIT. ALL THE KIDS WILL BE DANCING TO IT. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HEY!
Stephen:  HEY, BACK AT YOU. BACK AT YOU, MY FEELINGS EXACTLY.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S ALWAYS LOVELY TO TALK WITH YOU, BUT I DO HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME PUBLICLY BONE PICKING. YOU SAID THIS-- AND DON'T DENY IT. YOU SAID, "YOU'RE NOT SURE IF THE WORLD NEEDS MOVIE STARS."
YES, I SAID THAT.
Stephen: WHO WOULD I THEN TALK TO? I CAN'T TALK TO NEIL DEGRASS TYSON EVERY NIGHT. I WOULD LOVE TO, I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT I LIKE TALKING TO MOVIE STARS. WE NEED PEOPLE UP ON THE BIG CIVIL THRER.
YOU THINK.
Stephen: YEAH, THE DREAM FACTORY. WE NEED HEROOS.
OKAY, FINE.
Stephen: WHY DON'T WE NEED MOVIE STARS.
I THINK WHAT I MEANT, STEPHEN COLBERT, IS I THINK WHAT I MEANT MORE WAS-- I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES THERE'S THIS IDEALIZATION OF PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC EYE, AND THERE'S THIS FALSE KIND OF IDEALIZED VISION, THIS FALSE PERFECTION THAT I THINK IS PROJECTED FROM PEOPLE IN THAT POSITION. AND I THINK SOMETIMES IT CAN CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF DISSATISFACTION WITH OUR OWN-- BECAUSE I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A MOVIE STAR AT ALL.
AND NEVER WILL.
Stephen: HOLD ON. IS HE IS A MOVIE STAR? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU DON'T GET TO SAY WHETHER YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR.
IT'S MY LIFE, STEVE GLEN ANOTHER THAT'S FINE, THAT'S OKAY. BUT THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU'RE NOT INFLUENTIAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO SAY--
OKAY.
Stephen: WHETHER YOU'RE A STAR OR NOT.
ALL RIGHT, BUT WE'RE ALL STARS, STEPHEN, IS THE POINT. SPEAK OF NEIL DEGRASS TYSON, WE ARE ALL MADE OF STARDUST ARE, WE NOT? ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BOOM!
BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROJECTION OF PERFECTION, WHETHER IT'S IN TERMS OF BEAUTY OR IN TERMS OF "I'M JUST SO CHARISMATIC." BUT I'M NOT. I'M LOTS OF THINGS. WE ALL ARE. HUMAN BEINGS ARE MADE UP OF THE, YOU KNOW, THE LIGHT AND THE DARK.
Stephen: I'M A COLLECTION OF BAD HABITS.
EXACTLY. I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING IS ONE SOMETIMES HAS A TENDENCY TO FOCUS ON THIS IDEA OF PERFECTION, WHICH I THINK DOESN'T ARB LOW US-- DOESN'T GIVE US PERMISSION TO ACCEPT OUR WHOLE SELVES IN OUR ENTIRETY, OUR OWN BEINGNESS. I THINK IT CREATES THIS "NOT ENOUGHNESS" IN THE CULTURE WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING UP AT THINGS THAT AREN'T REAL BUT PRETENDING TO BE REAL BUT MORE PERFECT THAN YOU. THAT'S HOW I FEEL WHEN I LOOK AT MOVIE STARS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO HIT YOU. COME ON BACK. COME ON BACK. COME ON BACK. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
OKAY.
Stephen: BUT YOU PLAYED A LOT OF FLAWED CHARACTERS. YOU WERE THE PRIEST IN "SILENCE." OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE IN "HACKSAW RIDGE." HOW DO YOU KEEP-- OKAY, HOW DO YOU KEEP FROM GETTING TOO SWAMPED BY THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE WORK? DO YOU HAVE ANY-- HOW DOES ANDREW GARFIELD LIGHTEN IT UP? SINCE THE CARE-FREE SPIDER-MAN DAYS ARE BEHIND YOU.
OH, YEAH, THEY WERE CARE-FREE.
Stephen: WERE THEY NOT CARE-FREE?
LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING SPIDER-MAN.
THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SPIDER-MAN BUT WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, STEPHEN. THAT'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY. IT'S NOT JUST, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: YOU JUST COULDN'T ROCK THE TIGHTS ANYMORE, IS THAT IT?
DON'T DIMINISH-- DON'T DIMINISH THE EXPERIENCE. DON'T REDUCE IT.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE IN ANY WAY. I APOLOGIZE.
NO, BUT MOVING ON QUICKLY FROM THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) I-- YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
ABOUT LIGHTNESS, IT WAS ABOUT LIGHTNESS.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU LIGHTEN IT UP.
GOODNESS, GRACIOUS ME. THERE'S A GAME I LIKE TO PLAY WITH MY CASTMATES. IT'S CALLED THE GAME OF GIDDINESS AND FREEDOM.
Stephen: FOR A GAME THAT LIGHTENS YOU UP, THAT SURE IS A HIGHFALUTIN NAME. THAT'S THE SEQUEL TO "THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING." "THE GAME OF GIDDINESS AND FREEDOM?"
I MADE IT UP.
Stephen: LET'S GET GIDDY AND FREE.
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?
Stephen: I'LL TRY. LET'S GET GIDDY AND FREE. WE'RE TOO SERIOUS RIGHT NOW. LET'S GET GIDDY AND FREE.
THE GAME OF GIDDINESS AND FREEDOM IS PRET MUCH YOU SAY THINGS. YOU JUST SAMES.
Stephen: IT IT SOUNDS LEAK A SIMPLE GAME.
IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE GAME.
Stephen: ANYTHING?
ANYTHING ANY WORDS IN ANY ORDER. THE RULE IS YOU DON'T THINK.
Stephen: IT'S RULE ASSOCIATION.
NOT REALLY, NO. LET'S JUST BEGIN. HEY, STEPHEN, YOU'RE-- HI, MY NAME IS ANDREW. AND YOU'RE MY FRIEND OR ONCE WERE. SHALL WE GO TO THE BALL?
Stephen: HI, ANDREW, TALKING TO YOU IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A MAN'S EYEBROWS.
YES, YES!
Stephen: AND THE SKIN ON THE WATER IN THE POOL AND THE MUSIC AND THE SPLASHING AND THE SMELL.
MY-- MY FRIEND FRED CALLED YOU A LOSER, AND I DON'T THINK HE'S RIGHT.
Stephen: MANY PEOPLE-- AND THE SPIDER-MAN WAS-- I NEVER SAW THOSE MOVIES THAT YOU WERE IN. I HEARD THEY'RE VERY GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A GOOD GAME.
THAT'S THE GAME OF GIDDINESS AND FREEDOM.
Stephen: I LIKE IT, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU COULD GO ON FOREVER.
Stephen: IT'S WORD ASSOCIATION CONFESSION, THOUGH?
IS IT.
Stephen: IT'S LEAK A CONFESSION.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
Stephen: JUST THINGS BURST OUT. I DID NOT SEE EITHER OF YOUR SPIDER-MAN MOVIES, BUT I WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT-- I WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT IF WE HADN'T PLAYED THE GAME AND NOW I CONFESSED BUT IN SUCH A GIDDY AND LIGHT WAY YOU CAN'T BE MAD AT ME BECAUSE I KNOW HOW SERIOUSLY YOU TAKE THOSE MOVIES. THE NEW MOVIE--
WE'RE NOT PLAYING GAME ANYMORE?
Stephen: WE CAN PLAY THE GAME, BUT THAT MEANS WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT YOUR MOVIE. IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER.
NO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FILM.
Stephen: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FILM.
ME, TOO.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED BREATHE" ABOUT ROB AND HIS FAMILY. WHAT DID HE DO, NOT JUST FOR HIMSELF BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD?
REMARKABLE. HE WAS-- OH, GOD, HOW DO I EVEN START? I'LL TRY-- BECAUSE I'M HERE.
Stephen: HE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN.
HE WAS ENGLISH, THANK YOU. NO, HE WAS A WONDERFUL MAN. HEESMS THIS VERY CHARMING, CHARMED ATHLETE, CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY BACK IN THE 50s. HE MET THIS WONDERFUL WOMAN DIANA. THEY GOT MARRIED VERY QUICKLY, FELL IN LOVE VERY QUICKLY. THEY WENT TO KENYA. HE WAS A TEA BROKER AND THEN AT THE AGE OF 28 HE GOT HIT WITH THE POLO VIRUS AND HE WAS PARALYZED FROM THE NECK DOWN FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE, AND IT WAS, OF COURSE, A MAJOR BLOW. AND HE WAS VERY DEPRESSED FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS, AND SUICIDAL FOR-- FOR A PART OF IT, DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS VALUE WAS ANYMORE, WHAT HIS PURPOSE OR MEANING AND BEING IN THE WORLD WAS ANYMORE. BUT IT WAS WITH THE LOVE OF HIS WIFE, THIS AMAZING WOMAN WHO IS STILL WITH US, DIANA CAVENDISH, AND HIS INCREDIBLE GROUP OF FRIENDS, THAT HE MANAGED TO REFIND THAT SPARK AND LONGING FOR LIFE. AND HE-- HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO WAS ON-- HE HAD TO LIVE ON A VENTULARITY, ON AN EXTERNAL VENTULARITY, RESPIRATOR, MACHINE THAT BREATHED FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WASN'T ABLE TO DO IT ANYMORE.
Stephen: WHAT THEY CALL THE IRON LUNG.
BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY ON A VENTILATOR, WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE WERE ON AN IRON LUNG. HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON ON ANY FORM OF EXTERNAL VENTILATION WHO DECIDED TO LEAVE HOSPITAL AND LIVE AT HOME. HE WAS THE FIRST PESPINOT.
Stephen: RESPINAUGHT?
SOMEONE ON A RESPIRATOR LEAVING THE CONFINESAVE HOSPITAL. IT WAS CONSIDERED A DEATH SENTENCE. HE WAS A DARING, PIONEERING, ADVENTUROUS MAN WHO DECIDED, "IF I'M GOING TO BE HERE, I'M GOING TO LIVE. I WANT TO BE AT HOME WITH MY WIFE AND I WANT TO SEE MY SON, YOU KNOW, GROW UP."
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF YOU AS ROBIN CAVENDISH AND HIS WIFE AND HIS SON. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS SCENE?
OH, YEAH, I THINK IN THIS SCENE, WE'RE-- I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE ROBIN IS DREAMING ABOUT GOING FURTHER. HE WAS ALWAYS LONGING TO GO FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER, AND NOT LET THIS LIMITATION BE THAT, A LIMITATION.
Stephen: JIM.
I'M SORRY.
ME, TOO. ( APPLAUSE )
BUT IT'S NOT HEAVY. IT'S A REALLY LIGHT FILM.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "BREATHE" IS IN THEATER THIS FRIDAY.
Stephen: HAY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST IS A SEVEN-TIME EMMY AWARD-WINNING, SKETCH COMEDY ACTRESS AND STAR OF "TRACEY ULLMAN'S SHOW." PLEASE WELCOME TRACEY ULLMAN. ♪ GIVE IT UP FOR TRACEY ULLMAN GIVE IT UP FOR TRACEY ULLMAN ♪ GIVE IT UP FOR TRACEY ULLMAN GIVE IT UP FOR TRACEY ULLMAN ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, TRACEY
HELLO, STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: AS I SAID, "TRACEY ULLMAN'S SHOW," TRACEY TAKE OFF, TRACEY STATE OF THE UNION--
MY NAME IS IN THE TITLE. A PATTERN.
Stephen: MUCH HARDER TO REPLACE YOU IN THE SHOW IF YOUR NAME IS IN THE TITLE. YOU ALSO GET ALL THE PRAISE, AND SEMIEMMY AWARDS. MANY MORE NOMINATIONS.
YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND AGAIN THIS YEAR AT THE EMMYS YOU WERE NOMINATED AGAIN.
YEAH.
Stephen: FOR THE FIRST SEASON OF "THE TRACEY ULLMAN SHOW." DIDN'T WIN, FERL UNFORTUNATELY.
I THINK I WOULD, THOUGH. BEING UP AGAINST "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" WAS PRETTY TOUGH THIS YEAR. "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" IS UNBELIEVABLE. THANK GOD FOR "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE." SO I JUST HAD A SMASHING TIME.
Stephen: THE SECOND SEASON STARTS OCTOBER 20. YOU'RE KNOWN FOR YOUR CHARACTERS AND IMPRESSIONS AND YOU DO A LOT OF THEM ON YOUR SHOW. WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST? DO YOU REMEMBER THEM AS A CHILD, YOUR FIRST ONE? AND DID YOU DO THEM AS CHILDREN?
I USED TO STAND ON THE WENDO SILL IN MY MOTHER'S BEDROOM AND DO A SHOW. A LOT OF US DID, DIDN'T WE? DID YOU? AND I USED TO IMITATE THE OLD SPINSTER, ANNIE COX WHO HAD LOST HER FIANCE IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR. I USED TO DO THINGS LIKE THAT. AND I USED TO PRETEND I WAS EDITH PEAR. RUBBISH. AND MY MOTHER WOULD GO, "IT'S UNBELIEVABLE SHE'S SPEAKING FRENCH. SHE'S NEVER HAD A LESSON  ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN THEY USED TO JUST DRAW THE CURTAINS AND I WOULD-- I KNEW THAT WAS WHEN THE SHOW WAS OVER.
Stephen: WINDOW WAS CLOSED, RIGHT? WINDOW WAS CLOSED DURING THIS PERFORMANCE?
YEAH, YEAH. BUT THAT SORT OF THING. AND I STILL FEEL I'M STILL DOING THAT NOW.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
EVERY DECADE OF MY LIFE I'VE CONTINUED TO DO THE "TRACEY ULLMAN SHOW."
Stephen: IS IT TRUE-- I KNOW YOU'RE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN NOW. YOU BECAME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IN THE 2008 ELECTION SO YOU COULD VOTE FOR BARACK OBAMA. IS THIS TRUE?
YEAH. I DID. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I MET HIM AT, LIKE, SOME LITTLE PARTY, LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHOULD-- I JUST WAS SO IMPRESS WITH THE MAN. I LEFT LIKE ON A HIGH. I THOUGHT, "I'M GOING TO BECOME AN AMERICAN!" AND I DID. I TOOK THE TEST AND IT WAS AT THE STAPLE CENTER IN L.A. AND THEY PLAYED A MOVIE WITH THE MONSTER TRUCKS AND THE MOON LANDING AND GEORGE W. BUSH WAS STILL PRESIDENT. ♪ I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN BECAUSE AT LEAST I KNOW I'M FREE THEY PLAYED THAT ♪ AND I STAND IN ♪
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE SWORN IN?
WHEN WE WERE SWORN IN THEY PLAYED THAT.
Stephen: I WOULD LIKE TO BE SWORN IN. IT'S LIKE-- YOU WERE BAPTIZED WHEN YOU WERE BORN AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE THE CHOICE. HOW DID YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS FEEL BACK HOME KICKING THE QUEEN TO THE CURB. YOU HAVE TO RENOUNCE THE QUEEN, DON'T YOU?
SO AMERICAN, "HEY, YOU'RE KICKING THE QUEEN TO THE CURB."
Stephen: DON'T YOU HAVE TO RENOUNCE THE QUEEN?
NO! I'M NOT A ROYALIST. THEY DON'T WANT ME AS A DAME. I'M NOT LOSING ANYTHING THERE. WHEN KATE MIDDLETON IS PREGNANT AGAIN, THEY ALWAYS SAY THINGS LIKE, "KATE MIDDLETON HAS HYPERPAREMESIS." WHY CAN'T THEY SAY SHE'S THROWING UP. SHE FEEFLS SO BAD, SHE'S BARFING. THAT'S ROYAL. THROWING UP.
Stephen: YEAH, WE HAVE A CLIP HERE FROM THE SHOW. WHO ARE YOU PLAYING IN THIS CLIP?
UH, WHERE IS IT? OH, JUDI DENCH. IS IT JUDI DENCH AND MAGGIE SMITH.
Stephen: AND JUDI DENCH IS IN JAIL. WHAT IS SHE IN JAIL FOR IN THIS?
WELL, SHE'S A NATIONAL TREASURE BUT SHE'S NAUGHTY JUDI DENCH, MY JUDI DENCH. SHE DOES THINGS LIKE SHOPLIFTS IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND THROWS DOG POO INTO TREES. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WRAP THEM UP IN BAGS AND... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE JUDI DENCH.
AND SHE GETS CAUGHT FOR DOING THAT, AND MAGGIE SMITH HAS TO COME BAIL HER OUT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
AGZ YOU DO.
Stephen: JIM. ( LAUGHTER )
MAGGIE! THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE! THEY'VE CONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT I COMMITTED SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL INFRACTION.  OF COURSE, I TOLD THEM I COULD HAVE DONE NO SUCH THING. I'M BELOVED BY THE NATION. BUCKINGHAM PALACE, BUT THEY JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.
WELL, MADAM, YOU KNOW THIS LADY?
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE IN MY LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ).
BUT IT'S ME, JUDI! WE DID "THE MARIGOLDS" TOGETHER.
YES, AND I GOT SECOND BILGE.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.
OH, I THINK I CAN. I'M A NATIONAL TREASURE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S HARD TO THINK-- IT'S HARD TO THINK OF JUDI DENCH AS A CRIMINAL, THOUGH, AS A TROUBLEMAKER.
SHE LIKES IT, THOUGH.
Stephen: DOES SHE?
YES.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
SHE'S-- SHE APPROVES OF IT. AND SHE SAID THE PEOPLE LOOK AT HER FUN NESHOPS NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I ADMIRE THEM SO MUCH. MAGGIE AND JUDI. I MEAN, THEY ARE NATIONAL TREASURE S.
Stephen:  DO YOU CALL THEM MAGGIE AND JUDI.
DARLING, ACTORS ALWAYS KEEL EACH OTHER BY YOU KNOW-- I HAVE MET THEM.
Stephen: NOW, THEY'RE BOTH DAMES.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO BE A DAME?
OH, PLEASE, I'M NOT GOING TO BE A DAME.
Stephen: I'M SURE THERE'S A PARTY AND YOU GET A BADGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND AMERICANS ARE SO IMPRESSED BY THAT (BLEEP).
THEY ARE, THEY ARE. I THINK TRUMP IS DESPERATE TO GET TO ENGLAND BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE IN THE CINDERELLA CARRIAGE GOING DOWN THE MALL WAVING,UN.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO GET THERE QUICK! IT TURNS INTO A PUMPKIN AT MIDNIGHT.
AND CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES SAYS, "IF HE GRABS MY PUSSY, I'LL BREAK HIS ARM." AS SHE SHOULD. AS SHE SHOULD.
