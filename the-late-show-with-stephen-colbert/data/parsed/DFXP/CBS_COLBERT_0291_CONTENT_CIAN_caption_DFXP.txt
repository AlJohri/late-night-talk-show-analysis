IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES. SHAILENE WOODLEY, LAVERNE COX AND RICK AND MARTY LAGINA. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT IS STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHOOO! WHOOO! HEY, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU GUYS WATCH-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU GUYS WATCH THE GRAMMYS LAST NIGHT? JAMES CORDEN DID A GREAT JOB, FANTASTIC SHOW. EVERYBODY WAS THERE. FUN SIZED SUPERSTAR BRUNO MARS SALUTED PRINCE, DAFT PUNK AND THE WEEKEND PERFORMED IN SUPERMAN'S FORTRESS OF SAL TEUD. DWIGHT YOAKAM WONDERED ON STAGE APPARENTLY LOOKING FOR THE PARKING GARAGE. THERE WERE A FEW TECHNICAL DEFICITS. ADELE HAD SOME, LADY GAGA AND METALLICA HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE MIC, EVIDENTLY. ♪ IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY A METALLICA CROWD HAD TO SAY, WHAT? WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. TURN IT UP. I'M NOT GETTING-- I'M NOT-- (APPLAUSE) BUT I'M BEING TOLD, I'M TOLD THAT CBS HAS FOUND THE MISSING AUDIO TRACK. JIM, CAN WE PLAY THAT WITH JAMES HETFIELDS VOCALS RESTORED. I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK BABY I WAS BORN THIS WAY. (LAUGHTER) GAGA, GAGA AND METALLICA PERFECT. JUST GREAT. SUCH A BLENDING OF THE STYLES. OF COURSE THE STAR OF LAST NIGHT AS EVERY NIGHT WAS BEYONCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE WAS NOMINATED FOR NINE GRAMMYS INCLUDING ALBUM OF THE YEAR FOR LEMONADE. EVERYBODY EXPECTED HER TO WIN, ESPECIALLY THE WOMAN WITHOUT ACTUALLY WON.
I CAN'T POSSIBLY ACCEPT THIS AWARD AND I'M VERY HUMBLED AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL AND GRACIOUS BUT MY ARTIST OF MY LIFE IS BEYONCE AND THIS ALBUM TO ME, THE LEMONADE ALBUM WAS JUST, SO MONUMENTAL, BEYONCE, IT WAS SO MONUMENTAL.
Stephen: I THINK ADELE JUST SAID I AMA LET ME FINISH BUT BEYONCE HAD ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIMES. RIGHT? SHE SELF-KAYNEED. VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN PULL THAT OFF. IN FACT, ADELE WAS SO SHAKEN BY THE WIN THAT SHE ACCIDENTALLY TORE HER GRAMMY IN HALF, THAT'S RIGHT, EVEN ADELE'S VICTORIES ARE BREAKUP STORIES. BUT YOU KNOW WHO DID NOT WIN A GRAMMY LAST NIGHT? DONALD TRUMP. YEAH. RIGGED. TOTALLY RIGGED. (LAUGHTER) MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL GRAMMY VOTERS. SAD. DIDN'T HAPPEN. FAKE NEWS. THAT'S FAKE NEWS. FAKE AWARDS. (APPLAUSE) THIS WEEK DONALD TRUMP TOOK JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE DOWN TO MAR-A-LAGO AND AT DINNER TRUMP WAS SWARMED WITH PAYING MEMBERS WHO WERE HOPING FOR A FEW SECONDS WITH THE PRESIDENT. NOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE CORRUPTION-- (APPLAUSE) LET ME SET THE SCENE. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRIME MINISTER ABE ARE EATING THEIR DINNERS WHEN THEY RECEIVE NEWS THAT NORTH KOREA HAD TEST LAUNCHED A BALLISTIC MISSILE. THIS IS A PROVOCATION BY A ROGUE NUCLEAR STATE. SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IMMEDIATELY RETREATED TO A SECURE LOCATION WHERE HE COULD BE BRIEFED ON THE DETAILS. I'M JUST KIDDING. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP TOOK THE CALL ON HIS CELL PHONE AT THE TABLE AND THE MEAL QUICKLY MORPHED INTO A STRATEGY SESSION IN FULL VIEW OF THE FELLOW DINERS. THAT'S RIGHT. TRUMP TEAM HANDLED AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS LIKE TEENS AT AND AFTER-PROM PARTY LOOKING AT DEREK'S INSTAGRAM. DID YOU KNOW HE'S WITH KAYLEN, DID YOU KNOW HE IS WITH KAYLEN, I DISN KNOW KAYLEN HAD NUKES. THAT'S SAD. OTHER DINERS EVEN POSTED FACEBOOK PHOTOS OF TRUMP AND ABE LOOKING AT ONE IMAGINED ARE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS BY THE LIGHT OF SOMEONE'S CELL PHONE FLASH LIGHT. BUT I'M SURE THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE SECURE UNLESS THAT CELL PHONE FLASH LIGHT ALSO SHOW HAS A CAMERA ATTACHED TO IT IT. CAN'T HAPPEN. ANOTHER GUY POSTED FACEBOOK PHOTOS OF HIMSELF WITH A GUY WHO CARRIES AROUND THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES, IDENTIFYING THE STAFFER BY NAME. THIS IS RICK. RICK IS THE MAN. OR (APPLAUSE) RICK IS THE MAN-- OR MORE ACCURATELY RICK WAS THE MAN, UNTIL HIS IDENTITY WAS COMPROMISED NEXT TO THE CARVING STATION. THE GUY HAS SINCE TAKEN DOWN THE FACEBOOK POST. AND I CAN'T BLAME HIM. HE ONLY GOT 20 LIKES. (LAUGHTER) I THINK A POST ABOUT THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES REALLY SHOULD HAVE BLOWN UP. OF COURSE-- OF COURSE-- WHAT? (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE STILL UPSET ABOUT TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN. SO YESTERDAY TRUMP SENT OUT A NEW FACE, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR AND YOUNG GARGAMEL STEPHEN MILLER. HE WAS ON ALL THE SUNDAY SNOWS. HE WAS ON THE NATION FACE, HE WAS ON MEET THE GOATEE AND SUNDAY WITH THIS WEEK GEORGE. AND THE NATION FACE HIMSELF, JOHN DICKERSON HAD AN INTROSPECTIVE QUESTION FOR MILLER.
WHEN I TALK TO REPUBLICANS ON THE HILL, THEY WONDER WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT HAVE YOU ALL LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER?
OUR OPPONENTS, THE MEDIA AND THE WHOLE WORLD WILL SOON SEE AS WE BEGIN TO TAKE FURTHER ACTIONS THAT THE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED.
Stephen: ADDING I AM BECOME DEATH, DESTROYER OF WORLDS. KNEEL BEFORE ZOD. (LAUGHTER) KNEEL, KNEEL, KNEEL. (APPLAUSE) HAVE JOHN DICKERSON WASHED AND BROUGHT TO ZOD'S TENT. JIMMY, CAN WE JUST PLAY THAT LAST SENTENCE AGAIN.
THE POWERS OF PRESIDENT TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED.
Stephen: WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED? LET ME TEST THAT THEORY. WHAT THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MILLER DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE TRAVEL BAN. THIS WEEK THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ESTIMATED THAT TRUMP'S BORDER WALL IS GOING TO COST $21.6 BILLION DOLLAR BILLS. BUT MILLER SAYS IT IS A GOOD INVESTMENT.
THIS WALL WILL PAY FOR ITSELF MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES OVER. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: IT WILL PAY FOR ITSELF? I THOUGHT MEXICO WAS PAYING FOR IT. NOW TRUMP'S GOING TO MAKE THE WALL PAY FOR THE WALL? THAT'S NOT FAIR. THAT'S NOT FAIR AT ALL. BUT MILLER TOOK HIS STRONGEST STAND WHEN IT CAME TO DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT'S SUPER CRAZY CHARGES OF VOTER FRAWT. THIS WEEK TRUMP SAID THE ONLY REASON HE LOST NEW HAMPSHIRE IS BECAUSE VOTERS WERE BUSSED IN FROM MASSACHUSETTS. AND MILLER HAS THE EVIDENCE, KIND OF SORT OF.
WINE STRAWB-- WEINTRAUB SAYS A CALL UPON THE PRESIDENT TO SHARE VOTER FRAUD EVIDENCE SO ALLEGATIONS MAY BE INVESTIGATED PROMPTLY, DO YOU HAVE THAT EVIDENCE?
THIS MORNING ON THIS SHOW IS NOT THE VENUE FOR ME TO LAY OUT ALL THE EVIDENCE.
Stephen: OKAY. (LAUGHTER) NOT ALL THE EVIDENCE. HOW ABOUT SOME OF THE EVIDENCE. MAYBE ANY OF THE EVIDENCE?
GEORGE, GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, TALK TO ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN POLITICS THERE FOR A LONG TIME. EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
Stephen: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD AN EYE WITNESS. YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO CALL TO THE STAND ANYBODY IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. GET THEM UP HERE. AND WHILE MILLER DOESN'T WANT TO SHOW ANY EVIDENCE ON TV, HE WILL SHOW ALL OF HIS FACE ON ANY OF IT.
I'M PREPARED TO GO ON ANY SHOW, ANYWHERE, ANY TIME AND REPEAT IT AND SAY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CORRECT, 100%.
Stephen: ANY SHOW, ANY TIME, ANYWHERE? PERFECT. HOW ABOUT THE LATE SHOW TOMORROW AT THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD? OKAY. AND GUESS WHAT, YOU'VE ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT YOU WILL BE HERE TOMORROW. NEED EVIDENCE? ASK ANYONE IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP, I'M GONNA CALL YOU A LIAR. (APPLAUSE) AND IF YOU DO SHOW UP, I AM GONNA CALL YOU A LIE TORE YOUR FACE. WE HAVE A TBREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SHAILENE WOODLEY IS HERE. STICK AROUND. ♪
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: FOLKS, BEFORE WE GET STARTED, WE WANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, OUR FRIEND CHARLIE ROSE AT THE CHARLIE ROSE SHOW AND CBS THIS MORNING, HE HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY LAST WEEK, AND HE'S DOING GREAT. HE'S DOING GREAT. WE JUST WANT TO SAY GET WELL, CHARLIE. GET WELL. HAVE THEM THROW AN EXTRA HEART IN THERE, THROW AN EXTRA ONE IN THERE. YOU'RE A STAR. YOU CAN GET THAT.

I LOVE, LOVE.
Stephen: WE BOTH HAVE VALENTINES. SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE MAYBE DO NOT HAVE A VALENTINE. HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE FINDING SOMEONE TO BE WITH ON VALENTINE'S DAY.
Jon: YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THAT'S WHY I MADE A SIMPLE GUIDE TO TEACH EVERYONE HOW TO FIND LOVE IN JUST SIX EASY STEPS. JIM HELLO, STUDENTS I'M JON BATISTE AND THIS IS PIANO 10-FUN. HOW TO LOVE. LET'S FACE IT, WHEN IT COMES TO FEELINGS, LOVE IS THE BIG KA HUMANA. BUT IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF AMERICANS WHO STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A SOUL MATE, LISTEN UP. LESS LESSON ONE, HISTORY'S GREATEST LOVERS. NONE OF US WOULD BE HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR TWO VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE FALLING IN LOVE. TOM HANKS AND RITA WILSON. DON'T THINK WE COULD CARRY ON WITHOUT THEM. AND IF YOU WANT TO FOA ABOUT LOVE, LEARN FROM THE BEST BY READING UP ON FAMOUS COUPLES LIKE ADAM AND EVE, ROMEO AND JULY YETD, GARFIELD AND DILLBERT. NICK AND 25 ELIGIBLE BACHELORETTES AND WHO COULD FORGET EARTH AND MOON. JUST KISS, ALREADY. LESSON TWO, DATING. DATING IS LIKE A JOB INTERVIEW. IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT, YOU'LL END UP WORKING AT SPORTS AUTHORITY. BUT WHY TELL YOU HOW TO GO ON A DATE WHEN I CAN TAKE YOU ON A VIRTUAL DATE. PUT ON YOUR VR GOGGLES NOW. HELLO. THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE. YOU LOOK GREAT. HOW YOU DOING? ME TOO BUT MY NAME IS NOT ALEX, IT'S JON. TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT YOURSELF. HA, HA, I DON'T TRUST CATERPILLARS EITHER.

YOU HAVE FAILED THE DATE. YOU WILL DIE ALONE. HA HA HA HA HA. GREAT JOB. LESSON THREE, SO YOU HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE AND DECIDED TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL, HUH? THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO POP THE BIG QUESTION. WILL YOU MARRY ME? YOUR PROPOSAL IS A MOMENT YOU WANT TO REMEMBER FOREVER SO BE SURE TO GET IT ON CAMERA. HERE'S A TIP, PROPOSE ON A SLIP AND SLIDE THAT'S BEING USED BY A GROUP OF FUN-LOVING GOLDEN RETRIEVER PUPPIES AND THEY'LL SEND THE TAPE IN TO AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS AM YOU CAN WIN $10,000. I USE MY MONEY TO BUY THIS GIANT CHECK. BUYERS REMORSE. LESSON FOUR.
Stephen: JON? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY DRESSING ROOM.
I'M TEACHING THE PEOPLE ABOUT LOVE. LESSON FIVE, THE MOVIE FORREST GUMP. MY FAVORITE PART IS WHEN HE GETS THAT BOAT AND HE IS ON THE WATER AND HE HASN'T SEEN LIEUTENANT DAN A LONG TIME AND THEN SEE HIM A ACROSS THE WATER AND HE LIKE LIEUTENANT DAN, DAN, AND HE JUMP IN THE WATER AND HE SWIM AND HE'S LIKE OH, SHUCKS HAVE I TO CATCH LIEUTENANT DAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM, SINCE VIETNAM. POP POP POP. THEN HE DIED, OH, LESSON SIX, THERE MUST BE TWO DOZEN SONGS WRITTEN ABOUT LOVE, ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, LOVE ME DO AND OCTOPU S GARDEN. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE IN LOVE TO WRITE A LOVE SONG. HERE'S A HINT. WRITE A SONG ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE IN LIFE THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT AND THEN JUST SWITCH IT OUT FOR YOUR LOVERS NAME. CHECK OUT THIS TUNE I WROTE.

♪ I CAN SEE ALL I WANT. ♪.
HOW IS IT.
Stephen: HOW IS IT?
YEAH, HI.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU.
I'M GOOD.
Stephen: THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL DRESS AND YOU HAVE RECENTLY BEEN MADE AN ADD MIRNL I SEE, IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE AUTHORITY.
THANK YOU, IT'S NOT MINE BUT I AGREE, I THINK IT'S REALLY PRETTY.
Stephen: THIS ISN'T MINE EITHER. I WAS WARNED BEFORE I MET YOU THAT YOU.
WERE YOU WARNED.
Stephen: I WAS WARNED THAT YOU WERE A HUGGER.
YES.
Stephen: I WAS WARNED YOU ARE A HUGGER AND I GOT A GREAT HUG FROM YOU.
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT, THANKS FOR HUGGING ME BACK. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WEIRD IF YOU HADN'T HUGGED ME BACK. I JUST HUG YOU AND YOU JUST STAND THERE.
Stephen: WHERE IS THE HUGGING COME FROM? IS IT VERY FULL AND LOVING HUG.
I WAS ACTUALLY JUST TALKING TO SOMEBODY BACK THEREMENT I FEEL LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY IN THIS INDUSTRY YOU MEET SOMEONE FOR FIVE SECONDS AND THERE IS A HANDSHAKE AND A HI HOW ARE YOU BUT NO ONE IS LISTENING TO YOU HOW YOU ARE, GOOD, NOT DWOODZ, I FEEL LIKE WE DO THAT A LOT IN LIFE ESPECIALLY WITH OUR PHONES AND TECHNOLOGY THERE IS NOT A LOT OF REAL INTERACTIONS SO MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO LIKE THAT OR MAYBE I JUST DON'T LIKE SHAKING SWUB'S HANDS BECAUSE THEN YOUR HANDS GET ALL GRIMY.
Stephen: UH-HUH. I REALLY WANT TO USE SOME PU RELL RIGHT NOW.
WE DIDN'T SHAKE HANDS.
Stephen: DID YOU GROW UP IN A HUGGING FAMILY. WAS IT ENCOURAGED AT HOME?
NO, I MEAN-- KIDS, MAKE SURE WHEN YOU GO TO SCHOOL TODAY THAT YOU HUG EVERYONE IN CLASS. NO --
Stephen: WE HAD TO HUG EACH OTHER. I'M ONE OF 11 I HAD CANS AND WE HAD TO HUG EACH OTHER. WE COULDN'T FIGHT, WHEN TO END EVERY FIGHT WITH A HUG.
FIGHTING BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND MY BROTHER AND I, WE FOUGHT A LOT AS KIDS. OVER SILLY THINGS AND THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME IN PARTICULAR MY DAD MADE MY BROTHER AND I SIT ON OUR FRONT LAW. LAWN, I GREW UP IN SU BUR BE-- SUBURBIA SO WE TBHEU EVERY NEIGHBOR. WE HAD TO SIT ON THE FRONT LAWN FOR WHAT FELT LIKE FOUR HOURS T WAS PROBABLY 30 OR 40 MINUTES.
Stephen: YOU HAD TO HUG EACH OTHER.
WE HAD TO HUG EACH OTHER. MY DAD WOULD COME OUT EVERY TEN MINUTES. HAVE YOU WORKED IT OUT YET, YOU HAVE SAID YOUR SORRY. MY RECOLLECTION IS MY BROTHER AND I JUST AGREED TO SAY LET'S JUST TELL HIM THAT WE WORKED IT OUT AND THEN WE CAN LEAVE.
Stephen: WOW, DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT KIND OF PARENTING? ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT WITH YOUR KIDS.
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN I THINK IT'S KIND OF HILARIOUS, RIGHT? LIKE WE MAKE OUR KIDS HUG EACH OTHER.
Stephen: MY FAMILY.
I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED.
Stephen: HUG AND KISS, ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE SPOT WHERE THE FIGHT WAS HAPPENING.
UNTIL YOU HUGGED IT OUT AND KISSED IT OUT.
Stephen: HUG AND KISS, THAT WAS IT, HAD TO.
AND DID THAT JUST BECOME ROUTINE AND WAS IT-- DID YOU ACTUALLY GET OVER IT.
Stephen: WE LEARNED TO PRETEND.
EXACTLY. WE LEARNED TO PRETEND TO LOVE EACH OTHER.
HOW DOES THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU.
Stephen: FANTASTIC. WE STILL PRETEND TO LOVE EACH OTHER. ACTUALLY WE LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH. ARE YOU VERY INTERESTED IN THE ENVIRONMENT. I WANT TO SHOW THIS PHOTO. ARE YOU COOL WITH US SHOWING THAT PHOTO.
YOU CAN SHOW THAT.
Stephen: I THOUGHT PERHAPS AT FIRST YOU WERE AUDITIONING FOR ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. BUT THIS IS YOU ACTUALLY HAVING BEEN ARRESTED AT THE STANDING ROCK PROTEST.
YES. (APPLAUSE)
I WISH I HAD KNOWN.
Stephen: GO A HEADS.
I WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AS PUBLIC AS IT WAS. I WOULD HAVE MADE LIKE A FACE. I FEEL LIKE I'M LOOKING AT THE PERSON LIKE ARE YOU KID MING RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: I THINK IS T IS A FAIRLY GOOD FACE IF. I WAS ARRESTED AND PUT IN AN ORANGE JUMP SUIT I WOULDN'T LOOK AS SERENE AS YOU DO. EXPLAIN, I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL PROTESTS OUT IN THE NORTH OF THE AMERICAN PLAINS OVER DEVELOPMENT ON TRIBAL LANDS. SPECIFICALLY E EXPLAIN STANDING ROCK.
STANDING ROCK HAS BEEN THE TRIBE STANDING ROCK HAS BEEN OPPOSING THIS SINCE 2014 AND LAST YEAR STARTING AROUND SEPTEMBER THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FLOODED TO THE RESERVATION TO PROTEST THIS PIPE-LINE AND WE GOT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS UNDER OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION TO DENY THE EASEMENT SO THEY COULDN'T DRILL. AND AS WE HAVE ALL MAYBE HEARD IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, THERE HAS BEEN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION SAYING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH THE EASEMENT ANYWAYS AND START DRILLING.
Stephen: SO DO THE PROTESTS CONTINUE OR IS IT SORT OF-- FET APLOMB.
THE PROTEST IS CONTINUING, PEOPLE ARE STILL THERE. BUT THE THING THAT I LIKE TO SORT OF START TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THAT THE FRONT LINES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE IN NORTH DAKOTA. THE FRONT LINES CAN BE WHEREVER YOU R YOU CAN CREATE A PROTEST IN NEW YORK CITY, YOU CAN CREATE A PROTEST BECAUSE PROTESTS ARE ABOUT CREATING AWARENESS AND ABOUT PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER. AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST WAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT THIS PIPELINE MORE SO THAN EVEN PROTESTING ON THE FRONT LINES IF THAT'S NOT YOUR SPEED IS TO DIVEST FROM THESE BIG BANKS THAT ARE INVESTED IN THE PIPELINE. AND THAT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BANKS THAT ARE INVESTED IN THE PIPELINE, IT'S ABOUT BANKS THAT ARE INVESTED IN THE, YOU KNOW, THE IMMIGRATION, ALL OF THESE THINGS. SO THERE WILL BE A WEBSITE UP IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS CALLED HOW TO DI VEST.ORG AND YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
Stephen: SO DID YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE OLD GRAY BAR HOTEL WERE YOU ACTUALLY THROWN IN JAIL.
I WAS, YEAH.
Stephen: WAS IT ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU WENT INTO THE YARD AND PUNCHED THE BIG ES PERSON YOU COULD SEE, WHAT WAS IT SHALL-- HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE?
I WAS ONLY-- I WAS LUCKY. MY MOM WAS ACTUALLY WITH ME IN NORTH DAKOTA THAT DAY BY HAPPENS CHANCE.
Stephen: MOM WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN NORTH DAKOTA.
SHE WAS OUT THERE TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE WITH THIS POW WOW IN RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA. WE WERE UP THERE, I WAS FACED, I GOT ARRESTED. I HANDED HER MY PHONE AND I WAS LIKE KEEP RECORDING. AND THE LOOK ON HER FACE, SHE WASN'T THERE SHE WAS SHOCKED. I CAN'T IMAGINE ACTUALLY WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO SEE YU DAUGHTER HANDCUFFED AND TAKEN AWAY.
Stephen: DID AT ANY POINT SHE SAY I WANT TO YOU HUG IT OUT WITH THE POLICE OFFICER, OKAY. WELL, NOW YOU ARE IN, IT IS A MINI SERIES, A NEW SHOW ON HBO CALLED BIG LITTLE LIES WITH REESE WITHERSPOON AND NICOLE KIDMAN, WERE YOU AT ALL INTIMIDATED LIKE A FRESHMAN WITH THE SENIORS AROUND THE LUNCH TABLE WITH THOSE TWO.
I WASN'T INTIMIDATED. I WAS REALLY EXCITED. I WAS A LITTLE BIT AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING TO BREAK INTO A MOULON ROUGE SONG BECAUSE I LOVE MUSICALS AND I LOVE MOULIN ROUGE.
Stephen: THAT WOULD MAKE NICOLE KIDMAN UNCOMFORTABLE.
MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE ME REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE PROBABLY MORE THAN HER. BUT YOU KIND OF WANT TO KEEP THOSE LINES BETWEEN ART AND REALITY SEPARATED A LITTLE BIT. BUT I WOULD FIND MYSELF SINGING LIKE THE ELEPHANT LOVE SONG MEDLEY AND HAVE TO CHECK HER OUT AND MAKE SURE NICOLE WASN'T THERE.
Stephen: WELL, THE SHOW IS ABOUT WOMEN IN WELL-HEELED CALIFORNIA TOWNS. AND ARE YOU NEW TO THE TOWN. I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. CAN YOU SET THIS UP, WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE.
SO MY CHARACTER DOES MOVE TO MONTEREY CALIFORNIA AND FEELS OUT OF PLACE BEING A YOUNG MOTHER MONGSZ SO MANY-- AMONGST SO MANY WELL ESTABLISHED MOTHERS AND SHE EXPRESSES HER VULNERABILITY IN THIS CLIP ABOUT WHAT IT IS LIKE.
Stephen: JIM.
IT'S LIKE I'M ON THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN. OR LIKE YOU KNOW, LIKE I SEE THIS LIFE AS A MOMENT AND IT'S SO WONDERFUL. BUT IT DOESN'T QUITE BELONG TO ME. DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE? YEAH. ARE YOU FOLLOWING THIS?
YEAH.
I LOOK AT YOU AND YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT TOAM BAR RASS YOU AT ALL IT IS TRUE, YOU ARE. AND SO ARE YOU.
I AGREE.
YOU GUYS ARE JUST RIGHT. YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. AND FOR SOME REASON, THAT MAKES ME FEEL WRONG, I GUESS. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELL, IT WAS LOVELY IT TO MEET YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU. PU RELL.
Stephen: PU RELL.
OH MY GOSH, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IT I DON'T WANT IT. (LAUGHTER).

Stephen: I DON'T NEED ONE BECAUSE HERE YOU ARE. SPEAKING OF DREAM JOURNALS, THIS IS-- MAY I SHOW THIS PHOTO. THIS IS YOU LAST NIGHT WITH BEYONCE AT THE GRAMMYS. (APPLAUSE) ARE YOU DOING OKAY? ARE YOU GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
STEPHEN, I MET THE QUEEN. I MET THE QUEEN AND YOU KNOW, I HAVE OFTEN IMAGINED THIS DAY. I'VE DREAMED OF THE DAY, AT THE GRAMMYS LAST NIGHT AND I SAW, YOU KNOW, IT IS FUNNY, I WAS GETTING READY. OH MY GOSH. I AM NOT GOING TO START CRYING. I STARTED CRYING THINKING ABOUT IT IN MY APARTMENT.
Stephen: ALONE.
ALONE IN MY APARTMENT, JUST IN TEASER. AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT WHEN YOU MEET THE QUEEN, A CALM COMES OVER YOU. I-- I SWEAR TO GOD.
Stephen: I'M SHIRE STHES' VERY NICE.
A CALM CAME OVER ME AND I DID NOT CRY. I WAS STRANGELY CALM. I WALKED UP TO HER. SHE PASSED ME IN THE AISLE AND THE COMMERCIAL BREAK CAME AND I SAID THIS IS MY CHANCE. AND I GET UP AND I'M LIKE OKAY, MY GIRLFRIEND IS WITH ME. I'M GOING TO GO SHE IS TALKING WITH SOME FOLKS AND SHE IS SEATED AND BEAUTIFULFULLY PREGNANT NOW AND I KIND OF PEEK OVER AND I SMILE AT HER. AND SHE SEES ME AND HER FACE LIGHTS UP. AND THE MOMENT SHE SEES ME SHE IS LIKE HELP ME UP. SHE GOT UP, SHE GOT UP FOR ME. BEYONCE GOT UP FOR ME. (APPLAUSE) AND SHE HAD HEARD FROM HER PEOPLE THAT I'M A HUGE FAN. SHE SEN ME FLOWERS. I DID A DESTINY'S CHILD SONG FOR LIP SYNC BATTLE. LONG STORY SHORT, SHE WAS INCREDIBLE. SHE WAS SO SWEET AND I WAS VERY CALM. I GOT BACK TO MY SEAT AND I CRIED. I DID NOT CRY WHEN I MET HER.
Stephen: I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. THAT SAY FANTASTIC STORY. YOU WERE THERE FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT AM YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.
I FLEW BACK ON A RED EYE YES, AND I DID SLEEP MOST OF THE TIME BUT I'M COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED NOW. BUT ALL FOR YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
WHEN I DID THE RED EYE MY FACE LOOKS LIKE A CATCHER'S MIT THE NEXT DAY.
I HAVE AN AMAZING HAIR AND MAKEUP SHOUT OUT TO DEJA. SO I HAVE A REALLY GOOD TEAMMENT I WISH I COULD SAY THAT I WOKE UP LIKE THIS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY,.
Stephen: WELL, LAST NIGHT WHEN WERE YOU INTRODUCING LADY GAGA AND METALLICA YOU GAVE THE AUDIENCE AN ASSIGNMENTth. BOTH THERE AND AT HOME. YOU SAID EVERYONE GOOGLE GAVIN GRIM, WHY SHOULD WE GOOGLE HIP.
GAVIN GRIM IS A 17 YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN FROM GLOUCESTER, VIRGINIA, AND IS HE GOING TO THE SUPREME COURT MARCH 28th. AND IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS HEARING A CASE ON TRANSGENDER RIGHTS. GAVIN GRIM HAD TO SUE THE BOARD OF EDUCATION IN GLOUCESTER TO BE ABLE TO USE THE BOY'S BATHROOM, ALL THE OTHER BOYS IN HIS SCHOOL ARE ABLE TO BECAUSE IS HE TRANSGENDER. AND AND SO GAVIN HAD TO GO TO A BATHROOM WAY OFF, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE HIDDEN FIGURES, THAT MOMENT IN HIDDEN FIGURES WITH-- WHEN SHE HAS TO WALK LIKE 45 MINUTES TO A DIFFERENT BATHROOM. VERY MUCH LIKE THAT. AND SO I FELT LIKE PEOPLE WEREN'T TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CASE AND THIS IS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SUPREME COURT IS HEARING A CASE ABOUT TRANSRIGHTS AND IF WE LOSE THIS, OUR RIGHTS COULD BE SET BACK FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND LIKE I THINK WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT MY FRIEND SAYS FROM THE ACLU IS THAT THESE ANTI-BATHROOM, ANTI-TRANSBATHROOM BILLS ARE NOT REALLY ABOUT BATHROOMS. THEY'RE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TRANSPEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXIST IN PUBLIC SPACE. BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T USE PUBLIC BATHROOMS WE CAN'T GO TO SCHOOLS. WE CAN'T WORK. WE CAN'T GO TO HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES. SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT US HAVING A RIGHT TO EXIST IN PUBLIC SPACE AND I EXIST AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO IN PUBLIC SPACE. (APPLAUSE)
CBS IS A PUBLIC SPACE.
SO EVERYONE, SO EVERYONE PLEASE STAND WITH GAVIN GRIM SUPPORTING HIM. HE IS GOING TO THE SUPREME COURT MARCH 28th AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ELEVATE THE STORIES OF TRANSPEOPLE 2456789 IS WHY I AM SO EXCITED EXCITED ABOUT MY N DOUBT THAT YOU SHOWED A CLIP OF BECAUSE THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO BEGIN TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE. BECAUSE IT IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT TRANSPEOPLE THAT IS BEING PERPETRATED THAT IS NOT REALLY WHO WE ARE.
YOUR CHARACTER IS ALSO TRANSWOMAN.
YES, SHE IS.
SHE'S AN ATTORNEY. DOUBT PREMIERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT 10 P.M. RIGHT HERE ON CBS.
Stephen: BEAT ME TO THE BUNCH PUNCH. NOW YOUR CHARACTER WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAW IN ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK.
YOU THINK YOUR NEW CHARACTER WHACK IS YOUR NEW CAN CHARACTER'S NAME.
COULD CAMERON WORTH GET SOPHIA OFF THE HOOK.
CAMERON IS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND I BELIEVE SHE COULD. BECAUSE CAM CAMERON'S SUPERPOWER IS THAT SHE HAS THE CAPACITY TO CONVEY DEEP EMPATHY TO A JURY AND JUDGE FOR THE CLIENTS THAT SHE REPRESENTEDS. SO I DO BELIEVE THAT SHE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A JURY UNDERSTAND WHY SOPHIA STOLE THOSE IDENTITIES AND THOSE CREDIT CARDS TO FUND HER TRANSITION. AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET HER OFF. GET HER ACQUITTED.
Stephen: EITHER ONE, EITHER ONE DARLING, EITHER ONE. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
LOVELY TO MEET YOU AS WELL.
Stephen: DOUBT PREMIER THIS WEDNESDAY AT 10 P.M. ON CBS. LAVERNE COX, EVERYBODY. RICK AND MARTY LAGINA. (APPLAUSE) HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUESTS ARE THE TREASURE HUNTING STARS OF THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND, RICK AND MARTY LAGINA. WITHIN ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT?
MARTY, RICK.
YES, SIR.
SO THIS IS TUESDAY NIGHTS ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL, WE HAVE THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND. I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN A STORY OF OAK ISLAND, SINCE I WAS A KID, OKAYMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, WHAT IS OAK ISLAND AND WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING FOR.
RICK CERTAINLY SHARES THAT CHILDHOOD INTEREST.
I WILL GIVE YOU THE BRIEFING. OAK ISLAND IS SORT OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIG UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. RICK, WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT IT.
WELL, WE GREW UP, WE WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL. I LOVED TO READ. SO WE GO TO THE LIBRARY ONCE A WEEK. I FIGURED OUT THE BEST BOOK IN THE LIBRARY WAS THE READER'S DIGEST. SO IN 65, JANUARY, THERE IS AN ARTICLE ABOUT OAK ISLAND. AND I TURN THE FIRST PAGE AND I, I WAS LOST. I WANTED TO KNOW WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY AND HOW.
SO DO I. THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T HAD ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED SO FAR. WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BECAUSE YOU GOT THE DAMN TV SHOW. WHAT IS IT ABOUT OAK ISLAND THAT FASCINATES YOU. CUZ I KNOW, THE ANSWER ALREADY. I'M ASKING YOU TO TELL THE AUDIENCE.
LOOK, IT'S THE WORLD'S LONGEST RUNNING TREASURE HUNT.
Stephen: OKAY.
Stephen: WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THERE'S TREASURE ON OAK ISLAND.
HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE.
Stephen: ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
FIVE MINUTES, GO, RICK.
I MEAN, IT A SICK LAR DEPRESSION WAS FOUND UNDERNEATH A GIANT OAK STREET IN 1759.
Stephen: A CIRCULAR DEPRESSION FOUND UNDER AN OAKTREE.
BUT THAT HAS TO BE CONTEXTED WITH THE FACT THAT IN NOVA SCOTIA, THE MAR I TIME HISTORY, CON QUISA DOR, PIRATES, PRIVATEERS, CAPTAIN KID THERE IS THIS BELIEF THAT TREASURE WAS DEPOSITED THERE.
WHEN THESE BOYS STARTED DIGGING IN 1795, IT SAY REALLY LONG STORY, REALLY SHORT.
Stephen: SO IN 1795 THEY STARTED UNDER THE OAKTREE, BOYS FOUND IT AND STARTED DIGGING.
THEY GET DOWN TEN FEET AND HIT A LAYER OF OAK LOGS.
Stephen: NEXT TOON OAKTREE, WHAT ARE THE ODDS, GO AHEAD.
BUT THERE IS A LAYER, NOT AN ORDINARY, NOT AN ORDINARY THING. SO THEY TAKE IT. THEY ARE BOYS, THEY HIT ANOTHER LAYER OF OAK LOGS AND THEY GIVE UP, TEMPORARILY. THEY COME BACK AS ADULTS BECAUSE THEY ARE CAUGHT. THEY ARE THE FIRST ONES TO BECOME OBSESSED. WE ARE THE LATEST ONE.
Stephen: HAS ANYONE EVER FOUND ANY TREASURE THERE?
DEPENS HOW YOU DESIGN-- DEFINE TREASURE.
Stephen: GOLD AND BUBLOONS AND DIAMONDS AS BIG AS A BABY HEAD, SPANISH GALLION.
YOU ARE DEFINING IT BIG. WE FOUND SOME VERY INTERESTING.
Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND. HAVE I STUFF BACK HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. EXPLAIN WHAT THIS IS?
THIS IS-- THIS IS NOT VERY DRAMATIC LOOKING, IS IT, DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A DIAMOND.
Stephen: SHOW THE CAMERA.
THIS IS-- YOU SEE THAT? THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.
Stephen: I KNOW. WHAT IS THAT, IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE.
THAT IS ACTUALLY-- THAT IS ACTUALLY COCONUT FIBER.
Stephen: WHAT DOES COCONUT FIBER IS DOING IN NOVEMBER SCOSHA.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: BIG BINGO, THAT'S THE TRSHURE. I'M HOOKED. THIS IS WHY I'M HOOKED. TOTALLY HOOKED, OKAY. IT CAN'T-- IT HAD TO BE-- WHY ARE THERE COCONUTS, THEY PACKED THE GOLD INSIDE THE COCONUTS.
NO, NO, NO. THEY USED COCONUT FIBER TO KEEP THE STUFF FROM SHIFTING AROUND IN SHIPS, THAT IS HISTORICAL.
Stephen: OKAY. SO WHAT ARE THESE.
THESE ARE THE FAMOUS SPANISH SCISSORS.
Stephen: WHAT MAKES THEM FAMOUS?
THEY ARE FAMOUS TO US.
Stephen: OKAY.
THEY FROM-- FOUND ON OAK ISLAND IN SMITH'S COVE BURIED UNDERNEATH THIS LAYER OF HE CAN COFIBER.
Stephen: COCONUT FIBER AND SCISSORS UNDERNEATH.
RIGHT. CLEARLY TREASURE.
Stephen: THEY ARE PROTECTING THE SCISSORS.
THE COCONUT FIBER, THE OAK ISLAND THING IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT HAS EVERYTHING. IT HAS A CURSE T HAS-- .
Stephen: WHAT IS THE CURSE.
RICK, TELL THEM WHAT THE CURSE IS.
THE CURSE IS THAT-- .
Stephen: YOU ARE PLAY BY PLAY, HE'S COLOR COMMENTARY.
THE CURSE SAYS THAT THE ORIGINAL OAK, THE UMBRELLA OAKS THESE LARGE CAN OPIES OAKED ALL OF THEM PERISHED, DIE ON THE ISLAND AND THAT SEVEN PEOPLE MUST DIE AND THEN THE TREASURE WILL BE REVEALED. ALL OF THE OAKS CURRENTLY ARE DEAD AND SIX PEOPLE HAVE TRAGICALLY PERISHED IN PURSUIT OF THE TREASURE.
Stephen: LIKE THEY'RE DOWN IN THE MONEY PIT.
ONE MAY BE. ONE MAY BE. THE FIRST DEATH WAS A FELLA FELL INTO THE EXCAVATED MONEY PIT WHICH WAS THEN 90 FEET DEEP.
Stephen: WHY IS IT CALLED THE MONEY PIT IF YOU NEVER FOUND ANY MONEY?
BECAUSE THE MONEY FIGURATIVELY HAS BEEN GOING IN TO THE MONEY.
Stephen: OH, I UNDERSTAND.
I ALSO HEARD STORIES LIKE THERE WERE TUNNELS THAT FLOOD.
THAT'S WHERE THIS ALL TIES TOGETHER.
Stephen: HOW DOES.
THE COCONUT FIBER WAS FOUND IN A HUGE LAYER OUT 500 FEET FROM THE MONEY PIT AND THE EARLY EXPLORERS FOUND THAT THE REASON IT FLOODED WHEN THEY TRIED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A FLOOD TUNNEL. AND THE COCONUT FIBER WAS TO KEEP IT FROM SITTING UP.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: I HOPE.
YOU SAID ARE YOU SELF ARE YOU CAPTIVATED.
Stephen: I AM BUT YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF MY HAND.
Stephen: THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND AIRS TUESDAY NIGHTS ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL, RICK AND MARTY LAGINA, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
