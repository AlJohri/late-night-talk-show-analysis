RECENTLY, "THE WASHINGTON POST" REVEALED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP BRAGGED TO THE RUSSIANS ABOUT HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INTELE. HERE ARE SOME OTHER CLASSIFIED SECRETS THAT TRUMP BRAGGED ABOUT.
SERGEY, IF WE BOMB OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO PRESS 9 FIRST, SERIOUSLY. OH, OH, THERE'S A SECRET 3% MILK. MUM'S THE WORD. HEY, LISTEN, OUR SPY SATELLITES CAN STEAL HBO FROM OTHER NATIONS. OH, THIS WILL REALLY SHOCK YOU. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES GINA RODRIGUEZ. BEN FALCONE. BRAD PITT. AND MUSICAL GUEST THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN. PLUS SPECIAL GUEST BRAD PITT. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. TOO NICE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU BE THE OLD SAYING, "ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES?" RIGHT NOW, WE ARE KNEE DEEP IN A STEAMING PILE OF CONSEQUENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THINGS THAT ARE SELF-EVIDENTLY BAD ARE BEING SOLD TO US BY PEOPLE WHO KNOW BETTER AS PERFECTLY OKAY. THE LATEST IS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IN THE OVAL OFFICE REVEALED HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND AMBASSADOR. IT IS THE WORST PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY BREACH SINCE REAGAN SAID THIS:
MR. GORBACHEV, OUR NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES ARE 17, 26, 5 WITH A POWERBALL OF 37. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE MISS YOU, RONNIE! WE MISS YOU, RONNIE! APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY-- AND THIS IS BEING REPORTED IN THE "WASHINGTON POST--" TRUMP WAS SHOWING OFF FOR HIS GUESTS TELLING THE RUSSIANS: "I GET GREAT INTEL. I HAVE PEOPLE BRIEF ME ON GREAT INTEL EVERY DAY." WELL, YEAH. YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT. IT'S THE JOB. IT'S LIKE THE GUY WORKING THE FRY STATION SAYING, "YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE TATER TOTS I HAVE ACCESS TO, IF IN THIS METAPHOR TATER TOTS WERE A TOP-SECRET SNACK PROVIDED BY OUR ALLIES. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST WHO TRUMP LEAKED THE INFORMATION TO. IT'S WHO WE GOT IT FROM. ISRAEL WAS THE SOURCE OF THE INTELLIGENCE TRUMP GAVE TO THE RUSSIANS. AND OOPSA SHALOM. TRUMP IS SCHEDULED TO VISIT ISRAEL NEXT WEEK. THAT-- THAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE ONE AWKWARD STATE DINNER. "MR. PRESIDENT, CAN YOU PLEASE PASS THE HUMMUS? OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO PASS IT DIRECTLY TO RUSSIA?" ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS MIGHT NOT BE A SURPRISE TO THE ISRAELIS, BECAUSE BEFORE DONALD TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED, AMERICAN OFFICIALS WARNED THEIR ISRAELI COUNTERPARTS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY TOLD THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, BECAUSE IT COULD BE LEAKED TO THE RUSSIANS. AND JUST TO BE SAFE, WHILE HE'S THERE, DON'T LET HIM SEE ANY OF THOSE NOTES TUCKED INTO THE WESTERN WALL. "OOH, SARAH IS ASKING GOD FOR STRENGTH THROUGH HER DIVORCE. VLAD'S GONNA LOVE THAT ONE." NOW, WHEN THE NEWS BROKE, THE WHITE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY DEPLOYED NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND MR. CLEAN'S DISAPPOINTED DAD, H.R. McMASTER.
THE STORY THAT CAME OUT TONIGHT AS REPORTED IS FALSE. AT NO TIME, WERE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES OR METHODS DISCUSSED. I WAS IN THE ROOM. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
Stephen: OKAY, SO A COMPLETE DENIAL BY THE MOST RESPECTED MEMBER OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. SMART STRATEGY. AND FOLLOWING THAT, DONALD TRUMP DID THE RIGHT THING BY GIVING SOMEONE ELSE THE FINAL WORD AND NOT CONTRADICTING IT ON TWITTER. I'M JUST KIDDING. HE SAID: "AS PRESIDENT, I WANTED TO SHARE WITH RUSSIA-- AT AN OPENLY SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE MEETING-- WHICH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DO, FACTS PERTAINING"-- DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT. BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT HE SAID FROM THERE. BECAUSE HE JUST CONFESSED. AUTOMATIC. THIS EXPLAINS WHY HE DOESN'T WRITE MURDER MYSTERIES. CHAPTER ONE, "I DID IT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HE DID IT.
Stephen: AND THE TIMING, THE TIMING OF THIS COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE WORSE. TRUMP MET WITH THESE RUSSIANS IN THE OVAL OFFICE ONE DAY AFTER HE FIRED F.B.I., HEAD JIM COMEY. THAT'S LIKE STARTING A TINDER ACCOUNT ON THE WAY HOME FROM YOUR SPOUSE'S FUNERAL. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SAYING IT'S A BAD THING. YOU UNDERSTAND. I'M SAYING THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING TO DO! I WOULD SAY THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NO SHAME, BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BECAUSE THE ONE PERSON AT THE MEETING THEY DIDN'T ORIGINALLY ADVERTISE WAS THERE WAS RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEY KISLYAK, CONSIDERED BY OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AS A TOP RUSSIAN SPY. WE KNOW HE WAS THERE BECAUSE SO WERE RUSSIAN CAMERAMEN. LOOK AT HOW MUCH FUN THEY'RE HAVING. THE MEETING WAS SET UP BY TRUMP AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO VLADIMIR PUTIN.
WHEN I SPOKE WITH PUTIN HE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD SEE LAVROV. WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO SEE HIM?
Stephen: YES! YOU SHOULD SAY NO! SAY NO FOR ONCE TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. SHOULD I SAY NO TO VLADIMIR DISM OR SAY NYET IF YOU WANT TO BE POLITE. TO RECAP:  DONALD TRUMP ADMITTED TO FIRING THE MAN IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING HIS RUSSIA TIES. THEN HE MET WITH TWO RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS, A MEETING THAT WAS ARRANGED BY VLADIMIR PUTIN AND WHICH WE ONLY SAW BECAUSE RUSSIAN PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE THERE TO TAKE PHOTOS. AND AT THAT MEETING HE ADMITS HE GAVE RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. FOR PERSPECTIVE, LET'S GO LIVE TO PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. DORIS, YOUR REACTION?
WHAT'S HAPPENING!
Stephen: THANK YOU, DORIS. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE'S SO SAGE. SHE ALWAYS-- SHE ALWAYS PUTS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US. SO FAR, CONGRESS' REACTION HAS BEEN SIMILAR TO DORIS'. ONE OF THE STRONGEST CRITICISMS OF TRUMP'S ACTIONS CAME FROM REPUBLICAN SENATOR BOB CORKER, WHO SAID THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS "IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL RIGHT NOW." YEAH, IT'S A SLOW DESCENT INTO CHAOS. JIM, DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF METAPHORICAL FORESHADOWING OF THAT? OKAY, YEAH, THERE IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU HAVE IT. SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING. HE TRIED TO TELL US. HE TRIED TO TELL US. I APOLOGIZE, SIR. YOU WARNED US. ♪ I'M GOING DOWN ♪ I'M GOING DOWN ♪
Stephen: WORKER WASN'T THE ONLY ONE ANGRY ABOUT MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED INFO. ANOTHER TOP REPUBLICAN WEIGHED IN, AND HE DIDN'T MINCE WORDS.
WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORD "CONFIDENTIAL" OR "CLASSIFIED." ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I GOTTA SAY-- AND I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT-- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH DONALD TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, I DO NOT-- I DO NOT ENVY THOSE PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE WORKING THERE RIGHT NOW. AND, APPARENTLY, NEITHER WOULD THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS MORNING, IT CAME OUT THAT AFTER THE NEWS BROKE OF TRUMP TELLING ALL THIS STUFF TO THE RUSSIANS, REPORTERS HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS, BUT WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS WERE, LITERALLY, "HIDING IN THEIR OFFICES." AND THEN TRUMP TOLD THE RUSSIANS WHERE THEY WERE HIDING. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE WHITE HOUSE STAFFER TOLD REPORTERS, "DO NOT ASK ME ABOUT HOW THIS LOOKS. WE ALL KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS." ( LAUGHTER ) FINE, FINE, FORGET HOW IT LOOKS. DO YOU KNOW HOW IT ENDS? BECAUSE THE TENSION IS KILLING ME. WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE IS IN SUCH CHAOS, I WANTED AN INSIDER'S PERSPECTIVE, SO PLEASE WELCOME LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICES, TRUMP STAFFER LIZ WALLACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: EXCUSE ME. MISS WALLACE? ARE YOU THERE?
NOPE! NOBODY'S HERE!
Stephen: I CAN HEAR YOU.
NO, YOU CAN'T!
Stephen: LIZ, WILL YOU PLEASE COME OUT? WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.
AHN-AH.
Stephen: JUST TELL US WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THERE.
DO NOT ASK ME WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE! WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE!
Stephen: YOU'RE REALLY TAKING THIS HARD.
THIS IS NOTHING. SEAN SPICER'S ASSISTANT JUST KEEPS STAPLING HER HAND. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT EVENTUALLY.
NO! I'VE GOT A DRAWER FULL OF GRANOLA BARS AND AN EMPTY GATORADE BOTTLE. I'M GOOD FOR DAYS. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ OF THE MESS YOU LEFT WHEN WENT AWAY ♪
Stephen: LIZ? ARE YOU BLASTING MUSIC? LIZ!
WHAT?
Stephen: SEAN SPICER DIDN'T EVEN DO THE PRESS BRIEFING TODAY. IS HE HIDING, TOO?
LET ME GO ASK HIM. I'M NOT HERE!
Stephen: WHITE HOUSE STAFFER, LIZ WALLACE, EVERYBODY! WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! GINA RODRIGUEZ IS HERE. BUT UP NEXT, MR. BRAD PITT! STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. JON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS. YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: YOU ALL MAY NOT KNOW OUT THERE THAT JON AND I HAVE DEEP CONVERSATIONS SOMETIMES.
Jon: OH, YEAH, WE GET DEEP, WE GET DEEP.
Stephen: WE DO. I'LL SIT ON THE STEPS. I'LL HAVE A COCKTAIL. YOU'LL HAVE THE PIANO. AND WE TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THE UNIVERSE SOMETIMES. WE CHEW THE FAT.
Jon: YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET ANSWERS BUT YOU GET INTERESTING THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AND LIVE YOUR LIFE AND KEEPING ABOUT ON THAT.
Stephen: I FIND THE QUESTIONS SOMETIMES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ANSWERS, UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO THE DOCTOR.
Jon: THEN YOU WANT THE ANSWERS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT WE TALK DEEP, BECAUSE I'M A DEEP GUY. WHICH IS WHY SOMETIMES I'LL PONDER LIFE'S BIG QUESTION LIKE "WHAT IS THE TRUE DEFINITION OF HAPPINESS?" AND "WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LOVE?" AND "WHO STOLE MY DICTIONARY?" ( LAUGHTER ) AND SOMETIMES I NEED TO EXPRESS THESE THOUGHTS, PREFERABLY WITH ANOTHER A-LIST CELEBRITY, IN A SEGMENT I CALL: "BIG QUESTIONS WITH EVEN BIGGER STARS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW. LOOK AT THAT NIGHT SKY. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
IT SURE IS. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH! OH, HEY, BRAD PITT! I NEVER SEE YOU UP HERE.
YEAH, I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN A WHILE. FEELS GOOD. FEELS GOOD. HEY, STEPHEN?
Stephen: YEAH, BRAD?
IF THE UNIVERSE INCLUDES ALL OF EXISTENCE, WHAT EXISTED BEFORE THE UNIVERSE?
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. PROBABLY JUST A TEASER TRAILER FOR THE UNIVERSE WITH, LIKE, ONE REALLY GOOD SCENE THAT ISN'T EVEN IN THE UNIVERSE ONCE IT'S RELEASED. HEY, BRAD, DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER DEATH?
I'M NOT SURE. I DEFINITELY BELIEVE IN DEATH AFTER LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: GOTTA SAY THAT'S-- THAT'S DEEP.
YES, I AM. AREN'T I?
Stephen: YEAH.
HEY, STEVIE?
Stephen: YEAH, BRADLEY?
WHY DO WE ONLY REMEMBER SOME OF OUR DREAMS?
Stephen: BECAUSE NOT ALL OF OUR DREAMS ARE ABOUT HAVING SEX IN A HELICOPTER. ( LAUGHTER )
SAD, BUT TRUE. SO TRUE.
Stephen: HEY, BRADFORD?
YES, STEVE-ARINO? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO YOU THINK BEAUTY IS REALLY ONLY SKIN DEEP?
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER TAKEN MY SKIN OFF. HEY, STEVE-AMIGO?

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN?
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT MY TAILOR SWEARS IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND. ( LAUGHTER )
HEY, COLBY CHEESE, DO YOU THINK HUMANS ARE BASICALLY GOOD OR EVIL?
HMMM... BASICALLY GOOD. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YEAH, YEAH, BASICALLY GOOD. BUT ALSO KIND OF CHEWY. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU LOOK UP THERE?
Stephen: OH, I SEE AN ENDLESS VOID-- NO ANSWERS, NO MEANING, NO WAY TO CONSTRUCT COHERENCE FROM THE SWIRLING CHAOS.
YOU SEE ALL THAT WHEN YOU LOOK INTO SPACE?
Stephen: OH, NO. JUST THAT CLOUD LOOKS LIKE SEAN SPICER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, YEAH, WEIRD. HEY, STEVIE-C. DO YOU THINK MATHEMATICS ARE THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE, OR DID WE JUST INVENT IT?
Stephen: WHOA. BLEW MY MIND, BRAD. I'M NOT SURE IF NUMBERS ARE THE UNDERLYING REALITY. BUT ONE THING IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE: YOU'RE A SOLID EIGHT.
REALLY? ( LAUGHTER ) AN EIGHT?
Stephen: I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM DESPERATE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHOOTING STAR! SHOOTING STAR!
YOU'RE SWEET. THANKS, THANKS. THANKS. HEY, PITTY-PATT ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU THINK ANYONE CAN EVER TRULY KNOW THEMSELVES?
DOESN'T MATTER. NO, IN THE END, IT TURNS OUT WE WERE ALL EDWARD NORTON THE WHOLE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW. WOW. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.
REALLY? THERE WERE, LIKE, A TON OF CLUES EVERYWHERE.
Stephen: THE SECOND TIME YOU WATCH IT, OBVIOUSLY, THE SECOND TIME YOU WATCH IT. HEY, "BRAD TO THE BONE"?
YEAH, "WE AIN'T LEAVIN' 'TIL WE'RE STEPHEN"?
Stephen: IS IT POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE INFINITY?
YES. YES, IT IS. IT'S ONE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF "OCEAN'S" SEQUELS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE. HEY, STEVIE-COLBEAZY?

Stephen: NO, I JUST WANT TO GO TO NEXT FRIDAY SO I CAN WATCH YOUR NEW MOVIE "WAR MACHINE" ON NETFLIX.
OH! THAT'S SO NICE. THAT'S SO NICE. I'D DEFINITELY WANT TO GO THE PAST.
Stephen: OH, RIGHT, SO YOU COULD KILL HITLER?
NO, I ALREADY DID THAT IN A MOVIE. I'D JUST GO BACK ABOUT FIVE MINUTES GO, SO I CAN CHANGE THIS SCENE TO INCLUDE ANOTHER PLUG FOR MY MOVIE "WAR MACHINE" APPEARING ON NETFLIX.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, YOU DID IT.

Stephen: BECAUSE YOU HAD FUN WITH THE PRESIDENT?
BECAUSE I HAD FUN WITH THE PRESIDENT. AND THEN THEY JUST, ALL CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND STUFF. AND I'M LIKE ME! I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

WELL, PRETTY MUCH EVERY SINGLE WAY IT COULD BE. I MEAN, IT'S THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO. IT'S ITS MOST WONDERFUL THING I'VE EVER DONE. BUT YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A ROLE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN BEFORE, AND YOU FIEND YOURSELF DOING THINGS YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. I DO KNOW THAT RECENTLY I THOUGHT I'D MISSED IT. I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER DO IT, AND SUDDENLY, BAY YEAR AGO, I STARTED TELLING DAD JOKES. ( LAUGHTER ) FULL-ON DAD JOKES.
Stephen: IT JUST COMES UP ON THE OF YOU.
IT JUST COMES OUT, AND A PUN OR SOMETHING, JUST THE WORST, CRUMMY PUN. LIKE IT'S WARM IN THE ROOM AND MY KID IS EATING TOAST, AND I'M LIKE, "KIND OF TOASTY IN HERE, HUH?" AND THEY'RE LIKE, "DAD, THAT'S AWFUL." AND I'M LIKE, "I'M SO SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED."
Stephen: BEING A DAD IS WEIRD BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF-- YOU'RE AN AUTHORITY FIGURE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW. IF MY KIDS ARE WATCHING THIS, I KNOW A LOT.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY COME TO YOU WITH SCWEZ QEZ? WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.
I DEFLECT "MOMMY IS RIGHT OVER THERE." NO I JUST DO MY BEST LIKE ANYBODY WOULD.
Stephen: LIE. THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY DON'T KNOW AT ALL.
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW WON'T HURT THEM?
