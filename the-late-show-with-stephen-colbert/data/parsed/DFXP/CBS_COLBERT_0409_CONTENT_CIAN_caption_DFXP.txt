REPUBLICAN ?RAERTZ PUSHING FOR A NEW HEALTH CARE BILL TO BE PASSED BY NEXT WEEK. LAST SPRING, REPUBLICANS BROUGHT YOU "NIGHT OF THE LIVING BILL." NOW GET READY FOR THE HORRIFYING, TERRIFYING SEQUEL:  "DAWN OF THE BILL." WE THOUGHT OUR HEALTH CARE NIGHTMARE WAS OVER WITH THE DEATH OF THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT. BUT THE DEAD HAVE RETURNED.
IT GETS UP AND KILLS.
"DAWN OF THE BILL." STARRING LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH SKARALOINA, AND MITCH McCONNELL OF KILL-TUCKEY. "DAWN OF THE BILL." IT JUST WON'T DIE. BUT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL. "DAWN OF THE BILL," RATED "R" FOR "REALLY, THIS THING AGAIN?"
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JEFF BRIDGES. SENATOR JEFF FLAKE. AND MUSICAL GUEST MIGUEL. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON. HEY, EVERYBODY. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME. WELCOME, ONE AND ALL, TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, THIS WEEK-- THIS WEEK, THOSE OF YOU WHO WATCH THE NEWS, THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON, D.C., THE THINKABLE HAPPENED. REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, AGAIN. THIS IS BEYOND BEATING A DEAD HORSE. THIS IS GETTING DAMN CLOSE TO BEASTALITY, OKAY. I HOPE THAT HORSE HAS A SAFE WORD. PUMPKIN PATCH IS WHAT I RECOMMEND. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, BACK IN JULY, REPUBLICANS TRIED A PLAN CALLED THE "BETTER CARE RECONCILIATION ACT." IT WOULD HAVE CUT MEDICAID, INCREASED PREMIUMS, AND LEFT MILLIONS UNINSURED. WHEREAS, THIS NEW BILL HAS A DIFFERENT NAME. THIS ONE'S CALLED THE "GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL." AND SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR JOHN THUNE PAID ONE OF ITS AUTHORS THE ULTIMATE COMPLIMENT, SAYING, "I JUST TOLD BILL CASSIDY HE'S KIND OF THE GRAVE ROBBER. THIS THING WAS SIX FEET UNDER, AND I THINK HE'S REVIVED IT." ACTUALLY-- THIS IS INTERESTING-- GRAVE ROBBING IS A BIG PART OF THE NEW PLAN. YOU KNOW, GET YOURSELF A NEW HIP OR DENTURES, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT OFFERS COMPLETE SHOVEL COVERAGE. BUT THE G.O.P. NEEDS TO MOVE FAST BECAUSE, DUE TO SENATE RULES THAT I REFUSE TO LEARN ABOUT, THEY'RE FACING A SEPTEMBER 30 DEADLINE. IT'S A RACE AGAINST THE CLOCK. THEY'VE GOT TEN DAYS TO OVERHAUL THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, OR EVERYBODY LIVES. ( LAUGHTER ) IN FACT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: THEY ALL LIVED. I'M READY TO LIVE. I'M READY.
Stephen: SO, THANK YOU. WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! IN FACT, THIS IS BEING DONE IN SUCH A RUSH THAT "THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE WON'T ESTIMATE THE FULL EFFECTS OF OBAMACARE REPEAL UNTIL AFTER THE VOTE DEADLINE." WELL, THAT THERE IS JUST GOOD HEALTH CARE. LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND HE SAYS, MR. SMITH, WE WON'T HAVE YOUR TEST RESULTS FOR A WEEK, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, JUST START MUNCHING ON THAT BOWL OF PILLS OVER THERE." NOW IT'S A COMPLEX BILL THAT REWORKS, I THINK IT IS, ONE-SIXTH, ONE-SIXTH OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY. SO BEFORE THE VOTE, REPUBLICANS HAVE SET ASIDE 90 SECONDS OF DEBATE. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE GOING TO KILL OBAMACARE IN ROUGHLY THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO MICROWAVE A FROZEN BURRITO. BOTH WILL KILL YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THERE'S A LITTLE WRINKLE GETTING THIS DONE, INCLUDING THE 10 DAYS THAT ARE LEFT TO VOTE ARE, THREE JEWISH HOLY DAYS, WHICH THE SENATE HAS OFF. BUT THAT DOESN'T BOTHER SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, WHO SAID, "I WANT TO HONOR EVERY RELIGION'S HOLIDAY." BUT THEN ADDED, "HARRY REID HAD A VOTE ON OBAMACARE ON CHRISTMAS EVE." THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE, BECAUSE CHRISTMAS IS THE SACRED STORY OF HOW A WOMAN GAVE BIRTH IN A BARN WITH NO HEALTHCARE, AND IT WAS FINE. WORKED OUT GREAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PERFECT! PERFECT! NOW, HERE'S HOW THE PLAN WORKS. THE PLAN TAKES THE MONEY FROM OBAMACARE'S MEDICAID EXPANSION THAT 31 STATES OPTED IN TO FIVE YEARS AGO, OR SOMETHING. AND TURNS THAT INTO A POOL THAT GETS REDIVIDED INTO BLOCK GRANTS TO ALL THE STATES WHETHER THEY OPTED IN FIVE YEARS AGO OR NOT. SO THAT MEANS STATES LIKE MY HOME STATE OF NEW YORK LOSES A LOT OF MONEY, WHILE MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA WOULD GET A LOT OF MONEY. SO HALF OF ME IS TOTALLY ON BOARD WITH THIS. THE BILL'S SPONSOR, LINDSAY GRAHAM, EXPLAINS IT THIS WAY:
I LIKE MASSACHUSETTS. I LIKE MARYLAND. I LIKE NEW YORK. I LIKE CALIFORNIA. BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM THAT MUCH TO GIVE THEM A BUNCH OF MONEY THAT THE REST OF US WON'T GET.
Stephen: "PLUS, YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST GOING TO SPEND IT ON LATTES AND NPR AND GAY CAKES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE CAKE IS GAY, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: FOR A GAY WEDDING, THE CAKE ITSELF HAS TO BE GAY. THAT'S THE COMPLAINT, ISN'T IT? ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT. HERE'S WILL DEAL, YOU KNOW WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT OBAMACARE? OBAMA. REMEMBER THAT GUY? REMEMBER OBAMA? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: GREAT GUY. REALLY TALL.
Stephen: WHAT?
Jon: REALLY TALL.
Stephen: VERY TALL, VERY TALL THAT'S WHAT HE'S KNOWN FOR. HERE'S WHAT OBAMA SAID TODAY:
THIS IS SOMETHING I ALWAYS HAD TO EMPHASIZE TO MY STAFF WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT: BETTER IS GOOD. (LAUGHTER) YOU LAUGH, BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE FORGET THAT. I WILL TAKE BETTER EVERY TIME. SO THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED TODAY.
Stephen: I MISS YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) BUT JUST FOR MY OWN SELF HERE, JIMMY, CAN WE PUT THAT PICTURE OF HIM BACK UP? LOOK HOW GRAY HE'S GOTTEN. THAT'S HOW BAD DONALD TRUMP IS: OBAMA'S AGING FASTER WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE BE PRESIDENT. OBAMA KNOWS HIM-CARE ISN'T AND BHAU OBAMA IS SOMEWHAT PASSI ABOUT THIS.
WHEN I SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO UNDO THAT HARD-WON PROGRESS FOR THE 50th OR 60th TIME WITH BILLS THAT WOULD RAISE COSTS OR REDUCE COVERAGE OR ROLL BACK PROTECTIONS FOR OLDER AMERICANS OR PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, IT IS AGGRAVATING.
Stephen: SIR, I KNOW YOU'RE FAMOUSLY EVEN-KEELED, BUT AMERICANS ARE MORE THAN AGGRAVATED. I'M POURING BOURBON ON MY BREAKFAST, AND MY BREAKFAST IS SCOTCH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER STEPHEN MOORE EXPLAINED WHAT'S DRIVING THE LATEST REPUBLICAN PUSH TO REPEAL OBAMACARE: "PEOPLE WANT INSURANCE FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES, NOT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S FAMILIES." WHAT A COMPASSIONATE MAN. IT'S ALL SUMMED UP IN HIS NEW LINE OF GREETING CARDS: "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GRANDMA. "IF WE WEREN'T RELATED, I'D LEAVE YOU TO DIE." BASED ON A TRUE STORY. FUNNY, BECAUSE IT'S TRUE. BUT IF YOU ALSO WANT INSURANCE THAT COVERS ONLY YOUR FAMILY, WELL, FOLKS, THERE'S A COMPANY READY TO HELP.
IT WAS HARD FINDING INSURANCE THAT COVERED ONLY MY FAMILY. LUCKILY, WINICURE INSURANCE DOES JUST THAT.
WINNACKER INSURANCE, INSURANCE FOR JUST THE WINNICKER FAMILY OF OHIO AND NO ONE ELSE.
IT'S BUILT ON THE IDEA THAT I'M A WINNACKER, AND WE DESERVE HEALTH CARE. OTHERS MIGHT TOO, BUT I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
AND WINNICKER IS ONLY $20 A MONTH. UNLESS YOU'RE SICK, THEN IT COULD BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
WITH A RIESK POOL OF ONLY THREE PEOPLE, AND OUR DOG, CHAMPERS, PRICES CAN GET VOLATILE.
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING SICK BECAUSE I'M HEALTH YOU NOW. AND NOW ISN'T THE FUTURE. IT'S NOW.
I LOVE NOW.
WINNACKER INSURANCE, BECAUSE ONLY YOU MATTER. EVERYONE ELSE IS PROBABLY JUST A HOLOGRAM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: RIGHT IN THE HEART. RIGHT IN HEART.
Stephen: RIGHT SOMEWHERE, SOMEWHERE-- GETS ME SOMEWHERE. THE U.N. IS IN TOWN THIS WEEK. YOU CAN TELL ABUSE THE ELMOS ARE HARASSING PEOPLE IN OTHER LANGUAGE. DONALD TRUMP HOSTED A LUNCH FOR AFRICAN LEADERS.
I'M GREATLY HONORED TO HOST THIS LUNCH, TO BE JOINED BY THE LEADERS OF COÔTE D'IVOIRE, ETHIOPIA, GHANA, GUINEA, NAMBIA. NAMBIA'S HEALTH SYSTEM IS INCREASINGLY SELF-SUFFICIENT.
Stephen: NOW, THERE IS NO SUCH COUNTRY AS "NAMBIA." DESPITE THAT, THEY WILL SOON HAVE A BETTER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAN WE DO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I MIGHT MOVE TO NAMBIA. I HEAR VERY GOOD THINGS.
Jon: I NEVER HEARD OF THAT I.
Stephen: I MIGHT GO GO OF TO NAMBIA. HE WENT ON TO PRAISE THE AFRICAN REPUBLICANS OF NAMBLA, WANGO-TANGO, AND WAKANDA. "WE MUST SECURE OUR SUPPLIES OF VIBRANIUM." "I WANT TO THANK PRIME MINISTER CHAKA KHAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SO WONDERFUL." OF COURSE, EVERYONE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT HIS BIG SPEECH TO THE U.N. YESTERDAY. AND REPUBLICANS LOVED IT. LET'S SEE HOW CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY FELT. HERE HE IS LISTENING TO TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS THE HAPPIEST HE HAS LOOKED SINCE HE TOOK THE JOB. I'M SORRY, GENERAL, BUT WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES, HE'S STILL GOING TO BE THERE. OF COURSE, THE MAIN FOCUS OF TRUMP'S SPEECH WAS NORTH KOREA-- WHICH WAS ALSO THE FOCUS OF HIS TRADITIONAL POST-SPEECH TWITTER RANT. "THE AMERICAN FLAG EMOJI HAS GREAT STRENGTH AND PATIENCE, BUT IF IT IS FORCED TO DEFEND ITSELF OR ITS ALLIES, WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY DESTROY #NOKO." #NOKO?
Jon: NOKO.
Stephen: NOKO. THAT REALLY MAKES NORTH KOREA SOUND LEAK A GENT RIIFIED NEIGHBORHOOD. "HAVE YOU BEEN TO NOKO? THEY'VE GOT WHOLE FOODS NOW, IN THAT THEY HAVE ONE WHOLE FOOD. I THINK IT'S A BELL PEPPER." AND TODAY-- THAT'S A BIG PEPPER.
Jon: THAT'S A BIG OLD PEPPER.
Stephen: AND TODAY, THE U.N. GOT A VISIT FROM FIRST LADY, MELANIA TRUMP, WHO SPOKE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE DANGERS OF BULLYING.
WE MUST TEACH EACH CHILD THE VALUES OF EMPATHY AND COMMUNICATION THAT ARE AT THE CORE OF THE KINDNESS, MINDFULNESS, INTEGRITY, AND LEADERSHIP, WHICH CAN ONLY BE TAUGHT BY EXAMPLE.
Stephen: YES, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE-- KINDNESS, INTEGRITY, TEACHING BY EXAMPLE. QUICK QUESTION: HAVE YOU MET YOUR HUSBAND? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JEFF BRIDGES IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, POSSIBLY THE WORST CAMPAIGN AD EVER, AND THE PRESIDENT WEIGHS IN ON THE EMMYS. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT OVER THERE. RIGHT THERE. ISN'T THIS A LOVELY CROWD?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: ISN'T THIS JUST AN AMAZING CROWD? YOU PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE ENERGY IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT. AND YOU KNOW-- PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. AND IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH FRIEND LIKE THESE RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THESE ARE DARK TIMES. THESE ARE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO, WHO TOOK A DIRECT HILT FROM HURRICANE MARIA OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS. THAT ENTIRE ISLAND IS WITHOUT POWER. SO I HOPE EVERYONE DOWN THERE, ALL THOSE AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE SAFE. BUT I KNOW THAT CAN'T BE THE CASE. SAME GOES FOR THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO CITY, WHO SUFFERED A 7.1- MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE YESTERDAY. SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO HELP, GO TO colbertlateshow.com. WE'VE GOT SOME SUGGESTIONS OF WHERE YOU CAN DONATE. NOW, DONALD TRUMP I HAVE TO SAY HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD ABOUT RESPONDING DURING THESE DISASTERS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS. LAST NIGHT HE TWEETED: "GOD BLESS THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO CITY. WE ARE WITH YOU AND WILL BE THERE FOR YOU. PUERTO RICO BEING HIT HARD BY NEW MONSTER HURRICANE. BE CAREFUL, OUR HEARTS ARE WITH YOU-- WILL BE THERE TO HELP!" THAT IS A STRONG AND PRESIDENTIAL RESPONSE THAT LASTED FOR ABOUT 18 MINUTES, BECAUSE THEN HE TWEETED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT TRULY SEEMED TO UPSET HIM: "I WAS SADDENED TO SEE HOW BAD THE RATINGS WERE ON THE EMMYS LAST NIGHT-- THE WORST EVER. SMARTEST PEOPLE OF THEM ALL ARE THE 'DEPLORABLES.'" NOW, WAIT A SECOND. THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. WORST RATINGS OF ALL. I SWEAR I HEARD SOMEONE AT THE EMMYS SAY THEY WERE THE HIGHEST RATED EVER. I GUESS... I GUESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE!
Jon: I REMEMBER SEEING IT.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE SAD ABOUT. I'M NOT EVEN SAD ABOUT IT, AND I WAS THE HOST OF THE EMMYS. BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EVERY SINGLE PART OF THAT TWEET WAS FACTUALLY INACCURATE. THE EMMYS WEREN'T "LAST NIGHT." FROM WHEN HE TWEETED IT. THEY WERE SUNDAY NIGHT I CHECKED THE TV SCHEDULE, AND YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING "NCIS: NEW ORLEANS." "SO SAD ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN NEW ORLEANS. SO MANY NAVAL CRIMES." "STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY." AND IT WASN'T THE WORST-RATED EMMYS, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE NIELSEN RATINGS, 11.4 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED IT, SLIGHTLY MORE THAN LAST YEAR'S LOWEST-EVER AUDIENCE OF 11.3 MILLION. THAT'S RIGHT: WE HAD THE SECOND-WORST RATINGS OF ALL TIME. IN YOUR FACE! WE SUCK LESS! WE SUCK LESS! WE SUCK LESS! WE SUCK LESS! THANK YOU. I'D LIKE THAT CROCHETED ON A PILLOW, YOU THANK YOU. SPEAKING OF SUCKING, THE 2018 MIDTERMS ARE STARTING TO HEAT UP ALREADY. FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S AN EXAMPLE: VIRGINIA'S 10th IS UP FOR GRABS BETWEEN INCUMBENT REPUBLICAN LADY WHO'S SERIOUSLY GONNA LOSE IT IF YOU DON'T START USING A COASTER, BARBARA COMSTOCK; AND DEMOCRAT CHALLENGER AND MAN INTRODUCING HIS TREE TO HIS PARENTS, DAN HELMER. NOW, HELMER IS A WEST POINT GRAD, ARMY VETERAN, AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN; AND HE'S RUNNING IN A PURPLE DISTRICT, SO THIS IS A RACE HE CAN ACTUALLY WIN, UNLESS ANYONE SEES HIS NEW CAMPAIGN AD. JIM? ♪ ♪ ♪
HEY, DAN, ISN'T THAT CONGRESSWOMAN COMSTOCK BACK THERE AT THE BAR?
SURE IS.
BET YOU CAN'T GET HER TO HOLD A TOWN HALL.
TOWN HALL? I CAN DO YOU ONE BETTER THAN THAT. WE'VE LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELING.
NO, DAN. ( CLEARS THROAT ) ♪ YOU NEVER HOLD TOWN HALLS ANYMORE WITH CONSTITUENTS ♪ PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND OBAMACARE YOU VOTED AGAINST ♪ YOU'RE TRYING HARD NOT TO SHOW IT ♪ BUT BARBARA, BARBARA YOU KNOW IT ♪ YOU'VE LOST THAT CENTRIST FEELING ♪ 'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT WING APPEALING ♪ ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH! NO ONE KNOWS HOW THAT AD ENDS, BECAUSE THAT'S THE FARTHEST ANYONE HAS EVER MADE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) I ASSUME IT ENDS WITH "CONGRATULATIONS CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA COMSTOCK." BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST ME. MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE IT. CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN KELLY, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE AD? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JEFF BRIDGES. STICK AROUND ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ACADEMY AWARD- WINNING ACTOR, MUSICIAN, ARTIST, AND PHILOSOPHER WHO NOW STARS IN "KINGSMAN: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE."
AT WHAT POINT ARE YOU GOING TO START BEHAVING LIKE A STATESMAN? YOU GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING A RODEO CLOWN?
NO, SIR. I APPROXIMATION, SIR.
I'M CHAMPAGNE, BUT ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM, CALLS ME "CHAMP."
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME THE DUDE HIMSELF, JEFF BRIDGES. SIR. NICE TO MEET YOU. COME ON UP! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT IS-- IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO BE HERE WITH YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE EVER HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ON THE OLD GIG, WE TALKED BACKSTAGE AFTERWARDS, WHICH WAS A JOY FOR ME. AND I SAID I JUST GET RELAXED LOOKING AT YOU. YOU'RE A NOTORIOUSLY CHILL DUDE, IF YOU'LL PARDON THE EXPRESSION.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, YEAH.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU REMAIN CHILL IN 2017? BECAUSE THIS MIGHT BE THE LEAST-CHILL YEAR OF MY LIFETIME.
IT'S SO WEIRD, ISN'T IT MY GOD!
Stephen: EVERYBODY IS SO TENSE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST TAKING THE WEIRDNESS, AND I'M KIND OF WORKING WITH IT. YOU KNOW I'M --
Stephen: YOU'RE WORKING THE WEIRD?
I'M INSPIRED TO ENGAGE UNION YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE IMPULSE IS TO THROW UP YOUR HANDS. YOU KNOW --
Stephen: WITHDRAW.
JUST, YOU KNOW, BE CYNICAL ABOUT THE WHOLE THING! COME ON, IT'S SO DAMN --
Stephen: YOU CAN'T BE. CYNICISM TAKES YOU AWAY FROM LOVE.
THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: YEAH.
SO I TRY TO CREATE THE KIND OF WORLD THAT I WANT TO LIVE IN, I WANT MY KID TO LIVE IN. AND I, YOU KNOW, START, YOU KNOW, CALL TO ACTION KIND OF. THAT'S HOW I'M TAKING IT.
Stephen: DO YOU DO ANY EXERCISES? YOU'RE A SPIRITUAL PERSON, I THINK, A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSON.
I MEDITATE A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY SPIRITUAL EXERCISES YOU CAN SHARE?
WELL, I HEARD-- DO YOU HAVE A HUNK OF CLAY THERE? WE'RE GOING TO DO A LITTLE CERAMIC THING, MAYBE.
Stephen: WE-- WE-- WE DO HAVE A HUNK OF CLAY.  ( APPLAUSE )
WELL, WE COULD DO THAT.
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHY DON'T WE EARN IT. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MOVIE AND THIS WILL BE RIGHT HERE.
I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD SMELL, THAT CLAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SMELLS LIKE? POSSIBILITIES. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DO THAT'S NOT COOL?
WELL, YOU KNOW, MY PUBLICIST, JEAN SEAVERS, SHE DID A LITTLE OF THE PREINTERVIEW BEFORE ME. SHE WAS TRYING TO-- I'VE BEEN IN LONDON. I HAVE JET LAG. SHE SAID, "I'LL DO A LITTLE BIT FOR YOU." HE SAID, I DID A LITTLE BIT FOR YOU. I TOLD HIM YOU LIKE TO BUY GOSSIP MAGAZINES." I SAID, "JEAN, COME OYOU'RE BLOWING MY WHOLE ZEN, CHILL KIND OF THING."
Stephen: NO, BUT I HEARD THAT. I HEARD YOU LIKE TO BUY GOSSIP MAGAZINES. WAS SHE TELLING THE TRUTH?
SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.
Stephen: YOU MEAN LIKE "US WEEKLY?"
WHATEVER. IT'S SORT OF A CEREMONY WHEN I GO INTO THE AIRPORT, I GOTTA GO AND HIT THE, YOU KNOW, THE RACKS... I JUST --
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MAGAZINE.
NO, THAT'S THE WEIRD THING. I START TO-- NOW AS I GET ON IN AGE, I DON'T RECOGNIZE HARDLY ANY OF THESE GUYS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE TO KEEP UP. "INQUIRING MINDS ..."
Stephen: WOULD WANT TO KNOW. NOW YOU'RE IN SERGE KINGSMAN, I' GOING GIVING AWAY HOSPITAL HEADQUARTEHEADQUARTERS ARE BLOWN THEY COME TO THE UNITED STATES AND THERE'S AN AMERICAN VERSION OF IT. WHAT IS IT CALLED?
WE'RE THE STATESMEN. I'M THE HEAD OF THE STATESMEN. MY NAME IS CHAMPAGNE. MY CHARACTER DOESN'T LIKE TO BE REFERRED TO AS CHAMPAGNE. IT'S A LITTLE FARE, U-FRU. HE GOES FOR CHAMP.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SEXY COSTARS.
BAR.
Stephen: MOORE.
CHANNING TATUM.
Stephen: YOU EVER SEE MAGIC MIKE?
I HAD DINNER WITH HIM LAST NIGHT, AND HE TOLD ME THEY'RE DOING-- HE'S PRODUCING AND DIRECTING A LIVE VERSION OF THAT SHOW.
Stephen: A LIVE "MAGIC MIKE?" ISN'T THAT JUST CALLED A STRIP CLUB? I THINK THERE'S ONE RIGHT DOWN THE STREET HERE IN NEW YORK. A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM ARE GOING ON AT ONCE.
THIS ONE IS IN VEGAS.
Stephen: OH, SO IT'S-- SO IT'S LEGAL.
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: SO TELL THE STORY OF THE MOVIE BUT-- I DON'T KNOW. IS HE IN IT?
NO, HE DIRECTED IT, AND PRODUCED IT AND --
Stephen: I'D GO SO THAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: WOULD YOU GO SEE THAT?
HE'S TERRIFIC. HE HAS A WONDERFUL DANCE NUMBER IN "KINGSMAN" ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: SHIRTLESS?
I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY, STEPHEN. NO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: LET'S SELL SOME TICKETS, IS WHAT I'M SAYING. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, STATESMEN ARE FROM KENTUCKY.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: RIGHT? THAT'S WHERE THE HEADQUARTERS IS. THEY'RE EACH NAMED AFTER A DIFFERENT KIND OF-- BOOZE.
Stephen: OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HAVE YOU SPENT ANY TIME IN KENTUCKY? IT'S A NICE PLACE.
YEAH. ( WHISTLING ) I WAS THERE, YOU KNOW, EARLIER IN THE YEAR. I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN ON THE WINNING HORSE.
Stephen: AT THE DERBY?
KENTUCKY DERBY.
Stephen: I MISSED IT. WHO WON THIS YEAR.
ALWAYS DREAMIN.
Stephen: ALWAYS DREAMIN. THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU. THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU. WAS THIS HIGH-CLASS KENTUCKY DERBY?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: I WENT THERE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND I DID THE INFIELD, WHICH IS A SNAKE PIT.
I GOT TO SAY-- WHAT DID I SAY? I REALLY WANTED TO SAY, "AND THEY'RE OFF!" BUT I DIDN'T GET TO SAY THAT. DO THEY SAY THAT.
Stephen: "AND THEY'RE OFF! CRAP WORTHY IN THE LEAD, AND HERE-- DOWN THE STRETCH. ( APPLAUSE ).
NO, I GOT TO SAY-- I GOT TO SAY, "RIDERS UP!"
Stephen: NO WAY!
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU GOT TO SAY THAT?
YEAH.
Stephen: THEY SAY THAT AT THE "MAGIC MIKE" SHOW, TOO. I WANT TO LEARN-- I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO RELAX YOUR WAY. NOW WE'VE GOT IT. DO I NEED TO DIVIDE IT?
DIVIDE THAT IN HALF.
Stephen: DIVIDE IT IN HALF.
ROLL ONE OF THOSE INTO A BALL, YOUR FAVORITE PART, WITH YOUR HANDS. LIGHTEN UP!
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A COMMERCIAL BREAK COMING UP.
LIGHTEN UP. STEPHEN, YOU'RE TOO TENSE, MAN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILLING. ( LAUGHTER ) PENETRATION. ♪ OH, MY LOVE OH, MY DARLING ♪
I NEED YOU NOW. VERY GOOD. ♪ I HUNGER FOR YOUR... ♪
Stephen: "KINGSMAN:  THE GOLDEN CIRCLE" IS IN THEATERY THIS FRIDAY. JEFF BRIDGES, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK! THANK YOU, JOHN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM ARIZONA WHO IS NOT JOHN McCAIN. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR JEFF FLAKE! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) HEY, SENATOR. THANKS FOR COMING. COME ON OUT HERE. NICE TO HAVE YOU ON.
THAT IS HOW I'M USUALLY INTRODUCED "THE OTHER SENATOR FROM ARIZONA."
Stephen: NOW, THE-- I WAS TELLING THE PEOPLE EARLIER HERE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN A PRETTY BOLD STANCE. YOU'VE BEEN OPENLY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "CONSCIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE," THAT WE'LL GET INTO IN JUST A MOMENT, IN WHICH YOU'RE OPENLY CRITICAL OF HIM. BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT YOU. WHAT WAS YOUR-- WHAT'S YOUR LIFE BEEN LIKE? DID YOU GROW UP IN ARIZONA?
I DID. I'M ACTUALLY A FIFTH GENERATION ARIZONAIAN. AN
Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE FROM A BIG FAMILY.
AND I GREW UP IN THE TOWN OF SNOWFLAKE, ARIZONA.
Stephen: I IS THERE A LOT OF SNOW IN ARIZONA.
THERE ARE A LOT OF FLAKES, LIKE MY FAMILY.
Stephen: IS IT NAMED AFTER YOU?
MY GREAT-GREAT GRANDFATHER IN 1878 WAS SENT TO ARIZONA BY BRIGHAM YOUNG TO COLONIZE THE STATE AND HE FOUNDED A SMALL TOWN. HE WAS GOING BACK UP TO UTAH TO GET THE CATTLE TO PAY FOR THE VALLEY THAT HE BOUGHT, AND HE RAN INTO ERASTUS SNOW, AND HE ASKED MY GREAT-GREAT GRANDFATHER, HAVE YOU NAMED THE TOWN? AND HE SAID NO, AND HE SAID CALL IS IT IT SNOWFLAKE FOR THE TWO OF US.
Stephen: DID YOU GROW UP IN THE TOWN?
I GREW UP NOT KNOWING "FLAKE" WAS A PEJORATIVE TERM.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL. ARE YOU KNOWN AS REASONABLE, BIPARTISAN, THE DEMOCRATS WANT A FULL C.B.O. SCORE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY NOT WAIT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON BEFORE YOU AFFECT ONE-SIXTH OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY?
LET ME SAY, I WANT A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH OBAMACARE IS IT WAS PUSHED THREE BY ONE PARTY.
Stephen:Y UNDERSTAND THAT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF PROBLEM IF WE JUST DO THIS LONG TERM. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE 200,000 ARIZONAIANS WHO WILL MAKE UP THIS MORNING OR TOMORROW MORNING WITHOUT HEALTH CARE. THEY'VE PAID THE FINE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE CARE. AND THEY STILL CAN'T AFFORD INSURANCE. 80% OF THEM MAKE LESS THAN $50,000 A YEAR.
Stephen: WHY NOT FIX WHAT WE HAVE IN OBAMACARE RATHER THAN TO BLOW UP THE BILL WE HAVE RIGHT NOW FOR SOMETHING THAT'S A QUESTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I DON'T THINK THIS IS-- THIS ISN'T A MATTER OF BLOWING UP THE SYSTEM. IT'S LETTING THOSE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RUN IT BETTER. AND I THINK THAT THAT CAN BE THE CASE. IF YOU LOOK BACK IN 1996, WE DID WELFARE REFORM, AND THE HUE AND CRY FROM EVERYONE OUT THERE WAS THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS, IT WILL NEVER WORK. THE GOVERNORS WILL TAKE IT OVER AND THERE WILL BE A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. THAT WASN'T THE CASE AT ALL. IN FACT, IT WORKED VERY SUCCESSFULLY. HEALTH CARE IS MORE DIFFICULT --
Stephen: YOU'RE LITERALLY DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO COULD DIE.
YOU BET. BUT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU NOW IS THE EXCHANGE IN ARIZONA, PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ON MEDICAID WHO ARE BUYING ON THE EXCHANGE, IT'S GROUND ZERO FOR THE FAILURE OF THE EXCHANGE. THERE ARE 15 COUNTIES IN ARIZONA. AND ALL 15 COUNTIES, IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A POLICY ON THE EXCHANGE, YOU'RE PAYING MORE FOR YOUR PREMIUM THAN ARE YOU FOR YOUR MORTGAGE, IN EVERY COUNTY. IN A COUPLE OF COUNTIES, YOU'RE PAYING DOUBLE. AND THEN WITH COT PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES THAT ARE SO HIGH, IT'S AS IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING THAT STRIKES ME. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE OF OBAMACARE IT WAS TO PROVIDE AS MUCH HEALTH CARE TO EVERYBODY AS YOU COULD. WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS OVER TAKING OBAMACARE AWAY, OFTEN THERE ARE IDEOLOGICAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. THE GOAL IS ABOUT IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE, NOT GETTING HEALTH CARE TO THE MOST PEOPLE YOU CAN.
I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S-- THAT'S CERTAINLY THE GOAL THAT ALL OF US HAVE.
Stephen: OKAY,.
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. I MEAN, EVERYBODY WANTS THAT, MOST PEOPLE COVERED --
Stephen: NOT EVERYBODY WANTS THAT. NOT EVERYBODY WANTS THAT BECAUSE AS TRUMP ADVISER STEPHEN MOORE SAID, PEOPLE WANT HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR OWN FAMILY, NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAMILY. BUT THAT'S HOW INSURANCE WORKS. THE IDEA OF A RISK POOL, WHICH IS WHAT OBAMACARE IS, IS WHAT INSURANCE IS. WHY-- WHY-- WHY NOT JUST FIX THE RISK POOL AS EXISTS, RATHER THAN CALLING ALL THE MONEY BACK IN, RESPLIT SPLITTING IT UP, TAKING MONEY FROM NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS AND CALIFORNIA, AND THE OTHER STATES THAT LINDSEY GRAHAM NAMED. AND THEN REDISTRIBUTING THEMEP IN BLOCK GRANTS THAT CAN BE USED IN WAYS TAARE NOT GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL GRANTORS.
LET ME JUST SAY WITH THE MEDICAID RIGHT NOW-- ( APPLAUSE ) THOSE FIVE STATES THAT WERE NAMED BY LINDSEY GRAHAM-- CALIFORNIA, MASSACHUSETTS, NEW YORK, AND MARYLAND-- 40% OF MEDICAID SPENDING GOES TO THOSE FOUR STATES. AND IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE OTHER STATES, YOU'D SAY THAT'S HARDLY FAIR.
Stephen: THEY'RE HIGH-POPULATION STATES WHO PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE FEDERAL COFFERS.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
Stephen: I'M SURE IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
PENNSYLVANIA, RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO MASSACHUSETTS, COFERS TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE WITH I THINK ONE-THIRD FEWER DOLLARS. AND SO -- AND ARIZONA COVERS A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY EFFICIENTLY. NEW YORK, NOT SO MUCH. AND SO PART OF THE REASON WE WANT TO PUSH THIS DOWN TO THE GOVERNORS' LEVEL IN THE STATE LEGISLATURES IS THEY USUALLY DO THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND BETTER, WAS WAS THE CASE WITH WELFARE REFORM THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS ARE GOING TOPAZ THIS?
I DO.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SEVERAL SENATORS PUBLICLY OPPOSED TO IT, AND YOU CAN ONLY LOSE TWO.
IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE FINAL FEW SENATORS. I HOPE WE CAN. LEAK I SAID, PEOPLE IN ARIZONA ARE HURTING. AND THAT'S WHO I'M RESPONDING TO. WE'VE GOT TO FIX IT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY GOING FORWARD, OBVIOUSLY. IT IS NEVER GOOD FOR ONE PARTY TO PUSH SOMETHING THROUGH ON ITS OWN. IN THE MEANTIME, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS INSURANCE.
Stephen: WELL, IN THE BOOK, "CONSCIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE," WHICH IS A HAT TIP TO GREAT SENATOR FROM ARIZONA, BARRY GOLDWATER, CONSERVATIVE FROM THE 1960s, YOU SAY THAT THE G.O.P. IS IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM TO SEE WHO CAN BE MEANER, MADDER, AND CRAZIER. WERE YOU EVER PART OF THAT PROBLEM?
YOU BE, AS FAR AS THE MEANER, MADDER, AND CRAZIER, I'D LIKE TO THINK THOUGH. I MEAN, WE-- IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW, ALL THE INCENTIVES OUT THERE CEEND OF REWARD THOSE WHO YELL THE LOUDEST. AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ONE OF THOSE.
THE WAY THE DISTRICTS ARE GERRYMANDERED AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS LED TO THAT. BUT ALL OF US HAVE REGRETS.
Stephen: WHAT ARE SOME OF YOURS?
I MENTION IN THE BOOK, DURING THE TARP VOTE, THE TROUBLED ASSET ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN 2008, WE HAD TO FIX IT OVERNIGHT. AND THE HOUSE VOTED NO, AND THE STOCK MARKET DROPPED 700 POINTS WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS. I WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO VOTED NO.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU VOTE NO AT THE TIME?
AT THE TIME, MY FEELING WAS I DIDN'T CONTRIBUTE TO THIS. AND I HADN'T. I WASN'T THE ONE WHO RACKED UP ALL THE DEBT, OR I DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, WORK ON THE REGULATION THAT MAY HAVE ALLOWED THIS. SO I JUSTIFIED IT MYSELF FOR SAYING, "I DON'T NEED TO FIX THIS. WE'LL LET SOMEBODY ELSE." AND THEN WE HAD ANOTHER VOTE, AND I VOTED NO AS WELL, WHEN I SHOULD HAVE VOTED YET YYES.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY INTERESTING-- AND YOU REGRET THAT.
I DO.
Stephen: THAT'S AN INTERESTING PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE THAT GETS BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INSURE ONLY THEIR OWN FAMILY AND NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S.
THAT MAY BE THE CASE WITH ONE FAMILY OR ANOTHER. BUT IF YOU'RE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, AND YOU WANT TO BE REELECTED, THEN, SRBLED, YOU'RE GOING TO CARE FOR WHO HAS INSURANCE AND WHO DOESN'T.
Stephen: YOU HAVE OPPOSED TRUMP. DO YOU THINK THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR RE-ELECTION CHANCES? BECAUSE HE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY, AND HE HAS PROMISED TO PUT IN $10 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY TO DEFEAT YOU. IS THAT A PLUS OR A MINUS, GIVEN HIS POPULARITY. ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S-- IT'S NEVER A PLUS. AND I-- LET ME JUST SAY. MY BOSSES ARE SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN ARIZONA. THAT'S WHO I ANSWER TO. I AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT ON SOME THINGS. I HAVE PROFOUND DIFFERENCES ON OTHERS. LIKE I DID WITH A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS. BUT I ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA, AND ARIZONA TENDS TO ELECT INDEPENDENT-MINDED SENATORS-- BARRY GOLDWATER, JOHN McCAIN. SO I LIKE MY CHANCE S.
Stephen:  WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TALKING TO ME AND EXPLAINING THE RATIONALE BEHIND YOUR DECISION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
