Stephen: JEFF TWITTY! HEY, MAN.
HEY.
Stephen: DON'T GET UP.
OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: ANYWAY, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE COMING ON SHOW. I'M A HUGE FAN.
THANKS, STEPHEN. I'M ALSO A HUGE FAN OF WILCO.
Stephen: I SEE YOU LIKE KEEPING YOUR GUITAR CLOSE.
WHEREVER I AM, YOU WILL ALLY FIND MY GUITAR.
Stephen: LUCILLE.
EXCUSE ME.
Stephen: LUCILLE, YOUR GUITAR. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN. I GOTTA HAVE MY MUSIC CLOSE, TOO. THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS CARRY AROUND MY LITTLE LADY.
YOU PLAY HARMONICA?
Stephen: NO, PLAY DIDGEROO. YEAH. THIS IS ALICE. SHE'S MY LIFE. LET'S SCWAM.
STEPHEN, I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: LET'S CRANK IT UP AND RIP OFF KNOB.
STEPHEN, THAT DOESN'T HAVE A KNOB.
NO, IT'S A METAPHOR FOR SEX.
I'M PLAYING IN THE KEY OF G. IS THAT A G?
IT'S NOT "G" AT ALL. IT WON'T WORK. I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE. THIS ONE'S IN THE KEY OF "G." ALL RIGHT! LET'S DO IT.
STEPHEN, I'M A PROFESSIONAL. I DON'T KNOW. CAN YOU EVEN PLAY THAT THING IN.
Stephen: YOU TELL ME.
WOW.
Stephen: LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT. YOU START.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ETHAN HAWKE TIM MEADOWS AND MUSICAL GUEST WILCO. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, CHRIS! THANKS, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. AMAZING! AMAZING!
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. HEY! WELCOME TO THE "LAT "LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. OH, MY GOSH. OH, IT FEELS GOOD. FEELS GOOD TO BE WITH EVERYBODY HERE TONIGHT. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. AND, FOLKS, CHECK YOUR CALENDARS. WE ARE JUST DAYS AWAY FROM THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, THIS MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, AND THE "LATE SHOW" WILL BE BROADCASTING LIVE RIGHT HERE FROM THIS STAGE TO HELP YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WILL APPLAUD ME ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL BE HE WERE LIVE TO HELP YOU RELIVE ALL THE BIG MOMENTS YOU JUST SAW AND ARE NOW DRINKING TO FORGET. DONALD TRUMP SAYS FOR THE DEBATE HE'S NOT PREPPING. HE'S GOING TO RELY ON HIS IMPROV SKILLS, SO I'M ASSUMING THAT HIS PREP CONSISTS OF ASKING A ROOM FULL OF DRUNK PEOPLE FOR AN OBJECT AND OCCUPATION. ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. "I HEARD CHIA PET AND PROCTOLOGIST." SCENE! GOOD MORNING, DOCTOR! ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE-- IMPROV. MEANWHILE, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IS REALLY WORRIED THAT TRUMP COULD BE SEEN AS THE WINNER IF HE CLEARS THE LOW BAR OF AVOIDING OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT THE LOWEST BAR FOR DONALD TRUMP. A LOW BAR FOR HIM IS NOT TELLING LESTER HOLT HE'D BE A TEN IF HE BOUGHT A NEW SET OF KNOCKERS. COME ON, LESTER, SHAKE THEM UP. IT'S TRUE, LESTER. YOU LOOK GREAT. SO, SECRETARY CLINTON IS PREPARING FOR EVERYTHING. IN FACT, IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT SHE IS ACTUALLY PREPPING FOR TWO TRUMPS AT THE DEBATE-- AN ON-MESSAGE, DISCIPLINED DONALD TRUMP AND A FREEWHEELING DONALD TRUMP. BY THE WAY, "FREEWHEELIN' DONALD TRUMP" IS THE WORST FOLK ALBUM OF ALL TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, NORMALLY CANDIDATES PREPARE BY DOING MOCK DEBATES AGAINST A STAND-IN FOR THEIR OPPONENT, BUT WHO COULD PORTRAY THE TWO SIDE OF DONALD TRUMP? I KNOW OF ONLY ONE PERSON WHO COULD CAPTURE BOTH TRUMPS AT THE SAME TIME, AND WE HAVE OBTAINED EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE OF HIM PREPPING SECRETARY CLINTON. ( LAUGHTER )
THEY HAVE THE JOBS. SNEAKY LITTLE IMMIGRANTS. WICKED, TRICKSY IMMIGRANTS. IMMIGRANTS ARE MY FRIENDS. BUILD... THE... WALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TRUMP IS A LOT LIKE GOLLUM-- BOTH OF THEM HAVE TROUBLE HOLDING ON TO A RING FOR TOO LONG. NOW, DON'T YOU BOO GOLLUM. MAO, HERE'S SOME INTERESTING NEWS. A MAN IN CANADA WAS CAUGHT STEALING GOLD FROM THE ROYAL CANADIAN MINT. THE MAN, AN EMPLOYEE OF THE BANK, SMUGGLED $140,000 IN GOLD NUGGETS OUT OF THE MINT INSIDE HIS RECTUM. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. ♪ GOLD-SPHINCTER! COULD YOU HEAR THAT-- COULD I HEAR THAT ONE MORE TIME, PLEASE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ HE'S THE MAN THE MAN WITH THE FUNNY WALK ♪ THOSE HORNS, BY THE WAY, THAT WAS THE SOUND HE MADE WHEN THEY PULLED THE GOLD OUT OF HIM. THE MAN WAS CHARGED WITH THEFT, POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY-- AND, GOD, I HOPE-- MONEY LAUNDERING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW--
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING THE THEFTS FOUND A JAR OF VASELINE IN HIS LOCKER, D I'M GOING TO SAY A RUBBER MALLET AND A BITE STICK. PRESIDING OVER THE CASE WHEN WAS MAN WAS ON IT TRIAL-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- THE HONORABLE JUDGE PETER DOODY, PROVING ONCE AND FOR ALL, I BELIEVE, THAT THERE IS A GOD. ( LAUGHTER ) THE THIEF WAS ORDERED TO RETURN THE GOLD NUGGETS, BUT THE MINT WAS LIKE, "EH, WE'RE GOOD." WE'LL TAKE A CHECK. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, IN OTHER NEWS, I JUST SAW A STORY THAT FILLED ME WITH RAGE-- AND THEN HUNGER.
AN ENTREPRENEUR HAS RECEIVED A PATENT FOR THIS CREATION TO REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR NEXT BARBECUE. IT IS A COMBINATION HAMBURGER/ HOT DOG. HE CALLS THIS THE HAMDOG.
Stephen: YES. THE HAMDOG. SORRY, ELON MUSK. SOMEONE BEAT YOU TO THE PUNCH. THE HAMDOG IS, EVIDENTLY, AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME. INSTEAD OF HOLDING A HOT DOG IN ONE HAND AND A HAMBURGER IN THE OTHER, NOW I CAN HOLD THEM BOTH IN ONE HAND, LEAVING THE OTHER HAND FREE TO PERFORM THE HEIMLICH ON MYSELF. BUT HERE'S WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. OKAY. THIS HAMDOG WAS INVENTED BY AN AUSTRALIAN! HOW DID AUSTRALIA BEAT AMERICA? TO THE HAMDOG? AMERICA HAS ALWAYS LED THE WORLD IN UNNATURAL FOOD COMBINATIONS. I MEAN, WHO MADE A TACO SHELL OUT OF DORITOS? WE DID! WHO PUT PIZZA FLAVORING ON POTATO CHIPS? WE DID! AND, DAMNIT, HAVE WE FORGOTTEN THE DOUBLE DOWN-- BACON AND CHEESE BETWEEN TWO PIECES OF DEEP-FRIED CHICKEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAVE WE FORGOTTEN! WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA? CERTAINLY NOT OUR NEXT OF KIN. AND WHY DO YOU THINK THE PILGRIMS KALE OVER HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? NOT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, BUT SO ON THANKSGIVING THEY COULD STUFF A CHICKEN INSIDE A DUCK INSIDE A TURKEY WITHOUT THE KING'S PERMISSION! I'M CALLING ON ALL OUR NATION'S TOP SCIENTISTS TO STOP WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING AND INVENT NEW, UNNATURAL FOOD COMBINATION TO MAKE US PROUD. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. COMBINE LAMB CHOPS WITH A SLURPEE! PIPE GRAVY INTO A TWINKIE! MAKE BEEF STROGANOFF INTO FRUIT ROLLUPS! CALL THEM FRUIT STROG-OFFS! PUT CHEESE ON ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE CHEESE ON IT ALREADY. GOOD LUCK FINDING IT! BECAUSE, IN THE WORDS OF ROBERT F. KENNEDY, "SOME MEN SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE AND SAY WHY? I DREAM THINGS THAT NEVER WERE AND SAY 'I'D PUT THAT IN MY MOUTH.'" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND NOW, SAY HI TO SOMETHING THAT IS NATURAL AND DELICIOUS-- JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: DA-DA-CA-DA. THAT WAS THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I SEE YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST WITH YOU TONIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE HONORED TO HAVE?
Jon: YES,E, INDEED UPON I HAVE THE LEGENDARY NILE RODGERS IN THE THE HOUSE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HE'S HEADLINE LINING? "FREAK OUT LET'S DANCE," ON SATURDAY OCTOBER 8 AT FOREST HILLS STADIUMS IN QUEENS.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU. THANK YOU.
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU FOLKS THAT DONALD TRUMP'S NOT DOING VERY WELL WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS. I ESPECIALLY DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU FOLKS OVER THERE. YESTERDAY, AT A RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA, HE ONCE AGAIN BROUGHT THE BLACK COMMUNITY THE MESSAGE OF HOPE THAT ALL IS HOPELESS.
THEY ARE IN THE WORST SHAPE THAN EVER, EVER, EVER.
Stephen: FOR ONE THING, DONALD TRUMP MIGHT BECOME PRESIDENT. AND WHILE SOME POLLS OUT THERE SHOW TRUMP WITH 0% SUPPORT AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS, WE FOUND ONE. FOR HIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE WE TURN NOW TO OUR DEAR FRIEND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A BOARD-CERTIFIED BLACK REPUBLICAN, ENTREPRENEUR, AND TRUMP UNIVERSITY GRADUATE, P.K. WINTHROP. P.K., THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) P.K., P.K., MY MAN! GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. "WHAT IT DO?"
OH, IT DOES, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I SEE YOU COME TO US FROM A GOLF COURSE. I'M SORRY, DID WE INTERRUPT A ROUND?
OH, I DON'T PLAY GOLF, STEPHEN. I JUST DRESS UP LIKE TIGER WOODS AND CHARGE WHITE PEOPLE FOR AUTOGRAPHS. THEY DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: GOOD TO HEAR, GOOD TO HEAR. SPEAKING OF CONFUSED WHITE PEOPLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP SAYING THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WORSE TIME FOR BLACK PEOPLE?
THAT'S TRUE, STEPHEN. UNLESS "TIME" INCLUDES HISTORY. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, THIS BLACK PERSON NEVER HAD IT BETTER.
Stephen: REALLY?
YOU BET. SCARCITY DETERMINES VALUE. AS ONE OF THE FEW BLACK TRUMP SUPPORTERS, I AM SOLID GOLD. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: SPEAKING OF WHICH, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT GUY IN CANADA?
YEAH, HE'S AD ANY FRIEND OF MINE. STAY STRONG, LESTON!
Stephen: I'M SURPRISED YOU SUPPORT TRUMP. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS BARACK OBAMA IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
OH, ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN. I'LL MISS ALL THE WONDERFUL RETAIL OPPORTUNITIES HE PROVIDED. THOSE ANTI-OBAMA RALLIES WERE GREAT FOR MY BUSINESS. REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO SELL THESE OBAMA/HITLER MUSTACHES?
Stephen: HOW COULD I FORGET? YOU WERE QUITE PROUD OF YOUR ETSY PAGE.
YEAH, WELL, THANKS. ALSO, REMEMBER MY DELICIOUS "OBAMA IS A KENYAN" BLACK RHINO STEAKS? ( LAUGHTER ) OH, I SOLD A LOT OF THESE.
Stephen: HOLD ON, P.C. AREN'T BLACK RHINOS ENDANGERED?
LIKE I SAID, I SOLD A LOT OF THESE. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS CROWD FAVORITE: OBAMA "YOU LIE" MOUTHWASH! BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE HECKLING THE PRESIDENT DURING THE STATE OF THE UNION, YOU WANT YOUR BREATH AT ITS FRESHEST.
Stephen: WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ABOUT TO LEAVE OFFICE, SO WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS PLAN NOW?
WELL, STEPHEN, I'VE COMPLETELY RESTOCKED MY ENTIRE INVENTORY WITH NEW MERCHANDISE, LIKE THESE BRAND TRUMP-STACHES. YOU SLAP ONE OF THESE BABIES ON A PICTURE OF TRUMP... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND HE BECOMES HITLER?
NO, STEPHEN. HE BECOMES A POWERFUL LEADER WHO KNOWS HOW TO RALLY THE PEOPLE WITH HIS POWERFUL ORATORY SKILLS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE CHARLIE CHAPLIN. HEY, YOU HUNGRY FOR MORE?
Stephen: I IN NO WAY IMPLIED THEY AM.
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THESE. THESE ARE TRUMP BLACK RHINO STEAKS. EACH RHINO WAS HAND-SLAUGHTERED BY DONALD TRUMP, JR. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. BUT, I JUST HAVE ON ASK YOU HERE, AREN'T THOSE THE SAME STEAKS AS BEFORE?
NOPE. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. THESE HAVE BEEN AGED FOR EIGHT YEARS IN A CLIMATE-CONTROLLED DUPLEX. AND YOU CAN WASH THEM DOWN-- YOU CAN WASH THEM DOWN WITH TRUMP SPEARMINT LIQUEUR. YEAH. IT TINGLES! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT AT LEAST THAT ONE DIDN'T HARM ANY RHINOS.
ACTUALLY, THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF RHINO IN HERE. WE USE ALL OF THE ANIMAL. WE'RE NOT MONSTERS. COME ON, MAN.
HEY, HEY, I'M SORRY. ARE YOU TIGER WOODS?
DO YOU HAVE $5?
Stephen:
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ETHAN HAWKE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE "LATE SHOW" HERE ON CBS, WHERE DISCO NEVER DIED. KEEP ON STRONG. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. NILE RODGERS IS HERE. ETHAN HAWKE WILL BE OUT HERE IN JUST A SECOND, TIM MEADOWS. WILCO IS PERFORMING. PLEASE JOIN US FRIDAY, THOUGH, BECAUSE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IS MY GUEST ON FRIDAY.  ( APPLAUSE ) WE'LL HAVE AN EXTENSIVE INTERVIEW ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK, HIS LIFE, AND HOW HE GOT ALL JACKED IN THE EARLY 80s FOR "BORN IN THE U.S.A." I UPON TO KNOW WHAT HIS WORKOUT ROUTINE WAS. THERE'S PROBABLY A DIET BOOK IN THERE. MY FIRST GUEST IS A FOUR-TIME ACADEMY-AWARD NOMINEE WITH 30 YEARS OF ACTING, WRITING AND DIRECTING UNDER HIS BELT. HIS NEW MOVIE IS "THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN."
23 CONFIRMED KILLS. ONE OF THE SHARPSHOOTERRERS, DUBBED, "THE ANGEL OF DEATH." DO WHAT HE DOES. HE'S A LEGEND.
THAT'S SOME FANCY SHOOTING THERE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME ETHAN HAWKE! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
WOW!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, I'LL BITE. YOU'VE GOT A WILCO T-SHIRT ON. ARE YOU A FAN OR ARE YOU LOOKING TO BE IN THE BAND?
WELL, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT-- NO, I'M A FAN. I GOT THE CHANCE-- I MADE A VERY STRANGE, WEIRD MOVIE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER CALLED "CHELSEA WALLS," A MOVIE-- ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S, LIKE, THE FOUR PEOPLE WHO EVER SAW IT. BUT IT WAS A LOT OF FUN, AND THE MOVIE HAS KIND OF NO NARRATIVE. IT'S A WEIRD, STRANGE POEM OF A MOVIE. AND I ASKED WHAT JEFF TWEEDY DID THE THE SCORE AND HE DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB. IF THERE'S A REASON TO SEE THE MOVIE, HE DID THE SCORE AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SCENES KRIS KRISTOFFERSON WAS IN IT.
Stephen: CAN YOU DIRECT THE MOVIE?
I DID. I RAN A THEATER COMPANY WHEN I WAS A KID.
Stephen: HOW YOUNG?
"DEAD POETS SOCIETY "CAME OUT WHEN I WAS 18 AND I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE AND MY MOM WAS CRYING AND CRYING AND SAID, "YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING USEFUL IN YOUR LIFE." I SAID, "NO, I'LL START A THEATER COMPANY."
Stephen: AND YOUR MOM SAID, "WHY NOT GO FOR THE BIG MONEY AND BE A POET."
YEAH, KNOWING MY MOM SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT.
Stephen: REALLY? WAS YOUR MOM KIND OF ARTIE AND SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR CAREER?
YOU SAY THAT KIND OF MEAN.
Stephen: NO, MY MOSMS KIND OF ARTIE AND SUPPORTIVE OF MY CAREER.
MY MOTHER THOUGHT ALAN GINSBERG SHOULD BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YEAH, SO SHE DID THINK IT WAS A PRETTY WORTHWHILE CAREER, AND WHAT ACTUALLY OF A LOT OF HELP TO ME. THE MONEY I MADE FROM "DEAD POETS SOCIETY "AND I REPRESENTED A THEATER FOR THREE MONTHS.
Stephen: HERE IN THE CITY?
THE FIRST TIME WE DIDN'T RENT FOR WHAT LONG, AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PLAY I WAS GOING TO DO BUT I STARTED TO MAKE FRIENDS AND PUT IT ON.
Stephen: IT WAS THE SANFORD MEISSNER THEATER.
HE HAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES ABOUT ACT OF ALL TIME. HE WISHED IT WAS AS HARD ADD TIGHT-ROPE WALKING SO ALL THE PHONY ( BLEEP ) WOULD FALL TO THE GROUND AND DIE.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. HAVE YOU EVER FELT LIKE I'M GOING TO FALL OFF THIS ROPE AT ANY MINUTE? I HAVE FALLEN OFF THE ROPE. YEAH.
Stephen: OH, OKAY. PAINFUL?
VERY PAINFUL.
Stephen: WOW.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU START WHEN YOU'RE 18-- I'M NOT REALLY JOKING. I HAD TO LEARN IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW. SO I WAS FALLING ON MY ASS AWE TIME.
Stephen: WAS THERE, LIKE AIR, MOST PAINFUL EXPERIENCE FOR YOU THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW? ( LAUGHTER )
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY-- YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR PAINFUL EXPERIENCES BUT --
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIS PAINFUL EXPERIENCE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD PUT MY FEET UP ON THE COUCH.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ETHAN, LET'S FOLLOW THAT FEELING. WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: AND HOW DOES IT RELATE TO YOUR ARTSY MOTHER? NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO, BUT I WILL ASK YOU THIS, I WILL ASK YOU THIS BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR PAINFUL EXPERIENCE. ARE YOU REALLY GETTING A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD OR DID YOU GET A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
Stephen:  IT'S A YES OR NO QUESTION, SIR. BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE A LAWYER PRESENT.
I'M FINDING YOUR QUESTIONS SCARY.
Stephen: CAN YOU GET A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD?
DI.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 45 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: YOU'RE 45 YEARS OLD. ARE YOU-- IS THERE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENING TO YOU?
I KNOW, RIGHT.
Stephen: WHEN YOU GET A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD-- WHO GAVE IT TO YOU.
THERE IS A FILM FESTIVAL IN SAN SEBASTIAN WHICH HAS A LONG LEGACY OF CELEBRATING FILM, AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WASN'T AWARD, GREGORY PECK, SEAN PENN, DENZEL WASHINGTON, MERYL STREEP. THE LIST GOES ON FOR 50 YEARS ASK IT'S INCREDIBLE. THEY OFFERED IT TO ME, AND I FELT LIKE I HAD TO ACCEPT. MY WIFE FELT LIKE IT WAS A DEATH SENTENCE.
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T DESERVE IT BUT YOU'RE ONLY 45 YEARS OLD. BUT LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT THEY PUT YOU OUT TO PASTURE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU'RE DOING SIX FILMS THIS YEAR, REPORT YOU?
I'M DOING SIX THIS MONTH, PAL. I DON'T WANT TO DIE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE THE END.
Stephen: "DON'T WANT TO DIE." WELL, SEE IF YOU CAN STAY ALIVE FOR TWO MINUTE. TWO SECONDS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL AND THEN WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE ETHAN HAWKE. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NOW WE'RE HERE WITH ETHAN HAWKE. NOW, THEN, ETHAN, I INTERRUPTED YOU BEFORE YOU TOLD US ABOUT YOUR PAINFUL EXPERIENCE. WHAT IS-- DO YOU WANT TO SHARE?
I THOUGHT I HAD GOTTEN OUT OF IT.
Stephen: NOPE, NOPE.
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT SO MANY PAINFUL EXPERIENCES -- ALL RIGHT, I'LL START WITH THIS ONE. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE STUDYING ACTING, DOING REPETITION EXERCISES, TAKING ACTING VERY SERIOUSLY. "DEAD POETS SOCIETY" COMES OUT AND PEOPLE THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE AT IT. YOU'RE PLAYING THE UMMAYOUNG MAN'S PART AS CONSTANTINE, MAKING A BROADWAY DAVIEW. YOU FANTASIZE IN YOUR HEAD. YOU CAN'T HELP IT. YOU WANT TO SHARE AND EXPRESS YOURSELF, BUT YOU DO THINK, MAYBE PEOPLE WILL THINK I'M AGREED GREAT. AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF-- YOU MIGHT READ WHAT MARLON BRANDO'S DEBUT WAS LIKE, AND YOU READ THE GREAT NOTICES AND YOU THINK, "I WONDER IF MINE WILL BE LIKE THAT." MAYBE. AND YOU ARE REHEARSING AND FEELING SO CONFIDENT. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY GOING WELL, AND YOUR FRIENDS COME AND THEY TELL YOU YOU'RE GREAT. AND YOUR MOM, WHO IS VERY SUPPORTIVE, COMES AND SHE'S LIKE, "WOW, ETHAN! YOU'RE REALLY DOING IT." AND THEN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" COMES, AND YOU DO YOUR SHOW, AND YOU'RE AT THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY AND AGENTS ARE LIGHTING YOUR CIGARETTES-- THIS IS BEFORE THE INTERNET-- AND THEN THE PAPER COMES OUT. ( SIGHS ) EVERYBODY STARTS ON LEAVE. AND YOU'RE THERE WITH YOUR CIGARETTE. MAYBE I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. "ETHAN HAWKE PLAYS CONSTANTINE MORE CONCERNED WITH HIS PIMPLES THAN HIS POETRY. PERHAPS HE SHOULD SPEND LESS TIME AT THE ACTORS' STUDIO AND MORE AT THE DERMATOLOGIST."
Audience: OOOOOOH!
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO LAY BACK DOWN AGAIN?
YEAH.
Stephen: OH, MY GOD.
BUT I'M STILL HERE, MAN.
Stephen: YOU ARE STILL HERE.
I'M 45! I'M ON "THE COLBERT SHOW."
Stephen: LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. I'M NOT SURE IF THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS HERE. SO "THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN," A REMAKE OF THE "THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN," WHICH IS A REMAKE OF "THE SEVEN SAMURAI," WHICH SIREMAKE OF "SNOW WHITE AND THE THE SEVEN DWARFS." YOU PLAY GOODNIGHT ROBICHEAUX, A FORMER CONFEDERATE SOLDIER WITH 37 KILLS, AND KILLING UNION SOLDIERS AND WE'RE PULLING FOR YOU? IT'S A DIFFICULT BACK STORY. HOW DO YOU BUILD THIS CHARACTER? WHAT WOULD YOU BASE THIS CHARACTER ON?
ACTUALLY, NOT TO MAKE A JOKE, I FOUNDA INCREDIBLY INTERESTING. PART OF THE THING SO FASCINATING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS IT'S BEING HEADED BID DENZEL WASHINGTON. SO TO SEE HIM TAKE OVER THIS KIND OF VERY MUCH DICK CHENEY ICONOGRAPHY OF THE CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD WESTERN.
Stephen: YULE BRENNER PLAYED THE PART INITIALLY.
WHO WAS RUSSIAN. WHEN YOU DO AN OLD-SCHOOL HOLLYWOOD WESTERN, THE IMAGES IN YOUR MIND ARE JOHN WAYNE, YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE DIFFERENT GUYS. HAVING DENZEL DO THAT AND REALIZING ONE OF HIS CLOSE FRIENDS IS A FORMER CONFEDERATE SOLDIER. I HAD THE SAME REACTION AS YOU. WHAT IS THIS GOI'S BACK STORY. I FOUND IT KIND OF FASCINATING AND STARTING DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR AND THE LOUISIANA TYINGERS AND WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT AND HOW INTERESTING A PLACE LOUISIANA WAS IN THE CIVIL WAR. AND I CALLED UP ONE OF MY FRIEND WHO IS A MUSICIAN IN NEW ORLEANS. AND I SAID, "TELL ME ABOUT THE LOUISIANA TIGERS." AND HE SAID A FAINT HEART NEVER ( BLEEP ) A BOB CAT."
Stephen: DID HE JUST HANG UP AFTER THAT? NO, HE HAD SOME OTHER-- HE-- HE HAD SOME OTHER-- IF YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME DO THIS.
Stephen: SURE.
THE OTHER ONE HE SAID WAS, "MOSQUITO DOWN THERE ARE SO LARGE, THEY CAN STAND FLAT FOOTED AND MAKE LOVE TO A TURKEY."
Stephen: IS THAT ACCURATE? IS THAT ACCURATE? YEAH. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO I HUNG UP THE THE PHONE, AND I SAID TO MYSELF, "I HAVE FOUND MY CHARACTER."
Stephen: HOW MANY MOVIES HAVE YOU DONE AT THIS POSTPONE?
IN MY LIFE?
Stephen: SURE. DO YOU KNOW?
BACK ON THE COUCH. I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING ABOUT A MOVIE AND SELLING.
Stephen:  THE REASON I'M ASKING IS HAVE YOU DONE WESTERNS BEFORE?
NO, I HAVE NOT.
Stephen: YOU'RE RIDING HORSES ALL THE TIME. I HAVE TO ASK-- WHAT WERE YOUR INNER THIGHS LIKE ON DAY FOUR. I HAVE DONE A LITTLE RIDING AND IF YOU HAVEN'T CONDITION IT FOR A WHILE IT'S LIKE HELL ON EARTH. THERE'S A REASON COWBOYS WALK BOWLEGGED. EVERYTHING OKAY.
EVERYTHING IS FINE. I ALREADY HAVE FOUR KIDS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: IT'S BEST KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL, RIDING A HORSE.
RIDING HORSES IS NO JOKE. AND RIDING IT WITH THAT MANY OTHER GUYS. I MEAN, THERE ARE, LIKE, 150 STUNT GUYS. WE'RE ALL RIDING. IT'S HOT.
Stephen: ANYBODY AT THE CAN "THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN" FEEL LIKE, "I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?" ANYBODY BEING A LITTLE TOO MACHO AND GETTING IN TROUBLE?
EVERYBODY WAS TOO MACHO AND GETTING IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE. WE SHOT THIS MOVIE FOREVER. I'M USED TO DOING INDY MOVIES. WE SHOOT THEM FOR A COUCH WEEKS. THIS ONE WE WERE OUT FIVE MONTHS IN THE DESERT, RUNNING AROUND, BEATING EACH OTHER UP.
Stephen: IT SOUND LIKE FUN.
IT WAS A BLAST.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR COMING.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. "THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN" OPENS FRIDAY. ETHAN HAWKE, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TIM MEADOWS. ♪ EVERYBODY SING, WE ARE FAMILY ♪ ♪ GET UP AND SING IT TO ME ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO THE "LATE SHOW"." I'VE KNOWN MY NEXT GUEST SINCE I WAS 25 YEARS OLD, AND THE FIRST TIME HE EVER TALKED TO ME, HE WAS ANGRY AND YELLING, AND I DESERVED IT. PLEASE WELCOME TIM MEADOWS. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS? ARE YOU GOING TO DO A MAGIC TRICK?
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO FORGET-- I'LL SAVE IT FOR LATER. I DON'T WANT TO FORGET IT.
Stephen: GOOD, I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT. I WON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT.
HI, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: TIM MEADOWS, NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE 19-- I THINK THE FIRST TIME WE MET-- THAT STORY, YOUR GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME IN CHICAGO, THERE WAS A PARTY, LIKE A FOURTH OF JULY BARBECUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AT HER MOTHER'S HOUSE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND I GUESS I'D HAD SOMETHING TO DRINK.
REALLY.
Stephen: OR SOMETHING. AND I CRAWLED ON THE ROOF OF HER MOTHER'S GARAGE AND WAS THROWING HOT DOGS AT THE PEOPLE AT THE PARTY. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU IDEAL AT ME?
I DON'T. I'M SURE IT HAD "M." IF IN THERE.
Stephen: IT DID, AND IT ENDED WITH GROW THE ( BLEEP ) UP. YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THE SECOND CITY AND I HAD JUST BEEN HIRED IN THE NATIONAL TOURING COMPANY. AND I THOUGHT I'VE BLOAP IT. I WILL NEVER BE A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY.
BECAUSE I WAS SO COOL.
Stephen: YOU WERE SO COOL. YOU WERE SO COOL. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS IS WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE BACK THEN. THIS IS YOUR "S.N.L." PHOTO YOUR FIRST SEASON. THIS IS THE GUY-- CAN I SEE THE SHOT AGAIN? IT'S A LITTLE BART SIMPSONY. THAT'S THE GUY WHO IDEAL AT ME. I APOLOGIZE.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. >.
WE USED TO JOKE ABOUT THAT. WHEN I WASN'T ON THE SHOW, I WOULD SAY, "THAT'S A LIVE SHOT OF ME GETTING TRAIN GOING HOME." BECAUSE IT'S ME LOOKING AT THE TRAIN, TURNING AROUND AND GOING, "HEY, I'M TAKING OFF NOW."
Stephen: YOU HAVE KIDS NOW, RIGHT?
I DO.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?
I HAVE TWO BOYS. THEY ARE 14 AND SOON TO BE 16.
Stephen: TO THEY CARE THAT THEIR DAD IS FAMOUS?
I REMIND THEM OF THAT A LOT.
Stephen: HEY! HEY!
I'LL TELL THEM, EVERY ONCE THIS A WHILE I GO, "DO YOU GUYS REALIZE, TIM MEADOWS, THE TELEVISION STAR, IS COOKING YOUR BREAKFAST? THIS IS SO COOL FOR YOU."
Stephen: YOU CAN TELL YOUR GRANDCHILDREN YOU WERE THERE!
YEAH, YEAH. TIM MEADOWS IS ACTUALLY DROPPING YOU OFF AT SCHOOL, MAN.
Stephen: WAIT, WHAT DID YOU SAY, 14, AND 16?
YES.
Stephen: COTHEY EVEN WANT TO BE WITH YOU? DO YOU GUYS STILL DO THINGS TOGETHER. EVEN TEENAGERS--
THEY DON'T THINK I'M COOL ANYMORE. I THOUGHT EVEN THE COOLEST PERSON IN THE WORLD THEIR KIDS PROBABLY THOUGHT THEY WERE NERD OR JUST OF THE WORST-- LIKE, EVEN MILES DAVIS PROBE HAD THAT PROBLEM WITH HIS KIDS AT A CERTAIN POINTS. HIS KIDS WERE PROBABLY LIEB, "OH, DAD, SHUT UP WITH THAT TRUMPET, YOU KNOW." "I'M MILES DAVIS, MAN! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" THEY DO. NOW I TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH THEM AS I CAN BECAUSE THEY ARE CHANGING. WE WENT TO DETROIT THIS SUMMER.
Stephen: YOUR HOME TOWN.
MY HOME TOWN. I GREW UP IN DETROIT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YEAH.
Stephen: WE USUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY FROM DETROIT HERE. I APOLOGIZE.
NOT HAD TIME. THEY'RE IN PRISON, SOMEWHERE, PROBABLY. I GREW UP IN A ROUGH PART OF DETROIT. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT. IT IS CALLED DETROIT. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, OKAY. NO RIM SHOT ON THAT. ( RIM SHOT )
Stephen: DON'T GO FAR.
YOU KNOW ME? BUT, NO, WE WENT TO DETROIT THIS SUMMER. WE SAW A BUNCH OF BASEBALL GAMES. WATCHED THE TIGERS PLAY. AND WE WERE DRIVING FROM DHOG DETROIT, AND WE WERE PLAYING A CAR GAME, TRYING TO KILL TIME. AND THE GAME WAS, LIKE, YOU HAD TO PICK THE SUBJECT, AND THEN YOU HAD THREE SECONDS-- OR FIVE SECONDS TO NAME SOMETHING, YOU KNOW. SO IT WAS LIKE, "DIRECTORS, "AND YOU'D BE, "SCORSESE." IT WOULD BE YOUR TURN AND IF YOU CAN'T THINK OF SOMETHING WE'D GO 4, 3, 2. IT WAS ME ASK MY SON. WE WERE DRIVING AND PLAYING MUSICAL --
IS THIS THE 14-YEAR-OLD OR 16-YEAR-OLD?
THE 14-YEAR-OLD. WE WERE PLAYING MUSICAL GROUPS. I GO LED ZEPPELIN AND HE WAS LIKE... AND I GO 3, 2, 1. AND HE GOES PUSSY RIOT!
Stephen: IT COUNTS.
COUNTS. I I HAD NEVER HEARD HIM SAY ( BLEEP ). IN ANY OF ITS VARIATIONS THAT YOU COULD USE THAT WORD.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK CBS CENSORS HAVE HEARD IT EARTH?
REALLY PUSSY RIOT.
Stephen: NO, CAN'T FIND IT IN ANY THE OF THE DICTIONARIES.
I'M SORRY.
Stephen: IT'S NOT MY BEEP! IT'S THEIRS.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED THIS SUMMER. THEY'RE GETTING SO COOL NOW, THEY DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH ME AS MUCH.
Stephen: NOW, "SON OF ZORN," WHICH IS THE PROJECT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE GREAT JASON SEDAIKIS.
LOVE HIM.
Stephen: HE IS LIKE HE MAN OF THE "MASTERS OF THE YMPS" CARTOON CHARACTER WHO COMES BACK TO TO BE WITH HIS NONANIMATED CHILD AND YOU PLAY THE BOYFRIEND OF MOTHER?
YES.
Stephen: IT'S AN ETERNAL STORY.
IT IS.
Stephen: I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE. GYP.
CRAIG NEEDS SOME BISE FOR HIS BICYCLES.
BICYCLES? WHO THE HELL RIDES BICYCLES?
WE DO. CRAIG AND I ENJOY RIDING BICYCLES TOGETHER AS A COUPLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT EDIE AND I USED TO DO AS A COUPLE, HAVINGITANT RICK SEX ON THE MOUNT KNOW.
YOU SHOULD TRY BICYCLE. IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART, HAVINGITANT RICK SEX ON A MOUNTEN TOP.
I'M GOING TO GO FOR AN ANGER RIDE.
LET ME GUESS, ON YOUR BICYCLE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, IT'S REALLY GOOD.
THANKS.
