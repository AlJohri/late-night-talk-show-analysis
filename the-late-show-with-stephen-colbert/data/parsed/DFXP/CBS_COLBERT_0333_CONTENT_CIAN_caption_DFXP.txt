HEY, DID YOU HEAR TRUMP SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH WOULD ALLOW HIM TO CHANGE OUR NATIONAL MONUMENTS.
HE'S TRYING TO WEAKEN MY ACT. BULLY!
OUTRAGE! WHAT DO YOU CARE? YOU WERE CHOPPING DOWN CHERRY TREES LEFT AND RIGHT.
IT WAS ONE AND I FESSED UP TO IT YOU SON OF A PITCH.
CAN YOU   ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHY ARE YOU THREE GROUPED TOGETHER AND I'M ALONE.
THERE WERE THOSE RUMORS. I'M A HOMOSEXUAL? NO, WE WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT. THAT YOU'RE A CAN BALL.
WHO TALKED? IT WAS ONE TIME.
I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING, WHAT IF TRUMP WANTS TO CHANGE OUR NATIONAL MONUMENTS SO HE CAN PUT HIS OWN HEAD ON MT. RUSHMORE. THERE IS A BASE.
NO!
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, LL COOL J, PHILLIPA SOO, MUSICAL GUEST GORILLAZ, AND JON BATISTE WITH "STAY HUMAN." NOW FROM ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN )
Stephen: THANKS, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT! YOU'RE TOO KIND! ( PIANO RIFF ) WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOR THOSE OF YOU CHECKING YOUR CALENDARS, WE ARE NEARING THE END OF TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICE. ( CHEERING ) WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS LATER. COULD GO EITHER WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ONLY 1,400 MORE TO GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE MOOD HERE. HOWEVER ANYBODY FEELS ABOUT IT, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THESE FIRST HUNDRED TO BE OVER WITH, THOUGH. IT'S JUST EXHAUSTING, WATCHING THIS MAN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. ( LAUGHTER ) HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING, RIGHT? HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING. WHEN HE WAS RUNNING, HIS MESSAGE WAS, "I'LL GET THE JOB DONE. I'M A NEGOTIATOR. I WROTE 'ART OF THE DEAL.'" I AGREE WITH THAT ART PART. IT'S LIKE MODERN ART. WHEN I LOOK AT HIS PRESIDENCY AND THINK, "MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD COULD DO THAT." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TAKE HIS HEALTH CARE BILL. HE PROMISED TO REPEAL AND RELAYS ObamaCare, RIGHT -- REPEAL-AND-REPLACE, PROMISED IT -- BUT THEN  PULLED HIS BILL WITHOUT A VOTE. NOW HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND REVIVED IT AS SOMETHING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING "ZOMBIE TRUMPCARE." A LOT OF REPUBLICANS AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT BECAUSE LOOK AT THE CROWDS THAT ARE SHOWING UP AT THEIR TOWN HALLS. ( SCREECHING TIRES )
Stephen: NOT HAPPY. BUT THAT'S DEMOCRACY. THAT'S DEMOCRACY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
STEPHEN: AND IN THIS NEW PLAN, UNLIKE OBAMACARE, STATES WOULD BE ALLOWED TO NOT COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT WILL BE, LIKE, STATE BY STATE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) NOT A GOOD DEAL. WHICH IS WHY NEW HAMPSHIRE IS CHANGING THEIR LICENSE PLATES FROM "LIVE FREE OR DIE" TO "LIVE HERE AND DIE." AND IN PREPARATION FOR THIS PASSING, YESTERDAY, THE HOUSE G.O.P. EXEMPTED THEMSELVES FROM ZOMBIE TRUMPCARE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) OH, LISTEN, HEY, HEY, HEY, NO, DO NOT BE TOO HARD ON THESE GUYS. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND -- THEY ALL WOULD HAVE LOST THEIR COVERAGE BECAUSE BEING A DOUCHEBAG IS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT?
Jon: OH!
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY THINGS TRUMP HAS ALMOST DONE. YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP CAREENED DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO ACTION, HINTING OUT OF NOWHERE THAT HE WAS GOING TO SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WITHDRAWING THE U.S. FROM NAFTA. BUT THEN, HE QUICKLY TWEETED, "I RECEIVED CALLS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA ASKING TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, RATHER THAN TERMINATE. I AGREED... DOT, DOT." ADDING, "DOT, DOT, DOT, SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT IF WE DO NOT REACH A FAIR DEAL FOR ALL, WE WILL THEN TERMINATE NAFTA. RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOOD, DEAL. VERY POSSIBLE!" SO, TO RECAP: HE THREATENS TO END THE RELATIONSHIP, THEN GETS A PANICKED PHONE CALL, AND NOW SAYS THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOOD. NO WONDER HE'S ON HIS THIRD MARRIAGE. ( APPLAUSE ) HERE'S HIS ANNIVERSARY CARD. "TO MY LOVING WIFE. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. I WANT TO TERMINATE MARRIAGE. BUT LOVE IS GOOD. MAKE-UP SEX VERY POSSIBLE!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MAKE-UP SEX WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. I'VE SEEN THOSE GUYS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, HEY! ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST GOT DISTRACTED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HAVING SEX WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT, HEY, I'M FLATTERED. I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP. I'M FLATTERED, JUSTIN. BUT, HEY, HERE'S THE GOOD THING, I WANT YOU TO HOLD ON TO THIS -- AT LEAST WE'RE ALL STILL ALIVE. FOR NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I SAW THIS HEADLINE TODAY: "U.S. COMMANDER NOT CONFIDENT NORTH KOREA WILL REFRAIN FROM NUCLEAR ASSAULT." WOW! NOTE TO SELF: MOVE STUDIO TO ABANDONED MINESHAFT. OF COURSE, THAT HEADLINE IS A LITTLE UNFAIR. WHAT THE COMMANDER ACTUALLY SAID WAS THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A TIMETABLE FOR REACHING "AN INFLECTION POINT," BUT, "HE DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE" THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD REFRAIN FROM DOING "SOMETHING PRECIPITOUS." I THINK MY PANTS HAVE REACHED AN INFLECTION POINT BECAUSE, AFTER READING THAT, I'M NOT SURE I CAN REFRAIN FROM DOING SOMETHING PRECIPITOUS. ( APPLAUSE ) OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. IT IS LITERAL NUCLEAR WAR! NUCLEAR WAR! THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED NUCLEAR CRISIS WITH A MADMAN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHO SAYS HE WILL USE THEM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF THIS, YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE BUSSED IN ALL 100 SENATORS FOR A CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ON NORTH KOREA. FIELD TRIP! OKAY! "OKAY, EVERYBODY HAVE THEIR PERMISSION SLIPS? OKAY, GET A TRAVEL BUDDY. COME ON, SOMEONE HAS TO BE MITCH MCCONNELL'S TRAVEL BUDDY. TOUCH HIM, IT DOESN'T RUB OFF." COME ON. MITCH, COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL. MITCH, COME OUT OF YOUR SHELL. SOMEONE GET HIM SOME LETTUCE. JUST FEED HIM A LITTLE. COME ON. ( PIANO RIFF ) SO WHY THE SPECIAL TRIP? WELL, ACCORDING TO THE SENATORS, THEY STILL DON'T KNOW BECAUSE, APPARENTLY, THEY "LEARNED 'VERY LITTLE' DURING THE BRIEFING," WITH ONE "ANONYMOUS REPUBLICAN SAYING THAT THE BRIEFING FAILED TO CLARIFY EVEN THE MOST BASIC QUESTIONS." SO, APPARENTLY, IT WAS LED BY SEAN SPICER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: GOOD OLD SEAN. OH, HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE TRUMP DIDN'T DO BUT DID UNDO. YESTERDAY, TRUMP SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLING FOR A REVIEW OF OUR COUNTRY'S NATIONAL MONUMENTS, WHICH COULD "OPEN THEM TO DRILLING, MINING, AND LOGGING." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) NO, GUYS, GUYS, LOOK, HE'S JUST TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FINALLY FIND OUT HOW MUCH OIL IS IN LINCOLN'S EYEBALL. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP SPECIFICALLY HAS HIS EYES ON FEDERAL LAND IN UTAH WHERE OBAMA CREATED THE BEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT. WELL, LEAVE IT TO OBAMA TO NAME SOMETHING AFTER EARS. ( LAUGHTER ) HE HAD LARGE EARS. VERY NICE. THEY FIT HIS HEAD, THOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHILE IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL EXECUTIVE ORDER, TRUMP REALLY BELIEVES IN IT.
SOMETIMES I LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS I'M SIGNING.
STEPHEN: "SOMETIMES" HE LOOKS AT THE THINGS HE'S SIGNING? SOMETIMES? ( LAUGHTER ) JUST RANDOMLY? NOT ALL THE TIME? HAS ANYONE TRIED PUTTING A RESIGNATION LETTER IN FRONT OF HIM? IT'S WORTH A SHOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST SOMETIMES? ♪ COLD BLOODED ♪
Stephen: MAY GOD HELP US. I'M SORRY, GO ON, SIR.
I SAY, MAYBE PEOPLE WON'T LIKE IT, BUT I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND NO REGULAR POLITICIAN'S GOING TO DO-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FOLKS WOULD DO. I WILL TELL YOU, LITERALLY, SOME POLITICIANS HAVE SAID, "YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING." I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS, BUT WE'RE DOING THEM BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO, AND IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF THE NATION.
STEPHEN: SO, AFTER A LONG DEBATE WITH HIMSELF AND PEOPLE OFF-CAMERA WHO PROBABLY AREN'T THERE, TRUMP DUG DEEP AND FOUND THE COURAGE TO CALL HIMSELF COURAGEOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDES THANKING HIMSELF, TRUMP ALSO THANKED HIS OTHER SUPPORTERS AT THE CEREMONY.
I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY SO MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND GOVERNORS, WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT. GOVERNOR LEPAGE OF MAINE, WHO, BY THE WAY, HAS LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS HEAVY, AND NOW I KNOW HIM WHEN HE WAS THIN, AND I LIKE HIM BOTH WAYS, OKAY? ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
STEPHEN: OH, HE LIKES HIM BOTH WAYS. ♪ I LIKE 'EM FAT ♪ ♪ I LIKE 'EM PROUD ♪ ♪ MMM... MMM... MMM ♪
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN, THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS PLAYING THE GUITAR. ( APPLAUSE ) THE JOB OF REVIEWING OUR NATIONAL MONUMENTS FALLS TO SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR AND GUY WHO'S TRYING WAY TOO HARD TO LOOK OUTDOORSY, RYAN ZINKE. AND TRUMP KNOWS WHY ZINKE IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB.
SECRETARY RYAN ZINKE IS DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. SOON AFTER HE WAS CONFIRMED, WE HAD A SNOWSTORM, BIG ONE, AND HE WAS OUT THERE ON THE STEPS OF THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL SHOVELING THE SNOW ALL BY HIMSELF, AND HE'S A STRONG GUY. HE DID A GOOD JOB.
Stephen: REALLY? REALLY? THAT'S WHAT TRUMP THINKS THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR'S JOB IS? THEN FORGET ZINKE, HE SHOULD'VE APPOINTED TORO POWERMAX 826. BUT EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY, YOU GUYS, BECAUSE OBAMA'S BACK, BABY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ON MONDAY, BARACK OBAMA DID A FORUM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND HE WAS FIRED UP AND READY TO GO... GIVE A SPEECH TODAY TO INVESTMENT BANKERS FOR $400,000. SO HILLARY WASN'T ABLE TO CONTINUE OBAMA'S LEGACY, BUT AT LEAST OBAMA WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE HERS. ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, GOOD FOR HIM. GOOD FOR HIM. HE'S OUT OF OFFICE, TIME TO CASH IN, BUT, MAN, $400,000? WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY, YOU COULD JOIN MAR-A-LAGO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. L.L. COOL J IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL TELL YOU MY LATEST MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. RIGHT OVER THERE! COME ON! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, I'M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT OUR GUESTS TONIGHT LL COOL J.
Jon: MM-HMM! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S NOT JUST THE LADIES WHO LOVES COOL JAMES. EVERYBODY LOVES COOL JAMES OUT THERE. I'M ALSO EXCITED BECAUSE TOMORROW NIGHT WE HAVE MR. TOM HANKS ON THE SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE TALK ABOUT RELIGION FROM TIME TO TIME ON THIS SHOW BECAUSE I'M HOPING TO GET THIS THEATER RECOGNIZED AS A CHURCH FOR TAX PURPOSES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS STORY: THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY EXPANDED ITS LIST OF RECOGNIZED RELIGIONS FROM JUST OVER 100 TO 221. SO THERE MAY NOT BE ATHEISTS IN FOXHOLES, BUT NOW THERE ARE PAGANS, WICCANS, AND MEMBERS OF THE SCHWENKFELDER CHURCHES, SCHWENKFELDERIANS, WHICH IS A CROSS BETWEEN AMISH AND JERRY LEWIS. "SCHWENKFELDERIAN!" THE LADY WITH THE SIG OOH OOH DENHAGEN -- I DON'T SPEAK FLUENT LEWIS. ONE OF THE MILITARY'S NEWEST RECOGNIZED FAITHS IS HUMANISM, WHICH EMPHASIZES THE INHERENT VALUE OF HUMAN BEINGS -- YOU CAN IDENTIFY HUMANISTS BY THEIR SYMBOL, THE HAPPY HUMANIST! SEEN HERE BEING ROBBED BY THE ARAMARK LOGO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TAKE MY WALLET! I'VE GOT CHILDREN! LOOK HOW HAPPY THIS GUY IS. THERE IS NO GOD! THE STARS BLINDLY RUN! WE'LL NEVER SEE GRANDPA AGAIN! ( LAUGHTER ) NOW THEIR RELIGION, NOT MINE -- I KNOW GRANDPA'S WAITING FOR ME -- MY RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE MILITARY -- CATHOLICISM. BUT I DON'T PARTICIPATE IN ALL OF THE RICH TRADITIONS THAT I SHOULD. FOR INSTANCE, CONFESSION. BUT I LIKE TO GET THINGS OFF MY CHEST. SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
AUDIENCE: OF COURSE NOT!
STEPHEN: GREAT. THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) STANDARD DISCLAIMER -- I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, WAIT RIGHT THERE. ( ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY IN THE BACKGROUND ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE. WHEN I'M AT MCDONALDS, I ALWAYS CASUALLY SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THROW AN ORDER OF FRIES IN THERE!" EVEN THOUGH I'D BEEN PLANNING ON FRIES ALL ALONG. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, WHEN I "THROW MY HANDS IN THE AIR LIKE I JUST DON'T CARE," I ACTUALLY CARE VERY DEEPLY. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE -- WHILE I WISH HER WELL, I DO NOT CARE ABOUT APRIL THE GIRAFFE. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST NEVER GOT INTO IT. AUDIENCE, USUALLY, WHEN WE DO CONFESSIONS, I COME UP WITH AN EXCUSE TO DRINK LIQUOR BACK HERE, BUT I COULDN'T THINK OF ONE THIS WEEK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HAVE NEVER FILLED OUT A BIRTHDAY CARD ANYWHERE OTHER THAN THE BATHROOM OF THE RESTAURANT WHERE WE'RE CELEBRATING YOUR BIRTHDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, YOU KNOW HOW ON AIRPLANES, THEY HAVE THAT "SECURE YOUR OXYGEN MASK BEFORE HELPING OTHERS" RULE? I DON'T NEED TO BE TOLD THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNTIL I GOT MARRIED, I ONCE WENT 11 YEARS WITHOUT CHANGING MY SHEETS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) AT PARTIES, I'M A BIG FAN OF THE IRISH GOODBYE. BUT I'M AN EVEN BIGGER FAN OF THE IRISH HELLO-- WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN SHOW UP. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE?
AUDIENCE: WE FORGIVE YOU!
STEPHEN: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH L.L. COOL J. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WOW! THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE CROWD. I MEAN, THEY CAME BACK FROM THAT COMMERCIAL JUST NOW AS IF THEY HAD JUST REHEARSED IT. UNBELIEVABLE.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A MULTI-PLATINUM MUSICIAN WHO, FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, HAS BEEN SOLVING CRIMES ON "NCIS: LOS ANGELES."
LOOKS LIKE HE WAS GETTING RID OF EVIDENCE.
EVIDENCE OF WHAT? GOLD HEISTS. SO COMES DOWN HERE, THEY FIRE AT HIM, HE TAKES THEM OUT.
SECOND COMES FROM BEHIND, CATCHES HIM BY SURPRISE.
A HIT? MAYBE. TWO FUEL CANS, TWO VEHICLES.
AND ONLY ONE BODY.
Stephen: THAT MEANS THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE HERE.
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME L.L. COOL J! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
OKAY!
Stephen: I LIKE HOW YOU GAVE A LITTLE KNOCK OUT TO THE CAMERA THERE.
TOUCHED IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: I HAD NOT MET YOU TILL TWO MONTHS AGO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TILL WE SAT EACH OTHER.
AMERICAN SONG BOOK GALA.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU ON TALK SHOWS FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN DID YOU DO MOMMA SAID KNOCK YOU OUT.
IN THE '90s.
Stephen: I SAW YOU ON DAVE LETTERMAN DO THAT.
THAT'S FUNNY.
Stephen: I SAID, THAT GUY IS COOL FOR A REASON.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN COOL SINCE THE '80s. HOW DO YOU KEEP COOL FOR SO LONG? A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSE THEIR COOL AT THIS AGE.
IF I REALLY TRIED TO ANSWER THAT, I WOULD BE UNCOOL IMMEDIATELY, RIGHT?
Stephen: YOU CAN'T NAME -- I AM SO COULIBA -- I AM SO COOL, COOL, COOL! LOOK! IT'S A BIRD, A PLANE, NO, COUNT COOL, COOL, COOL! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: FIRST ALBUM WAS -- 1985.
Stephen: OKAY. BECAUSE MY PRODUCER LOOKED THIS UP AND HE SAID THE SAME YEAR YOU RELEASED YOUR FIRST ALBUM -- WHEN WERE YOU BORN, JOHN?
$86.
Stephen: DAMN IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE FIRST YEAR YOU RELEASED THIS ALBUM, THE NUMBER ONE SONG WAS WE BUILT THIS CITY. NOW HUMBLE.
SIT DOWN, BE HUMBLE!
Stephen: ARE YOU SURPRISED HOW HIP-HOP CHANGED THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE? DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF IT BACK THEN?
NO, IF I KNEW ALL I KNOW NOW I WOULD HAVE TRADEMARKED A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF, RIGHT? BUT -- ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THAT'S THE REAL ANSWER, RIGHT? I CAN GIVE YOU THE TV ANSWER AND THE REAL ANSWER. THE REAL ANSWER IS I WAS MAKING WAY MORE MONEY NOW BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. YOU KNOW, I HAD NO IDEA BUT IT WAS ALWAYS BIG IN MY WORLD. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO SUCCEED AT ANYTHING, YOU HAVE TO BE OBSESSED WITH IT, YOU HAVE TO LOVE IT, YOU HAVE TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. FOR ME AND THE GUYS IN MY COMMUNITY AND FRIENDS GROWING UP IN QUEENS, YOU KNOW, HIP-HOP WAS THE BIGGEST THING IN THE WORLD. SO, YOU KNOW, I DID NOTICE A CHANGE. WHEN I STARTED SEEING, LIKE, SILVER-HAIRED LADIES IN MONTANA WRAPPING WHILE -- RAPPING WHILE THEY DID MOP AND GLOW, AND THE KIDS IN THE BACKGROUND, I KNEW THINGS HAD CHANGED, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THE LANDSCAPE ALTERED A LITTLE BIT. WHEN IOWA IS LIKE, L.L.! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE FIRST TOURING AND LEFT QUEENS, WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO GO OUT OF THE AREA WHERE HIP-HOP WAS KNOWN.
WHEN I WAS 16 OR 17 WE FIRST WENT TO MAINE ON TOUR, I HAD TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE WHAT HIP-HOP WAS AND WHAT WE WERE DOING. THIS IS THE DEEJAY, HE HAS TWO RECORDS. HE'S GOING TO EXTEND THE BREAK BY MIXING THE RECORDS BACK AND FORTH AND I'M GOING TO RHYME ON TOP OF IT. WHEN I SAY, PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR. WHEN I SAY, HO, YOU SAY --
AUDIENCE:  HO! THEY DIDN'T CATCH ON THAT QUICK. KENDRID GOES OUT AND TOURS AND SAYS, I'M AN ARTIST! BUT I HAD TO EXPLAIN.
Stephen: THE FELLA OUT THERE IS GONNA DO SOME POETRY --
IT WAS CRAZY, A DIFFERENT WORLD. AND THEY WERE WHITE.
Stephen: WELL, THE BIGGEST PART OF THE HIP-HOP AUDIENCE IS STILL WHITE, WHITE SUBURBAN BOYS? ISN'T THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR THE MOST HIP-HOP MUSIC?
YEAH, MILLIONS OF LITTLE M&Ms RUNNING AROUND.
Stephen: GOD BLESS 'EM EVERY ONE.
I LOVE 'EM. THEY BOUGHT MY RECORDS.
Stephen: SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY FOR THAT EARRING.
THAT'S A GIFT.
Stephen: AN ENGAGEMENT PRESENT?
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK I COULD PULL THAT OFF.
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED. IF PEOPLE THINK YOU'VE GOT A CHECK, YOU CAN PULL ANYTHING OFF. YOU CAN WEAR CINDERELLA'S DIAMOND SLIPPERS AND THEY SAY, OH, YEAH, THE STYLE, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE I WOULD START WITH THE DIAMOND STUFF TO COOL MYSELF UP.
YOU'RE ALREADY COOL. YOU'RE ALREADY COOL. YOU'RE ALREADY COOL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IS THAT THE TV ANSWER OR THE REAL ANSWER?
NO --
Stephen: IT'S CBS, I WANT TO MAKE SURE.
GEEKS ARE PEOPLE, TOO, RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.
I'M A CLASSIC GEEK. THAT'S WHY I NAMED MYSELF LL COOL J. THOUGH PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST RHYME YOU EVER WROTE.
I VAGUELY REMEMBER IT.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THIS HAPPENED?
I STARTED WRITING AROUND 11 OR 12, SONGS, RHYMES. THE RHYME WAS A MYSTERIOUS AREUS AROUND COOL JAY GIVES A TOUCH OF DISMAY, I COULD BLOW OUT A CANDLE FROM A MILE AWAY. I COULD SNAP MY FINGERS, FLY THROUGH THE AIR. I'M NOT A MUTE, NO MUTATION, MY RAP IS STRANGE, CREATE SO MUCH POWER IT BOILS YOUR BRAINS. YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AND YOU HAD TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE MAINE-ERS.
OH, YEAH, THE MAINE-ERS, IF IT AIN'T GOLF AND LOBSTER, BABY, YOU IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: "NCIS," HOW MANY SEASONS?
FINISHING UP THE EIGHTH SEASON. THE FINALE IS REALLY DRAMATIC. CHRIS O'DONNELL, GREAT GUY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO D.V.R. IT IF YOU CAN'T WATCH IT LIVE. IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY DRAMATIC AND FUN SHOW.
Stephen: EIGHTH SEASON, "NCIS: LOS ANGELES," SO MUCH CRIME. SO MUCH NAVAL CRIME IN LOS ANGELES.
HEAVY BODY COUNT. HEAVY BODY COUNT. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW MANY CHARACTERS, EACH CHARACTER HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY'VE DISPOSED OF. BUT, YEAH, I'VE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE.
Stephen: COULD YOU GO TO A CRIME SCENE RIGHT NOW AND BE, LIKE, I'VE GOT THIS ONE, OFFICERS?
I THINK I KNOW THE STEPS, I HAVE A LITTLE BACKWARD INDUCTION, LIKE, START WHERE YOU WANT TO END UP AND REVERSE ENGINEER THE SITUATION.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT CALLED ENTRAPMENT?
MAYBE IN VEGAS. ( LAUGHTER ) VEGAS IS FUNNY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, PROBABLY DNA, YOU KNOW, LOOKING, YEAH, I PROBABLY COULD SOLVE A CRIME. THAT'S PROBABLY WEIRD.
Stephen: I'D WATCH A SHOW WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO SOLVE A CRIME.
A REALITY SHOW.
Stephen: YOU TAKE ALL THE DIFFERENT PRORLDS ON TV AND WE TAKE THE GUY, THEM "LAW AND ORDER" PEOPLE, AND PUT YOU TOGETHER TO SOLVE A CRIME.
WOULD TAKE 14 YEARS TO SOLVE A CRIME. EPISODE ---, GOT 'EM! I HAVE "NCIS" AGENTS SAYING, YOU'RE MAKING US LOOK BAD, SOLVING THESE CASES IN AN HOUR AND A HALF.
Stephen: I GOT READ IN FOR A JURY AND THEY SAID PLEASE DON'T THINK WHAT WE'LL GIVE YOU IS "NCIS," NO CAMERA FLYING UP SOMEBODY'S KNOWS, NO DNA SWAB, THEY WERE REALLY MAD AT PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON THESE SHOWS.
THAT'S RIGHT. I REPRESENT THE MILITARY, I REPRESENT ALL THE PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINES. I WENT TO CAMP PENDLETON AND MET THE SAILORS SO I COULD REPRESENT THE MILITARY IN A COOL WAY. IT'S COOL.
Stephen: THANKS FOR REPRESENTING HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU! "NCIS: LOS ANGELES" AIRS SUNDAYS AT 8:00 ON CBS. L.L. COOL J, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH STAR OF "HAMILTON" AND NOW "AMILIE" ON BROADWAY, PHILLIPA SOO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY NEXT GUEST ORIGINATED THE ROLE OF ELIZA IN "HAMILTON." SHE NOW STARS IN "AMEÉLIE" ON BROADWAY. PLEASE WELCOME PHILLIPA SOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON "AMEÉLIE" STARTING ON BROADWAY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: SO MANY CONGRATULATIONS IN ORDER FOR SOMEONE OF YR TENDER YEARS. YOU'RE 26 YEARS OLD.
YES.
Stephen: GRADUATED FROM JUILLIARD IN 2012.
WITH ONE OF THESE GUYS, WITH YVONDA! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LOVELY FELLAS. THEY'RE GREAT.
Stephen: THE SAME YEAR, YOU WERE IN THE GREAT COMEDY OF 1812. MIRANDA SAW YOU THERE. HE CAST YOU IN THE BROADWAY CAST, NOMINATED FOR A TONY AND NOW STARRING IN "AMEÉLIE" ON BROAD WAY. ARE YOU SORRY YOU LOST ALL THE YOUNG YEARS BECAUSE AT 26 I WAS STILL PUTTING CRACKED PEPPER ON SALADS.
I HAVE YET TO WORK A RESTAURANT JOB.
Stephen: THEY'RE WONDERFUL. I KNOW ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME DRINKING BEERS ON MY FIRE ESCAPE WONDERING WHEN IS SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN? AND IT HAPPENED A LOT SOONER.
Stephen: WEDNESDAY. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A WILD RIDE AND QUITE AWESOME.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON "HAMILTON," FIRST OF ALL. AN EXTRAORDINARY MUSICAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNBELIEVABLE. I THINK IT PROBABLY CHANGED PEOPLE'S EXPECTATION OF I THINK THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF A BROADWAY SHOW OR WHAT'S IN THERE. DO YOU THINK IT'S CHANGED PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS OF HOW HIP THE BROADWAY SHOW NEEDS TO BE?
OH, YEAH. I FEEL LIKE IT WAS SO GREAT ON SO MANY LEVELS AND THERE WAS KIND OF A SAYING FLOATING AROUND THE THEATER WHICH IT'S A TRAIN AND YOU CAN JUMP ON IT AT ANY POINT WHETHER YOU'RE A LOVER OF MUSICAL THEATER OR HIP-HOP OR HISTORY. THERE WAS, LIKE, A WAY TO JUMP ON THE TRAIN, AND I THINK WHAT WAS MOST SURPRISING WAS THAT THERE WERE SO MANY KIDS WHO JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS SCORE AND WITH LYNN'S MUSIC AND THIS STORY, AND THAT WAS SUPER INSPIRING.
IN 1985, IF YOU HAD DONE THIS MUSICAL, YOU WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE IN MAINE WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT TO DO BEFORE YOU DID THE MUSICAL. ( LAUGHTER ) I GOT THIS PHOTO SHORTLY BEFORE THE SHOW. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? IS THIS AN EARLY PRODUCTION OFF OFF OFF BROADWAY THAT YOU'RE PART OF?
THAT'S OFF OFF OFF OFF OFF BROADWAY IN LIL' LIL'.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU IN THIS PHOTO HERE?
THREE OR FOUR. PROBABLY THREE.
Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU CAST YOURSELF IN HERE?
IT LOOKS LIKE THE MAGICAL HEADBAND DINOSAUR EXTRAVAGANZA, FROM WHAT I CAN SEE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IS THAT HOW YOU STARTED, JUST SINGING AROUND THE HOUSE?
YES, I DID. I WOULD PUT ON SHOWS FOR MY FAMILY AND ANYBODY WHO WAS AROUND. THE HOUSE WAS THE HOUSE WE MOVED INTO AND WE WERE HAVING A LOT OF WORK DONE, AND WHEN WE WERE PAINTING HOUSE, THE PAINTERS WERE THERE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND I DECIDED ONE DAY TO JUST PUT ON MY TUTU AND JUMP ON THE COFFEE TABLE AND SING ARETHA FRANKLIN SONGS FOR THE PAINTERS WHO WERE PAINTING HOUSE.
Stephen: WOW. LIKE WHAT SONGS? WHAT WAS YOUR GO-TO ARETHA?
DEFINITE "THINK" BECAUSE BEING FROM "CHICAGO" WE LOVED "THE BLUES BROTHERS" AND I LOVED THAT SCENE.
Stephen: DID YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS?
I DIDN'T KNOW THE WORDS.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SING A SONG WITHOUT KNOWING THE WORDS?
YOU HAVE YOUR MARKERS. YOU HAVE THE BEGINNING AND END. YOU WOULD BE LIKE ♪ ♪ THINK ♪ ♪ THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME ♪ ♪ PEOPLE GO AROUND EVERY DAY -- MUMBLING -- YEAH, THINK ♪
YOU KNEW THE WORD "THINK" HAD TO BE IN THERE.
Stephen: THROW IT IN THERE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN.
YES, AND I'M PERFORMING THIS SONG TO THE FULLEST OF MY ABILITIES.
Stephen: IN HAMILTON, I'M TALKING TO THE CAST MEMBERS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME TO THE SHOW BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED TO SEE THE SHOW. WERE THERE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO COME BACKSTAGE AND OTHER PERFORMERS WHO CAME TO SEE YOU AND YOU SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT TO MEET THIS PERSON?
THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. THE MOST GEEKED OUT MOMENT I HAD WAS WITH JULIE ANDREWS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S THE SOUND YOU MAKE WHEN SHE WALKS INTO THE ROOM.
EXACTLY. LYNN WOULD DO THIS THING. I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T LIKE TO KNOW WHO WAS THERE BEFORE WE PERFORMED. LIN, WHEN WE WOULD EXIT THE STAGE, HE WOULD SAY, LIKE, STEPHEN COLBERT IS HERE! THEN WE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM ME. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN THAT EVENING HE SAID, JULIE ANDREWS IS HERE AND I WENT -- GASPS -- SHE'S REALLY HERE? I WOULD SINGING SPOON FULL OF SUGAR, SO EXCITED TO MEET HER. WHEN I FINALLY GOT DOWN TO THE STAGE TO MEET HER, I COULDN'T STOP SMILING, MY CHEEKS WERE HURTING I WAS SMILING SO MUCH. I DIDN'T WANT TO STOP SMILING.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T AROUND HERE.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: IT'S EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT JULIE ANDREWS TO BE AND MORE.
SHE'S SO POISED AND BEAUTIFUL AND A GIFT TO US ALL IN TERMS OF AN ARTIST, RIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Stephen: THE NEW PLAY AT THE WALTER KERR IS "AMEÉLIE." YOU CALLED THIS A LOVE LETTER TO THEATER.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT YOU LOVE ABOUT THTHEATER ITSELF?
I LOVE THE COMMUNITY ASPECT. WHAT'S SO GREAT IS NOT ONLY MY COLLABORATIONS I GET TO HAVE IN THE ROOM CREATING THE THING, BUT ALSO THE COLLABORATION I GET TO HAVE WITH THE COMMUNITY I'M SHARING IT WITH.
Stephen: THE AUDIENCE, YOU MEAN?
YEAH, THE AUDIENCE. IT'S A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE. WE'RE ALL THERE COMING FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS HAVING THIS ONE EXPERIENCE, AND I THINK THAT'S THE POWER OF THEATER IS IT CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TRULY.
Stephen: I AGREE. AS I TOLD THE AUDIENCE, I LIKE DOING TO SHOW FOR THE AUDIENCE BUT I LOVE DOING THE SHOW WITH THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER.
YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >
