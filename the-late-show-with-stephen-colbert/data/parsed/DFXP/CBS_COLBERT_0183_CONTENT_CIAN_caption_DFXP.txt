Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES ALLISON JANNEY, ANTHONY WEINER AND RYAN ADAMS FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION -- DEATH, TAXES, HILLARY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY! DEATH, TAXES AND HILLARY! HEY, EVERYBODY! (AUDIENCE CHANTING) HI, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S NICE! THANKS! WHAT'S GOING ON? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! I'M STEPHEN COLBERT! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AT OUR SHADOW CONVENTION IN NEW YORK CITY. JUST MOMENTS AGO IN PHILADELPHIA, BERNIE SANDERS ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON. IT WAS AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH, BUT DISAPPOINTED MANY SUPPORTERS. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MANY CRYING WOMEN SINCE BERNIE OPENED FOR THE BEATLES. (LAUGHTER) ON THE STAGE, ACTUALLY.
Jon: IT WAS RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LIVE ON NIGHT ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH, LIVE! LIVE! ALSO KNOWN AS HILLARY CLINTON AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE ON FRIDAY, WIKILEAKS RELEASED EMAILS PROVING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE WAS CONSPIRING AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS. IN AN UNPRECEDENTED SHOW OF BIAS, THE DEMOCRATS THREW THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND THE REGISTERED DEMOCRAT. IT'S NOT FAIR. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE SAM'S CLUB REFUSING TO TAKE YOUR BLOCKBUSTER CARD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IN ONE LEAKED EMAIL, A D.N.C. STAFFER SUGGESTS ATTACKING SANDERS' FAITH, WONDERING "...CAN WE GET SOMEONE TO ASK HIS BELIEF? DOES HE BELIEVE IN A GOD. HE HAD SKATED ON SAYING HE HAS A JEWISH HERITAGE. I THINK I READ HE IS AN ATHEIST. THIS COULD MAKE SEVERAL POINTS DIFFERENCE WITH MY PEEPS." (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, PEEPS ARE VERY RELIGIOUS. (LAUGHTER) THOSE LITTLE MARSHMALLOW CHICKS NEVER MISS AN EASTER SUNDAY. (LAUGHTER) NOW, SOME OF THE EMAILS ARE LESS -- 19,000 E-MAILS WERE RELEASED. SOME ARE LESS DAMNING, SUCH AS THIS ONE WITH THE SUBJECT LINE "TINY SUGGESTION" THAT READS-- AND THIS IS TRUE: "EAT MY BUTT." (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, HEY... HEY, WHO HASN'T ARGUED OVER OFFICE EMAIL ABOUT WHERE TO GET LUNCH? (LAUGHTER) THE RESPONSE WAS AN ALL-CAPS REBUKE, "CLAYTON"! IT'S CLAYTON! THE OL' OFFICE "EAT MY BUTT" GUY! SURE, IT'S VULGAR, DISGUSTING, AND CRUDE, BUT IT'S THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT THE DEMOCRATS CAN TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BERNIE'S SUPPORTERS HAVE LONG ACCUSED THE D.N.C. AND THEIR CHAIRWOMAN DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ OF PRO-HILLARY BIAS, AND NOW THAT THESE EMAILS HAVE BEEN LEAKED, WASSERMAN SCHULTZ IS IN DEEP... UH, WHAT'S THE WORD?
DOO DOO.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU. THAT HAS LEFT A BAD TASTE IN PEOPLE'S MOUTHS. AND HERE'S HOW MUCH THE DEMOCRATS DON'T GET IT. YESTERDAY, WASSERMAN SCHULTZ SAID SHE PLANS TO STEP DOWN AT THE END OF THE CONVENTION. WHAT? THAT'S LIKE PEOPLE FINDING OUT THAT THERE'S A TURD IN THE PUNCH BOWL AND TELLING THEM, "DON'T WORRY, WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE TURD AS SOON AS THE PARTY'S OVER. UNTIL THEN, DRINK UP! I PROMISE! WE'RE TALKING OF, AT MOST, FOUR DAYS OF TURD PUNCH." ENJOY YOURSELF. (LAUGHTER) THERE WERE SOME ROUGH FEELINGS WHEN THE DAY BEGAN. BY EARLY EVENING, THINGS HAD SEEMED TO CALM DOWN-- AND THEN BERNIE SUPPORTER SARAH SILVERMAN AND HILLARY SUPPORTER AL FRANKEN TOOK THE STAGE,   AND SILVERMAN GOT A LITTLE TIRED OF THE CROWD.
TO THE BERNIE OR BUST PEOPLE: YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS. (AUDIENCE ROARS)
STEPHEN: WOW. IT'S RARE WHEN THE COMEDIAN HECKLES THE AUDIENCE. (LAUGHTER) I LOVE SARAH. I'M GLAD SARAH SAID SOMETHING. BERNIE SUPPORTERS ARE KNOWN TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO STRONG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SHOUT OUT TO MY BROS!
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT SPEECHES TONIGHT, BUT LEAVE IT TO MICHELLE OBAMA TO TRULY UNIFY THE DEMOCRATS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: INCREDIBLE SPEECH.
Stephen: WITH TONIGHT'S SPEECH, SHE CONVINCED EVERYONE IN THAT ARENA THAT IT WAS FINALLY TIME TO ELECT, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FORMER FIRST LADY: MICHELLE OBAMA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE WAS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THAT PLACE, THEY WERE CHEERING SO HARD. IT WAS A VERY PERSONAL SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HER LIFE, LIFE OF HER HUSBAND AND WHAT THE GOALS OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WERE AND MADE A MOVING CASE FOR WHAT HER HUSBAND'S TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE HAS MEANT TO THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA.
NOT JUST TO OUR GIRLS, BUT THE CHILDREN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. KIDS WHO TELL US, I SAW YOU ON TV, I WROTE A REPORT ON YOU FOR SCHOOL. KIDS LIKE THE LITTLE BLACK BOY WHO LOOKED UP AT MY HUSBAND, HIS EYES WIDE WITH HOPE AND HE WONDERED, IS MY HAIR LIKE YOURS? (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: THE ONLY BOY WHO'S EVER SAID THAT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS HERMEY THE ELF WHO WANTED TO BE A DENTIST. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYWAY, MICHELLE'S SPEECH WAS SO GOOD, I WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN. WHEN IS MELANIA'S NEXT SPEECH? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STICK AROUND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, WITH MY SPECIAL VISIT TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. IT'S LIKE THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR POWER! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU, JON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! WELCOME BACK TO OUR LIVE COVERAGE -- IF WE CAN CALL IT THAT, OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. WHY NOT? NOBODY'S GOING TO SUE ME. ALL RIGHT. TODAY, THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION LAUNCHED WITH  THOSE LEAKED THE RESIGNATION OF DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I  WHY THERE MORE OF THAT TODAY. WHY DIDN'T THEY DEAL WITH ALL THAT YESTERDAY? WELL, MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. (LAUGHTER) TRUTH BE TOLD, YESTERDAY I WENT DOWN TO PHILLY TO BASK IN THE COMING CONFLICT. IT'S A BLOODSPORT. IT'S LIKE THE "HUNGER GAMES." NO, IT'S WORSE. IT'S!
AUDIENCE: HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES!
STEPHEN: CALIGULA, WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. FINALLY, A CHANCE FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO PROVE TO THE BERNIE DELEGATES THAT SHE IS NOT  NKS.D WHAT BETTER PLACE THAN THE WELLS FARGO ARENA! OOOH, DELICIOUS, LETS GO!

(LAUGHTER) HERE AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE RUGS ARE ALL BLUE. SO YOU'LL NOTICE THE CARPET DOES MATCH THE DRAPES, AND MY PUBIC HAIR! ITS BRIGHT BLUE! I'M REALLY QUITE CONCERNED. (LAUGHTER) OH, THE ACOUSTICS ARE WONDERFUL IN HERE! "LOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP!" OH, THEY'RE GOOD! OH, THAT REALLY RINGS! OH, THAT REALLY RINGS! JAKE, JAKE, YOU MIGHT KNOW, HAVE YOU SEEN CHUCK TODD?

STEPHEN: OH, ITS GOT A MIND OF ITS OWN. OH! LET'S GET A PREVIEW OF HILLARY'S SPEECH-- "THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE FONT AND SIZE OF THE TEXT. THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE FONT AND SIZE OF THE TEXT." AND THEY SAY SHE'S ROBOTIC. I DON'T UNDERSTAND! (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, CALIGULA, GET THE SCENT-- GET THE SCENT... AND, GO! FIND THE EMAILS!

Stephen: COME ON! YOU KNOW, I HEAR FROM PEOPLE THAT GOOD. YOU REALLY SHOULD BE WATCHINGLF.
I DON'T ENJOY -- I ENJOY THE PROCESS OF ACTING. I DON'T WANT TO WATCH MYSELF DO IT, NO, NO. NO. AS I GET OLDER, IT'S HARDER TO WATCH MYSELF ACT AND THE NIBBLES AND BITS THAT ARE, YOU KNOW --
Stephen: I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, THE WHAT?

Stephen: WOW, LOOK AT THE NIBBLES ON THAT WOMAN AND THE NOOKS AND CRANNIES FOR THE BUTTER TO COLLECT IN! YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOURSELF AS A THOMAS' ENGLISH MUFFIN.
I WAS GOING TO DO A SPIT TAKE.
Stephen: OH, THAT WOULD BE FUN. GREAT.
I SHOULD HAVE KEPT THAT FOR BALANCE.
Stephen: FOR A TAN? NO, WHEN I WAS DOING "THE WEST WING," I WAS ASKED FOR AN EXTRA SHEET OF PAPER FOR THE BOUNCE.
Stephen: LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS. THIS IS ME WITHOUT ANY BOUNCE, NO BOUNCE. I'M BEAUTIFUL.
SEE? (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOU TALKING ABOUT? PLAUSE)

SHE COMES BACK WITH A BABY AND SAYS IT'S MY GRAND CHILD. I'M WEARY AND NOT TRUSTING HER BUT I LET HER INTO MY LIFE. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE, VERY FUNNY, VERY TOUCHING, GREAT ACTING AND STORYTELLING. I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO NOMINATED FOR TWO EMMYS. GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF THOSE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU STUDIED THE ACTORS PLAY HOUSE.
NEIGHBORHOOD PLAYS.
Stephen: MY APOLOGIES. AND YOU SAID YOU LIKE TO DO ACTING EXERCISES?
YES, WITH NURSERY RIMES OR SONG LYRICS.
Stephen: AND YOU ACTUALLY TAKE THIS FROM SORT OF SEXY, LIKE HAIR BAND SONG LYRICS?
'70s SONG LISH LYRICS ARE ESPECIALLY FUN.
Stephen: LAST TIME WE DID "HOT BLOODED" BY FOREIGNER. I'D LIKE TO DO IT WITH YOU NOW. THIS IS BON JOVI'S BAD MEDICINE AND WE'LL TRY TO ACT IT WITH EACH OTHER AND, OBVIOUSLY, I'LL TAKE YOUR LEAD. AND, SCENE.
YOUR LOVE IS LIKE BAD MEDICINE. BAD MEDICINE IS WHAT I NEED.
Stephen: WHOA! SHAKE IT UP, JUST LIKE BAD MEDICINE.
HA HA HA, THERE AIN'T NO DOCTOR THAT CAN CURE MY DISEASE.
Stephen: BAD MEDICINE? I AIN'T GOT A FEVER. GOT A PERMANENT DISEASE AND IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A DOCTOR TO PRESCRIBE REMEDY.
Stephen: I GOT LOTS OF MONEY.
BUT IT ISN'T WHAT I NEED. GONNA TAKE MORE THAN A SHOT TO GET THIS POISON OUT OF ME. HUH, AND I GOT ALL THE SYMPTOMS, COUNT THEM, ONE, TWO, THREE.
Stephen: OKAY. FIRST YOU NEED, THEN YOU BLEED, THEN WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR KNEES --
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR FALLING IN LOVE.

Stephen: TALLULAH AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX THIS FRIDAY, EVERYBODY! ALLISON JANNEY! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪

Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WHERE IS THE NEW YORK DELEGATION? WHERE IS THE OFFICEPLACE SCANDAL? I FIGURED I'D PIERCE THE WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: GOOD. WHAT DID YOU PIERCE IT WITH? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DID YOU WATCH BACKSTAGE? DID YOU? I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, I WASN'T GOING TO BRING IT UP, BUT THANK YOU. BACKSTAGE, DID YOU WATCH THE CONVENTION?
I DID.
Stephen: ARE YOU STILL A DEMOCRAT?
OF COURSE.
Stephen: THEY LET YOU KEEP YOUR CARD AND EVERYTHING?
YEAH. ALTHOUGH THEY SAID I CAN'T WEAR A TIE AND FLAG LAPEL PIN ANYMORE. EVERYTHING ELSE, I CAN STILL DO.
Stephen: OKAY. DID BERNIE SANDERS DO WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO IN HIS SPEECH TO TURN THE TIED.
DID GREAT.
Stephen: CAN YOU -- CAN I TRUST ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S CLOSEST ADVISOR.
HILLARY PEOPLE MOSTLY LOVED BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS AND BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS LOVED HILLARY.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT TRUE. I WAS DOWN IN THERE. I RAN INTO BERNIE PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN AND I SAID, IS THERE GOING TO BE UNITY? THEY SAID, NO.
THEY WANT NATIONAL HEALTH CARE, HILLARY WANTS THAT. THEY HAVE TO A 15 MINIMUM WAGE, HILLARY WANTS THAT. ARE WE GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP?
Stephen: OR NOT VOTE. THAT'S A VOTE FOR A RACIST, NARCISSIST ANTI-SEMITE.
Stephen: HE CONTRIBUTED FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT HIM IN.
NO. BUT LET'S REALIZE SOMETHING HERE. FOR THE MOST PART, THE THINGS THAT BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS WANT, THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO GET WITH HILLARY CLINTON. I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT DUMB PEOPLE. THEY ARE DONATING MONEY, GOING TO RALLIES, ADVOCATING FOR ISSUES. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AND VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, REALISTICALLY, THEY'RE NOT. THEY DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING THEY WANTED. I CRIED WHEN HILLARY CLINTON LOST TO BARACK OBAMA. I MEAN, I WAS LIKE THAT LAST GUY LIKE THE CHINESE GUY IN FRONT OF THE TANK. I WAS THE LAST PERSON TO ENDORSE OBAMA. BUT, I MEAN, NOW, YOU'VE SEEN EIGHT YEARS, YOU'VE SEEN EIGHT YEARS OF REMARKABLE GROWTH, OF A COUNTRY THAT IS NOT -- YOU KNOW, TO HEAR DONALD TRUMP TALK, YOU'D THINK WE LIVE IN A LOUSY COUNTRY. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU AND THE MAIN STREAM IMMEDIATE CANNIA THAT GIVE HIM SO MUCH OXYGEN. (AUDIENCE BOOING)
Stephen: REALLY? I'M MAINSTREAM MEDIA? I TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. I'M MAIN STREAM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN) THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WE'VE GOT TO GO. WE'RE LIVE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE TO HAVE THE D.N.C. -- WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE D.N.C. WIKI LEAK THING THAT CAME OUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A BIG FAN OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA? DO YOU THINK THIS IS A FAIR THING FOR THE PRESS TO BE TALK ABOUT?
I DON'T LIKE THIS TREND OF CRIMINALS HACKING INTO SONY OR THE D.N.C., LEAKING SELECTIVE THINGS, AND THEN WE JUST TREAT IT AS IF IT'S REGULAR NEWS AND WE GO ABOUT IT. LOOK, IF SOMEONE HACKED INTO YOUR E-MAILS, THEY COULD PROBABLY FIND SOMETHING, THEY COULD PROBABLY FIND MOST THINGS VERY EMBARRASSING THAT YOU SAY.
Stephen: SURE. I'M A POOR SPELLER. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THE D.N.C. IS IRRELEVANT. IT'S KIND OF LIKE MAKING A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE DURING THE WORLD SERIES. BASICALLY, IT'S IRRELEVANT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BECAUSE THE D.N.C. DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL AUTHORITY OVER ANYTHING. THIS WAS AN ELECTION THAT WENT FOR 50 STATES. HILLARY CLINTON, FRANKLY, DOMINATED THE ELECTION. SHE WON BY OVER 4 MILLION VOTES, GOT MORE DELEGATES, BUT ON THE ISSUES, I BERNIE SANDERS MADE HER A LOT THE D.N.C. HAD SUCH -- MOST EM ANDTHEM WHAT THE D.N.C. DOES, MEDED, WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE ABLELL YOU.
Stephen: THE E-MAILS SAY THEY ACTUALLY VET ARTICLES BY REPORTERS, THEY SELL STORIES TO DI--
NO.
Stephen:'M READING IT OFF AN ADMITTEDLY THROUGH ILL-GOTTEN BOOTY. TOTALLY FOR A TEAM BUT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SCORE.
THE SAME WAY THE COMMISSIONER IN BASEBALL MIGHT HAVE SPECULATION, IT'S BETTER FOR RATINGS IF THE L.A. DODGERS IS  THE WORLD SERIES THAN MINNESOTAWINS, THAT ON MIGHT GO, I DON'T HAVE A BEEF WITH THE MINNESOTA TWINS, YOU'RE RIGHT -- THAT TYPE OF THING MAY GO ON WITH ANONYMOUS STAFFERS ALL THE TIME. BERNIE SANDERS RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN, GOT A LOT OF VOTES, FRANKLY ALL THE RULES THE PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ARE MADE BY THE INDIVIDUAL STATES AND THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB CHOOSING NOMINEES. BARACK OBAMA GOT ELECTED THROUGH THE SYSTEM SO STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SYSTEM. YOUR CANDIDATE DID VERY WELL. WE ADOPTED A LOT OF BERNIE'S IDEAS, WE'RE A BETTER PARTY AND WILL GO ON TO WIN THE ELECTION. THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK! (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU'RE FROM QUEENS.
GREW UP IN BROOKLYN, REPRESENTED QUEENS.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR HILLARY? YOU'RE COMBATIVE, HE'S AGGRESSIVE. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO DEBATE TRUMP?
IF I WERE HILLARY, I WOULD YIELD ALL OF MY TIME TO DONALD TRUMP.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT JEB DID AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!
NO, LOOK, I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVER LOOKS AT THE TELEVISION SET WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING AND SAYS THAT LOOKS LIKE A PRESIDENT TO
Stephen: THERE ARE 40% ITH
THERE ARE 70% OF AMERICANS WHO THINK HE'S UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT. HE'S ACTUALLY A UNIFYING FORCE.
