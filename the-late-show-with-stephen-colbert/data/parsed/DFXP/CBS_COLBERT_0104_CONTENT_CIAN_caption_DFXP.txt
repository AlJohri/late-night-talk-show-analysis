STEPHEN: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW!" I AM STEPHEN COLBERT. THANKS, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! THANKS SO MUCH! WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! I AM STEPHEN COLBERT. AND NOT ONLY WOULD I LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO THE SHOW TONIGHT, BUT I'D LIKE TO OFFER A SPECIAL WELCOME TO ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY, WHO, YESTERDAY, RETURNED TO EARTH AFTER A RECORD 340 DAYS IN SPACE. CONGRATULATIONS, SCOTT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YA! BECAUSE HE WAS UP THERE FOR SO LONG, NASA IS NOW STUDYING THE EFFECTS THAT PROLONGED WEIGHTLESSNESS HAS ON THE HUMAN BODY-- AND, THIS IS FASCINATING -- HE RETURNED TWO INCHES TALLER THAN WHEN HE LEFT. HOPEFULLY, THAT EXTRA HEIGHT WILL GIVE THIS NAVY CAPTAIN AND ASTRONAUT SOME CONFIDENCE. (LAUGHTER) NOW THIS EXTRA TWO INCHES IS ONLY TEMPORARY, SO I JUST HOPE HE TAKES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ALLOWED ON ALL THE RIDES AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK. UNTIL HE SHRINKS, OKAY? THING IS, 340 DAYS IS A LONG TIME TO BE OFF-PLANET, AND RE-INTEGRATING WITH OUR CULTURE MIGHT COME AS A SHOCK. SO I WANT TO HELP SCOTT CATCH UP ON SOME OF THE THINGS HE MISSED IN THE LAST YEAR. SCOTT, MIGHT WANT TO WRITE SOME OF THIS DOWN, OKAY? FIRST OFF, THANKS TO TAYLOR SWIFT, WE'VE NOW LEARNED THAT GIRLS NOW TRAVEL IN WHAT ARE CALLED "SQUADS." IT'S LIKE A MURDER OF CROWS. A SQUAD OF GIRLS. SQUADS HAVE GOALS. MY GOAL IS TO BE IN A SQUAD. BACK IN JUNE, PEOPLE STARTED WHIPPING AND NAE-NAEING.
Jon: THAT WAS NICE.
Stephen: WHIP, NAE-NAE. AND NOW THAT I HAVE DONE IT, THEY HAVE STOPPED. EVERYONE IS NOW DOING SOMETHING CALLED "NETFLIX AND CHILL." OR, IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET, JUST "HULU AND HUMP." WHAT ELSE? OH, YOU REALLY DO NOT LIKE -- THERE IS A GREAT MOVIE CALLED "THE MARTIAN," REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN SPACE. AND JUST BEFORE YOU LANDED, IT WAS REVEALED THAT KATY PERRY IS DATING ORLANDO BLOOM. WE ARE THINKING OF GOING WITH KATE-LANDO BLOOM-BERRY. OH, AND OF COURSE THERE'S A PRESIDENTIAL RACE THIS YEAR! AND IT'S GOING...  GOOD. IT'S GOING GOOD. (LAUGHTER) DON'T LOOK IT UP. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU ARE BACK JUST IN TIME FOR THE GREAT SHOW WE HAVE FOR EARTH TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST, WE HAVE GOT BELOVED ACTOR AND STAR OF THE NEW SERIES "UNDERGROUND," CHRISTOPHER MELONI! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEN I'LL TALK TO THE MOST RECENT RECIPIENT OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR, NAVY SENIOR CHIEF EDWARD BYERS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM RAY LAMONTAGNE! ( BAND PLAYING ) HEY! GET DOWN! IT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY! ( APPLAUSE ) MY FAVORITE BAND! THEY'RE ABOUT TO LIGHT THIS FIRECRACKER, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: A MANHATTAN POLICE HORSE THREW ITS OFFICER TO THE GROUND AND RAN LOOSE FOR TEN MINUTES AFTER BEING SPOOKED BY A LOUD NOISE. OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN AS LONG AS NEW YORK CITY DOESN'T HAVE ANYMORE LOUD NOISES. ♪

Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GOT THAT THANG! I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS, BUT I COULD LISTEN TO THAT SONG TWICE IN A NIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SCOTT KELLY MAY HAVE MISSED A LOT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SO FAR, BUT THERE IS PLENTY MORE FOR HIM TO CATCH UP ON BECAUSE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, FIVE MORE STATES WILL WEIGH IN ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: MICHIGAN, OHIO, LOUISIANA, NEBRASKA AND FLORIDA. IN FLORIDA, THEY WILL CAST THEIR VOTES THE TRADITIONAL WAY, BY VOTING FOR WHOEVER LOOKS MORE LIKE THEIR GRANDSON. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN THEN, WE STILL WON'T EVEN BE HALFWAY THROUGH THE PRIMARY PROCESS. WHICH MEANS THIS IS THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE! ♪
I JUST WANT A JOB! JUST GET ME A JOB! ♪
Stephen: WELL, HE MIGHT GET ONE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S BIG WIN ON SUPER TUESDAY HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS THE LIKELY NOMINEE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THAT HAS SENT THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT INTO A PANIC. THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE WITH THIS GUY, BUT THE VOTERS ARE CHOOSING THIS. IT'S LIKE AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE. AND UNLIKE TRUMP'S OTHER MARRIAGES, THIS ONE COULD LAST EIGHT YEARS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THEY HAVE WOKEN UP IN BED WITH THIS GUY, BUT THEY'RE NOT TAKING IT LYING DOWN! (LAUGHTER) FOR INSTANCE, IF TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE, REPUBLICAN SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL VOWS THAT HIS COLLEAGUES WILL "DROP HIM LIKE A HOT ROCK." WHICH IS A HUGE SACRIFICE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS PART TORTOISE. THAT'S HIS FAVORITE BASKING SPOT! RIGHT THERE! AND, TODAY, IN A DESPERATE BID TO STOP TRUMP FROM GETTING THE NOMINATION, THEY TRIED A NEW APPROACH OF A VERY OLD APPROACH.
HERE'S WHAT I KNOW: DONALD TRUMP IS A PHONY, A FRAUD.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. FACED WITH A MONSTER, THE G.O.P. HAD ONLY ONE CHOICE.
"RELEASE THE ROMNEY!" (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: YES, THEY BROKE THE SEAL ON MITT'S HYPERBARIC DIGNITY CHAMBER, AND HE BROUGHT THE PAIN.
NOW, I'M FAR FROM THE FIRST TO CONCLUDE THAT DONALD TRUMP LACKS THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU SAY WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, ISN'T HE A HUGE BUSINESS SUCCESS? DOESN'T HE KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT? NO, HE ISN'T AND, NO, HE DOESN'T. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO TRUMP AIRLINES? HOW ABOUT TRUMP UNIVERSITY? AND THEN THERE'S TRUMP MAGAZINE. AND TRUMP VODKA, AND TRUMP STEAKS, AND TRUMP MORTGAGE. A BUSINESS GENIUS, HE IS NOT.
STEPHEN: TRUE. TRUMP HAS PUT HIS NAME ON SOME TERRIBLE INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, FOUR YEARS AGO, HE ENDORSED MITT ROMNEY! (APPLAUSE) ALL IN ALL, A VERY POWERFUL STATEMENT FROM A MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT. LET'S SEE HOW TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS RESPONDED. ( ROARS )
STEPHEN: OH, THAT'S RIGHT, MITT. THEY WANT TO FEAST ON YOUR FLESH. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ROMNEY DOESN'T HAVE A ROUGH AND TUMBLE PLAN TO SAVE THE PARTY. HE KNOWS THERE'S A WAY TO STOP TRUMP FROM GETTING THE NUMBER OF DELEGATES HE NEEDS AT THE CONVENTION.
I BELIEVE WE CAN NOMINATE A PERSON WHO CAN WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION AND WHO WILL REPRESENT THE VALUES AND POLICIES OF CONSERVATISM. GIVEN THE CURRENT DELEGATE SELECTION PROCESS, THAT MEANS THAT I'D VOTE FOR MARCO RUBIO IN FLORIDA AND FOR JOHN KASICH IN OHIO, AND FOR TED CRUZ OR WHICHEVER ONE OF THE OTHER TWO CONTENDERS HAS THE BEST CHANCE TO BEATING MR. TRUMP IN A GIVEN STATE.
STEPHEN: WHAT AN INSPIRING MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD'S GREATEST DEMOCRACY: DON'T VOTE FOR WHO YOU THINK SHOULD BE PRESIDENT, VOTE FOR WHICHEVER CANDIDATE IN YOUR STATE HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF KEEPING TRUMP FROM GETTING DELEGATES. IT'S A SYSTEM OFTEN EMPLOYED BY BROS IN BARS THAT RHYMES WITH "CLOCK BLOCK." (LAUGHTER) AND I KNOW THERE'S AN ANGRY REPUBLICAN BASE OUT THERE, BUT THIS GUY SAYS IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE DEMOCRACY FROM THE VOTERS. AFTER YOU VOTE, MAYBE YOU WILL GET A STICKER THAT SAYS, "I DID WHAT MITT ROMNEY TOLD ME TO." (LAUGHTER) THIS GAME OF GANGING UP AGAINST THE POPULAR GUY WHO'S WINNING, THAT'S NOT DEMOCRACY. THAT'S A REALITY SHOW STRATEGY. AND THAT IS TRUMP'S HOME TURF. YOU HONESTLY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE BETTER AT THIS THAN HIM? IT'S LIKE SAYING, "YOU KNOW THE WAY TO FIX OUR GREAT WHITE SHARK PROBLEM IS, GET IN THE WATER WITH HIM. BUT FIRST LET ME PUT ON MY LUCKY HAM." TRUMP IS NOT RUNNING A POLITICAL -- THAT'S THE HAM. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP IS NOT RUNNING A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. HE'S A REALITY SHOW CONTESTANT WHO'S ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN TO POLARIZE THE AUDIENCE, THEN DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL TO GET THE ROSE THAT LETS HIM HAVE SEX WITH THE TOP CHEF. (APPLAUSE) THEN YOU GET TO NAME A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN THE FANTASY SUITE. (LAUGHTER) BUT LET'S JUST SAY FOR A MINUTE THIS PLAN TO STOP TRUMP WORKS. WHO THEN COULD THE REPUBLICANS RUN FOR PRESIDENT? THE GUYS WHO LOST? THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. NO, YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN LEGITIMATELY CHOSEN BY REPUBLICAN VOTERS. HOLD ON A MINUTE! MITT, WHY DIDN'T YOU THINK OF THIS? MITT, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAS OCCURRED TO YOU, BUT YOU FIT THAT DESCRIPTION! OH, DO IT, MITT. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, JUST GATHER UP THE GANG, THE FAMILY, GATHER UP TAGG AND BLITT AND GUFF AND TUPP, STRAP THE DOG TO THE CAR AND HEAD TO THE CONVENTION. I'M READY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'VE STILL GOT ALL KINDS OF STUFF FROM 2012. I'VE STILL GOT MY GANGNAM STYLE CD, MY LINSANITY SHIRT AND MY OFFICIAL PORTRAIT OF MITT ROMNEY ON THIS JUST FOR MEN BOX.

YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT THIS NATION NEEDS, WHAT ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS, YOU'RE SMART, YOU'RE ALWAYS SMILING -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DID MY WIFE ASK YOU THE TO SAY THAT?
NO.
Stephen: THAT IS VERY NICE TO GET THAT KIND OF SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE WHO IS KNOWN TO BE A TOUGH GUY. YOU HAVE A REPUTATION, YOU PLAY A LOT OF TOUGH GUYS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: IN THIS SHOW, ARE YOU A GOOD GUY OR A BAD GUY IN.
THE GUY I PLAY IS NAMED AUGUST PULLMAN, ON W.G.N. AMERICA MARCH 9.
Stephen: WE'LL GET TO ALL THAT, I PROMISE, BEFORE IT'S OVER.
YEAH. HE'S A GUY CAUGHT UP IN THE SLAVERY SYSTEM, THE MAIN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THERE IN THE SOUTH IN GEORGIA IN 1857, A GUY TRYING TO RAISE HIS 12-YEAR-OLD BOY AND IT'S TOUGH CIRCUMSTANCES.
Stephen: SO GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY? WE'RE TALKING SLAVERY HERE AND YOU DO HAVE TO PICK A SIDE THESE DAYS.
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S A CLIMATE CHANGE. EVERYONE WANTS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE EARTH BUT DO WE ALWAYS DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THE EARTH?
Stephen: NO. IF WE DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THE EARTH, WE WOULD TURN ALL THESE LIGHT OFF.
OKAY, SO GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY?
Stephen: YOU SEEM TO THINK I'M A GOOD GUY.
WELL, THAT'S JUST ONE SIDE OF THE STORY, THOUGH.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY IN YOUR OWN LIFE HAVE BEEN A TOUGH GUY. WERE YOU A BOUNCER?
YEAH, THAT'S HOW I MADE MY MONEY. I CAME TO NEW YORK TO BE AN ACTOR AND I IMMEDIATELY WENT WHERE THE BIG MONEY WAS SO I MADE $40 A NIGHT THROWING PEOPLE OUT OF BARS.
Stephen: $40 A NIGHT? IT WASN'T AN HOURLY WAGE?
IT WASN'T. IT WAS CASH, THOUGH.
Stephen: IF I WERE COMING UP TO YOU TO GET INTO THE CLUB, WOULD YOU HAVE LET ME IN? (LAUGHTER)
NO.
Stephen: WHY NOT? WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME?
I LOVE YOU, MAN, BUT THAT FACE IS NOT --
Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG? THIS ISN'T CLUB FACE?
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? IT'S I'M NOT BRINGING ANY CHICKS TO THE GAME FACE. (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY... I DON'T MEAN... (AUDIENCE REACTS) I DON'T -- SAD FACE. SAD FACE.
Stephen: PLEASE LET ME IN, BOUNCER MAN! NO, NO...
Stephen: DID YOU EVER HAVE TO ROUGH ANYBODY UP AND BRING THE HAMMER DOWN?
WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU MY CRAZIEST BOUNCER EXPERIENCE. TWO GIRLS RAN OUT ON A TAB, SO THE MANAGER COMES RUNNING AND SAYS, DO YOU SEE TWO GIRLS? I SAID, I DON'T KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT. SO WE RUN DOWN THE STREET AND GRAB THE TWO GIRLS. HE SAYS, THERE THEY ARE. HE SAYS, YOU STAY HERE AND I'LL GRAB THE CHECK THEY RAN OUT ON. AS I'M HOLDING THE GIRLS, THEY'RE KICKING ME AND SCRATCHING ME. THE CAR PULSE UP AND IT'S THEIR BOYFRIENDS AND NOW IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE AND ONE OF THEM KICKS ME IN THE SHIN. I LET GO OF HER. THE OTHER GETS DRAGGED IN. SO NOW I DIVE THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW -- AND THIS IS PROBABLY FOR LIKE A $100 BILL OR WHATEVER -- JUMPED THROUGH A PASSENGER WINDOW AND I'M TRYING TO GRAB THE KEYS. THE GUY IS TRYING TO PUSH ME -- THE GUY FROM THE BACK IS PUNCHING ME, I'M PUNCHING THE DRIVER, THE GIRL IS SCRATCHING MY FACE, THE DRIVER STARTS DRIVING AND HE TRIES TO RUN ME, SMASH ME AGAINST THE PARKED CARS, AND IT WAS IN THAT MOMENT OF LUCIDITY AND BRILLIANCE I'M GOING, I'M GETTING PAID $40 A NIGHT!
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO FROM THAT TO ACTOR? DID YOU PUT AT THE ON YOUR RESUME, MY ANKLES CAN TAKE THINGS SMASHED AGAINST A CHEVY? (LAUGHTER)

(LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE DOING A PROJECT WITH BRUCE WILLIS CALLED MARAUDERS. WHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING WITH HIM?
IT WAS GREAT.
Stephen: THAT'S A LOT OF TESTOSTERONE, TWO TOUGH GUYS.
YEAH, WE ONLY WORKED IN BIG STAGES BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH TESTOSTERONE. COME IN WITH HAZMAT SUITS AND MOPS. TO PUT ON THE MAKEUP, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE COULD APPROACH US. YEAH, IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. IT WAS VERY FUNNY BECAUSE BRUCE IS THE C.E.O. OF THE BANK AND HE HAS TO ESCORT ME OUT TO HAVE THE BANK, I'M AN F.B.I. GUY. AS HE'S ESCORT MEG THROUGH WITH HIS SECURITY, THE BAD GUYS COME IN TO ROB THE BANK AND START SPRAYING BULLETS EVERYWHERE. SO BRUCE AND I HAVE TO SHOOT OUR WAY OUT OF THERE. BUT BRUCE IS THE C.E.O.

THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: YOU ARE SPECIFICALLY TITLED SENIOR CHIEF SPECIAL WARFARE OPERATOR. THAT IS A REALLY ALL-ENCOMPASSING TITLE, A WARFARE OPERATOR. WHAT DO YOU OPERATE? I OPERATE WARFARE. WHAT DOES THAT TRAINING INCLUDE? WHAT ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE TRAINED TO DO?
WELL, IF WE WERE TO SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT, I THINK YOU WOULD RUN OUT OF TIME.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? THE FIRST IS BASIC UNDERWATER SEAL TRAINING, THEN SEAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING AFTER THAT FOR SIX MONTHS JUST TO GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR.
Stephen: WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT YOU WOULD BE RECEIVING THE MEDAL OF HONOR?
I FOUND OUT IN DECEMBER.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU FIND OUT?
IT'S A REALLY INTRIGUING PROCESS. THE WHITE HOUSE CALLS YOU, SOMEBODY ON HIS STAFF, AND THEY SAY, HEY, THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO TALK TO YOU NEXT WEEK AT THIS DATE AND TIME. ARE YOU AVAILABLE? AND MY FIRST REACTION WAS DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY SAY NO TO THIS? LET ME CHECK MY SCHEDULE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE PHONE CALL IS ABOUT?
I DID. I WAS AWARE HE WAS GOING TO GIVE A CALL BUT IT'S NOT TILL THE PRESIDENT CALLS YOU THAT IT BECOMES OFFICIAL.
Stephen: THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF THE ENGAGEMENT FOR WHICH YOU WERE AWARDED THE MEDAL OF HONOR ARE CLASSIFIED AND YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT. WALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY AND TRY NOT TO BREACH NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN YOU DO SO.
I'LL DO MY BEST.
Stephen: OKAY. DECEMBER 2012, WE RECEIVED OUR MISSION, A NO-FAIL MISSION, AND OUR GOAL WAS TO BRING BACK AN AMERICAN HOSTAGE.
Stephen: AFGHANISTAN? EASTERN AFGHANISTAN. SO WE INSERTED BY HELECOPTERRER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. HAD A FOUR OR FIVE HOUR WALK THROUGH MOUNTAINS AND GOT TO THE TARGET BUILDING AND ASSESSED.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S YOUR TARGET BUILDING? I ASSUME A LOT LOOK ALIKE.
THEY DO, BUT OUR NATION'S MILITARY HAS CLEVER WAYS OF FIGURING THAT OUT.
Stephen: OKAY. I'LL ACCEPT THAT. MOVE ON.
SO AS WE APPROACH THE BUILDING, OUR POINT MAN UND TEAMMATE NICK WAS UP FRONT. A GUARD CAME OUT OF ONE OF THE DOORS. HE IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED THE GUARD AND WE STARTED SPRINTING TOWARD THE DOOR. IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL DOOR. IT WAS A LAYER OF BLANKETS. AS NICK STARTED TO MOVE IN THROUGH THE BLANKETS, I MOVED IN BEHIND HIM. AS I WENT TO MY AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, AN ENEMY ON THE BACK WALL HAD HIS AK READY TO SHOOT AND EENGAGED HIM AND SAW ANOTHER PERSON MOVING ACROSS THE FLOOR. AT THAT TIME YOU DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS THE AMERICAN HOSTAGE JUST SCARED, TRYING TO MOVE --
Stephen: WHAT TIME OF DAY IS THIS?
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
Stephen: IS IT DARK, A LIGHT ON INSIDE?
IT WAS BITCH BLACK. THE AVERAGE AFGHAN HOUSE HAS ONE LIGHT BULB. I DON'T THINK THIS ONE HAD ANY LIGHT BULBS. WE HAVE NIGHT VISION, SO THAT GIVES US THE ADVANTAGE TO SEE. I SAW A PERSON MOVE ACROSS THE FLOOR. HE WAS MOVING TOWARD WEAPONS. I GOT TO HIM AND STRADDLED HIM AND PINNED HIM DOWN WITH MY LEGS.
Stephen: AT THIS POINT, DO YOU KNOW IF THIS IS THE HOSTAGE OR SOMEONE HOSTILE.
I DIDN'T KNOW. I WAS TRYING TO CONTROL HIM AND ADJUSTING MY NIGHT VISION SO I COULD GET FACIAL RECOGNITION. SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE'RE CALLING OUT, AMERICAN HOSTAGE, TRYING TO GET SOMEBODY TO RESPONDTHA BACK. HE FINALLY DID RESPOND BACK, ABOUT FIVE FEET AWAY TO ME TO MY RIGHT. I ENGAGED THE PERSON I WAS ON TOP OF AND JUMPED OFF HIM AND ON TO THE AMERICAN HOSTAGE. YOU WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS TO BRING THIS GUY BACK ALIVE AND WE'RE WEARING BODY ARMOR SO WE ACCEPT THAT RISK AND WANT TO PROTECT HIM. WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THERE WAS ANOTHER ENEMY THAT WAS TO MY LEFT WITHIN ARM'S REACH, FORTUNATELY, AND I WAS ABLE TO PIN HIM AGAINST THE WALL BY HIS THROAT TILL MY TEAMMATES WERE ABLE TO COME IN AND TAKE CARE OF THAT.
Stephen: SO YOU HAVE YOUR BODY ON TOP OF THE HOSTAGE TO PROTECT HIM WHILE PINNING SOMEBODY AGAINST THE WALL WITH YOUR HAND, AFTER ENGAGING THE ENEMY PREVIOUSLY TO THAT?
THAT'S CORRECT (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW, CAN YOU TELL US -- WITHOUT GIVING A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME -- IS THIS SEEMING LIKE IT'S HAPPENING FAST TO YOU? OR IS IT ALL HAPPENING IN SLOW MOTION FOR YOU?
THAT IS A UNIQUE THING ABOUT OUR TRAINING IS WE REHEARSE SO MUCH THAT IT IS VERY INSTINCT CHIEWL. SO WHILE THE WHOLE SCENARIO HAPPENED WITHIN A MINUTE, MINUTE AND A HALF, IN YOUR MIND IT'S VERY SEGMENTED. YOU TAKE ONE SITUATION, HANDLE IT AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. SO IT SLOWS DOWN. IT'S KIND OF LIKE TIME SLOWS DOWN.
Stephen: NOW I KNOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE RAID TO GET THE HOSTAGE, BUT ONE THING I KNOW YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FELLOW NAVY SEAL, AND THIS IS NICK CHECK, RIGHT?
YES, AND NICK CHECK WAS A TRUE AMERICAN HERO, AND HE'S THE HERO OF THAT OPERATION. HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO BRING BACK ANOTHER AMERICAN AND, FRANKLY, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HE DID NOT SURVIVE THE ENGAGEMENT?
HE DID NOT.
Stephen: AND HERE YOU ARE RECEIVING THE MEDAL OF HONOR FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA ON MONDAY, AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW,, PEOPLE WILL BE CALLING YOU A HERO. HOW DO YOU FEEL? I KNOW SOME PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY DON'T LIKE THAT TITLE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
THAT'S NOT A TITLE I WOULD GIVE MYSELF. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING OTHER PEOPLE BESTOW UPON YOU, AND THE PEOPLE I REALLY CONSIDER HEROS ARE THE BROTHERS I WORK WITH. THESE MEN ARE, YOU KNOW, THE TOUGHEST MEN ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. THEIR MENTALITY OF NEVER QUIT, NEVER FAIL AT ANYTHING THEY DO IS TRULY REMARKABLE AND, YOU KNOW, IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM, I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE TODAY. THEY SAVED MY LIFE COUNTLESS TIMES.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE YOU WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO BEFORE WE GO.
THERE IS. SO MY NEIGHBORS BOB AND GIGI, THEY LOVE YOUR SHOW, AND THEY'VE RECORDED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR SHOWS, SO I HAVE TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS. I HEARD YOU JUST HAD YOUR 100th EPISODE HERE.
