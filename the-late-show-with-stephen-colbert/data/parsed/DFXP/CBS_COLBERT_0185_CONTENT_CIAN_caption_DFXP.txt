IT'S THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JOHN OLIVER. JAI COURTNEY. CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVINCING. DEATH, TAXES, HILLARY.  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." HEY, EVERYBODY!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH! THANKS, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, PAUL. THANK YOU, MARK. WHAT'S UP, JON? WHAT'S UP, JOE? WHAT'S UP, JON? WHAT'S UP, JOE? HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! OH! YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE IT. IT'S ELECTRIC. WOOO! YOU CAN FEEL IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." AND I MEAN LATE SHOW TONIGHT. I'M JUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT WE ARE LIVE ON NIGHT THREE OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LAST NIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO BE NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT WAS-- YAY, PRETTY EXCITING. YOU REALLY FELT IT. IT WAS AN HISTORIC MOMENT COVERED BY ALL THE PAPERS. I'VE GOT THEM RIGHT HERE. LET'S SEE. FIRST UP, "THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"" HAD "HILLARY CLINTON WINS NOMINATION. AND THE PHOTO. WOW, THERE SHE IS. HILLARY REALLY LOOKING PRESIDENTIAL THERE FOR SOME REASON. SIMILAR THING ON "THE WASHINGTON POST." "HISTORIC NOMINATION FOR HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT THERE." THEN THERE'S THE "SEATTLE TIMES." "HOUSTON CHRONICLE." "PITTSBURG POST-GAZETTE." AND THE "CHICAGO TRIBUNE" ALL WITH NO PHOTO OF HILLARY CLINTON. IF SHE WINS, I EXPECT HER INAUGARATION COVERAGE TO READ, "JUSTICE ROBERTS PERFORMS HISTORIC SWEARING IN OF UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL THIS NEWSPAPER ON THE FLOOR. I THINK THAT'S A FIRE HAZARD. NOW, THE DEMOCRATS HAD BIG NAMES TONIGHT. MY OLD FRIEND JOE BIDEN GAVE A MOVING SPEECH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A MOVING SPEECH THAT POSED THE ETERNAL QUESTION:  WHY CAN'T JOE BIDEN BE THE NOMINEE?" AND UNCLE JOE WASTED NO TIME GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP.
HE'S TRYING TO TELL US HE CARES ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS? GIVE ME A BREAK! THAT'S A BUNCH OF MALARKY! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT? MALARKY? JOE, PLEASE, DON'T DROP THE "M" WORD. WE'RE LIVE. NEXT HE'S GOING TO SAY FAWLDERAL, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. AND HE CLOSED WITH A ROUSING CALL TO OPTIMISM.
WE ARE AMERICA, SECOND TO NONE! AND WE OWN THE FINISH LINE! DON'T FORGET IT! GOD BLESS YOU ALL. AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS! COME ON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE AMERICA! THANK YOU!
Stephen: COME ON! COME ON! LET'S DO THIS! COME ON! YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! WHAT ARE WE DOING! IT'S RIDICULOUS, IS WHAT IT IS! WHAT ARE WE DOING? OH, HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ IT'S MALARKEY IS WHAT IT IS! NOW, JOE, JOE LOVES LOVING. AND THE THEME OF THE NIGHT WAS LOVE, WHICH SEEMED TO RESONATE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE R.N.C. FEAR FESTIVAL. IT'S ALMOST AS IF-- AND I'M JUST GUESSING HERE-- IT'S ALMOST AS IF AN AUDIENCE WANTS TO HEAR SOMETHING OTHER THAN THEIR COUNTRY IS A GIANT FLAMING TURD PILE. SSOME PEOPLE LIKE BEING TOLD "WE LOVE EACH OTHER, AND EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY." THAT'S WHY, WHEN YOU SKINNED YOUR KNEE IN 2nd GRADE, YOUR MOM DIDN'T SAY, "WE'RE BROKE, AND ISIS IS COMING TO KILL US ALL." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MY MOM DIDN'T. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALSO TONIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON'S RUNNING, MATE VIRGINIA SENATOR AND LOOSE-FIT KHAKIS MODEL, TIM KAINE WAS THERE. THE THRILLA WHO'S VANILLA! NOW, SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHICH DEMOGRAPHIC THEY'RE HOPING TIM KAINE WILL ATTRACT. ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
Stephen:  THEY'RE PUSHING THIS SPANISH THING SO HARD THAT TONIGHT THEY INTRODUCED HIM BY BREAKING HIM OUT OF A PINATA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FINALLY, FINALLY-- AND FINALLY, THE MOMENT WE ALL WERE WAITING FOR, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WHO-- GAVE A GREAT SPEECH. DID YOU SEE IT? AMAZING SPEECH. THE GUY KNOWS HOW TO TALK. HE REMINISCED ABOUT HIS TIME IN OFFICE.
YOU FELL FOR MY BRILLIANT WIFE AND PARTNER MICHELLE. (CHEERS) WHO SOMEHOW HAS NOT AGED A DAY. (CHEERS) I KNOW. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR ME.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. HE HAS AGED. JIMMY, CAN WE SEE A PHOTO OF HIM IN 2008? THERE YOU GO. AND NOW IN 2016? YIKES! OH! THAT'S WITHOUT THE MAKEUP. THAT'S WITHOUT THE MAKEUP. YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT? YOU HAVE TO SEE HIM WITHOUT HIS MAKEUP. THAT'S WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. HE WASTED NO TIME BUILDING UP HILLARY CLINTON'S CREDENTIALS.
YOU KNOW, NOTHING TRULY PREPARES YOU FOR THE DEMANDS OF THE OVAL OFFICE. YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT, YOU CAN STUDY IT. BUT UNTIL YOU'VE SAT AT THAT DESK, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MANAGE A GLOBAL CRISIS OR SEND YOUNG PEOPLE TO WAR. BUT HILLARY'S BEEN IN THE ROOM.
Stephen: AND I'M PRETTY SURE SHE USED TO SIT AT MY DESK WHEN I WAS ASLEEP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) GOTTA-- THINGS WOULD MOVE. THINGS WOULD MOVE AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ADJUST THE CHAIR. AND AT THE END OF HIS SPEECH, OBAMA WAS JOINED ON STAGE BY A SURPRISE GUEST, HILLARY CLINTON. THAT IS NICE. THAT IS A REALLY LOVELY MOMENT. AND MAYBE TOMORROW, YOU KNOW, SHE'LLOB A NEWSPAPER. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NICE FOR HER TO GET IN THERE. OF COURSE, TONIGHT'S THEME WAS "WORKING TOGETHER," WHICH THEY STOLE FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN AND DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, IN CASE THIS IS NEWS FOR YOU, THE LATEST IN THE D.N.C.  EMAIL SCANDAL IS THAT. IS THE F.B.I. SUSPECTS RUSSIA. AND IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE PUTIN AND TRUMP TEAMING UP. AFTER ALL, WHAT'S ANNEXING CRIMEA IF NOT A VERY AGGRESSIVE REAL ESTATE DEAL? PUTIN FANS HERE TONIGHT EVIDENTLY. OF COURSE, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THEY'RE COLLUDING. ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THE HACKING GROUPS RESPONSIBLE GO BY THE NAMES "COZY BEAR" AND "FANCY BEAR." COZY BEAR AND FANCY BEAR? HOLD ON, WAIT A SECOND. JIMMY, PUT UP A PICTURE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN. COZY BEAR! NOW PUT UP TRUMP. FANCY BEAR! OH, MY GOD. IT ALL MAKES SENSE! EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS-- EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN THAT. EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS, PUTIN WAS RECENTLY SPOTTED HUNTING TRUMP'S NEXT HAIRPIECE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF THAT DONALD TRUMP IS COLLUDING WITH RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE IN SECRET. HE'S DOING IT IN PUBLIC.
RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING, I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THE 30,000 EMAILS THAT ARE MISSING.
Stephen:  ALSO, THOSE BONER PILLS DIDN'T WORK THE WAY YOU SAID THEY WOULD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IF ANYTHING-- IF ANYTHING-- IF ANYTHING, THEY MADE MY HANDS EVEN SMALLER. ( LAUGHTER ) STILL, STILL, I GOTTA SAY, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE HILLARY'S DELETED EMAILS. AND, RUSSIAN HACKERS, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, SEE IF YOU CAN DIG UP DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WITH A VERY SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR IT. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. HEY! WELCOME TO THE LIVE SHOW. IT FEELS ALIVE. WELCOME TO THE THE LIVE "LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY. AFTER THE THE THIRD NEED OF THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER. JON YOU HAVE VERY SPECIAL GUESTS.
Jon: WE HAVE ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAMER, GRAMMY AWARD WINNER, HIP-HOP LEGEND, D.M.C.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I'M REALLY ENJOYING THESE LIVE CONVENTION SHOWS. YOU LIKING THEM? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE ELECT. AND ONE MOMENT THAT I REALLY ENJOYED LAST WEEK WAS THE RETURN OF "STEPHEN COLBERT," THE HOST OF THE "COLBERT REPORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT. I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT. I'LL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T ENJOY IT SO MUCH? CORPORATE LAWYERS. BECAUSE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT SHOW, CBS'S TOP LAWYER WAS CONTACTED BY THE TOP LAWYER FROM ANOTHER COMPANY TO SAY THAT THE CHARACTER "STEPHEN COLBERT" IS THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH IS SURPRISING. BECAUSE I NEVER CONSIDERED THAT GUY MUCH OF AN INTELLECTUAL. SO IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I ANNOUNCE THAT, THANKS TO CORPORATE LAWYERS, THE CHARACTER OF STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST OF THE "COLBERT REPORT," WILL NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN.
Audience: NO! (BOOING) I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. LISTEN, I FEEL THE SAME WAY, BUT WHAT CAN I DO? THE LAWYERS HAVE SPOKEN. I CAN'T REASONABLY ARGUE I OWN MY FACE OR NAME. ( LAUGHTER ) AND AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT GUY ON AGAIN, I CAN'T. SO INSTEAD, JOINING ME NOW, LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM PHILADELPHIA, PLEASE WELCOME, STEPHEN COLBERT'S IDENTICAL TWIN COUSIN, STEPHEN COLBERT. GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME, STEPHEN.
YOU'RE WELCOME, STEPHEN. HELLO, AMERICA. HELLO, COLBERT COUNTRY! STAY STRONG! BE BRAVE! WITH.
Stephen: NOW, I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE, ARE YOU NOT THE GUY WHO HAD A TELEVISION SHOW FOR A DECADE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT, STEPHEN. THAT'S MY TWIN COUSIN. THIS IS MY FIRST APPEARANCE ON TELEVISION EVER. HOW AM I DOING, AMERICA ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'RE DOING GREAT. NOW, IDENTICAL TWIN COUSIN, HOW DOES THAT WORK?
IT'S SIMPLE, STEPHEN. OUR MOMS WERE IDENTICAL TWINS WHO MARRIED IDENTICAL TWIN HUSBANDS. THEN HAD SEX AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT AND GAVE US THE SAME NAME.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT CHECKS OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT LET'S JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT HIM. HIS WIFE'S NAME WAS LORRAINE.
YES, MY WIFE'S NAME IS LORRENA.
Stephen: HE WENT TO DARTMOUTH.
I APPLIED TO DARTMOUTH.
Stephen: OKAY, SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT GUY.
TOTALLY DIFFERENT GUY. ALSO, PRETTY SURE HE'S GAY. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. JUST SAYING HE TALKED ABOUT IT A LOT. WHERE THERE'S SMOKE THERE'S FIRE.
Stephen: I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
MOST OF ALL, STEPHEN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO SAVE THIS COUNTRY AND JOIN THE "LATE SHOW" TEAM.
Stephen: WAIT A MINUTE. SO YOU WANT TO BE A PERMANENT PART OF THIS SHOW?
STEPHEN, WHENEVER YOU NEED ME, WILD HORSES, RIDDEN BY CORPORATE LAWYERS, COULD NOT KEEP ME AWAY.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.
YES, I AM.
Stephen: THANK YOU. STEPHEN COLBERT'S TWIN COUSIN. STEPHEN COLBERT, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HAVE A GREAT SHOW, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE A DAMN FINE LOOKING MAN, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: HE'S A GOOD GUY. HE'S A GOOD GUY. I LIKE HIM. HAPPY TO HAVE HIM ON BOARD. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO HAVE THAT OTHER GUY WITH THE TV SHOW. I REALLY LIKE SOME OF THE BITS HE USED TO DO. BUT, AGAIN, WHAT CAN I DO IN THE FACE OF CORPORATE LAWYERS? WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WERD: THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. FOLKS, THE TWO WEEKS OF POLITICAL CONVENTIONS ARE DRAWING TO A CLOSE, AND WE NOW KNOW ONE THING FOR CERTAIN: WE KNOW THIS NOVEMBER IT WILL BE HILLARY CLINTON AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. AND POLLS SHOW THAT MANY OF US HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN THE OUTCOM WE REALLY WANT. WE WANT NEITHER. BOTH CLINTON AND TRUMP HAVE HISTORICALLY LOW APPROVAL RATINGS. IN FACT, 52% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAY THEY'RE ONLY VOTING FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT HILLARY TO WIN. AND I DON'T BLAME THEM FOR THAT SOFT SUPPORT. DONALD TRUMP IS A HARD MAN TO STAND BEHIND. MEANWHILE, 56% OF HILLARY SUPPORTERS SAY THEY JUST DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP TO WIN. HILLARY'S CRITICS SEE HER AS UNTRUSTWORTHY, SELFISH, AND TOO WILLING TO BEND THE RULES. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP'S CRITICS SAY HE'S PREJUDICED, UNPREPARED, AND HAS THE WRONG TEMPERAMENT FOR A PRESIDENT. THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYONE'S GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT THESE TWO. BOTH CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY DECADES-OLD BRANDS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE WONDER BREAD, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE PRESIDENT WONDER BREAD. SAME GOES FOR THE NEW McDONALD'S ANGRY MEAL. LET'S FACE IT, LET'S FACE IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOTH CANDIDATES KNOW IT. THAT'S WHY THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE THE MOST NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN. IN AMERICAN HISTORY. HILLARY CLINTON WILL SAY THINGS. THAT MAKE TRUMP SEEM RACIST, AND TRUMP WILL ATTACK HILLARY'S INTEGRITY. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS NEGATIVITY COULD LIKELY TURN AWAY VOTERS FROM THE POLLS. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SINCE MANY AMERICANS CAN'T BRING THEMSELVES TO VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE, THIS YEAR, I SAY, WE SHOULD CHANGE THE SYSTEM. SO ON ELECTION DAY, YOU CAN VOTE AGAINST THE CANDIDATE YOU DON'T WANT. THEN AT THE END OF ELECTION DAY, WE JUST COUNT ALL THE "AGAINST "VOTES, AND THE CANDIDATE WITH THE LOWEST SCORE BECOMES PRESIDENT. IT MAKES VOTING LIKE GOLF-- IF-- ON THE OUTSIDE CHANCE THEY DO NOT INSTITUTE MY PLAN, NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CANDIDATE, PLEASE, YOU STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE POLLS ON ELECTION DAY. YES, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE FOR A PERSON YOU DON'T REALLY WANT, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN GETTING THE PERSON YOU REALLY DON'T WANT. AND THAT'S THE WERD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK-- HER HUSBAND IS LIKE DEMONSTRABLY, YOU KNOW, DISLOYAL AND HAS SAID A FEW THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE. WHY DO YOU THINK HE SKATES WHEN THE IDEA OF UNTRUSTWORTHINESS STICKS TO HER?
BECAUSE BILL CLINTON CAME OUT ON ARSENIO YEARS AGO AND PLAILD THE SAXOPHONE. SO THAT-- THAT REALLY HUMANIZED HIM. AND, YOU KNOW--
Stephen: BUT, HONEST TO GOD, HE SKATES BY BECAUSE HE'S CHARMING? THAT'S WHAT IT IS?
BECAUSE HE'S CHARMING AND HE HAS A LOT OF DIRT ON HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND EVERYBODY REMEMBERS LEINSKY. THAT HUMANIZED HIM AS WELL.
Stephen: THAT HUMANIZED HIM AND HE GOT IN TROUBLE AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM FOR IT AND WHY DON'T THEY LIKE HILLARY FOR IT.
BECAUSE GUYS CAN UNDERSTAND A GUY GETTING SOME FILABORO.
Stephen: IS THAT OKAY? WE'RE ALL GO.
I FEEL LIKE HILLARY SHOULD TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS. IT WORKED FOR BEYONCE. BEYONCE TALKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S INFIDELITIES. AND WE COULD SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, HILLARY, WE FEEL YOU."
Stephen: SHE SHOULD DROP HER OWN LEMONADE. WHAT ABOUT TRUMP? WHAT'S THE OBVIOUS QUESTION FOR TRUMP THAT YOU WOULD ASK?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND THE REASON I SAY THAT ONLY A MAN-- A MAN THAT IS THATANG EXPREE THAT HATEFUL HAS TO SUFFER FROM ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION. THERE'S NO OTHER EXCUSE FOR IT.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT BARACK OBAMA? THIS IS SORT OF HIS SWAN SONG. THIS WAS HIS LAST BIG SPEECH TONIGHT. HE DID A GREAT JOB. HE KILLED IT. WHAT'S THE QUESTION AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE.
I THINK BARACK DID A GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD SAY TO BARACK-- ( APPLAUSE ) -- DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MADE IT LOOK SO EASY THAT DONALD TRUMP FEELS LIKE HE CAN DO IT? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
Stephen: UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
OR DID YOU DO SUCH A BAD JOB IN SOMEBODY LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S EYE HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN DO BETTER THAN HIM," WHICH IS INSULTING TO BARACK OBAMA.
Stephen: THERE WERE SOME ROUGH PATCHES IN THERE. IT WASN'T AN EASY EIGHT YEARS. YOU SAW HOW HE LOOKED LIKE EIGHT YEARS AGO AND NOW.
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR WHOEVER GETS IN THE WHITE HOUSE NEXT.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE CONVENTION FOR YOU THIS WEEK?
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE CONVENTION FOR ME? MICHELLE OBAMA'S SPEECH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. I THINK-- I THINK-- I THINK MICHELLE OBAMA IS THE EPITOME OF WHAT WE CALL BLACK GIRL MAGIC. YOU KNOW, SHE'S --
BLACK GIRL MAGIC? IS THAT A THING?
YEAH, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. S SHE'S INTELLIGENT. SHE'S GOT A GREAT... WHAT'S SERENA WILLIAMS GOT AND BEYONCE GOT-- CAN I SAY ASS? SHE'S GOT A GREAT ASS. SORRY, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SHE DOES YOU.
Stephen:  KNOW HE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING YOU ARE SAYING. HE'S GOT THOSE BIG EARS. HE ALSO HAS AN ARMY. SO I WOULD WATCH OUT I MEAN THAT IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY.
I MEAN THAT IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY. SHE IS THE EPITOME OF EVERYTHING THAT IS BEAUTIFUL ABOUT BLACK WOMEN, MICHELLE OBAMA.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK SHE SHOULD RUN?
NO, I DON'T WANT HER TO AGE LIKE BARACK HAS. SHE HASN'T AGED AT ALL YET. BUT AS SOON AS SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT, BECAUSE SHE COULD WIN, SHE'D START AGING LIKE A WHITE WOMAN. I'M SORRY.
