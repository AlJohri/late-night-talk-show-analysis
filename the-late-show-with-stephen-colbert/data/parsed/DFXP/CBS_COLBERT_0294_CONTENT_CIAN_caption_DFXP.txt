Reporter: CHOKE ARTIST. HE RAN VERY POORLY. MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF.
THIS GUY A TOTAL LIGHT WEIGHT. THIS SOCIALIST COMMUNIST. MAD DOG MATTIS. FAKE NEWS. MARCO, I WISH I HAD THAT HAIR. HE'S GIST GUSTING. BAD. I MOVED ON HER "LIKE A PITCH. GRAB 'EM BY THE PUSSY.
IT'S THE "CBS EVENING NEWS" WITH STEPHEN MORGAN. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES SALLY FIELD, MAGGIE SIFF AND MUSICAL GUEST LADY ANTEBELLUM FEATURING JON STEWART AND "DEAT AND "STAY HUMAN." LIVE FROM THE THEATER THEATER IN NEW YOEDSULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW  CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen:
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. WOW. I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD BE HERE ON THIS HISTORIC EVENING. DONALD TRUMP HELD HIS FIRST SOLO PRESS CONFERENCE AS PRESIDENT. HE WAS OUT THERE ALL BY HIMSELF. HE DIDN'T EVEN BRING HIS MEDS. IT WAS A ROBUST ONE HOUR AND 17 MINUTES. BEEFY. SO BEEFY, YOU COULD EAT IT WITH A FORK BUT YOU WILL WANT TO USE A SPOON TO GET EVERY DROP OF THE CRAZY. IT JUST HAPPENED. WE WERE RECORDING THIS IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON. IT LITERALLY JUST FINISHED. THIS IS FRESH. IT MUST BE FRESH BECAUSE YOU CAN SMELL IT. THERE IS A REAL -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, IT'S STILL STEAMING. YOU CAN WARM YOUR HANDS OVER THIS PILE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S KIND OF HARD TO CHARACTERIZE THE PRESS CONFERENCE. WORDS FAIL ME. HOW ABOUT CNN?
IT WAS UNHINGED.
Stephen: OKAY, JAKE. NICE TRY, BUT THAT'S THE LYING FAKE MEDIA. WHAT DID HIS FRIENDS AT FOX NEWS SAY?
ALL RIGHTY, THEN!
STEPHEN: VERY FUNNY. VERY FUNNY, NICE TRY. VERY FUNNY. OKAY. WHAT DID FOX NEWS REALLY SAY?
WOW. ALL RIGHTY, THEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW! WOW! WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT, WHO NEEDS FOX AND FRIENDS? NOW, RIGHT OFF THE BEAN, HERE'S THE THING -- DONALD TRUMP HELD THIS CONFERENCE BECAUSE THERE'S CHAOS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND ALL THE TALK ABOUT WHETHER THE RUSSIANS ARE PLAYING FOOTSIE WITH HIM AND THINGS LIKE THAT. HIS PRESS AIDES SAID THIS IS TOTALLY HIS IDEA. I TOTALLY BELIEVE NO ONE ELSE THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR HIM TO DO. TRUMP DEFENDED HIS ROUGH START BY IMMEDIATELY ATTACKING AMERICA'S TRUE ENEMY: ANYONE BUT HIM.
TO BE HONEST, I INHERITED A MESS. IT'S A MESS.
STEPHEN: NO, YOU INHERITED A FORTUNE. WE ELECTED A MESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN HE TOUTED HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN A PRESIDENT ELECTED IN THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHO'S DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE.
STEPHEN: I DON'T SAY THIS OFTEN, BUT, MR. TRUMP, I COMPLETELY AGREE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. AND THE PRESIDENT FOCUSED TO THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES HIM HAPPY, BESIDES HIS NIGHTLY BATHROBE TIME: REMINISCING ABOUT HIS ELECTION.
GOT 306 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GET 222. THEY SAID THERE'S NO WAY TO GET 222. 230 IS IMPOSSIBLE. 270, WHICH YOU NEED, THAT WAS LAUGHABLE. WE GOT 306. BECAUSE PEOPLE CAME OUT AND VOTED LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. SO THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES. I GUESS IT WAS THE BIGGEST ELECTORAL COLLEGE WIN SINCE RONALD REAGAN.
STEPHEN: ACTUALLY, SIR, BARACK OBAMA GOT 365 ELECTORAL VOTES IN 2008, YOU ONLY GOT 306. WAIT... DO YOU THINK 306 IS LARGER THAN 365? WOW, BETSY DEVOS WORKS QUICK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE DeVOS EFFECT! YOU GOT DeVOSFIED. THAT WAS THE DeVOSFICATION OF DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) LATER, A REPORTER REMINDED HIM HOW NUMBERS WORK.
YOU SAID TODAY THAT YOU HAD THE BIGGEST ELECTORAL MARGIN SINCE RONALD REAGAN WITH 304 OR 306 ELECTORAL VOTES. IN FACT, PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT 365 IN 2008--
WELL, I'M TALKING ABOUT REPUBLICAN.
-- PRESIDENT OBAMA, 332, AND GEORGE H.W. BUSH, 426, WHEN HE WON AS PRESIDENT. SO WHY SHOULD AMERICANS TRUST--
WELL, NO, I WAS TOLD-- I WAS GIVEN THAT INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW. I WAS JUST GIVEN-- WE HAD A VERY BIG MARGIN.
I GUESS MY QUESTION IS, WHY SHOULD AMERICANS TRUST YOU WHEN YOU ACCUSE THE INFORMATION THEY RECEIVE OF BEING FAKE WHEN YOU'RE PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT'S--
WELL, I WAS GIVEN THAT INFORMATION.
STEPHEN: HOW PRESIDENTIAL. REMINDS ME OF HARRY TRUMAN, WHO SAID, "LOOK I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO STOP, I WAS GIVEN THAT BUCK." ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP PROVED ONCE AGAIN HE IS CONSISTANTLY INCONSISTANT.
I WATCH CNN. IT'S SO MUCH ANGER AND HATRED, AND JUST THE HATRED. I DON'T WATCH IT ANYMORE.
STEPHEN: BUT YOU LITERALLY SAID YOU WATCHED IT, TWO SENTENCES AGO! THEN YOU SAID YOU DON'T WATCH IT! IMAGINE IF BILL CLINTON SAID, "I DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH THAT WOMAN. THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST. I TOTALLY BANGED HER IN THE OVAL OFFICE. TOTAL. BOOM. TOTAL. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT A CNN REPORTER FOUGHT BACK.
JUST BECAUSE THE ATTACK OF FAKE NEWS AND ATTACKING OUR NETWORK, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU, SIR--
I'M CHANGING IT FROM FAKE NEWS THOUGH. VERY FAKE NEWS.
STEPHEN: OH, VERY FAKE NEWS! I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE BRINGING OUT THE BIG GUNS. AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO RATCHET IT UP TO "VERY, VERY, TOTES-MAGOTES, FOR REALSIES FALSIE FAKE NEWS." NO FAIR CHANGEYS. NO DROPS, NO BOMBS, NO TAKEOUTS. ( APPLAUSE ) CIRCLE DOT, GOODIE SHOT. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WORKS. AND TRUMP FINALLY ADDRESSED THE RUMORS ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
PUTIN PROBABLY ASSUMES THAT HE CAN'T MAKE A DEAL WITH ME ANYMORE BECAUSE, POLITICALLY, IT WOULD BE UNPOPULAR FOR A POLITICIAN TO MAKE A DEAL. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING I'M A POLITICIAN, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I AM NOW.
STEPHEN: THERE IT IS. CATCH THAT IS THIS WE ALL SAW THE MOMENT WHEN DONALD TRUMP FINALLY REALIZED HE IS PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP EXPLAINED WHY GOOD RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA WERE SO IMPORTANT.
IF RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY GOT TOGETHER AND GOT ALONG-- AND DON'T FORGET, WE'RE A VERY POWERFUL NUCLEAR COUNTRY, AND SO ARE THEY. THERE'S NO UPSIDE. WE'RE A VERY POWERFUL NUCLEAR COUNTRY. AND SO ARE THEY. I'VE BEEN BRIEFED, I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING ABOUT A BRIEFING THAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO SAY, ANYBODY THAT READ THE MOST BASIC BOOK CAN SAY IT, NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST WOULD BE LIKE NO OTHER.
STEPHEN: YES, THAT'S THE KIND IN-DEPTH BRIEFING THAT ONLY THE PRESIDENT IS PRIVY TOO. IT'S IN THE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED BRIEFING BOOK: "NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST BAD." IT'S A LITTLE TECHNICAL. IT'S A LITTLE TECHNICAL. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO JARGONY, BUT THE BRIEFING IS JUST ONE LONG WORD -- BOOM. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, RATHER THAN ADDRESS THE RUSSIAN RUMORS, TRUMP PIVOTED
DOES ANYBODY REALLY THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE TOUGHER ON RUSSIA THAN DONALD TRUMP? DOES ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM REALLY BELIEVE THAT?
STEPHEN: I DON'T KNOW, I'LL ASK. DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT? ( CHEERING ) AND TRUMP WASN'T DONE WITH HIS ETHNIC OUTREACH. ADDRESS B THE THORNY TENSIONS OF WHITE HOUSE RACISM WITH APRIL RYAN.
ARE YOU GOING TO INCLUDE THE CBC WITH YOUR URBAN AGENDA.
WHO? THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND THE --
WELL, I WOULD. DO YOU WANT TO SET UP THE MEETING?
NO, NO, NO, I'M JUST A REPORTER--
ARE THEY FRIENDS OF YOURS? GO AHEAD, SET UP A MEETING.
I KNOW SOME OF THEM, BUT I'M SURE--
LET'S GO. SET UP A MEETING. I WOULD LOVE TO MEET WITH THE BLACK CAUCUS. I THINK IT'S GREAT. THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. I THINK IT'S GREAT.
STEPHEN: OH, YOU'RE BLACK, CAN YOU TALK TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AT YOUR NEXT MEETING OF THE BLACK CLUB? YOU KNOW WHAT, FORGET IT. I'LL HAVE BEN CARSON DO IT. THSIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. ( APPLAUSE ) WOW, IT'S TRUE, RIGHT? THE PRESIDENT. IS HE GIVING AWAY A SECRET? ALL BLACK PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER, RIGHT?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU KEEP EACH OTHER'S SCHEDULES.
Jon: WE MEET AT OPRAH'S HOUSE.
CAN YOU SET UP A MEETING FOR ME WITH BEYONCE, JAY-Z, AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: HEART A LOT OF GREAT THINGS.
Jon: YOU CAN COME, TOO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND FINALLY, CBS' MAJOR GARRETT ASKED THE QUESTION SWIRLING ALL WEEK: WHAT TRUMP WILL DO ABOUT THE HEIGHTENING TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA.
YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANYTHING I'M GOING TO DO. I DON'T TALK ABOUT MILITARY RESPONSE. I DON'T SAY I'M GOING INTO MOSUL IN FOUR MONTHS. "WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK MOSUL IN FOUR MONTHS," THEN THREE MONTHS LATER,  "WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK MOSUL IN ONE MONTH." "NEXT WEEK, WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK MOSUL."
STEPHEN: THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT UNVEILING HIS TWO NEW CHARACTERS: "MILITARY GUY" AND "DICTATOR GIVING A PRESS CONFERENCE." ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! SALLY FIELD IS HERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STICK AROUND!
Stephen: SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU, MY FRIEND. JON, I UNDERSTAND, UH, YOU ARE ACTUALLY -- IS IT TRUE THAT THIS SUNDAY AT THE ALL-STAR GAME, THE N.B.A. ALL-STAR GAME, YOU'RE DOING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GOING TO JAZZ IT UP OR JUST THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?
Jon: I'LL PUT A LITTLE FLAVOR ON IT.
Stephen: GREAT. GOOD LUCK. BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE OUR DEAR FRIEND, AND NATIONAL MELANIA TRUMP RESERVE, LAURA BENANTI. SHE AND HER HUSBAND PATRICK BROWN JUST WELCOMED THE BIRTH OF THEIR DAUGHTER ELLA ROSE BENANTI-BROWN. LAURA, WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR YOU AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR FRIEND MELANIA BACK HERE SOON. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I DID READ THAT WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS THE HOST OF A TALK SHOW, I'M IN A POSITION OF GREAT POWER. AND YET, THERE ARE THOSE EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN I. HISTORY'S MOST FEROCIOUS DESPOTS, LIKE GENGHIS KHAN. KIM JONG UN, AND KATE MIDDLETON. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, SHE'S RUTHLESS. THAT HAT CAME RIGHT FROM PRINCE WILLIAM'S SCALP. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL OF US HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON: ABSOLUTELY NO CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY, AND A BIG FURRY HAT! ( DRUM CADENCE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, MY PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
STEPHEN: NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MY HEAD, I REALLY FEEL LIKE GIVING A PRESS CONFERENCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANY PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. ( DRUM BEAT ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, IF SOMEONE AT A COCKTAIL PARTY SAYS, "HERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING...", WHAT THEY SAY MUST BE SOMETHING INTERESTING. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS YEAR'S OSCARS MUST TRAVEL BACK IN TIME AND GIVE THE 2006 BEST PICTURE OSCAR TO "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN." ( APPLAUSE ) "CRASH" WAS OKAY, BUT COME ON! ( APPLAUSE ) GINGER ALE AND ROOT BEER MUST HAVE ACTUAL ALCOHOL IN THEM OR BE RENAMED "GINGER DRINK" AND "BROWN TOO SWEET." ( APPLAUSE ) LET US ALL AGREE THAT VAPING WAS A PHASE AND NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FACE IT! FACE IT! YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE (BLEEP) A ROBOT. ( LAUGHTER ) HENCEFORTH, WHOMSOEVER REMOVES THE GOOD SCISSORS FROM THE KITCHEN WITHOUT RETURNING THEM SHALL BE SENTENCED TO MOWING THE LAWN USING THE BAD SCISSORS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF YOU GET MARRIED IN CLEVELAND, YOU MAY NOT CALL IT A DESTINATION WEDDING. YOU MUST CALL IT A LAYOVER WEDDING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) KIM JONG UN'S NEXT BALLISTIC MISSILE MUST BE FIRED AT THE GUY WHO GAVE HIM THAT HAIRCUT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) STARTING MONDAY, PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE MEANS THE PRESIDENT IS FOR SALE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FREE SHIPPING IF YOU'LL ALSO TAKE STEVE BANNON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SALLY FIELD. ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. FOLKS -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS WON OSCARS, EMMYS AND YOUR HEART. SHE NOW STARS ON BROADWAY IN "THE GLASS MENAGERIE." PLEASE WELCOME THE GREAT SALLY FIELD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
THAT OPENING WAS BRILLIANT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HADN'T HEARD THE PRESS CONFERENCE BECAUSE I WAS WORKING SO I GOT EXCERPTS FROM YOU, AND THEN YOUR COMMENT. THAT WAS BRILLIANT.
Stephen: A LOT OF IT WAS REFRESHING.
BRILLIANT AND HORRIFYING.
Stephen: EXCITING. EXCITING IS A WORD.
Stephen: EXCITING IS A WORD, YEAH. TERROR IS A FORM OF EXCITEMENT, ISN'T IT?
YEAH, TERROR MIGHT BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE WORD.
Stephen: DISOORIENTING, CAN'T FEEL MY FINGERS, SWEATING AT NIGHT --
THOSE ARE ALL THE RIGHT WORDS.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE LAST MARCH.
YES.
Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU GAVE ME A BIG OLD KISS.
I DID. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT WAS THAT DID IT? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN CALLED, SALLY.
I HAVEN'T CALLED. I WAS HORRIFIED I DID IT.
Stephen: I WASN'T. I WASN'T HORRIFIED AT ALL.
YOU WEREN'T?
Stephen: NO, MY WIFE WASN'T HAPPY.
I CAN IMAGINE. I CAN IMAGINE. I APOLOGIZED TO HER.
Stephen: OKAY. AND, WELL, YOU LIKED IT? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OF COURSE, I LIKED IT. I LIKE SALLY FIELD!
SO... WHAT'S NEW?
Stephen: I ALSO GOT A COLD AS A RESULT OF IT.
YOU HAD A COLD LAST TIME, TOO.
Stephen: NO, YOU GAVE ME A COLD.
YOU HAD IT ALL THIS TIME?
Stephen: NO, YOU GAVE ME LAST TIME.
I GAVE YOU THAT, BUT IT WAS ONE HELL OF A COLD! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IT WAS. ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH. ( PAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE LAST THING WE TALKED ABOUT HIS HILLARY CLINTON.
WE DID.
Stephen: SHE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND YOU ENDORSED HILLARY CLINTON.
SURE DID.
Stephen: TRUMP IS NOW PRESIDENT. PEOPLE LOVE A WINNER. YOU WANT TO BACK DONALD TRUMP?
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A NICE STEAMY PILE THAT YOU WERE --
Stephen: YEAH, ORGANIC. ORGANIC. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAND TO HIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S NO WAY TO BRING A NATION TOGETHER.
I'M SORRY, THE NATION IS IN DIRE TROUBLE.
Stephen: MM-HMM. MIGHT BE.
REAL, REAL TROUBLE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK MIGHT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER? HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY POLITICAL ACTIVITY SINCE LAST TIME? WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?
WELL, I HAVE BEEN ON STAGE, SO IT'S BEEN LIMITED.
Stephen: RIGHT. DID YOU GO TO THE WOMEN'S MARCHS?
I WENT TO MARCHS HERE, SPOKE AT GATHERINGS. I THINK, AS SOON AS I CAN, I WILL BE DOING WHATEVER I CAN. BUT I WAS SO INCREDIBLY MOVED TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT A MOMENT TO BREATHE, WHEN THE BAN HAPPENED, THEY WERE IN THEIR CARS, THEY WERE AT THE AIRPORTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH, IT WAS VERY NICE, WASN'T IT?
EVERYWHERE. EVEN IN LOS ANGELES, THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN TWO OR THREE HOURS TO GET THERE EVEN IF YOU'RE TWO OR THREE MILES AWAY.
Stephen: MM-HMM. EVERYBODY. AS HORRIFYING AS THIS IS -- AND IT REALLY IS -- TO SEE PEOPLE STANDING UP IN A WAY THAT I HAD NOT -- I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE AND EVEN IN THE '60s, AND I WAS THERE IN THE '60s, EXCEPT I WASN'T ONE OF THEM, I WAS DOING "THE FLYING NUN" AT THE TIME. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TRUE. WE COULD USE YOUR SUPER POWERS NOW.
YEAH. SHE COULD FLY BUT HAD NO SUPER POWERS WHATSOEVER.
Stephen: SHE COULD FLY. TRUST ME, IT WASN'T ALL THAT MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THE COMEDY YOU'RE DOING AND SEVERAL OTHERS IS SO INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT KIND OF -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT REALLY IS.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BY SEVERAL OTHERS, YOU MEAN MY RERUNS, RIGHT?
YES, ALL YOUR RERUNS. ALL THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS YOU BRING TO LIGHT.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YES.
Stephen: WELL, IT'S FUN. I ENJOY DOING THE SHOW BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. I'D GO CRAZY IF I COULDN'T COME HERE. SAME WAY HE'D GO CRAZY IF HE COULDN'T TALK TO PEOPLE.
AND HE GOES CRAZY WHEN HE TALKS TO PEOPLE.
Stephen: KIND OF LIKE THAT. SO YOU'RE ON TWITTER, FINALLY, I UNDERSTAND. ARE YOU A HACKTIVIST?
I'M A FLEDGLING TWITTER-ER.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR NAME? REAL MOMMA GUMP.
Stephen: YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK, RIGHT?
50/50.
Stephen: WHEN YOU GO INTO THE BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP COMPANY, DO YOU GET ANY TABLE YOU WANT? MOMMA GUMP IS HERE. TABLE, PLEASE. HAVE THE WAITER WASHED AND BROUGHT TO ME. ( LAUGHTER )
CAN I DO THAT?
Stephen: OH, YEAH. I WOULD LOVE TO GO DO THAT WITH YOU. THAT WOULD BE FUN. HARD TO GET A SEAT THERE SOMETIMES. SO LET ME SEE, YOU'RE NOT ON TWITTER UNTIL YOU --
WELL, I FOLLOW YOU.
Stephen: YOU FOLLOW ME? YES.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO GET INTO A TWITTER WAR.
I DON'T READ WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ME.
Stephen: ABOUT YOU? NO.
Stephen: SO I CAN ATTACK YOU ON TWITTER AND YOU WON'T KNOW.
I WON'T KNOW.
Stephen:@-- REAL MOMMA GUMP. I READ ALL THE STUFF YOU SAY.
Stephen: SALLY FIELD CAN'T REALLY FLY DESPITE LYING TO US FOR YEARS. HASH TAG.
ALTERNATIVE FACTS, YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE.
Stephen: HASHTAG, FAKE NONE.
YES.
Stephen: BACK WITH MORE SALLY FIELD. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH LOVELY AND TALENTED SALLY FIELD. SALLY.
YES.
Stephen: YOU'RE BACK ON BROADWAY AFTER 15 YEARS.
YES.
Stephen: DOING TENNESSEE WILLIAMS "THE GLASS MENAGERIE."
YEAH.
Stephen: THE PLAY WAS FIRST PERFORMED IN 1 1944. WHY DO YOU THINK THE STORY STILL HOLDS UP NOW?
IT'S BRILLIANT WRITING BY A YOUNG GENIUS, TENNESSEE WILLIAMS WAS. WHEN HE WROTE THE PLAY, IT WAS SO AVANT-GARDE WHAT HE SAW. IT'S REALLY BEEN DONE THE WAY HE -- IT'S RARELY BEEN DONE THE WAY HE ORIGINALLY WROTE IT BECAUSE AT THE TIME THEY WENT, H HUH? DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IT WAS BEFORE THE THEATER HAD COME IN AND CHANGED THE WAY THEATER CONTAINED ITSELF, HOW YOU CAN TELL A STORY. SO I THINK "THE GLASS MENAGERIE," SPECIFICALLY, OFFERS SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO COME AND REVISIT IT IN MANY WAYS, MANY HANDS. RIGHT NOWIST IN THE CAPABLE AND EXTRAORDINARY HANDS OF SAM GOLD, WHO IS THE DIRECTOR, WHO HAS A VISION OF WHAT STORY HE'S TELLING, WHICH IS EXACTLY "THE GLASS MENAGERIE" BUT HAS NOT BEEN QUITE SEEN THIS WAY BEFORE. AND I THINK IN SOME WEIRD WAYS, IT PERTAINS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD, IN THAT AMANDA HAS THESE TWO CHILDREN --
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER. -- MY CHARACTER, WHO ARE UNIQUE IN THEIR WAY, ONE OF THEM BEING A CLOSETED GAY WHO IS HAVING A HARD TIME AROUND HIS MOTHER WHO REFUSES TO SEE ANYTHING THAT ISN'T OF THE MIND OF THE SPIRIT, AND SHE WOULDN'T ALLOW THAT IN A MILLION YEARS. AND HER DAUGHTER WHO IS PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, IS PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED, BUT MORE THAN THAT, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE THINGS THAT HER MOTHER DID. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED AND, YOU KNOW, HAVE A MAN SUPPORT HER. SHE HAS MAYBE OTHER THINGS SHE WANTS TO DO. SO AMANDA IS THE GREAT KILLER OF DIFFERENCES. I THINK, YOU KNOW, AMANDA WANTS EVERYTHING TO BE THE WAY SHE CAN CONTAIN IT, SHE UNDERSTANDS IT, LET IT BE LIKE ME. LET BOTH MY CHILDREN BE THE WAY I WAS, THE WAY I CAN UNDERSTAND, AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IS LET'S GO AFTER THE OTHERS, ANYBODY THAT ISN'T EXACTLY GOING DOWN THIS ONE ROAD WHICH HAS BEEN SET UP AS THE RIGHT, WHITE ROAD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE ON STAGE?
OH, WHEN I WAS 12 IN SEVENTH GRADE.
Stephen: REALLY? 12?
YES, 12.
Stephen: WHAT PART DID YOU PLAY?
IT WAS IN SCENE STUDY. I HAD A SCENE FROM "BORN YESTERDAY."
Stephen: DID YOU PLAY JUDY HOLIDAY?
THE BLONDE BOMBSHELL. COMPLETE TYPE CASTING. HEIDI THE LITTLE GOAT GIRL TAKING A STAB AT MADEA OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY! BUT IT WAS MY FIRST SCENE AND I REMEMBER IT VIVIDLY.
Stephen: HOW DID IT GO? OH, IT WAS DREADFUL.
Stephen: WERE YOU IN THE SCHOOL PAGEANT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO, NO, I WAS VERY SHY.
Stephen: OH. WE WOULD HAVE CHRISTMAS PAGEANTS WHERE YOU HELD A CANDLE UNDER YOUR FACE AND WALKED DOWN AND SANG HOLY NIGHT OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: DID YOU DO THAT? WERE YOU THE VIRGIN MARY?
NO. I WAS ONE OF A HERD OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: FIRST TIME I WAS ON STAGE --
I HEARD YOU WERE BUTT NAKED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NO, NO. HONEY, HONEY, THAT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I WAS ON STAGE, THAT WAS JUST MY FAVORITE TIME ON STAGE.
OH, WELL, THAT WOULD DO IT.
Stephen: THE FIRST TIME I WAS ON STAGE IS I WAS THE FOURTH WISE MAN IN THE CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. I WAS THE FOURTH WISE MAN BECAUSE THE POWER WENT OFF AT OUR HOUSE AND MY MOM SPENT ALL THE TIME MAKING THE COSTUME AND MAKING THE BOX OF TREASURE THAT WE GOT TO THE CHURCH LATE. SHEP S.A.MY MOM SAID GET UP THER THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME ON STAGE. I WAS HOOKED. ( APPLAUSE ) LOVELY TO SEE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "THE GLASS MENAGERIE" OPENS MARCH 9 ON  BROADWAY AT THE BELASCO THEATRE. SALLY FIELD, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "SONS OF ANARCHY" AND "MAD MEN." NOW, SHE STARS IN SHOWTIME'S "BILLIONS."
IF YOU KNEW ENOUGH TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME YOU KNOW I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BUT THAT ISN'T THE SAME AS NOT WANTING TO.
YES, IT IS. THERE IS THIS THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE IN A ROOM TOGETHER. IT ALWAYS HAS, BOBBY, JUST FLOWS LIKE THIS. BUT I'M SHUTTING IT OFF. I HAVE SHUT IT OFF.
ALL RIGHT. FIRST, I APOLOGIZED. BUT IF IT TAKES ME SENDING YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY JOE DiMAGGIO STYLE TO PROVE IT, I WILL.
HE DID THAT AFTER MARILYN WAS DEAD. YOURS WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON ME HIS HAD ON HER.
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME MAGGIE SIFF! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: THE FIRST TIME -- I WON'T KISS YOU.
Stephen: MORE'S THE PITY. THE FIRST TIME WE MET WAS AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY AT CBS JUST THIS PAST CHRISTMAS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I KIND OF EMBARRASSED MYSELF A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOU SAID HI, I'M IN "BILLIONS," AND I SAID I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY WATCHED IT BECAUSE I TRIED TO WATCH THE FIRST ONE AND I PUT IN THE D.V.D. TO WATCH IT THEY GAVE ME WHEN GIAMATTI WAS ON AND THE FIRST SCENE IS HIM HOG TIED TON FLOOR AND A DOM MATRIX COMES IN AND PUTS HER BOOT ON HIS CHEST AND I TURNED IT OFF BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING WITH MY CHILDREN. AND YOU SAID?
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
Stephen: IT REVEALED SOMETHING ABOUT PAUL JI MATTIA BECAUSE HE TOLD ME IN THE SCENE WHERE H HE'S TIED UP ON THE FLOOR AND YOU PUT THE BOOT ON HIS CHEST, HE FELL ASLEEP WHEN YOU WERE SHOOTING THE SCENE. WERE YOU INSULTED IN ANY WAY?
NO, I WAS FASCINATED. I LEARN FROM HIM EVERY DAY.
Stephen: REALLY? YES.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF ROUGH STUFF IS GIAMATTI INTO IF HE CAN ASLEEP DURING A SCENE ABOUT S&M?
I THINK IT'S SUCH A NOVEL EXPERIENCE WITH HIM THAT HE SURRENDERED 100%. IT WAS OUR FIRST DAY SHOOTING TOGETHER EVER.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY? THE FIRST SCENE?
YES, STUB THE CIGARETTE OUT ON YOUR CHEST. YES, SO I WAS AWAKE FOR THE BOTH OF US. I WAS JUST, LIKE, OKAY, YOU RELAX AND I I WILL TRY NOT TO KILL YOU WITH MY STILETTO AND DANGLING CIGARETTE BECAUSE YOU'RE A NATIONAL TREASURE AND CO-WORKER.
Stephen: MM-HMM. BUT I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT SOMEBODY LIKE HIM. YOU KNOW, HE'S SO BRAVE. HE'S SO CURIOUS. HE'D NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE, AND HE'S, LIKE, THAT'S FASCINATING, LET'S GO! I WAS, LIKE, LET'S GO DO THIS THING!
Stephen: HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR THAT ROLE? DO YOU DO A RAID ALONG? ( LAUGHTER ) I'M CURIOUS, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET IT RIGHT, I ASSUME.
YEAH, YOU DO. I TALKED TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT WORLD.
Stephen: PEOPLE IN THE LIFESTYLE.
PEOPLE IN THE LIFESTYLE, YES.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT, WE CALL IT THE LIFESTYLE ). TALKING IN A LOW VOICE ). YOU SHOULD COME DOWN SOME TIME. ( LAUGHTER )
WE DO HAVE A CONSULTANT ON SET.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A DOMINATRIX CONSULTANT ON THE SET.
WE DO.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE?
I THINK YOU NEED ONE. THE LITTLE I'VE SEEN.
Stephen: WHAT DOES HE OR SHE DO, I ASSUME?
SHE. SHE -- WELL, SHE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH US ABOUT SORT OF THE LIFESTYLE AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CHARACTERS WHICH IS WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN, BUT ALSO IN THE SCENES WHICH WERE A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT, WHICH I'M NOT A PART OF. WHEN THEY GO INTO CLUBS, THERE IS MACHINERY INVOLVED AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: WOW, YOU ALSO HAVE A MECHANIC ON SET.
WELL, SHE KIND OF TAKES CARE OF ALL THAT. SHE'S THE MECHANIC DOMINATRIX.
Stephen: SO WHAT DOES THIS PERSON SAY, NO, NO, THAT WOULD BEEN RIGHT. DOES SHE GIVE YOU ADVICE, NAH, DON'T DO IT THAT WAY?
HONESTLY, FOR MY PART, BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS, IT'S SORT OF A FACET OF THEIR MARRIAGE, AND THEY'RE NOT PROFESSIONAL, YOU KNOW, DOM-SUBTYPES SO THEY FIGURE IT OUT AS THEY GO ALONG. I TALKED TO HER ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY.
Stephen: IT'S A HOBBY. IT'S HOBBIEST QUESTIONS.
Stephen: THE SERIES IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND THERE IS RACE CARS AND THERE'S MANSIONS. DO YOU FLIP THROUGH THE SCRIPT AND SAY WHAT FUN THING, WHAT TOYS DO I GET TO PLAY WITH THIS WEEK?
I WOULD BE THE WORST BILLIONAIRE ON THE PLANET.
Stephen: NO, NO, DONALD TRUMP IS THE WORST BILLIONAIRE ON THE PLANET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE RIGHT.
Stephen: SO YOU DON'T LIKE TO PLAY WITH THE TOYS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
I WOULDN'T BE A MALIGNANT, NARCISSISTIC BILLIONAIRE.
Stephen: UH-HUH. I THINK I WOULD GIVE MY BILLIONS AWAY. I DON'T KNOW REALLY KNOW HOW TO SPEND MONEY AND I DON'T HAVE A VERY GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE. I'M THE MOTHER OF A TODDLER.
Stephen: YOU'RE A MOTHER OF A TODDLER?
YES. SO I SPLIT MY LIFE BETWEEN PUTTING ON THESE CLOTHES AND BEING HIGH-POWERED SUPERWOMAN AND I GO HOME AND I'M COVERED IN MARKER AND PUKE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A CONSULTANT FOR THAT, TOO? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU PLAY A LOT OF CHARACTERS. "SONS OF ANARCHY," "MAD MEN." YOU SAY PLAYING WOMEN CAN SOMETIMES BE A POLITICAL ACT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN SORT OF DENIGRATING MYSELF AS A PERFORMER. YOU'RE, LIKE, I'M JUST AN ENTERTAINER, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BUT I WORKED WITH A FILMMAKER RECENTLY WHO SAID, WHEN YOU ARE ON SCREEN AND YOU'RE REPRESENTING WOMEN, IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TIME CAPSULE, IT GETS SHIPPED OUT THROUGH CULTURE AND WHO YOU ARE IN TIME AND HOW YOU STAND UP TO THOSE ROLES IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT. SO I TAKE THAT IN. I'VE GOT TON PLAY SOME CHARACTERS THAT ARE VERY --
Stephen: THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE TO PUT ON YOURSELF.
IT IS. AND I DON'T FOR THE MOST PART. WHEN I STEP LACK AND THINK ABOUT IT, I THINK, IN A WAY, IT CAN BE A POLITICAL ACT. TO PLAY A CHARACTER EVEN ON A SHOW LIKE "SONS OF ANARCHY" WHICH IS SORT OF MACHO, BUT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO STANDS UP AND HAS, YOU KNOW, CAN STRING A LOT OF SENTENCES TOGETHER AND HAS CLEAR THOUGHTS AND CAN BE CEREBRAL AND FIERCE AND POWERFUL SOMETIMES. I'LL TAKE IT. THAT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AND SOMEWHAT POLITICAL.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH THE TIME CAPSULE. ( APPLAUSE )
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
Stephen: YES, YOU DO. SEASON 2 OF "BILLIONS" PREMIERS THIS SUNDAY ON SHOWTIME. MAGGIE SIFF, EVERYBODY! BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY LADY ANTEBELLUM! STICK AROUND!
