Stephen: WAIT A MINUTE, I SEE WHAT IS GOING TO GO ON AM WILL YOU GO EASY ON HIM BECAUSE YOU ARE BOTH BILLIONAIRES, THIS IS A BILLIONAIRE BRO CLUB.
COME ON, I GOT TWICE AS MUCH, AS LEAST TWICE AS MUCH BUT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HE IS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE SEW DESERVES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RESPECT.
Stephen: YEAH, I GUESS-- YOU KNOW WHAT, MARK, I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, I GUESS YOU ARE RIGHT.
GNAW, I GOT TO TAKE THE GLOVES OFF! JIMMY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HITS IT!

Stephen: WHOOO!

HEY, DONALD, DONALD. YOUR COMPANIES FAIL SO OFTEN, YOU MUST HAVE GONE TO BUSINESS SCHOOL AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY! OH, DONALD, HE JUST DROPPED YOU LIKE ONE OF YOUR FIRST TWO WIVES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU'RE SHINY, ORANGE AND EMPTY INSIDE. I WOULD SAY YOU ARE A TRAFFIC CONE BUT I WOULD SWERVE TO AVOID A TRAFFIC CONE. OH!
Stephen: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK, KEUSHAN. -- CUBAN.
DONALD, YOU KNOW THAT TO BE A BILLIONAIRE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BILLION PART IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. NOT JUST THE AIR.
Stephen: YOU JUST FELL IN THE SHARK TANK.
DONALD, I KNOW YOU HAVE NO SHOT WITH HISPANICS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL YOU'RE GETTING THE CUBAN VOTE.
Stephen: WHOOO!
DONALD, THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE WORTH $10 BILLION IS IF I PAID YOU NINE AND A HALF BILLION TO WASH MY BALLS!
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES TONY GOLDWYN, MARK CUBAN, AND LEWIS BLACK. FEATURING JON BATISTE AN STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE FROM THE SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016--   Captioning sponsored by CBS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHOOO! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHOOO, WHOOO, WHOOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW! THANKS SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, IT IS NIGHT THREE OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU-- YOU GUYS WAMPED LAST NIGHT-- THE SHOW, YEAH. YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE CHEERED MORE. NOW LAST NIGHT I SAID THE CONVENTION WAS GOING SO SMOOTHLY, AND I COMPLAINED IT WAS BORING. WELL, OOPSA CABADRA. TONIGHT THE CONVENTION BUS TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN AND PLUNGED INTO EXCITEMENT CANYON. LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED. WE STARTED OUT TODAY COUNTING DOWN TILL TOMORROW WHEN DONALD TRUMP WILL FINALLY SPEAK FOR THE FOURTH TIME. (LAUGHTER) AND DONALD MADE A TRIUMPHANT ENTRANCE INTO CLEVELAND THIS AFTERNOON, COMPLETE WITH HIS OWN THEME SONG. ♪ (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT ACTUAL SONG, THAT THEY WERE PUMPING OUT OF THE HELICOPTER. IT IS THE THEME FROM THE MOVIE "AIR FORCE QUUN--" ONE "I ASSUME BECAUSE LIKE HARRISON FORD DONALD TRUMP IS A FAMOUS PERSON PRETENDING TO BE THE PRESIDENT. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: GET OFF OF MY AIRPLANE!
Jon: THAT'S HAR ISON.
Stephen: THAT'S MY HARRISON FORD IMPRESSION. DONALD DID NOT FLY TO CLEVELAND ON THE HELICOPTER, THAT'S FOR LOSERS. NO, MIGHT AS WELL TAKE A BUS. HE THROUGH TRUMP FORCE ONE, HIS PLANE WITH HIS NAME ON THE SIDE TO CLEVELAND TO GET ON HIS HELICOPTER TO FLY TO A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PART OF CLEVELAND, SLIGHTLY WASTEFUL OF FUEL. IT WOULD BE EASIER JUST TO GET OUT AND STAB A PENGUIN IN THE HEART. MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE, TED CRUZ WAS GETTING READY FOR HIS BIG SPEECH TONIGHT BY GIVING ANOTHER SPEECH, WHICH GOT SLIGHTLY UPSTAGED.
OUR PARTY NOW HAS A NOMINEE. AND I DON'T KNOW-- ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS PRETTY WELL ORCHESTRATE ED! JEFF, DID YOU E-MAIL THEM TO FLY THE PLANE RIGHT WHEN I SAID THAT?
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. YOU COULD ALMOST SEE TRUMP IN THE PILOT'S WINDOW DOING THIS. (LAUGHTER) YES, TRUMP'S PLANE FLEW RIGHT BEHIND CRUZ IN THE MIDDLE OF TED CRUZ'S RALLY. IT REALLY MAKES YOU WONDER WHY IS TED CRUZ STILL HOLDING RALLIES AGAIN? (LAUGHTER) OKAY. SO IT WAS A BIT OF A-- A BIT OF A SCREW YOU. A BIT OF A SCREW YOU BUT AS THEY SAY IN TEXAS, REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED CON QUESO BECAUSE TONIGHT IN HIS PRIM TIME SPEECH, TED CRUZ DID NOT ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. AND THE TRUMP DELEGATES WERE ENFEUGO.
WE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF OUR MOMENT. TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, TO PROTECT OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS. EVEN IF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DON'T AGREE.
Stephen: CHAOS. YOU COULD BARELY HEAR CRUZ TALKING. THE CRUZ PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING THE TRUMP PEOPLE. AND I BELIEVE-- HAVE WE GOTTEN IT? YES, WE'VE GOTTEN A REVERSE SHOT OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: FROM NOW ON, FROM NOW ON IT WILL BE KNOWN AS THE RED CONVENTION. AND AGAIN, KEEP IN MIND, HOW-- I CAN'T IMPRESS UPON YOU HOW CRAZY THIS IS. HE WAS THE PRIME TIME SPEAKER AND HE DID NOT ENDORSE THE CANDIDATE. THAT'S LIKE BEING THE BEST MAN AT A WEDDING AND TOASTING THE GROOM BY SAYING, HEY, BUDDY, YOU'LL FIND A GOOD ONE EVENTUALLY. YEAH, YEAH. (APPLAUSE) YEAH. MAYBE WITHOUT SUCH BIG KANGELS, OKAY, AFTER-- THAT WAS THE BESTMAN, NOT ME. I WAS IN CHARACTER. NOW AFTER THE CRUZ MISSILE HIT ITS TARGET WE HEARD FROM ERIC TRUMP SEEN HERE GIVING A SPEECH IN FRONT OF AMERICA'S BRIGHT FUTURE. AND I ENDORSED HIS FATHER'S PLANS FOR THIS NATION.
IT'S TIME FOR A PRESIDENT WHO CAN MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AHEAD OF BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TOO.
Stephen: YES. (LAUGHTER) AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. YES, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. DONALD TRUMP WILL END AMERICA SOONER THAN WE THOUGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: BUT OF COURSE TONIGHT WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MIKE PENCE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT YEAR IS IT? (LAUGHTER) OKAY. PENCE IN HIS SPEECH WASTED NO TIME PRAISING DONALD.
HE'S A MAN KNOWN FOR A LARGE PERSONALITY, A COLORFUL STYLE AND LOTS OF CHARISMA. AND SO I GUESS HE WAS JUST LOOKING FOR SOME BALANCE ON THE TICKET.
Stephen: YES. YES, HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. (APPLAUSE) ADDING PENCE REALLY BALANCES THE TRUMP TICKET. CRAZY BORING 2016. (APPLAUSE) BUT AS A FAMILY VALUES CONSERVATIVE, PENCE HAD ONE WARNING.
HISTORY TEACHES US THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES EVIL.
Stephen: YES. WEAKNESS AROUSES EVIL. AND AMERICA MUST BE STRONG OR WE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY EVIL BONERS. YOU KNOW, AND PENCE--  (APPLAUSE) WEAKNESS, WEAKNESS IS THE VYING RA OF EVIL. AND THEN PENCE LAID OUT HIS CREDENTIALS.
I'M A CHRISTIAN, A CONSERVATIVE AND A REPUBLICAN, IN THAT ORDER.
Stephen: YES, IN THAT ORDER. FOURTH I'M A LIST MAKER, FIFTH I'M A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE HE FORE GOT TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. AND SIXTH, SIXTH, I'M A TACKLING DUMBEE IN A SUIT. BRING IT OUT HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, SIR. WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT PENCE'S BACKGROUND. HIS FAMILY, HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND BELIEFS. NO QUESTION WAS LEFT UNANSWERED EXCEPT FOR ONE. WHO'S MIKE PENCE AGAIN? (LAUGHTER) WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I'LL TELL YOU, FOLKS, GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE WAS BORN IN COLUMBUS, INDIANA ONE MORNING WHEN I BELIEVE LIGHTNING STRUCK A JAR OF MAYONNAISE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I'M BEING UPSTAGED BY AN INANIMATE OBJECT OVER THERE, I CAN'T ARE THAT. AS A CHILD PENCE WAS AN OVERACHIEVER WHO WAS ONCE EVEN AWARDED A TROPHY FOR BEST DENIM JUMP SUIT. AND PENCE WILL BE A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD BIG IDEAS. FOR INSTANCE, IN 2001 HE WROTE AN OP ED SAYING DESPITE THE HYSTERIA FROM THE POLITICAL CLATION AND THE MEDIA, SMOKING DOESN'T KILL. WHY? BECAUSE TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE SMOKERS DOES NOT DIE FROM A SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESS. IT'S TRUE. NO, IT'S TRUE. SMOKING DOESN'T KILL YOU IF YOU DON'T COUNT THE PEOPLE WHO DIED FROM SMOKING. JUST 33%. BUT IT'S NOT JUST SMOKING. IT IS NOT JUST SMOKING, FOLKS. PENCE HAD HIS EYE ON ANOTHER ISSUE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE. THE MOVIE MULAN. IN 1999 HE PENNED ANOTHER OP ED CLAIMING THE FILM WAS TOO POLITICAL, SAYING QUOTE, SOME MISS CHIEFOUS LIBERAL AT DISNEY ASSUMES THAT MULAN'S STORY WILL CAUSE A QUIET CHNG IN THE NEXT GENERATION'S ATTITUDE ABOUT WOMEN IN COMBAT. OH, HE'S RIGHT, NO, IT'S SUBTLE BRAIN WASHING. THE SAME WAY DISNEY IS KNOWN FOR PROMOTING HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS, PLURAL MARRIAGE AND BESTIALITY. (APPLAUSE) BE OUR GUEST, BE OUR GUEST. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) IN 2015 PENCE IGNITED A FUROR WHEN HE SIGNED INDIANA'S RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT WHICH ALLOWED BUSINESSES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST LGBT PATRON-- PATRONS BUT HE WAS JUST FOLLOWING THE OLD SAYING, THE CUSTOMER'S ALWAYS STRAIGHT. NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE SAYING, I DON'T CARE ABOUT MIKE PENCE. INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP. BUT IF TRUMP AND PENCE WIN, YOU WILL CARE ABOUT PENCE BECAUSE THERE IS HUGE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NEWS JUST OUT TODAY. YOU SEE, WHEN TRUMP WAS VETTING OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH AS A POSSIBLE RUNNING MATE, HIS SON, DONALD TRUMP, JR., ASKED GOVERNOR KASICH, DID HE HAVE ANY INTEREST IN BEING THE MOST POWERFUL VICE PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A VICE PRESIDENT WHO WAS HALF MACHINE AND GOT AWAY WITH SHOOTING PEOPLE IN THE FACE. (APPLAUSE) AND APPARENTLY WHEN KASICH'S ADVISOR ASKED HOW THIS WOULD BE THE CASE, DONALD, JR. EXPLAINED THAT HIS FATHER'S VICE PRESIDENT WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY. THEN WHAT, THE ADVISOR ASKED, WOULD TRUMP BE IN CHARGE OF. MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. NOW I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF YOU OUT THERE THINK TRUMP ISN'T QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. WELL, ISN'T IT COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP AGREES WITH YOU. WE'VE GOT A HUGE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WHEN WE COME BACK, I WILL TAKE YOU TO A REPUBLICAN PARTY I WENT TO IN CLEVELAND. MET SOME GREAT PEOPLE. THEN TONY GOLDWYN, MARK CUBAN AND LEWIS BLACK. STICK AROUND. WHOOO! (APPLAUSE). ♪ WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. NOW JON, JON, FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ENJOYING IT SO FAR, YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST WITH THE BAND, TELL THE PEOPLE AT HOME WHO WE HAVE HERE.
Jon: YES, INDEED. WE HAVE THE LEGENDARY WYCLEF JEAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
Jon: Y'ALL GOT TO COME CHECK HIM OUT. HE'S PLAYING AT THE OZZY FUTION FEST THIS WEEKEND.
THAT'S RIGHT, GOING TO BE IN NEW YORK CITY THIS SATURDAY, COME CHECK ME OUT, BABY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NOW NOW IF MOST PEOPLE, THE CLOSEST YOU WILL GET TO ONE OF THESE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS IS TO WATCH THEM ON TV. BUT I HAD THE CHANCE TO GO DOWN TO CLEVELAND THIS WEEK AND ACTUALLY MEET THE DELEGATES WHO NOMINATED DONALD TRUMP. I GOT TO SAY, THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO DESERVE A BETTER CANDIDATE. AND WE HAD A BLAST. TAKE A LOOK. THIS WEEK I ATTENDED THE RNC'S OFFICIAL WELCOME PARTY IT WAS A VERY EXCLUSIVE AFFAIR, ONLY 12,000 PEOPLE WERE INVITED.
YOU ORIGINALLY SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.
I'M A GEL DELEGATE FOR DONALD RUMP. WAS HE YOUR FIRST CHOICE.
NO.

NO WHICH CHOICE WAS DONE ALD TRUMP FOR YOU?
OKAY, THERE WERE WAY TOO MANY CANDIDATES IN THE FIELD.
Stephen: TELL ME.

Stephen: OKAY. SEVEN. ANYONE AROUND HERE WHO WAS AN ORIGINAL TRUMP SUPPORTER? WHAT IF SOMEHOW RONALD REAGAN JUST SHOWED UP ON THE FLOOR OF THE CONVENTION RIGHT NOW? WOULD YOU STILL GO WITH TRUMP? OR WOULD YOU GO WITH REANIMATED REAGAN?
NO, BECAUSE HE'S KIND OF SIMILAR IN WAYS.
Stephen: SO YOU'D STILL GO WITH TRUMP?
I WOULD.
Stephen: IF REAGAN CAME BACK- -
AND I LOVE REAGAN.
Stephen: --FROM THE AFTERLIFE-- I UNDERSTAND. CAME BACK FROM THE AFTERLIFE AND HE SAID, "I AM HERE TO SAVE AMERICA," YOU'D STILL SAY, "THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I'M GOING WITH DONALD'?
TODAY, WE NEED A CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: EVEN IF IT WAS REAGAN. YOU UNDERSTAND HE'S COME BACK FROM HEAVEN.

DID OR DID NOT THE NOMINEE OF YOUR PARTY SAY THE FOLLOWING: "MY FINGERS ARE LONG AND BEAUTIFUL; IT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED ARE VARIOUS OTHER PARTS OF MY BODY."

I DON'T THINK HE SAID THAT.
Stephen: TRUMP.
HE SAID IT?
OH NO.
Stephen: COME ON.
Stephen: HE DID. HE SAID IT. I'M NOT MAKING THIS STUFF UP, LEGALLY I CAN'T. I'M ON TELEVISION. HEY MAN! TRUMP OR FALSE-- OKAY. I CAN DUNK A BASKETBALL. VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT, BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE?
I'LL SAY TRUE.
Stephen: FALSE. HE CANNOT DUNK A BASKETBALL, I'M SO SORRY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THE FEELING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HE CAN DO ANYTHING.
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE CAN DUNK A BASKETBALL. HE MAY NOT BE BLACK, HE MAY-- BUT HE CAN DUNK--

Stephen: NOW I DID THE SAME THING THAT EVERYBODY DOES, I'M SURE. I COULDN'T FIGHT THE URGE TO CALL YOU MR. PRESIDENT WHEN YOU WALKED OUT HERE.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: HOW DID THAT FEEL? CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL?
I CAN. WE SHOULD-- THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO GET MY JOB.
Stephen: RIGHT. MAYBE HE COULD ACTUALLY JUST HAVE YOUR JOB BECAUSE IF WE PUT HIM ON TV AS PRESIDENT, HE MIGHT NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE WE COULD PULL THAT OFF, EXCEPT I'M NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP MY JOB. MY JOB IS TOO MUCH HAVE. DONALD CANNOT HAVE IT.
Stephen: YOU DO HAVE A GOOD JOB.
THE CAST WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: ALSO, YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT A LOT ON SCANDAL. AND I'M NOT SURE-- WHILE WE'RE AT IT, THERE YOU GO. IS THERE A RULE IN SHONDA RHYMES CREATED THIS SHOW, IS THERE A RULE IN SHONDALAND THAT THE MEN TAKE OFF THEIR CLOTHES AND THE THE WOMEN DON'T.
THE RULE EXACTLY AS QUOTED TO ME IS IN SHONDALAND THE WOMEN CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THE BOYS HAVE TO TAKE OFF THEIR CLOTHES WHEN SHONDA TELLS THEM TOO TO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE RIGHT HERE, HOW OLD ARE YOU?
HOW OLD AM I?
Jon: HOW OLD ARE YOU.
56.
Stephen: YOU GO TO HELL. I'M 52 AND I WON'T TAKE OFF MY SHOES IN PUBLIC. IF YOU FEEL AN URGE TA TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT AT ANY POINT DURING THIS INTERVIEW, PLEASE DON'T LET US STOP YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I WILL LET YOU KNOW.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU ACT ON THIS SHOW, BUT YOU ALSO DIRECT ON THIS SHOW. AND AGAIN, THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF STEAMY STUFF ON THE SHOW.
HAVE I ACTUALLY DIRECTED MY OWN STEAMY STUFF WHICH IS REALLY WEIRD.
Stephen: YOU DIRECTED YOURSELF IN A LOVE SCENE.
YEAH, ACTUALLY I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST EPISODE I EVER DIRECTED. I HAD THIS BIG LOVE SCENE WITH KERRY WASHINGTON, THIS REALLY IMPORTANT REUNION BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS. AND IT WAS-- IT WAS REALLY AWKWARD TO TALK KERRY THROUGH HOW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SEX. I MEAN JUST IMAGINE-- IMAGINE THAT IN REAL LIFE. LIKE OKAY, HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO GO, YOU OKAY WITH THAT, YOU COMFORTABLE. HERE IS WHAT I WILL DO AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SAY I'M SORRY, WE HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN.
Stephen: WELL, NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO IT AGAIN, TONY.
WELL-- (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S TRUE, STEPHEN.
Stephen: ESPECIALLY AT YOUR AGE, TONY. THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. I MEAN I MEAN DO YOU EVER LIKE IN THE MIDDLE GO LET'S MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT. MAYBE IT'S THE GUY'S BIRTHDAY. LET'S MAKE IT A LITTLE CRAZIER. HOW DOES SHE TAKE THAT? BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE BOTH IN THE SCENE AND OUT OF THE SCENE AT THE SAME TIME.
YEAH. SHE GENERALLY TAKES IT WELL. SHE'S VERY-- (LAUGHTER) MOVE ON.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. I GOT ONE OTHER, ONE OTHER PICTURE HERE. THIS IS NOT QUITE AS-- THIS YOU AND HILLARY CLINTON.
THAT'S RIGHT, UH-HUH, RIGHT. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YOU ARE OFFICIALLY, ARE YOU KNOWN, HAVE I BEEN TOLD THAT YOU ARE A SURROGATE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND IS IT PAINFUL?
HOW DO YOU BECOME A SURROGATE.
IT MEANS I'M A FAKE HILLARY CLINTON.
Stephen: SO YOU SAY SOMETHING AND PEOPLE GO OH, TONY GOLDWYN SAID IT, HE IS THE SURROGATE OF HILLARY CLINTON, IF YOU SAY SOMETHING BAD, SHE'S IN TROUBLE.
BUT I DON'T SAY BAD THINGS. I SAY NICE THINGS.
Stephen: ARE YOU SUR GATING RIGHT NOW.
I WILL SURROGATE RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: SURROGATE.
I AM GOING TO SURROGATED. I GO AND I TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND WHY I SUPPORT HER. AND WHY I THINK-- FEEL VERY STRNGLY THAT SHE SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HONESTLY WHAT I DO IS I JUST TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHY I FEEL THAT WAY. AND TELL HER STORY BECAUSE SHE GETS KIND OF A BAD RAP FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IF YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING. AND I KNOW YOU HAVE.
Stephen: SURE.
THE VENOM HAS BEEN SPEUING. I KIND OF AM TELLING THE REAL STORY, IF YOU ACTUALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND LOOK AT WHAT THE WOMAN HAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE PAST 40 YEARS.
Stephen: BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE A SURROGATE, CAN I TRUST WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW IN YOUR SURROGATE MODE, NOT YOUR TONY GOLDWYN MODE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, BECAUSE WHEN I SEE A SURROGATE-- ON A NEWS SHOW I GO THAT IS A SURROGATE FOR HILLARY. OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO SAY THAT.
YEAH, WELL-- .
Stephen: DO YOU SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE YOUR OWN MAN.
I'M NOT MY OWN MAN. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER QUESTION. THIS PHOTO, DID IT IN THE NEXT FRAME WAS IT ANYTHING LIKE THIS PHOTO RIGHT HERE? (LAUGHTER) I KNOW THIS IS SHONDALAND, THIS IS SHONDALAND, WHAT ARE THE RULES IN HILLARY CLAND?
IN HILLARYLAND TONY MUST KEEP HIS CLOTHES ON IS.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT IS WHAT SURROGATES DO.
WE DO IT WOULD NOT GO WELL IF I DID THAT. I PROBABLY WOULDN'T-- WE'LL JUST LEAVE THAT ONE RIGHT THERE, OKAY?
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, GOOD LUCK SURROGATING FOR HILLARY CLINTON. GOOD LUCK WITH THE WHOLE CLOTHES THING.
I WILL TRY TO KEEP THEM ON SUZ GOOD LUCK WITH ALL THE CRAZY THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN SHONDALAND. WE'LL BE WATCHING. THANK YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MARK CUBAN. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU WYCLEF. THANK YOU, JON. MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS A BILLIONAIRE WITH A B, WHO OWNS THE DALLAS MAVERICKS AND STARS ON SHARK TANK. PLEASE WELCOME MARK CUBAN. (APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO BE BACK.
Stephen: YOU HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED SOME OF YOUR OPINIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP HERE TONIGHT. BUT I WANT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT TO YOU, MY FRIEND. IN JULY OF 2015 YOU SAID QUOTE, TRUMP IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO POLITICS IN A LONG TIME. I DON'T CARE WHAT HIS ACTUAL POSITIONS ARE, BUT LAST NIGHT ON TWITTER YOU OFFICIALLY JOINED THE NEVER TRUMP CLUB. WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU? WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU? WHY WAS IT THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO POLITICS AND NOW HE'S THE NEVER TRUMP.
AT THE BEGINNING HE WAS A BUSINESS PERSON AND I WANTED TO SEE A CHANGE FROM THE TRADITIONAL POLITICIAN. BUT THEN HE WENT AND OPENED HIS MOUTH. YOU KNOW. I MEAN HE HAD A REALLY GOOD CHANCE TO BE DIFFERENT AND REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE THINGS AM BUT HE DOESN'T DO THE WORK. HE'S LAZY.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE. YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE, HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. IN THE BILLIONAIRE WORLD, WHAT'S THE TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP? LIKE WHEN YOU GUYS ALL GET TOGETHER TO BE BILLIONAIRES TOGETHER, LIKE HOW DO YOU GUYS TREAT HIM?
WELL, IN THE MEETING WE VOTED HIM OUT.
Stephen: HE DOESN'T GET TO COME TO THE MEETINGS ANY MORE?
NO MEETINGS. WE LITERALLY CHANGED THE SECRET HANDSHAKE.
Stephen: CAN YOU TEACH IT TO ME A LITTLE LATER? (LAUGHTER) I DON'T LIKE-- SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE NOT SHAKING HANDS. (LAUGHTER) WHERE DO THE BILLIONAIRES MEET, BY THE WAY? IS IT LIKE AT THE PRIVATE JET, LIKE, HANGAR, IS THAT WHERE YOU GUYS HANG?
WHOEVER HAS THE BIGGEST JET AT THE TIME OR GETS A NEW JET, WE WILL JUST FLY AROUND.
Stephen: AND SHOW IT TO PEOPLE.
YOU GOT TO WHIP IT OUT AND SHOW YOUR JET.
Stephen: HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SAY AND NOT REALLY A BILLIONAIRE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? DO YOU THINK HE'S REALLY A BILLIONAIRE OR NOT A BILLIONAIRE?
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DEBT HE HAS. BUT I WILL GIVE HIMMED CREDIT. HE'S A BILLIONAIRE, FINE. MORE POWER TO HIM, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: HE'S A BILLIONAIRE, FINE.
WHO CARES, RIGHT? WHO CARES.
Stephen: THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY TO YOU, YOU ARE A BILLIONAIRE.
MORE POWER TO YOU.
Stephen: YOU ARE A BILLIONAIRE. YOU HAVE GOT OPINIONS. WHY DON'T YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. HAVE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
Stephen: ANY OTHER OFFICE LIKE SENATOR.
NO, NO,.
Stephen: STRAIGHT TO THE TOP.
STRAIGHT TO THE TOP. BUT I JUST DON'T WANT TO PUT MY FAMILY THROUGH IT MY SIXIER OLD, I TALK ABOUT IT WITH MY FAMILY, MY SIX YEAR OLD JAKE LOVES THE IDEA BUT IT'S A LOT OF SCRUTINY AND MY KIDS ARE YOUNG. I WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM. TYPICALLY I JUST DISLIKE POLITICS. BUT THIS YEAR IT'S SUCH A MESS AND WITH TRUMP GETTING SO INVOLVED, I WAS ASKED. I WAS ASKED BY A COUPLE OF SENATORS TO START A THIRD PARTY RUN. BUT IF I HAD DONE THAT, THEN THE WAY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WORKS, IF I WOULD HAVE WON ANY STATES, IT WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR TRUMP. SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE.
Stephen: OKAY. SO YOU WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA.
YUP.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL HAVE FRIENDS BACK IN INDIANA.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT PENCE? ANY GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT HIM?
ABOUT PENCE? (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: A REASONABLE QUESTION? IT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION.
THE NEXT TIME I'M DRINKING IN BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA, I WILL ASK THEM ABOUT MIKE PENCE. BUT THE NEXT TIME WILL BE THE FIRST TIME.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SO NOW ON SHARK TANK YOU GUYS GRILL PRETTY HARD THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROPOSING THEIR IDEAS.
YEAH, WE DO.
Stephen: YOU DO A LOT OF RESEARCH AND EVERYTHING. IF SOMEONE WAS COMING TO YOU AND YOU ARE DECIDING WHO GETS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, WHAT QUESTIONS WOULD YOU ASK CANDIDATES. LIKE HOW WOULD YOU VET THEM?
ONE, I WOULD WANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE HE'S DONE BUSINESS WITH. SO IF YOU NOTICE WITH TRUMP, IN THE WHOLE CONVENTION THING, NONE OF HIS BUSINESS PARTNERS ARE COMING FORWARD. THEY'RE NOT COMING FORWARD TO SPEAK. THEY'RE NOT COMING FORWARD IN THE MEDIA TO SAY GOOD THINGS ABOUT HIM. THEY'RE NOT COMING FORWARD TO GIVE HIM MONEY. SO THAT IS ONE RED CHECK MARK. SO I WOULD FIND OUT ABOUT THAT. I WOULD TALK TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE HE'S DONE-- HE'S DONE PROJECTS FOR, RIGHT? TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS THEIR EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER DONE BUSINESS WITH HIM?
ONE TIME. I HAD GIVE AND TAKE WITH HIM. BUT WE DID AN MMA PROJECT ABOUT 2009, I THINK, JUST A LITTLE DEAL. BUT NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE.
Stephen: WOULD YOU DO BUSINESS WITH HIM AGAIN, BILLIONAIRE TO BILLIONAIRE.
YEAH, I MEAN, AS LONG AS HE DOES WHAT I TELL HIM TO DO, I'M FINE WITH IT.
Stephen: MARK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. MARK CUBAN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OUR FRIENDS LEWIS BLACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN COMPLAIN BEING POLITICAL CONVENTIONS SINCE 19 THE 6. PLEASE WELCOME BACK OUR BEAUTIFUL FRIEND LEWIS BLACK. (APPLAUSE). ♪ GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MY FRIEND.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: FIRST QUESTION, I HAVE TO ASK, ARE YOU SCRUBBING UP FOR SURGERY OR-- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE, MY FRIEND.
WELL, I LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
Stephen: YEAH.
YOU SAID WATCH THE CONVENTION AND THEN COME ON DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT.
Stephen: SURE.
I DON'T WEAR A SUIT WHEN I'M AT HOME. I DON'T DRESS UP TO WATCH THOSE IDIOTS! I-- I PUT ON MY PAJAMAS.
Stephen: YES.
NORMALLY, BUT SINCE I'VE GOT TO WORK, NORMALLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M WATCHING THE CONVENTIONS, I LIKE TO GET A MORE FEEN DRIP. I GO TO MY COUCH AND LET IT DRIP OVER ME. SOMETIMES WHEN I GET REALLY ANGRY I LIKE TO TEAR OFF MY CLOTHES, RUN AROUND NAKED AND SCREAM LIKE A BANSHEE.
Stephen: YOU MIGHT FIT IN AT THE CONVENTION TONIGHT. BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE CRAZY.
IT WAS CRAZY, NOT CRAZY ENOUGH, BUT IT WAS CRAZY.
Stephen: ARE YOU A FAN, PEOPLE GOT VERY ANGRY, AND YOU ARE AN ANGRY MAN. WOULD IT APPEAL TO YOU ALL. WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO BE IN THE MOSH PIT OF THE CONVENTION TONTD? I WOULD RATHER BE IN A LATWRITTENE.
Stephen: OKAY.
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, SERIOUSLY, PICK PICKING UP THOSE BARS THAT MAKE IT SMELL NICE. OH, STOP WHINING!
Stephen: OKAY, LEWIS, ARE YOU EXCITED? WERE YOU EXCITED ABOUT ANY OF THE CANDIDATE THIS YEAR? DID YOU SEE ANY OF TED CRUZ'S SPEECH BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T ENDORSE TRUMP.
TED CRUZ, I STOPPED LISTENING TO TED. IN WAS-- BUT I LISTENED TONIGHT BECAUSE OF YOU! BUT I STOPPED LISTENING.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
I STOPPED LISTENING TO HIM DURING THE DE-- THE PHIL BUSTER HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE STARTED QUOTING FROM READING GREEN EGGS AND HAM.
Stephen: SURE, YEAH.
AND THAT WAS WHEN I MADE THE DECISION I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AGAIN UNLESS HE WAS WEARING ALUMINUM FOIL ON HIS HEAD.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LISTEN TO HIM IN A BOAT? WOULD YOU LISTEN TO HIM WITH A GOAT? NOW THESE TWO CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW, YOU GET ANGRY AT POLITICIANS. BUT EVERYBODY IS ANGRY AT THE CANDIDATE THIS YEAR. IT'S KIND OF BEEN A BONUS ROUND HERE BECAUSE THESE ARE STATISTICICALLY THE TWO LEAST POPULAR CANDIDATES WE HAVE EVER HAD FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HOW DID WE GET HERE, MY FRIEND?
IT'S A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT. WE ARE MAKING THE ATTEMPT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE DONE IT WITH PEOPLE THAT WE LIKE. AND IT HASN'T WORKED OUT. SO LET'S JUST, IF WE PICK PEOPLE THAT WE REALLY DON'T LIKE, MAYBE IT WILL WORK THAT WAY.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
CUZ THAT'S-- SO FAR, DEMOCRACY IS GREAT BUT SHOW IT IS JUST NOT WORKING.
Stephen: WELL, MAYBE THIS. MAYBE THIS. MAYBE THEY BOTH GET TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT LIKE THE PEOPLE WITHOUT DON'T LIKE HILLARY, SHE HAS TO BE THEIR PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE WITHOUT DON'T LIKE DONALD, HE HAS TO BE THEIR PRESIDENT AND IT MAKES US BEHAVE. BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN PUNISHED BY GETTING THE PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT. I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS TIE THEM TOGETHER.
Stephen: LIKE INTO ONE PERSON.
THAT'S IT. JUST TIED UP ALL DAY. AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY GOT TO FUNCTION AND DEAL WITH THE PRESIDENCY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T-- WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS-- DONALD, CRANK, HE'S A CRANK VERSUS HILLARY WHO IS CRANKY. IT'S CRANK VERSUS CRANKY. IT'S NOT GOOD. I CAN'T-- WE HAVE TO STOP THESE CONVENTIONS. THEY HAVE TO STOP. FOUR DAYS OF A-- WHAT IS A PEP RALLY! I NEVER LIKED PEP RALLIES. DID YOU EVER LIKE PEP RALLY SMS.
Stephen: I WASN'T ON THE PEP SQUAD.
WELL, NO ONE SHOULD BE ON THE PEP SQUAD. YOU DON'T YELL BEFORE THEY PLAY. YOU YELL WHEN THEY PLAY. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. YELLING FOR POLITICIANS, WHAT, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU! YOU YELL, THAT'S LIKE A PEP RALLY FOR A BOWLING TEAM. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: I WILL STAY OVER HERE FOR AWHILE.
I'M SORRY.
Stephen: NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL RIGHT. JUST I'M GETTING SLIGHTLY SINGED BY THE RADIATION YOU'RE GIVING OFF RIGHT NOW. NOW YOU HAVE A SHOW COMING UP THIS FALL CALLED BLACK TO THE FUTURE ON BROADWAY ON MONDAYS AT THE MARQUEE THEATER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT.
STARTING SEPTEMBER 12th. AND I'M GOING TO BASICALLY GO THROUGH-- THE ENTIRE ELECTION CYCLE.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IT AGAIN?
I WANT TO SHOW EXACTLY HOW WE GOT TO HERE.
Stephen: ARE YOU GO TOTION WEAR THIS?
I WILL WEAR SOMETHING MORE-- I WILL WEAR A SUIT WITH A TIE. AND YOU KNOW WHY? THE SAME REASON THOSE SCHMUKS DO. IN ORDER TO PRESENT THE IDEA, IF YOU WEAR A TIE AS YOU WELL KNOW, PEOPLE THINK WOW, THIS PERSON KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE READY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO STANDING EL YOURSELF TO DEATH.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: LEWIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. BLACK TO THE FUTURE IS COMING TO BROADWAY THIS FALL. LEWIS BLACK, EVERYBODY. HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW. TUNE IN TOMORROW MY BESTS ARE ELIZABETH WARREN, BILLY EICHNER, NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORD INWITH AARON SORKIN, CHERYL HINES. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
