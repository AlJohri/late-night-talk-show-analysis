Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY! THANKS, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH! PLEASE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! IT'S VERY NICE! KEEPERS WHOA! YEAH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! THANKS, EVERYBODY! PLEASE! I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. MAN, SO EXCITED. WHAT A GREAT AUDIENCE, I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DO THE WAVE THERE. I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO PERSONAL A QUESTION... YOU GUYS LIKE THE WEB SITE AMAZOM.COM? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S GREAT, IT'S LIKE E-BAY, BUT THE THINGS YOU BUY DON'T ARRIVE SMELLING LIKE CIGARETTES. (LAUGHTER) AMAZON'S ALWAYS BEEN ON THE CUTTING EDGE. FROM DRONE DELIVERY, TO AUTOMATED WAREHOUSES, TO SHIPPING SIX A.A. BATTERIES IN A BOX THE SIZE OF A MINI FRIDGE. (LAUGHTER) AND YESTERDAY, WE LEARNED THAT AMAZON IS PLANNING TO OPEN HUNDREDS OF ACTUAL PHYSICAL BOOKSTORES. THAT'S EXCITING BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THOSE MUCH ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. AMAZON IS CALLING THEIR NEW STORES "OFFLINE SHOPPING." THIS IS REALLY EXCITING. IT'S A NEW CONCEPT. (LAUGHTER)
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I THINK THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE TREND OF ONLINE-RETAILERS GOING REAL-WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE, TINDER COULD OPEN A SINGLES BAR, WHERE EVERYBODY WALKS AROUND STATING THEIR HEIGHT. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMEONE, YOU SWIPE THEM LEFT. AND IF YOU "DO" LIKE THEM, YOU SWIPE THEM JUST RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) OR THE FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE "SEAMLESS" COULD OPEN A RESTAURANT, WHERE YOU HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR YOUR MEAL, AND THEN IT'S BROUGHT TO YOUR TABLE BY A SAD, WET MAN, WEARING A GARBAGE BAG PONCHO, WHO YOU HAND $3 WITHOUT MAKING EYE CONTACT. (LAUGHTER) OR NETFLIX COULD OPEN A CHAIN OF MOVIE THEATERS, WHERE THEY'RE NEVER SHOWING EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT, SO YOU JUST END UP HALF-WATCHING "CLUELESS" AGAIN WHILE PLAYING "BEJEWELED" ON YOUR PHONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH, MAN...
Stephen: A D I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, AND AS A MEMBER OF AMAZON PRIME, I HAVE ORDERED YOU A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S ARRIVING RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: IT ARRIVED RIGHT NOW. FIRST, I'LL BE TALKING TO FORMER NEW YORK GIANT MICHAEL STRAHAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE SPENT 15 YEARS IN THE N.F.L. AND IS NOW THE CO-HOST OF "LIVE WITH KELLY AND MICHAEL", WHERE'S HE'S SOMEHOW THE LESS RIPPED ONE. (LAUGHTER) HE'S TOUGH. THEN, I'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE VERY FUNNY SAMANTHA BEE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AN OLD CO-WORKER OF MINE. WE'RE ALL OLD CO-WORKERS TOGETHER. HER NEW SHOW IS CALLED "FULL FRONTAL." BUT SINCE IT'S CBS, TONIGHT IT'LL BE AT MOST "SIDE BOOB." (LAUGHTER) THEN, WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM INDIE LEGENDS, WILCO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU LIKE HIS L LULLABY?
Jon: YEAH, MAN, A GREAT MUSICIAN.
Stephen: THEN, THEY WILL BE PLAYING A SONG OFF THEIR LATEST ALBUM "STAR WARS." IT'S REALLY LIGHT AND BOUNCY BUT IT HAS A DARK SIDE. ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) OH, CAN YOU TASTE THAT DELICIOUS EAR-FOOD? THAT'S JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN", SAY HI EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HI, EVERYBODY OUT THERE! THEY'RE ABOUT TO SERVE YOU A HEAPIN' HELPIN' OF THEIR HOSPITALITY, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: SOMEONE NOMINATED DONALD TRUMP FOR A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. I THINK HE'S GOT A GOOD CHANCE. HE'S CLEARLY A PIECE OF SOMETHING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Announcer: TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MICHAEL STRAHAN! SAMANTHA BEE! AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY WILCO! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! ♪ AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)
Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR! WHOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) IS EVERYONE EXCITED FOR THE SUPER BOWL ON SUNDAY? (CHEERING) THAT'S NO SURPRISE. OF COURSE YOU ARE. IT'S LIKE THE OLYMPICS, ONLY BETTER BECAUSE IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR AND AMERICA ALWAYS WINS. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THIS YEAR THE BIG GAME IS BETWEEN THE DENVER BRONCOS, A.K.A. "THE BRONCS," AND THE CAROLINA PANTHERS, A.K.A. "THE PANTS." (LAUGHTER) AND AS SOON AS THE SUPER BOWL ENDS, I, STEPHEN COLBERT, WILL BE HOSTING A SPECIAL LIVE EPISODE OF "THE LATE SHOW!" ARE YOU READY FOR SOME SHOW THAT FOLLOWS FOOTBAAAAAAAAALL? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DAYS AWAY FROM THE BIG SHOW WE'RE ALREADY IN THE FEARSOME GRIP OF THE WEEK. IT ALL KICKED OFF ON MONDAY WITH SUPER BOWL MEDIA DAY, WHERE THE TEAMS MEET THE PRESS IN AN ORGY OF PROMOTIONAL ECSTASY, ALONG WITH, FOR SOME REASON, PEOPLE WHO APPARENTLY COULDN'T GET INTO "LET'S MAKE A DEAL."
IT WAS MOVED TO THE EVENING. IT WAS CHAOS. THERE WERE CLOWNS AND SUPER HEROES AND MISS UNIVERSE.
Stephen: YES! CLOWNS AND SUPER HEROES, AND MISS UNIVERSE, MARIONETTES AND DARK MAGICIANS A THOUSAND SCREAMING PEACOCKS EMERGING FROM A GOLDEN CLAMSHELL, THEIR WINGS BLOTTING OUT THE VERY SUN. UNTIL FINALLY, PEYTON MANNING ENTERS IN A CHARIOT WEARING THAT DRESS FROM "THE HUNGER GAMES." (LAUGHTER) SO A GREAT NIGHT FOR FOOTBALL. IT WAS SO GREAT TO SEE THE GUYS TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BACK TO THE FANS, LIKE PANTHERS QUARTERBACK CAM NEWTON WHO SAID: "WE'VE GOT NUMEROUS GUYS, NOT ONLY JUST HIM, THAT HAVE BEEN MAKING AN IMPACT AND LIVING THEIR DREAM. AN OVAL-SHAPED PIGSKIN HAS TAKEN THEM A LONG WAY." AND "I TELL KIDS, THAT OVAL-SHAPED PIGSKIN CAN TAKE YOU A LOT OF PLACES." HOW INSPIRING TO THINK THAT A YOUNG MAN NAMED CAM MADE IT TO THE SUPER BOWL WITHOUT EVER LEARNING THE WORD "FOOTBALL." (LAUGHTER) NO ONE TELL HIM. TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE AT THIS POINT. NOW ALL THESE HUGE N.F.L. STARS GIVING ACCESS TO THE MEDIA REMINDED ME:  I AM ALSO A MEDIA. AND I NEED TO GET PUMPED FOR MY POST SUPER BOWL SHOW. SO I SENT MY INTERVIEW STRIKE TEAM TO MEDIA DAY TO ASK THE PLAYERS ONE SIMPLE QUESTION:
WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET PUMPED UP FOR THE BIG SHOW? ♪
I PUT ON A TINY CROWN AND SAY, WHO'S THE PRINCE OF FOOTBALL? ME! THAT'S WHO.
I TELL MY CAT THAT THE GAME IS ALREADY OVER AND WE WON. AND THEN I HAVE TO GO OUT AND WIN BECAUSE I CAN NEVER LIE TO HER.
EVERY DAY I WAKE UP AT 4:00 A.M. SO I CAN GET OUT THERE AND SCORE SOME REALLY GOOD DEALS AT GARAGE SALES. NOTHING GETS ME GOING LIKE PAYING ONLY $2 FOR A USED CROCK POT.
I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND I SAY THE NAMES OF MY FAVORITE FANS -- COOPER, MYKAYA, MADISON, VIVIAN, TYLER, ZACH, GLORIA, ALICE, ALEXIS... ♪
YOU GOT TO ALWAYS GIVE 110% UNTIL YOU REALIZE THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE, AND THEN JUST GIVE 100%.
I JUST THINK TO MYSELF, WHAT WOULD THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS DO BUT FOR FOOTBALL?
SIX CANS OF SELTZER, BELCH THE ALPHABET AND I'M READY TO RUMBLE.
I WEAR MY LUCKY RABBITS FOOT, THEN PUT ON MY SOCKS AND SHOES SO NO ONE CAN SEE ONE OF PI FEET IS A RABBITS FOOT.
MATT, ADAM, PAUL, CHRIS, TIM, ANDRO... ♪
I DO IT FOR ALL THE DINOSAURS WHO DIDN'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE ME PLAY, BUT I KNOW THEY'RE WATCHING IN DINOSAUR HEAVEN.
WHENEVER THE COACH TELLS US TO TAKE A NEERKS I SAY WHERE DO YOU WANT US TO TAKE IT? IT ALWAYS GETS A LAUGH.
JIM PAGE, JIM D., JIM III, JIM IV, JIM... ♪
WHEN I WANT TO INTIMIDATE THE OTHER TEAM, I MAKE DIRECT EYE CONTACT ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND I MOUTH THESE WORDS -- (LAUGHTER)
OWEN, MARIA, WILLIAM -- YVETTE, GREG, LIZ, DAN, THAI, TYRONE.

I LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR AND I SAY, CANDY MAN, THREE TIMES. AND WHEN HE APPEARS AND TRIES TO KILL ME, I RUN REALLY FAST.
AUTO -- ERIC, GLEN, EMILY, KAREEM. I LIKE TO LISTEN TO THE LINE KING SOUND TRACK BEFORE THE BIG GAME. ♪ CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT ♪ JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOUND OF TWO LINES DOING IT THAT LIKELY GETS MY BLOOD PRESSURE. ♪
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MICHAEL STRAHAN! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ONLY FOOTBALL HALL-OF-FAMER WITH HIS OWN DAYTIME TALK SHOW. PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL STRAHAN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
THANK YOU! THAT WAS NICE! GREAT BAND, GREAT AUDIENCE! THANK YOU GUYS!
Stephen: OH, INCREDIBLE BAND! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO YOU HAVE EVEN ENERGY TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU DO IT ALL!
I'M SLEEPING RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU FAKE IT WELL, MY FRIEND. YOU HAVE TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO THAT.
I WORK A LOT, OBVIOUSLY.
Stephen: YOU GET UP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN TO DO THE SHOW WITH KELLY.
I GET UP AT THE CRACK OF DAWN TO DO G.M.A. BEFORE KELLY THREE DAYS A WEEK AND ON THE WEEKEND TRAVEL TO L.A. TO DO FOX. I'M CONSTANTLY GOING BUT I LOVE MY WORK SO IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WORK? COMPARED TO HAVING TO GRIND YOUR WAY THROUGH AN OFFENSIVE LINE OF 300-POUND MEN TO SWAT A BALL OUT OF SOMEBODY'S HAND, DOES EVERYTHING SEEM EASY NOW?
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S GOOD OBSERVATION. WHEN PEOPLE SAY, YOU WORK SO HARD, AND I SAY TRY TO MOVE A 350-POUND MAN TALKING BAD ABOUT YOUR MOM --
Stephen: IS THAT HAPPENING? I MADE IT UP IN MY HEAD SO I WOULD BE ANGRY ENOUGH TO FIGHT HIM.
Stephen: YOU PROJECT ON TO THE ENEMY SOMETHING WORSE THAN WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE TO TURN YOURSELF INTO A BONE-CRUSHING MACHINE?
WHEN I WAS A YOUNGER PLAYER, I HAD TO THINK, EVERY GAME, HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT MY MOMMA, JUST TO GET MAD.
Stephen: I WANT TO START THE INTERVIEW BY SAYING YOUR MOTHER SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY WOMAN. SO NICE, A SAINT, FANTASTIC. SO YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE BIG SHOW. YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE SUPER BOWL. YOU WON THE SUPER BOWL.
YEAH, WON.
Stephen: THERE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE, MAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CAN I SEE THE RING?
YEAH.
Stephen: DAMN! I COULD WEAR THIS AROUND MY NECK. THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
PUT IT ON RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME WITH IT.
Stephen: I'LL PUT IT ON MY THUMB. THAT'S NICE. WOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S CRAZY. I LOOK AT THE SUPER BOWL NOW AND TOOK ME 15 YEARS TO GET THIS. YOU SEE A LOT OF GUYS WHO ARE A LOT YOUNGER WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY AND HOW SPECIAL THAT MUST BE FOR THEM BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY PLAY FOR. YOU COULD DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT --
Stephen: UNTIL YOU HAVE THAT.
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THIS IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL TO BE ABLE TO CELEBRATE AN HONOR WITH EVERYBODY. I'VE WON A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL AWARDS AND I SAID, THAT'S GREAT, AND NO ONE ELSE IS CHEERING BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO DID IT. BUT TO DO IT AS A TEAM AND TO SEE HOW ECSTATIC EVERYBODY WAS AND I LOOK AT ELI MANNING AND WANTED TO KISS HIM AND THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SINCE ELI IS YOUR TEAMMATE, ARE YOU PULLING FOR PEYTON FOR FAMILY REASONS, FOR FAMILY LOYALTY?
NO. MAY THE BEST TEAM WIN. I'M A BIG 'EYTON FAN AND IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE PEYTON GO OUT ON TOP. IT WOULD BE AMAZING. BUT I. ALSO A BIG CAM NEWTON FAN. I REALLY AM. I THINK HE'S ONE OF THE FEW GUYS THAT I WOULD PAY TO WATCH PLAY. HE'S JUST THAT EXCITING.
Stephen: I WOULD PAY JUST TO WATCH HIM DANCE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S SO FUN TO SEE HIM HAVE A GOOD TIME. THERE IS A LOT OF CRITICISM. SOME PEOPLE SAY, THE QUARTERBACK SHOULD BE MORE DIGNIFIED AND SHOULDN'T BE DANCING. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU SEE THE RUNNING BACK DANCE WHEN THEY SCORE, RECEIVERS DANCE. DEFENSIVE LINEMON. THERE I AM AFTER THAT '50s SHOW FLEXING OVER TOM BRADY.
Stephen: DID YOU DANCE. I JUST SHOWED THE MUSCLES. THAT'S ALL I DID.
Stephen: I SHOW YOU LITERALLY OVER TOM BRADY. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS PHOTO? LOOK AT EVERYBODY DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND. YOU LITERALLY LOOK LIKE PETER PAN. (LAUGHTER) YOU LOOK LIKE THE PETER PAN OF DEATH COMING TO TAKE TOM BRADY BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK AND TAKE HIM OFF TO NEVER EVER LAND! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, THAT GUY -- THESE TWO FELL IN THE WAY AND I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET AWAY, SO I HAD TO DIVE AND TRY TO GET HIM AND THAT PICTURE LOOKS SO IMPRESSIVE, I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS HOME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M GOING TO SHOW MY KIDS, YOUR DADDY USED TO BE GOOD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW DADDY'S GOT HIS OWN LINE OF CLOTHES CALLED THE --
COLLECTION.
Stephen: OKAY. "COLLECTION BY MICHAEL STRAHAN." I'M GOING TO HOOK YOU UP, MAN.
Stephen: COULD YOU? YEAH.
Stephen: I THINK TWO OF ME COULD FIT INSIDE ONE OF YOUR SUITS.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET EV SUIT. YOU WILL GET A SUIT MADE JUST FOR YOU.
Stephen: MADE LIKE THIS? YEAH.
Stephen: SOME PLAYERS LIKE CAM NEWTON, VERY FLASHY STYLE.
OH, DID YOU SEE WHAT HE WORE THE OTHER DAY?
Stephen: THOSE PANTS WERE LIKE A MAGIC EYE POST-ER. IF YOU UNFOCUS YOUR EYES, YOU COULD SEE A DOLPHIN PLAYING VOLLEYBALL IN THOSE.
ONE THING I LEARNED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, CAM'S AGE, IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY OPENED UP A BAG OF SKITTLES AND SAID, PICK A COLOR. YOU JUST CHOSE IT AND HAD THE WORST SUITS. I'M VERY CONSCIOUS TO WEAR SOMETHING YOU DON'T REGRET IN A YEAR OR TWO. HE REGRETTED THAT THE NEXT DAY. THERE IS NO WAY YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH THAT. BUT, YEAH, I DO THE SUITS. I LOVE IT. I'M IN SUITS SIX DAYS A WEEK. I KNOW YOU WEAR SUITS QUITE A BIT.
Stephen: I DO. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT SUITS IS THEY GIVE ME THE ILLUSION OF A MALE PHYSIQUE. THAT'S WHAT8"÷ LIKE ABOUT THEM. I TRY TO TAKE THEM OFF WHEN A WOMAN'S AROUND.
KEEP THAT BUTTONED UP AROUND ME, YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT, MAN. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ACTUALLY, YOU'RE ALSO A SPOKESMAN FOR WHAT WE USED TO CALL METAMUCIL, BUT IT'S CALLED META, NOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THERE AN ATTEMPT TO HIP UP METAMUCIL?
NO, MAN, IT'S NOT METAMUCIL!
Stephen: IT'S META. I'M DOWN TO BE REGULAR! C'MON, MAN! ALL THE KIDS ARE DOING IT!
ALL THE KIDS ARE DOING IT!
Stephen: YOU GUYS WANT TO HIT THE META? I'LL SET YOU UP WITH A LINE, BABY!
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT CAMPAIGN RIGHT THERE! (LAUGHTER) SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG FOR THAT. YOU'RE NOT TOO YOUNG TO HAVE GOOD INTESTINAL HEALTH. IT REALLY WORKS!
Stephen: YOU ARE THE GREATEST SPOKESMAN OF ALL TIME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M SERIOUS! IT LOWERS YOUR CHOLESTEROL AND DOES ALL THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: IT WILL GO THROUGH YOU LIKE MICHAEL STRAHAN, THROUGH THE OPPOSING LINE! BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF GOING THROUGH YOU, DO YOU EVER MISS SACKING PEOPLE? LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A CELEBRITY CHEF ON, DO YOU THINK, I'M DOING THE TAKE MARIO OUT! I'M GOING TO KNOCK THE RICOTTA OUT OF THIS GUY! HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT MY MOMMA!
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HITTING MARIO, BUT WHEN I SEE A STRANGER IN SOME OTHER QUARTERBACK'S JERSEY, I DON'T CARE, I WANT TO HIT THEM.
Stephen: REALLY? I DO. I MISS IT. I MISS HITTING A QUARTERBACK BECAUSE THEY --
Stephen: JUST THE QUARTERBACK?
REALLY, YOU KNOW, I DO MISS THE 350-POUND GUY, I MISS THROWING HIM DOWN TO HIT THE QUARTERBACK, BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE HITTING THE QUARTERBACK BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET HIT IN PRACTICE, THEY WEAR A DIFFERENT COLOR JERSEY, THERE IS AN ARTICLE IN "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" ABOUT THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY THE BEST LOOKING GUYS ON THE FIELD.
Stephen: THEY GET THE MODELS.
YEAH, WHO DOESN'T WANT TO HIT A GUY WHO GETS ALL THAT? I DO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S ONLY HUMAN!
Stephen: TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. NOW, THE BALL ITSELF, THE BALL IS THE TACKLE MAGNET.
YES.
Stephen: IF I WERE PLAYING FOOTBALL, I WOULD SAY, DON'T GIVE ME THE BALL, I'M GOOD, BECAUSE GUYS LIKE MICHAEL STRAHAN ARE GOING TO COME GET ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL BUT SOMETIMES YOU WILL SEE A GUY RUNNING THE BALL AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM, I'M JUST GOING TO GET YOU BACK.
Stephen: WHEN YOU KNOCK THEM DOWN, OFF SWITCH TO TURN ON TO TURN INTO THE AGGRESSIVE MACHINE.
YEP.
Stephen: IS IT ALWAYS LIKE -- DO YOU FEEL IT IN THE MOMENT OR AFTER YOU FEEL SOMEBODY, YOU GO, MAN, I HIT THAT GUY TOO HARD AND FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
NO...
Stephen: WHEN YOU'RE YELLING, IS IT EVER, LIKE, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU!
NO, IT'S MORE LIKE, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT ABOUT MY MOMMA!
Stephen: WHAT! I SAID NOTHING! MICHAEL STRAHAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! "COLLECTION BY MICHAEL STRAHAN" IS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY AT J.C. PENNEY, EVERYBODY! MICHAEL STRAHAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THE SHOW KNOW THAT I'M A PRACTICING CATHOLIC. AND WHILE I USUALLY GO TO CHURCH, I'M OFTEN WAY TOO BUSY TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF MY CHURCH'S OTHER IMPORTANT RITUALS. FOR INSTANCE, I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF LAST RITES FOR YEARS. I HEARD THAT'S A GOOD ONE. AND THE RITUAL I MISS MOST IS CONFESSION. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMBING INTO THAT DARK WOODEN BOX THAT JUST MAKES ME FEEL SO ALIVE. SO, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD EXAMINE MY CONSCIENCE WITH YOU, THE AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
NO!
Stephen: I DIDN'T THINK SO. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. ♪ (ORGAN MUSIC) BOO! NOW FOR THE RECORD: I'M NOT SURE IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM.
