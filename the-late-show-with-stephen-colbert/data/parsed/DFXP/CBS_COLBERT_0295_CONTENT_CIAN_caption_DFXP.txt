WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS ESSENTIALLY INCOMPETENT. TRULY, OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE, FOLKS. YOU CAN'T GO AROUND JUST SIGNING LITTLE NOTICES THAT THE PRESIDENT SIGNS ALL THE TIME, EXECUTIVE ORDERS. EXECUTIVE ORDER-- EVERYTHING'S SCFER ORDER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME BECAUSE HE'S PLAYING SO MUCH GOLF. HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO CONVINCE CONGRESS. THE GUY PLAYS MORE GOLF THAN PEOPLE ON THE P.G.A. TOUR. WE HAVE AN INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT! WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES. JULIE ANDREWS. CHRISTINA HENDRICKS. AND THE UMBILICAL BROTHERS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. VERY NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS, IT'S FROM. YOU CAN FEEL THE FRIDAY IN THE ROOM, CAN'T YOU? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT? EVERYBODY HAVE A GOOD WEEK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, THEN, NONE OF YOU ARE DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT'S HAD A BIT OF A ROUGH PATCH. HE'S BEEN RIDDEN HARD AND PUT AWAY WET, I BELIEVE IS THE SAYING. AND NOW THERE'S NEW NEWS ABOUT HIS FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, MICHAEL FLYNN. REMEMBER THAT GUY. IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER, WHITE GUY, BROWN HAIR, ABOUT YAY IN BED WITH RUSSIA, THIS MUCH, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. FLYNN-- HERE'S WANT NEW NEWS, HERE'S THE NEW NEWS ABOUT FLYNN. FLYNN RESIGNED BECAUSE HE DISCUSSED LIFTING SANCTIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. WELL, FUNNY STORY. HE LIED ABOUT IT TO THE F.B.I. AND, FOLKS, THAT IS BOTH A NO-NO, AND A CLIRVEG-CLINK. WHAT. I WAS GOING TO TAKE A MULLIGAN. YOU DON'T GET ONE FREE TREASON. IT TURNS OUT LYING TO THE F.B.I. IS A FELONY. FLYNN'S SILVER LINING:  ANY DECISION TO PROSECUTE WOULD FALL TO TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. WOW. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS THE WEIRDEST MEET-AND-GREETS: "JEFF SESSIONS, THIS IS MIKE DON'T GET USED TO HIM. MIKE, THIS IS JEFF SESSIONS. JEFF, YOU'LL BE PROSECUTING MIKE, HERE. MIKE, YOU CAN GO." BUT TOMORROW DONALD TRUMP IS ADDRESSING HIS PROBLEMS IN WASHINGTON BY HOLDING A RALLY IN FLORIDA. AND WHEN YOU THINK DESTINATIONS IN FLORIDA, YOU KNOW IT'S GOT TO BE THE HAPPIEST PALCE ON EARTH: THE ORLANDO-MELBOURNE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT! YES, "INTERNATIONAL," VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IF THE RALLY DOESN'T FIX EVERYTHING, HE CAN JUST JUMP ON A PLANE TO RUSSIA AND HE'S COOL. NOW, IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A CAMPAIGN RALLY, THAT'S BECAUSE SEAN SPICER SAID ON WEDNESDAY THE EVENT IS "A CAMPAIGN RALLY." IS IT ELECTION TIME ALREADY?
Jon: OH, WOW.
Stephen: AGAIN? I KNOW IT DOES FEEL LIKE HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR FOUR YEARS, BUT IT DOES SEEM FAST. HERE'S WHY TRUMP'S DOING IT: TRUMP CAN'T ENJOY BEING PRESIDENT BECAUSE THE BUZZKILLS IN OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KEEP LEAKING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT BE THE REAL PRESIDENT. SO TO CLEAN UP THESE LEAKS, HE'S BRINGING IN A NEW YORK BILLIONAIRE TO LEAD A BROAD REVIEW OF AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. THAT IS SURPRISING, THAT THERE'S A BILLIONAIRE WHO WASN'T ALREADY IN TRUMP'S CABINET. FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST ANY BILLIONAIRE. THE GUY ON THE CASE IS STEPHEN FEINBERG, FOUNDER OF CERBERUS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. THAT'S RIGHT, CERBERUS. "HEY, EVERYONE, WE'VE GOT SOME IMAGE PROBLEMS. I KNOW-- GET ME THE GUY WHO NAMED HIS COMPANY FOR THE THREE-HEADED DEMON DOG THAT GUARDS HELL." ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, CONGRATS ON THE NEW JOB STEPHEN FEINBERG, AND HAVE FUN WORKING WITH OTHER TRUMP APPOINTEES LIKE STEVE MNUCHIN, STEVE BANNON, AND STEVE MILLER. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN'S BOOK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION "TEAM OF STEVES." LOUVRE LAUGH NOW, I DON'T THINK I'M TELLING ANY SECRETS HERE WHEN I SAY MY NAME IS STEPHEN. AND WITH SO MANY OF THEM IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THIS IS A TOUGH TIME FOR THE STEPHEN COMMUNITY. SO TONIGHT, I STAND UP FOR STEVES, BECAUSE WE STEVES ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS, WE'RE YOUR MAILMEN, WE ARE YOUR BROTHERS-IN-LAW-- SERIOUSLY, A LOT OF BROTHERS-IN-LAW ARE NAMED STEVE, IT'S WEIRD. STEVES ARE HONEST, HARD-WORKING, SALT-OF-THE-EARTH FOLKS. WE'RE NOT JUST A POOR MAN'S GREG. WE'RE STEVES, AND WE'RE PROUD. YES, WE MIGHT REPRESENT THE LESSER BALDWINS, BUT WHAT WOULD CROSBY, STILLS, AND NASH BE WITHOUT STEPHEN STILLS? CROSBY AND NASH? STILL PRETTY GOOD FOLK ROCK WITH TIGHT HARMONIES, BUT MISSING THAT "JE NE SAIS STEVE." WHEN YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK ABOUT A DEMON CLOWN WHO KILLS NEW ENGLAND CHILDREN, DO YOU PICK UP A BOOK BY BERNIE KING? NO, YOU GO TO STEPHEN KING EVERY TIME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STEPHENS INVENTED THE STONE-COLD STUNNER. STEPHENS WROTE "A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME." ANY STEVES IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT? NOT MANY! OKAY! STAND UP AND BE COUNTED ANYWAY! OKAY, NOW SIT DOWN. NOBODY LIKES A COCKY STEVE. OF COURSE, YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT NAMED HIS NEW PICK FOR LABOR SECRETARY, FLORIDA LAWYER AND LATINO SMEAGOL, ALEXANDER ACOSTA. ( LAUGHTER ) ACOSTA IS THE FIRST HISPANIC IN TRUMP'S CABINET. SO HE'S PROBABLY SAFE FROM DEPORTATION. OF COURSE, THE ONLY REASON TRUMP HAD TO NOMINATE ACOSTA IN THE FIRST PLACE IS HIS PREVIOUS PICK FOR LABOR SECRETARY DROPPED OUT BECAUSE OPRAH. AND SHE ISN'T THE ONLY CELEBRITY MAKING WAVES. THERE'S ALSO ELECTRONIC ARTIST AND BABY IN GRADUATE SCHOOL, MOBY. HERE'S THE DEAL:  MOBY CLAIMS TO HAVE SOURCES THAT CONFIRM TRUMP IS "IN COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT." AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST MOBY, HE'S GOT CONNECTIONS IN THE HIGHEST ECHELONS OF WASHINGTON'S VEGAN CAFES. HE POSTED HIS FINDINGS TO INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK, THEN, OF COURSE, REMIXED THEM AND SOLD THEM TO A MAZDA COMMERCIAL. ( LAUGHTER ) ACCORDING TO MOBY, TRUMP IS "BEING BLACKMAILED BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, NOT JUST FOR BEING PEED ON BY RUSSIAN HOOKERS BUT FOR MUCH MORE NEFARIOUS THINGS." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FOR TOO LONG WHEN BEING PEED ON BY HOOKERS STARTS TO SOUND TAME. ( LAUGHTER ) MOBY ALSO CLAIMS TO KNOW THAT TRUMP IS WORKING WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THAT HE WANTS TO START A WAR WITH IRAN, ENDING WITH, "I'M WRITING THESE THINGS SO THAT WHEN/IF THESE THINGS HAPPEN, THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC RECORD BEFOREHAND." AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHEN MOBY'S INSTAGRAM BECAME THE PUBLIC RECORD, IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER TRUMP'S TWITTER FEED BECAME THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT INSIDER-TRUMP-KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT STOP WITH MOBY. FOR MONTHS, TOM ARNOLD HAS CLAIMED THAT HE HAS ALL THE OUTTAKES FROM TRUMP SAYING THE "N" WORD ON "THE APPRENTICE." "ALL THE OUTTAKES?" ( LAUGHTER ) HOW OFTEN DID TRUMP DROP THE N-BOMB ON THAT SHOW? WAS "YOU'RE FIRED" NOT THE ORIGINAL CATCHPHRASE? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, RANDOM CELEBS CLAIMING TO HAVE DIRT ON THE PRESIDENT SEEMS CRAZY, UNTIL YOU REMEMBER THAT THE PRESIDENT IS A RANDOM CELEB. THINGS ARE SO WEIRD RIGHT NOW THAT MOBY AND TOM ARNOLD SEEM LIKE MORE RELIABLE SOURCES THAN KELLYANNE CONWAY AND SEAN SPICER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I'LL TELL YOU, CELEBRITIES ARE COMING UP ON THE OF THE WOODWORK WITH THEIR OWN TRUMP SCOOPS. JUST LOOK AT THESE TOTALLY REAL ACTUAL TWEETS THAT WE DEFINITELY DID NOT JUST MAKE UP. HERE'S ONE FROM COOLIO: "DONALD TRUMP IS PLANNING A GROUND WAR WITH CHINA. I HEARD IT FROM MY COUSIN, WHO DATED A CHINESE GIRL ONCE. SHE WAS NICE. HER NAME WAS HELEN." ( LAUGHTER ) OR THIS ONE FROM JONATHAN TAYLOR THOMAS: "IT'S AN OPEN SECRET AMONG THOSE IN THE KNOW THAT KELLYANNE CONWAY IS TRUMP'S MOST TRUSTED ADVISER, ONLY BECAUSE HE BELIEVES SHE'S IVANKA FROM THE FUTURE." THAT'S BELIEVABLE. I TOILGTLY BELIEVE THAT. I TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT. SO GILBERT GOTTFRIED HAS SOME INSIDE INFO: "STEVE BANNON IS ACTUALLY THREE TODDLERS MAKING A HUMAN PYRAMID INSIDE A TRENCHCOAT. AND THE REASON HE'S SO MOODY IS THAT THEY TAKE TURNS ON WHO GETS TO BE THE HEAD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) JUST-- FINALLY, THERE'S THIS SHOCKING REVELATION FROM CARTOON BABY TOMMY PICKLES: "I KNOW THE REAL REASON DONALD TRUMP WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. HE DREW WIENERS ALL OVER 'EM." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE LEGENDARY JULIE ANDREWS IS HERE! STICK AROUND! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARMING ACTRESSES EVER ON FILM AND ONE OF THE MOST LOVELY PEOPLE YOU'LL EVER MEET. PLEASE WELCOME JULIE ANDREWS. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
WOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JULIE ANDREWS, EVERYBODY. YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE-- YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD THIS, YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD THIS, BUT WHEN I TOLD EVERYBODY THAT YOU WERE MY GUEST TONIGHT, THEY SQUEALED LIKE I HAD GOOSED THEM WITH AN ICE PICK. THEY WERE SO EXCITED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL. YOU'RE SUCH-- YOU'RE, OBVIOUSLY, JUST A BRILLIANT PERFORMER, BUT LOVELY PERSON TO BE AROUND, TOO.
WELL, YOU SOUND SURPRISED. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOT EVERYBODY WHO IS PROFESSIONALLY CHARMING IS PERSONALLY CHARMING. BUT YOU ARE JUST SUCH A LOVELY PERSON. YOU TAUGHT ME A WONDERFUL TRICK. CAN I SHARE WITH THEM THE TRICK?
YES. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT WAS, BUT GO AHEAD.
Stephen: IT'S THE PHOTOGRAPH TRIP. HOW YOU SMILE.
AH, YES!
Stephen: THE FIRST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER, WE WERE BACKSTAGE AT THE OLD SHOW, AND I SAID LET'S SAY, "CHEESE." AND YOU SAID, NO, NO. WHAT DO WE SAY?
YOU SAY-- YOU ASK THEM TO COUNT TO THREE, AND THEN YOU SAY, "MONEY." AND I DON'T KNOW-- I WAS TOLD THIS. IT'S NOT MY IDEA.
Stephen: YES.
BUT I WAS TOLD TO DO THIS, AND LO AND BEHOLD, IT WORKS. IT DROPS THE JAW A BIT, MAKES YOU SMILE NICELY. SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL REMEMBER IT.
Stephen: EXACTLY. AND IT PUTS YOU IN A GOOD MOOD.
YOU HAVE TRIED IT.
Stephen: I'LL TRY NOW. READY?
YES, ONE, TWO, THREE.
Stephen: MONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) REALLY NICE.
YEAH, NOT BAD.
Stephen: IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, I'M A LITTLE LATE TO THIS, BUT ARE YOU DAME JULIE ANDREWS. HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN NOW?
I WAS MADE-- HAD THE HONOR OF BEING GIVEN THAT DAMEHOOD IN THE-- IN 2000.
Stephen: 2000.
YES.
Stephen: SO 17 YEARS NOW.
IS IT REALLY.
Stephen: IT IS. I'M SORRY TO SAY.
DOESN'T TIME FLY!
Stephen: IS IT THE SWORD ON THE SHOULDER AND ALL THAT?
NO, NOT AT ALL. THE MEN WHO ARE MADE SIRS -- AND DAME IS THE FEMALE EQUIVALENT-- MEN ARE TOUCHED ON THE SHOULDER WITH THE SWORD. BUT LADIES AND ALSO THE CLERGY, ARE NOT TOUCHED ON THE SHOULDER WITH A SWORD BECAUSE THEY ARE PEOPLE OF PEACE. SO IT'S A REAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRUE STORY. AND SO THE CLERGY ARE GENTLE AND KIND AND PEACEFUL AND NEVER FIGHT, I DON'T GUESS. AND, ALSO, LADIES. SO YOU GET PINNED A MEDAL INSTEAD.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES? THE QUEEN CAN CALL YOU UP AT ANY TIME AND SAY, "LET'S GO SHOPPING."
SHE'S VERY WELCOME TO. I'D BE VERY GRATEFUL IF SHE WANTED TO.
Stephen: YOU'RE OFFICIALLY ON THE QUEEN'S GIRL SQUAD NOW.
WHAT IT IS, QUITE SERIOUSLY, IT'S THIS LOVELY, QUIET HONOR THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOUR COUNTRY HAS GIVEN YOU SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, AND TO HAVE BEEN HONORED BY YOUR MONARCHIST IS A LOVELY THING.
Stephen: WELL, YOU ARE, TO AMERICANS, YOU ARE ABOUT AS BRITISH AS IT CAN GET IN OUR EYES. HOW IMPORTANT OVER THE YEARS HAVE YOU BECOME? OBVIOUSLY, YOU WERE MARRIED TO THE GREAT BLAKE EDWARDS, THE BRILLIANT COMEDIAN DIRECTOR. AND HOW AMERICANIZED DID YOU GET? DID YOU WATCH THE SUPER BOWL.
OF COURSE I DID. END TO END, BELIEVE ME TOTALLY.
Stephen: END TO END.
YES.
Stephen: WHO WERE YOU PULLING FOR JULIE?
IS IT OKAY TO SAY?
Stephen: YES.
WELL, I WANTED HIM TO WIN BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE BROKEN ALL RECORDS. I WANTED BRADY TO WIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, GOSH, WASN'T HE SPECTACULAR? >WHO DID YOU WANT TO WIN?
Stephen: THE I WANTED THE FALCONS TO WIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND ATLANTA WAS THE CLOSEST TEAM WHEN I WAS A KID.
A GREAT TEAM THAT YOUNG TEAM. AND THEY'RE GOING TO WIN AGAIN I'M SURE. SO IT WAS NICE THAT BRADY DID. WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU SAY?
YOU WERE LAUGHING AT ME JUST THEN.
Stephen: I WAS LAUGHING WITH YOU, JULIE.
OH, OKAY.
Stephen: I WAS LAUGHING WITH YOU. I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU WERE HERE THAT I'M LAUGHING, AND I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT THIS LITTLE CLIP WE'RE ABOUT TO PLAY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME ON THIS STAGE.
NO.
Stephen: IN 1961, YOU WERE HERE FOR THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS RIGHT IN THIS --
Stephen: RIGHT HERE. RIGHT IN THE CORNER OVER THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: PERFORMING A PIECE FROM "MY FAIR LADY." YOU ORIGINATEDLY PART OF ELIZA DOOLITTLE. WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE.
OH, JOSH  ♪ ALL I WANT IS A ROOM SOMEWHER FAR AWAY FROM THE COLD NIGHT AIR ♪ WITH ONE ENORMOUS WOULDN'T IT BE LOVELY ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I MEAN-- THANK YOU. HOW-- HOW LUCKY CAN A GIRL GET? I MEAN, REALLY.
Stephen: WAS THAT PART WRITTEN FOR YOU?
NO, NOT REALLY. IT WAS CREATED, OF COURSE, FOR REX, AND, OBVIOUSLY, FOR ME. BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD HAVE-- ANYBODY-- ANYBODY DID EVENTUALLY PLAY IT. IT'S JUST THAT-- I WAS IN IT FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO AUDITION FOR THE PART?
YES, I DID. I AUDITIONS FOR ALAN J. LERNER, THE GREAT LYRICIST, AND HE ALSO COMPILED THE BOOK.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND JUST AFTER THAT, I AUDITIONED FOR RICHARD ROGERS IN-- THEY WANTED ME TO AUDITION FOR A SHOW THAT THEY WERE DOING, ROGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN WERE DOING, CALLED "PIPE DREAM." I WENT UP, I GAVE AN AUDITION IN A VERY EMPTY THEATER, AND BELTED OUT MY LITTLE ARIA AS HARD AS I COULD, AND I KNEW SOMEWHERE OUT THERE MR. ROGERS WAS SITTING ALL ALONE, OR MAYBE WITH SOMEBODY. AND HE CAME UP ON STAGE AFTER-- I HAD NEVER MET HIM. AND HE SAID TO ME, "OH," HE SAID, "THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY ADEQUATE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND I SAID, "OH, OH, OH." HE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, I'M TEASING YOU." HE SAID, "HAVE YOU BEEN AUDITIONING FOR ANYBODY ELSE." AND THIS IS THE AMAZING THING. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. AND I SAID, "I HAVE AUDITIONED FOR MR. LERNER. I BELIEVE HE AND MR. LORD ARE DOING AN ADAPTATION OF GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S 'PYGMALION'." AND HE SAID, "OH." AND HE WAS VERY QUIET FOR A MOMENT. HE SAID, "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF THEY ASK YOU TO DO THE SHOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT ONE. IF THEY DON'T ASK YOU, SEE ME, BECAUSE I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO USE YOU." AND HE WITH GREAT GENEROSITY SUGGESTED I TAKE "MY FAIR LADY" IF I WAS GIVEN IT, AND I WAS GIVEN IT. HOW GENEROUS IS THAT.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN STICK AROUND?
I'D LOVE TO IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE JULIE ANDREWS. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE HERE WITH THE LOVELY DAME JULIE ANDREWS. AND BEFORE THE BREAK, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT "MY FAIR LADY."
YUP.
Stephen: YOU, ALSO, ARE VERY FAMOUS FOR PLAYING MARY POPINS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I UNDERSTAND-- I UNDERSTAND YOU DID YOUR OWN STUNTS IN "MARY POPINS."
YES, I DID.
Stephen: AND WHAT STUNTS ARE THERE TO DO?
ARE YOU KIDDING? WELL-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: MOSTLY BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.
NO, FLYING UP IN THE CLOUDS, AND BALANCING ON PLATFORMS WITH UNCLE ALBERT IN THE LAUGHING SCENE, AND FLYING --
Stephen: ALL PRACTICAL EFFECTS, YOU'RE ACTUALLY ON WIRES AND STUFF?
YES, I WAS! AND IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS DAY. RIGHT AT THE END OF FILMING WHEN I WAS IN THIS EXROOSHATINGLY PAINFUL HARNESS, AND I WAS HANGING AROUND UP THERE FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITH THE UMBRELLA --
Stephen: EXCUSE ME, DID THEY SAVE THE STUNTS--
UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT.
Stephen: THE VERY END.
WELL, IF THERE HAD BEEN AN ACCIDENT I WAS DISPENSABLE AFTER, THAT DISPOSABLE.
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE. WE'RE SAVING ALL THE STUNTS FOR THIS SHOW, FOR THE LAST EPISODE.
THE REALLY DIFFICULT ONE. I FELT MYSELF, AFTER HANGING AROUND UP THERE, TO JUST-- I FELT-- I THOUGHT I FELT THE ROPE-- THE WIRE LEAD, DROP ABOUT SIX INCHES. SO I THOUGHT OH, GOSH. YOU KNOW, TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AT THE END OF THE SHOW LIKE THIS, I WAS VERY NERVOUS AND VERY TIRED. SO I CALLED DOWN AND I SAID, "SKEWS ME, WHEN YOU DO LET ME DOWN, COULD YOU LET ME DOWN REALLY GENTLY BECAUSE I FELT MYSELF SLIP, AND I JUST DON'T FEEL TOO SAFE UP HERE." AND SO I-- THERE WAS A WIRE ON ME AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BOOK OF THE STUDIO AND DOWN TO THE WEIGHTED SOOND BAG SO THAT I WAS BALANCED. AND WHEN-- THEY SAID, WHEN SHE COMES DOWN, JUST LET HER DOWN REALLY EASY, JOE. LET HER DOWN AS GENTLY AS YOU CAN." AND I PLUMMETED TO THE STAGE. I DID. AND THERE WAS AN AWFUL SILENCE FOR A MINUTE. AND I DID LET FLY WITH A FEW ANGLO-SAXON FOUR-LETTER WORDS, I HAVE TO ADMIT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. AND THEN-- AND THEN POOR JOE'S DISEMBODIED VOICE FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STAGE SAID, "IS SHE DOWN YET?" ( LAUGHTER ) POOR GUY.
Stephen: WELL, NOW, YOU HAVE A NEW SHOW, A CHILDREN'S SHOW ON NETFLIX CALLED "JULIE'S GREENROOM."
YES.
Stephen: WHY WHEREYOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN THE EXPARTS GETTING CHILDREN INVOLVED AND EXCITED ABOUT BEING INVOLVED IN THE ARTS, THAT IT'S YOU EXPLAINING TO KIDS BACKSTAGE ABOUT HOW THE THEATER WORKS.
IT'S ACTUALLY EXPOSING THEM TO THE WONDERS AND THE JOY OF THE ARTS. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT I SUPPOSEDLY, I'M MISS JULIE, WHO RUNS A LITTLE TINY REGIONAL THEATER. AND I TEACH CLASSES. AND IT'S A CHARACTER I PLAY. IT'S NOT ME, JULIE, BUT MISS JULIE. AND THE THING IS THAT MY STUDENTS ARE THE HENSON PUPPETS, BRAND NEW ONES INVENTED FOR THE SHOW.
Stephen: OH!
AND THEY ARE ADORABLE. THEY ARE WONDERFUL. AND THE PUPPETEER IS SO BRILLIANT.
Stephen: WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP RIGHT HERE.
DO WE! THAT'S GREAT! PRINCESS APPLE READY?
HOW MANY PEOPLE.
I THINK WE HAVE A MALFUNCTION.
SHE'S GOT STAGE FRIGHT!
NO, NO, DARLING, LOOK AT ME. THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE LOVELY. THEY WANT TO ADORE YOU. THEY'VE COME TO ENJOY THE WHOLE SHOW. CAN YOU BE READY?
( INHALES DEEPLY ) READY TO GO.
CUE THE OVERTURE.
Stephen: THE STAGE IS STILL YOUR LIFE.
YES.
Stephen: IN AUSTRALIA YOU DIRECT A PRODUCTION OF "MY FAIR LADY."
I DID! I FELT I KNEW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT.
Stephen: THERE'S A FAMOUS SCENE WHERE HENRY HIGGINS IS PUTTING MARBLES IN ELIZA DOOLITTLE'S MOUTH.
YES. YOU CAN'T REALLY USE MARBLE S.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU USE?
YOU USE, LIKE, JELLYBEANS-- I USED TO HAVE JELLYBEANS, YEAH.
Stephen: WE HAVE-- WE HAVE A BOWEL BOLL OF GRAPES HERE.
WELL, ACTUALLY-- OH, YOU COULD USE GRAPES YOU.
Stephen:  COULD USE GRAHAMS. I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD TRY TO GET ME TO SAY A FEW THINGS.
ALL RIGHT, BUT --
Stephen: WHILE YOU FEED GRAPES INTO MY MOUTH.
NO, LET ME PUT THEM IN ONE PIE BY ONE. OPEN YOUR MOUTH. ONE... TWO... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THREE... FOUR... AND FIVE. OKAY. NOW, WITHOUT CHEWING THEM-- DON'T CHEAT-- SAY "WITH BLACKEST MOSS." ( MUMBLING ) WITH BLACKEST MOSS.
THE FLOWER POTS WERE THICKLY CRUSTED ONE AND ALL.
Stephen: THE FLOWER POTS WERE THICKLY CRUSTED ONE AND ALL.
NOT BAD, REALLY, NOT BAD. NOW YOU CAN EAT THEM. CAN I HAVE ONE? ( LAUGHTER )
AREN'T THEY GOOD? I WISH WE HAD, HAD GRAPES. MUCH NICER THAN JELLYBEANS.
Stephen: THIS IS THIS IS A CHOKING HAZARD. JULIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
OH, IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: "JULIE'S GREENROOM" IS AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX MARCH 17. DAME JULIE ANDREWS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE BACK WITH CHRISTINA HENDRICKS, STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

I HEARD YOU CHALLENGE MR. CAMPBELL TO A FIST FIGHT. WHY?
MAN'S GOT TO DO WHAT A MAN'S GOT TO DO.
WELL, I DISAGREE.
WHY IS THAT?
YOUR FIST ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. YOU NEED A KNIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) SIMPLY PUNCHING HIM IS NOT ENOUGH. YOU NEED TO CUT HIM FROM HIS FOREHEAD ALL THE WAY DOWN TO HIS CHIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME CHRISTINA HENDRICKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COME ON UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: PEOPLE OUT THERE MAY NOT BE KNOW, BUT YOU AND I MET UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES-- FIVE YEARS AGO, SIX YEARS AGO, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
OH, NOT THAT LONG. FOUR, FIVE.
Stephen: SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AT LINCOLN CENTER. WE DID STEPHEN SONDHEIM'S "COMPANY" TOGETHER. AND IT WAS A DEVASTATINGLY HARD MUSICAL TO BE. I'M COMPLETELY UNEQUIPPED FOR IT.
LET ME JUST LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE DID A MUSICAL TOGETHER WHERE THEY GOT THIS EXTRAORDINARY CAST TOGETHER, BUT EVERYONE HAD REALLY BUSY SCHEDULES. STEPHEN WAS DOING HIS SHOW, AND WE HAD TO LEARN CHOREOGRAPHY AND ALL THESE --
Stephen: AND HARMONIES.
AND HARMONIES. AND HE WOULD LEARN THEM ONLINE ON HIS COMPUTER, AND I DID MINE IN L.A. I LEARNED CHOREOGRAPHY IN L.A. AND THEN THEY BROUGHT THE WHOLE GROUP TOGETHER IN NEW YORK CITY. WE HAD, WHAT, FIVE DAYS TO --
Stephen: WE NEVER ACTUAL-- WE ACTUALLY NEVER RAN IT THROUGH ALL TOGETHER.
EVER.
Stephen: UNTIL WE DID IT LIVE AT LINCOLN CENTER. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE RAN THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.
AND I REMEMBER TURNING TO CRAIG BERRICO WAS STANDING NEXT TO ME WHO IS A WONDERFUL ACTOR AND I SAID, "I CAN'T FEEL ANY OF MY LIMBS."
Stephen: IT WAS THE MOST NERVE-RACKING THING WE EVER DID. YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY LOVELY.
AND HIS VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
Stephen: OH, YOU'RE VERY SWEET. THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU, VERY KIND ( APPLAUSE ) AND HE'S A HUGE SONDHEIM FAN.
Stephen: I'M A HUGE SONDHEIM FAN! HOW DID YOU GET ROPED INTO IT? I'LL TELL YOU MINE IF YOU TELL ME YOURS.
THEY CALLED ME AND SAID, "WOULD SHE LIKE TO PLAY THIS ROLE?" AND I SAID, "DO THEY UNDERSTAND I'VE NEVER SUNG PUBLICLY BEFORE AND THIS IS AN INSANE THING?" AND THEY SAID, "WELL, WE HEARD YOU DID MUSICAL THEATER IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STUFF." AND I SAID, "OKAY," I SAID, "LISTEN, THIS IS CRAZY." PATTI LAPONE IS IN IT, STEPHEN COLBERT, AND NEIL PATRICK HARRIS IS IN IT. I SAID, "I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE FREAKED OUT. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO GO STUDY WITH A VOCAL TEACHER FOR A WEEK, AND AT THE END OF THAT WEEK, I WILL EITHER AUDITION FOR THEM OR THEY CAN CALL THE VOCAL TEACHER AND SAY 'CAN SHE DO IT." I DIDN'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN.
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
THEY CALLED THE VOCAL TEACHER AND HE SAID, "SHE CAN DO IT." SO I SAID I'M GOING TO DO IT.
Stephen: YOU DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THE "NEW YORK TIMES" EYE BELIEVE THE "NEW YORK TIMES" CALLED YOU A "REVELATION." I BELIEVE THEY SAID THAT IN THE REVIEW.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.
Stephen: I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE, THE OPENING SCENE, THE OPENING MUSICAL NUMBER-- ♪ BOAB ♪
Stephen: BOBBY, BOBBY BABY AND IT'S INTRICATELY TIMED. IT'S INCREDIBLE, ALMOST UNLEARNABLE IN TERMS OF THE SYNCOPATION. BUT AT ONE POIN DURING THE OPENI YOU AND I ARE DANCING WITH EACH OTHER AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU-- AND I MEAN THIS AS AN ABSOLUTE COMPLIMENT-- WHEN YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN AND YOU FIND YOURSELF DANCING WITH A CHRISTINA HENDRICKS, YOU TEND TO MISS YOUR CUES. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ON INAUGURATION DAY YOU WERE DOWN IN D.C. THIS YEAR, WEREN'T YOU? WERE THRU TO CHEER ON THE NEW PRESIDENT?
I WAS THERE FOR THE CREATIVE COALITION.
Stephen: NOW, WHAT IS THAT?
THE CREATIVE COALITION IS THIS EXTRAORDINARY GROUP THAT'S A NONPARTISAN GROUP THAT MAKES SURE NO MATTER WHO YOUR PRESIDENT IS, NO MATTER WHAT, THAT WE GET ARTS EDUCATION.  ( CHEERS ) YEAH.
Stephen: GREAT IDEA. THAT'S EXCELLENT.
IT KIND OF SAVED MY LIFE. WHEN I WAS A KID-- I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN IDAHO, WHERE I STARTED BEING IN PLAYS AS A KID. IT WAS MY MOM'S IDEA.
Stephen: WHERE IN IDAHO.
AT TWIN FALLS, IDAHO.
Stephen: I'VE BEEN TO TWIN FALLS.
YOU HAVE!
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S GOT THE-- IT'S GOT THE TWO FALLS THERE.
STATE RIVER CANYON. EVILICA NEVIL --
Stephen: DID NOT JUMP OVER THE SNAKE RIVER.
YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: SPEAK OF YOUR CHILDHOOD BOOK IN TWIN FALLS, THE NEW MOVIE "FIST FIGHT" TAKES PLACE IN A HIGH SCHOOL. DID YOU SHOOT IN AN ACTUAL HIGH SCHOOL.
WE SHOT IN AN ACTUAL HIGH SCHOOL-- DID I SAY ASSUAL? THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING BACK INTO A HIGH SCHOOL? DID IT BRANG BRING BACK A LOT-- DID IT TRIGGER ANY MEMORIES FOR YOU?
IT WAS INCREDIBLE THAT YOU CAN WALK-- WE SHOT IN AN OLD HIGH SCHOOL IN ATLANTA, AND WE WALKED IN, AND THE SMELL SMELLS LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL. AND I JUST FELT LIKE THE NERD THAT I WAS. YOU KNOW, 20 YEARS AGO. OH, NO! OH, NO! WHAT DO YOU HAVE!
Stephen: WE'VE GOT SOME--
ARE YOU GOING TO PUNCH ME?
Stephen: NO, NO. THIS IS YOU-- THIS IS YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FANTASTIC.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: NOW AT ANY POINT DID MOLLY RING WOULD SEE YOU FOR IDENTITY THEFT.
THAT WAS SAMANTHA MATTHEWS "PUMP UP THE VOLUME."
Stephen: THIS ONE, A LITTLE GOTHY. A LITTLE GOTHY RIGHT THERE. YOU WERE A THEATER KID?
I WAS A THEATER KID. I WAS A THEATER KID. AND I HAD STARTED DOING THEATER AT-- IN IDAHO IN COMMUNITY THEATER, AND THEN MY PARENTS BROUGHT US TO VIRGINIA, AND I GOT INVOLVED IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. YOU KNOW, IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO SEE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES, HAVE EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE. AND IT TAUGHT ME A LOT.
Stephen: SO WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THE MOVIE, LIKE, WHO-- WHO ARE YOU PULLING FOR?
WELL --
Stephen: BECAUSE MY MONEY-- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ON ICE CUBE IN THIS ONE. ( LAUGHTER ).
I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT CHARLIE DAY AND YOU LOOK AT ICE CUBE AND YOU'RE ANYTHING TO PUT YOUR MONEY ON ICE CUBE. MY CHARACTER IS GOING FOR ICE CUBE.
Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER WANTS TO STAB CHARLIE DAY TO DEATH.
WELL, BECAUSE I THINK HE'S DONE SOMETHING HORRIBLE TO A STUDENT AND I'M LOYAL AND PROTECTIVE DISWR.
Stephen: AND YOU THINK THE BEST WAY TO RESPOND IS TO STAB SOMEBODY TO DEATH.
IN A MOVIE CALLED "FIST FIGHT." IN REAL LIFE I THINK I MIGHT GO FOR CHARLIE DAY BECAUSE HE'S SCRAPPY.
Stephen: I'M STILL GOING WITH ICE CUBE ON THIS ONE. CHRISTINA, IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU. HOPE WE SEE YOU AGAIN SOON.

WE DON'T CALL IT AUSTRALIA. WE CALL IT "VELCRO WORLD" THE SAFEST PLACE ON EARTH. THIS IS WALKING IN VELCRO WORLD.
SKIPPING IN VELCRO WORLD. OKAY, IT'S NOT MUCH FUN, BUT IT REALLY WORKS THE QUADS. IT'S GREAT.
