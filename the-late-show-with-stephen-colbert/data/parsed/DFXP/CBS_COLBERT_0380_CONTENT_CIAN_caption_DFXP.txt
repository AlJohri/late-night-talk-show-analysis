Captioning sponsored by CBS  PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUSHINGBACK AGAINST THE REVELATION THAT HE HAD A SECOND PREVIOUSLY UNDISCLOSED CONVERSATION WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. IT HAPPENED DURING A DINNER WITH WORLD LEADERS AT THE G20 SUMMIT IN GERMANY LAST WEEK. WE HERE AT THE LATE SHOW WONDERED A WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT SO WE ASKED THE WAIT STAFF.
AT ONE POINT TRUMP SAID TO PUTIN, I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL 20 COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD ARE HERE.
TRUMP CHOKED ON A DINNER ROLL AND KEPT COUGHING BUT LATER INSISTING THERE WAS NO HACKING WHATSOEVER.
TRUMP PUT HEINZ 57 ON HIS STEAK BUT LATER CLAIMED IT WAS HEINZ 3 MILLION.
TRUMP TUCK A NAPKIN THAT HIS KOL AR SO HE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING ON HIS SHIRT, PUTIN JUST TOOK HIS SHIRT OFF.
HE TOLD TRUMP THE MALE WAS COMPLIMENTARY BUT FOR SOME REASON HE STILL INSISTED THAT MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR IT.
TRUMP DIDN'T FIND THE GO20 THAT ATTRACTIVE. HE CALLED IT A G6 AT BEST.
AT ONE POINT THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME WHICH ONE WAS THE SALAD FORK BUT I COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE THEY ALL LOOKED SO HUGE NEXT TO HIS HANDS.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. RUSSIA WEEK! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES JAMES McAVOY, AND COMEDIAN MATEAO LAY FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND STEPHEN MEETING WITH REAL LIFE OLIGARCH MIKHAIL P PRRKS OKOHOROV AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: WHOOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU, COMRADS! WOW. SOMEBODY SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY--  THAT, THIS CROWD SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN HITTING THE PICKLES AND VODKA OUT THERE. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY, I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. NOW IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW-- IF YOU WATCHED THE SHOW LAST NIGHT I'M GOING TO SAY ALL OF YOU DID. YOU REMEMBER YOU REMEMBER LAST NIGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF PROMISING OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE THE BILL DIED OF TERMINAL, THEY LIED TO EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR THEM. NOT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY DID. THEY LIED. NOW NOT THAT BIG OF A SURPRISE THAT IT DIDN'T PASS. THE BILL IS LESS POPULAR THAN THE CEREAL PARTS OF LUCKY CHARMS. OR AS I CALL THEM, DISAPPOINTMENT BETWEEN MARSHMALLOWS. BUT TRUMP WON'T TAKE PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS, IT WILL COST US THE MID TERMS FOR AN ANSWER. THIS MORNING TRUMP TWEETED, I WILL BE HAVING LUNCH AT THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY WITH REPUBLICAN SENATORS CONCERNING HEALTH CARE. THEY MUST KEEP THEIR PROMISE TO AMERICA. WELL, OBVIOUSLY AT LUNCH-- (APPLAUSE) YOU CAN DO THIS-- LUNCH IS WHERE THE DEAL IS MADE. THAT'S THE ART OF THE DEAL. OKAY, SENATOR COLINS, I WILL TRADE YOU YOUR HEALTH CARE VOTE FOR MY JUICE BOX AND A PUDIN PACK. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. NOW THE PRESIDENT KICKED OFF THE EVENT WITH SOME LIGHT-HEARTED BULLYING OF ONE OF THE SENATORS OPPOSED TO THE BILL, NEVADA DEAN HELLER.
THE OTHER NIGHT I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS, MY FRIENDS, THEY REALLY WERE, AND ARE, THEY MIGHT NOT BE VERY MUCH LONGER. BUT I THINK HAVE I TO GET THEM BACK. THAT'S RIGHT-- WELL, NO, YOU DIDN'T GO OUT THERE. THIS WAS THE ONE WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE. HE WANTS TO REMAIN A SENATOR, DOESN'T HE?
Stephen: HA HA, HO-HO, OH, NOT SURE IF HE DOES ANY MORE. CUZ IF YOU ARE TRYING TO REMAIN A SENATOR, YOUR FIRST CHOICE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PHOTOGRAPHED HAVING DINNER WITH DONALD TRUMP. AND TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT HIS FAULT. IT IS NOT HIS FAULT! THAT THIS BILL DID NOT PASS.
I'VE BEEN HERE JUST SIX MONTHS. I'M READY TO ACT. I HAVE PEN IN HAND, BELIEVE ME. I'M SITTING IN THAT OFFICE. I HAVE PEN IN HAND.
Stephen: SIR, I HAVE NO PROBLEM BELIEVING YOU'RE JUST SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH LET'S SAY PEN IN HAND. AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PEN IN HAND. AND I GOT TO SAY. IF YOU CAN'T EVEN BET THIS DONE, PRETTY SOON YOUR PEN WILL BE SWINGING IN THE WIND. AND TRUMP WENT AFTER THE SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER FOR OBSTRUCTING THE BILL.
YOU KNOW, YOU LISTEN TO SCHUMER AND BEFORE HE EVEN KNEW WHAT THE PLAN SAID SHALL, HE WAS SAYING DEATH, EVERYONE'S GOING TO DIE, DEATH, DEATH, DEATH.
Stephen: NOW, TO BE FAIR, HE WAS ACTUALLY QUOTING CHUCK SCHUMER'S HARD-CORE MET AT BAND MALL IG NANT SCHUMER-- MALL IG DID -- MALL IG NENT SCHUMER. (APPLAUSE) SO NOBODY KNOWS IF THIS LEAN ON THEM AT LUNCHTIME IS GOING TO WORK. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS HOPING IT LIVES UP TO ITS EARLIER TWEET, THE REPUBLICANS NEVER DISCUSS HOW GOOD THEIR HEALTH-CARE BILL IS. AND IT WILL GET EVEN BETTER AT LUNCHTIME. THE DEMS SCREAM DEATH AS O-CARE DIES. OH MY GOD, THAT LAST PART IS ALMOST POETIC. THE DEMS SCREAM DEATH AS O-CARE DIES. IT'S ACTUALLY IAMBIC. NO, ITS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY, IF YOU LEAVE A MAN WAY BRAIN OF A HUNDRED MONKEYS IN FRONT OF A KEYBOARD LONG ENOUGH, EVENTUALLY HE WILL WRITE SHAKESPEARE. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE DEMS SCREAM DEATH AS O-CARE DIES. ALAS, POOR YORK, HE WAS COVERED BY TRUMPCARE. (APPLAUSE) GOT THORNS ON THEM. OH, AND THERE'S YET ANOTHER TRUMP-RUSSIA SCANDAL OUT THERE. AFTER THEIR PUBLIC MEETING AT THE G20, WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT TRUMP HAD AN UNDISCLOSED SECOND MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. REALLY? HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE? YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT COULD BE THE WORST SCANDAL IN U.S. HISTORY. PEOPLE THINK YOU COLLUDED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF A HOSTILE FOREIGN POWER. THEN YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MEET WITH HIM AGAIN AND YOU DON'T TELL ANYBODY? THAT'S LIKE IF O.J. DOES GET OUT ON PAROLE AND IMMEDIATELY GOES GLOVE SHOPPING. (LAUGHTER) HEY, THEY ALL FILT. LOOK HOW WELL THEY FIT.
Jon: HE CAN'T ACQUIT, HE CAN'T ACQUIT.
Stephen: NOW THIS MEETING TOOK PLACE DURING A DINNER AT THE G20 THAT WAS COUPLES ONLY. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH G20 LADIES NIGHT WHEN MERKEL'S DRINK FREE. NOW SO FAR THE WHITE HOUSE OF COURSE HAS DOWNPLAYED THIS MEETING CALLING IT A BRIEF CONVERSATION AT THE END OF DINNER. BRIEF. BECAUSE AFTER ALL, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GIVE SOMEONE YOUR ROOM KEY. ROOM 1101, BRING A TARP. BUT-- ALLEGEDLY, ALLEGEDLY, ALLEGEDLY. MORE ON THAT TOMORROW. BUT THE MEETING ACTUALLY LASTED AS LONG AS AN HOUR. GENTLEMEN, IF YOUR COLLUSION LASTS LONGER THAN AN HOUR, PLEASE CONSULT THE FBI. (APPLAUSE) THE WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE INSINUATION THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TRIED TO HIDE A SECOND MEETING IS FALSE, MALICIOUS AND ABSURD. STRONG WORDS. AND I THINK WE'VE ALSO FOUND TRUMP'S RE-ELECTION SLOGAN. TRUMP 2020, FALSE, MALICIOUS AND AN DURED. -- ABSURD. (APPLAUSE) BUT-- BUT TRUMP INSISTS HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG HERE TWEETING FAKE NEWS STORY OF SECRET DINNER WITH PUTIN IS SICK AND EVEN A DINNER ARRANGED FOR TOP 20 LEADERS IN GERMANY IS MADE TO LOOK SINNISTER. MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A PRIVATE DINNER IN GERMANY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CONTROL THE WORLD. IT ALREADY LOOKS SINNISTER. -- SIN IS TER, FAKE NEWS IS MAKING MY FORTRESS ON SKULL ISLAND LOOK EVIL, SAD. YOU KNOW WHAT, HERE'S THE THING, HERE'S THE THING. I WANT TO BELIEVE TRUMP HERE. I REALLY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS JUST SHOOTING THE BREEZE WITH A GUY HE IS ACCUSED OF COLLUDING WITH FOR THE SECOND TIME THAT DAY FOR AN HOUR.
VLAD, WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ANIMAL TO RIDE SHIRTLESS. YOU HAVE ONE HOUR TO ANSWER. (LAUGHTER) BUT HERE'S WHY IT IS HARD. HERE'S WHY IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE HIM. ELYS ABOUT EVERYTHING. ELYS ABOUT CROWD SIZE, VOTER FRAUD, TILL DEATH DO US PART. HE IS THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF BLITZER IS FAKE NEWS. THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A NOTHING BURGER BUT EVERY TIME THEY TELL US IT IS A NOTHING BURGER IT TURNS OUT TO BE A JUICY QUARTER POUNDER WITH SLEEVES. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: OH, OH, OH!
Stephen: YOU I AM CHOOSING TO BELIEVE THAT NOTHING HAPPENED THIS TIME. HAVE I TO JUST TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. BECAUSE BETWEEN HEALTH CARE, AND THE PRESIDENT PLAYING FOOT SEE WITH THE RUSSIANS, EVERY TIME TRUMP SPEAKS THIS IS ALL I HEAR.
DEATH, EVERYONE'S GOING TO DIE, DEATH, DEATH, DEATH.
Stephen: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JAMES McAVOY IS HERE. AND I SIT DOWN WITH AN ACTUAL RUSSIAN OLIGARCH MIKHAIL PROKHOROV. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, IT IS DAY THREE OF RUSSIA WEEK HERE AT THE LATE SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: ONE OF THE REASONS I WENT TO RUSSIA IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A STRONG MAN AS A LEADER AND WE HAVE A MAN WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEEM STRONG. AND IF HE SUCCEEDS, IF WE'RE LIVING UNDER A STRONG MAN, RUSSIA HAS PROVEN THAT THE BEST THING TO BE IS AN OLIGARCH, WHICH IS RUSSIAN FOR RICH GUY, DON'T ASK WHERE HIS MONEY CAME FROM. SEE, THIS IS HOW THINGS WORK OVER IN RUSSIA. OVER THERE THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS CONTROLLED BY WEALTHY ELITES WHO BUY INFLUENCE AND PULL STRINGS OF THE GOVERNMENT. WHEREAS IN AMERICA, WE SPEAK ENGLISH. THE OLIGARCHS, THE OLIGARCHS ARE BUSINESS FRIENDS OF VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO WERE GIVEN SWEETHEART DEALS TO BUY STATE OWNED RESOURCES AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION. I WAS HOPING TO MEET ONE AND ALSO TO NOT DIE. AND WE FOUND THE PERFECT GUY. MIKHAIL PROKHOROV. JIM?
Stephen: IN 1995, MIKHAIL PROKHOROV, A FRIEND OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, STRUCK GOLD-- IN THIS CASE NICKEL-- BECAUSE HE WAS ALLOWED TO BUY A STATE OWNED NICKEL MINING CONGLOMERATE FOR JUST PENNIES ON THE NICKEL. 12 YEARS LATER, THE HIGH FLYING BACHELOR HIGH FLEW IN HIS PRIVATE JET TO A FRENCH SKI RESORT TO PARTY WITH 20 RUSSIAN MODELS WHO THE FRENCH POLICE CLAIMED WERE PROSTITUTES, SO THEY ARRESTED HIM FOR "LE HUMAN TRAFFICKING." HE WAS NEVER CHARGED, BUT IT WAS SO SCANDALOUS THAT REPORTEDLY PUTIN FORCED HIM TO SELL HIS SHARE OF THE NICKEL MINE RIIIIIGHT BEFORE THE WORLD ECONOMY DROVE OFF A CLIFF. SO LUCKY MICKY HERE ENDS UP WITH MORE THAN $9 BILLION. HE HAS A JET, AND A YACHT SO BIG IT HAS ITS OWN YACHT. HE ENJOYS PARTYING IN IBIZA, HELI-SKIING AND MAKING ROCK VIDEOS OF HIMSELF DOING JET SKI TRICKS. HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2012, BUT HE LOST TO PUTIN. WHICH SOME SAY WAS THE PLAN THE WHOLE TIME. THAT'S DOING A BRO A SOLID. HE'S PALS WITH JAY-Z BECAUSE HE OWNS THE BROOKLYN NETS, THE WORST BASKETBALL TEAM IN THE WORLD. PROKHOROV STANDS 6'8", AND DID I MENTION FRIENDS WITH PUTIN? FOR SOME REASON HE INVITED ME TO HIS HOUSE OUTSIDE MOSCOW. AND FOR SOME REASON I WENT. MIKHAIL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
MY PLEASURE. CAN I CALL YOU STEVE?
Stephen: YES.
IF YOU SAID NO, YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: THAT'S HILARIOUS. OKAY. TELL ME HOW TO OLIGARCH? OKAY, GREAT. AGAIN FUNNY JOKE, IS IT A JOKE?
NOBODY KNOWS, IN RUSSIA.

Stephen: OKAY. BUT YOU DO HAVE A YACHT, RIGHT?
YES, I HAVE.
Stephen: OKAY. DO YOU HAVE A JET?
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HECK IT IS.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR YACHT IS?

Stephen: THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS. DO YOU HAVE A SPORTS TEAM?

Stephen: MORE LIKE THE BROOKLYN NYETS! RIGHT?

Stephen: UP TOP! DON'T LEAVE ME HANGIN'! COME ON! THANKS. NOW YOU'RE SINGLE. WHAT'S A NICE, SUCCESSFUL, HANDSOME GUY LIKE YOU DOING SINGLE? THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO'D LIKE TO MARRY AN OLIGARCH.

Stephen: OKAY. HAVE YOU JUST NOT FOUND THE RIGHT GIRL AND 19 OF HER FRIENDS?

Stephen: I DIDN'T ASK THAT WHICH IS ODD. IS THIS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS? IS THIS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS? OH, THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS. OKAY, WHAT IS THIS? YOU SAID THERE WERE NO SECRET ROOMS.
IT'S NOT SECRET.
Stephen: IT'S NOT A SECRET?

Stephen: AK-47 CAN I JUST STAND-- JUST ME-- A PICTURE OF ME AND AN OLIGARCH HOLDING AN AK-47? EVENTUALLY WHEN I'M BROUGHT UP BEFORE THE HAGUE I WANT TO LOOK NICE. OH, JAPANESE THROWING STARS.
NO, IT'S OLIGARCH THROWING STARS.
Stephen: OH, IT'S OLIGARCH THROWING STARS. EVERY EIGHTH GRADE BOY IS LIKE, "WHEN I GROW UP, I'M GONNA HAVE A SECRET ROOM BEHIND A WALL AND I'M GONNA HAVE JAPANESE THROWING STARS AND A AK-47 AND BIG PICTURES OF NAKED LADIES. I'M GONNA HAVE A JET AND A BOAT I DON'T EVEN USE." THAT'S LIKE-- THAT'S LIKE-- THAT'S-- THIS IS YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE LIVING THE PERFECT LIFE OF AN EIGHTH GRADE BOY. OKAY, MIKHAIL DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU PUT THE OTHER ONE? OH, THIS IS A NICE KITCHEN, LOVELY.

Stephen: OLIGARCH SNACK? LIKE CAVIAR?
BOLOGNA.
Stephen: SO YOUR SNACK IS BALOGNA ARE YOU SURE YOU ARE NOT AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY?
I'M SURE.
Stephen: THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY.
IT'S FOR SAUNA.
Stephen: THIS IS THE BIGGEST YARMULKE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT'S THE COOLEST HAT THERE IS, BECAUSE WE'RE OLIGARCHS. IT'S NOT A DUMB HAT AT ALL. CAN WE TOUCH, CAN WE TOUCH THE TIPS? NOT A LOT OF MEN ARE COMFORTABLE DOING THAT. OH, THIS IS NICE, YOU HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE BOATING ACCIDENTS, THAT'S GOOD. JUST TO REMIND YOURSELF- "BE CAREFUL." OKAY, LET'S THROW SOME PIES ON AND DO THIS.
NO, NO, ITS VERY TRADITIONAL, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, IT'S FOR SIMPLE PEOPLE, NOT FOR OLIGARCHS.
Stephen: ARE YOU AFRAID I WILL OUT-BENCH YOU?
NO, NO, FOR YOU I HAVE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NOT HERE, ANOTHER PLACE.
Stephen: I AGREED TO GO SEE THIS "SPECIAL EQUIPMENT," BUT FIRST I DITCHED MY SUIT FOR A NEW RELAXED OLIGARCH LOOK. WE HEADED OFF TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL MIKHAIL BUILT SO HE COULD PRACTICE AN ANCIENT, OBSCURE BUT DEADLY, TIBETAN MARTIAL ART CALLED "TESCAO." SO I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO KILL ANYBODY?
NO.
Stephen: GOOD. AND YOU WOULD TELL ME IF I DID RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS?
SURE.
Stephen: OKAY. BECAUSE I'M NOT SAYING THAT I WOULDN'T I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO. I'M NEW TO THIS. TURNS OUT THIS "TESCAO" PLACE IS THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE TREE FORT. DESIGNED TO THE HIGHEST TESCAO SPECIFICATIONS. FILLED WITH THINGS LIKE THIS, THAT DO SOMETHING-- ONE ASSUMES. THIS IS THE COOLEST GYMBOREE I'VE EVER BEEN TO, WHAT TIME IS YOUR MOM PICKING YOU UP?
TO BE AN OLIGARCH YOU NEED TO HAVE BALANCE AND TO FOR THE BALANCE, I MEAN OLIGARCH BALANCE YOU NEED BALLS.
Stephen: THOSE I HAVE, MY FRIEND. YOU ARE JUST MAKING THIS UP RIGHT? THIS IS COOL, IT LOOKS LIKE DR. SEUSS' SEX DUNGEON. YOU'LL GET IT. I NOTICED THE FLOOR IN THIS TESCAO TRAINING ROOM IS NOT EVEN, WHY IS THAT?
YOU ARE OLIGARCH NOW YOU ARE COMFORTABLE IN ANY SITUATION.
Stephen: OH, I SEE. I GOT TO RELAX AND JUST SAY THIS IS HOW IT IS, AND IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE ARCHITECT WAS SMOKING WEED. COME ON YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOMETHING.
GREAT.
Stephen: TESCAO! (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) HAVE YOU EVER TRAINED IN THE FULL COLBERT? WHAT YOU DO IS YOU ON YOUR BACK AND RELAX YOUR ARMS AND LEGS AND SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN HOLD IT. BUT YOU HAVE TO BREATHE, THOUGH. YOU HAVE GET BREATHING I COULD GO FOR SOME OF THAT BOLOGNA. I THOUGHT I'D SEEN EVERYTHING. BUT THEN THE GIANT RUSSIAN OLIGARCH ORDERED ME UNDERGROUND. OKAY, AND WHAT IS DOWN THERE BEFORE I GO DOWN THERE?
YOU ARE OLIGARCH YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.
Stephen: OKAY, WHATEVER I AM GOING DOWN. THIS IS WHERE THE CHUCK E. CHEESE TURNED INTO THE DANGER ZONE. WELCOME TO THE RED ROOM OF PAIN.
STEVE, THIS IS LETHAL STAR. YOU CAN HIT THIS IN SOMEONE AND TRY AND HIT THEM IN THE NECK. KEEP IT. I SHOW YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.
Stephen: ALRIGHT HERE IS THE SCENARIO, SOMEBODY IS COMING UP BEHIND ME AND TRYING TO TAKE MY OLIGARCHY AWAY, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT I AM TRAINED IN TESCAO. OKAY, I AM THEIR WORST NIGHTMARE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE MY STARS, WATCH OUT.

Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE DO TESCAO IN THE ENTIRE WORLD?
MAXIMUM MAYBE 25.
Stephen: 25. SO I AM IN THE TOP 25 PRACTITIONERS OF TESCAO IN THE WORLD?

Stephen: THIS IS YOUR BILLIONAIRE THING! REMEMBER SAID IS THERE ONE CRAZY THAT YOU DO THAT NO BODY ELSE DOES, THAT SEEMS NORMAL BECAUSE YOU ARE A BILLIONAIRE. THIS IS IT! YOU HAVE A CLUB HOUSE PAINTED IN DR. SEUSS COLORS IT HAS A DUNGEON IN IT WHERE YOU THROW AXES AT THE WALL. YOU ARE AN HONEST TO GOD OLIGARCH!

Stephen: WHEN YOU, WHEN YOU GET A HAIRCUT, DO PEOPLE HANG OUT OUTSIDE THE BARBER TO SEE HOW SHORT IT IS GOING TO BE, TO SEE IF THERE IS ANOTHER X-MEN MOVIE DOWN THE LINE. BECAUSE IT GIVES IT AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE PLAGUE THE DALAI LAMA.
THE THE THING IS WHEN I FIRST GOT MY HAIR SHAVED NOBODY RECOGNIZED ME, NOBODY KNEW WHO I WAS, THAT WAS GREAT. I WAS WALKING AROUND MONTREAL WHERE WE FILM X-MEN AND IT WAS LIKE HAVING FAKE GLASSES AND MUSTACHE AND NOSE ON AND ALL THAT STUFF.

Stephen: YEAH.

Stephen: FANTASTIC HAIR. ALL OF YOUR HAIR WENT TO HIM.
YES.

WE'RE BACK WITH JAMES McAVOY. NOW JAMES, LET ME ASK YOU THIS ABOUT PROFESSOR X, CHARACTER BACKGROUND WORK IF YOU CAN REVEAL THIS, DOES THE CARPET MATCH THE LACK OF DRAPES? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE.

Stephen: DID HE KNOW?

SO WHILE I'M YELLING AT ME,-- (SPEAKING ITALIAN) THEN WE STARTED MAKING OUT AND BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD DONE THIS BEFORE, HE STARTED TO LOSE IT. SO LIKE AT THE END OF OUR OPERA, HE JUST LIKE SHOVES ME ASIDE AND STARTS SCREAMING AT HIMSELF AND GOES AY, FRANCESCO, WHAT YOU HAVE DONE! IT WAS GREAT. BUT ON AMERICAN DATES ARE YOU LIKE OH, YOU HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER. (LAUGHTER) MORE GUAC PLEASE. I LOVE ITALY, LIKE GREAT FOOD BUT IF YOU ARE A COFFEE DRINKER, ITALY IS THE BEST COFFEE IN THE WORLD. AND I HATE WE ARE STUCK IN AMERICA WITH STARBUCKS, LIKE IT'S JUST-- I KEEP GOING, I'M LIKE A BARYTED WIFE, I KEEP GOING BACK LIKE HE'LL CHANGE, BUT IT'S JUST THE SAME. I WANT INTO STAR BUCKS ONE TIME, THEY ASKED FOR MY NAME TO PUT ON THE BACK OF THE CUP, SHE TURNED AROUND, MADE MY DRINK, CAME BECOME, IT SAID POTATOE. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING. WHEN YOU HEAR POTATOE, YOU STOP WRITING ON THE CUP. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHEN YOU SAY, I'M SORRY, I HEARD POTATOE. (LAUGHTER) WOW. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? I MEAN WHAT BARISTA IS LIKE OH, THE FIFTH POATD POAT TODAY! -- FIFTH POTATOE TODAY! ONE TIME I WENT IN AND I WAS WEARING FAKE GLASSES. THEY HAD 2340 LENSES IN THEM BUT I WAS FEELING MYSELF, AND WENT UP TO THE-- WELL WE SHOULD STOP CALLING THEM BARISTAS, THEY ARE JUST EMPLOYEES AT STAR BUCKS, THAT'S CALLED SHADE.  AND I WENT UP TO THEM-- YES, YES, AND I WENT UP HI, SHE DIDN'T EVEN TYPE, SHE LOOKED AT ME AND GOES YOUR GLASSES DON'T HAVE ANY LENSES IN THEM. OKAY, WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY E OH MY GOD, YOU ARE RIGHT, I THOUGHT THIS WAS A SBARRO. YEAH, I KNOW. AND THEN HER GAY COWORKER WEARING REAL GLASSES, BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY US GAYS THERE IS ALWAYS ONE GAY WORKING AT STAR BUCKS, I DON'T KNOW WHY WHY. IF THERE IS ONE GAY, WORK WILL GET DONE. IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE GAY, NOTHING GETS DONE! ONE GAY IS ALWAYS MANNING A SINKING SHIP, SUE, HURRY UP, LET'S GO, MORE MUFFINS. TWO GAYS, HAU, WHAT DOES SHE WANT. SO HE HEARS I'M WEARING FAKE GLASS, HE'S GOT REAL GLASSES, JUST SLITTERS INTO THE CONVERSATION, AND JUST PLAYS THE BIGGEST VICTIM. HE GOES I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THOSE WHO DON'T NEED GLASSES CHOOSE TO WEAR THEM. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WE WHO NEED THEM HAVE NO CHOICE. OKAY, JAFAR. (LAUGHTER) AND I JUST WANTED MY COFFEE SO I WAS LIKE CAN I GET PIE COFFEE AND THEY DOUBLED DOWN, LIKE WHY ARE WEARING THOSE GLASSES. SO I SAID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY FUNNY. I WAS LIKE INJURE YOUR JOB IS AS REAL AS THESE GLASS. I KNOW! BUT LISTEN, IT'S A FAKE JOB. BARISTA IS A FAKE JOB. IT'S A FAKE JOB IN THE SAME WAY I THINK A PHARMACIST IS I FAKE JOB LIKE OH, PHARMACIST-- WHY ARE YOU WEARING LAB COATS THERE IS NO SCIENCE HAPPENING BACK THERE. (LAUGHTER) NO CHEMISTRY, YOU'RE NOT IN INJURE JURASSIC PARK, YOU AREN'T CREATING NEW DINOSAURS, ARE YOU IN THE LOWEST FORM. ONE TIME I WAS IN OHIO TALKING ABOUT PHARMACISTS AND THIS GUY STANDS UP AND GOES I WENT TO SIX YEARS OF PHARMACY SCHOOL, I WAS LIKE WHAT DID YOU DO FOR SIX YEARS IN STARM SEE SCHOOL, DID YOU JUST PUT ON A LAB COAT AND YOUR TEACHER WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
