IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES SAMANTHA BEE. ABBY ELLIOTT. ABD ASA BUTTERFIELD. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY! OH, YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, CHRIS! WHAT'S ON, JON? TWO, TWO, TWO STRIPS OF BACON. WOW, NICE. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. READY FOR THE WEEKEND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ME, TOO. I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT BUT BIG NEWS JUST OUT. IT LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP MAY HAVE BROKEN THE LAW. YOU SHN BE THAT SHOCKED. "NEWSWEEK" HAS DISCOVERED THAT BACK IN 1998, TRUMP'S COMPANY VIOLATED THE EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA, ILLEGALLY SPENDING $68,000 ON A BUSINESS TRIP FOR REPRESENTATIVES OF TRUMP HOTELS AND CASINO RESORTS. NO WORD YET ON WHETHER THEY WERE IN CUBA TO SCOUT REAL ESTATE OR FIND A FRESH SUPPLY OF BEAUTY CONTESTANTS TO FAT-SHAME. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU RUN OUT AFTER A WHILE. YOU RUN OW AFTER A WHILE. TO SKIRT THE EMBARGO-- THIS IS WHAT THEY FOUND OUT-- TRUMP'S COMPANY DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY DIRECTLY. INSTEAD, THEY ILLEGALLY FUNNELED IT THROUGH A CONSULTING FIRM WHO ADVISED THEM "HOW TO MAKE IT APPEAR LEGAL BY LINKING IT AFTER THE FACT TO A CHARITABLE EFFORT." THAT'S HOW THEY GOT CAUGHT. BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE TRUMP MADE A CHARITABLE EFFORT. ( LAUGHTER ) STILL, THIS STORY SHOULDN'T BE A BIG PROBLEM FOR TRUMP, UNLESS THERE WAS SOME SORT OF SWING STATE WITH A HUGE CUBAN POPULATION WHO HATES ANYONE WHO WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH CASTRO. BU THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM, UNLESS THERE'S VIDEO OF HIM SAYING HE WOULD NEVER INVEST IN CUBA FROM THE SAME YEAR HE ACTUALLY DID. OH, THERE IS? AND WE HAVE IT? AND I'M PRETENDING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY OFF CAMERA FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT RIGHT NOW? THEN JUST PLAY IT THEN.
AS YOU KNOW-- AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE-- PUTTING MONEY AND INVESTING MONEY IN CUBA RIGHT NOW DOESN'T GO TO THE PEOPLE OF CUBA. IT GOES INTO THE POCKETS OF FIDEL CASTRO. (APPLAUSE) HE'S A MURDERER. HE'S A KILLER, HE'S A BAD GUY IN EVERY RESPECT.
Stephen: HE'S A MAN I'M PROUD TO CALL MY BUSINESS PARTNER. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE YOU, FIDEL. MWAH! THIS IS A DAMNING, CORROBORATED SCANDAL FOR TRUMP WITH ONLY ONE POSSIBLE RESULT:  HE GOES UP IN THE POLLS. BUT WE SHALL SEE. SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, ARE YOU GUYS FAMILIAR WITH A MEME CALLED PEPE THE FROG? FOR THOSE WHO DON'T, HERE'S A PICTURE. HERE'S PEPE THE FROG. AND PEPE WAS JUST DESIGNATED A HATE SYMBOL BY THE ANTI-DEFINATION LEAGUE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABUSING THE IMAGE OF A CARTOON CHARACTER TO HARASS AND SPREAD HATRED ON SOCIAL MEDIA," WHICH IS SHOCKING, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE NEEDED ANY HELP SPREADING HATRED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT PEPE DIDN'T START AS A SYMBOL OF HATE. HE WAS ORIGINALLY A CHARACTER IN AN INDIE COMIC ABOUT A GROUP OF FUN-LOVING STONERS CALLED "BOYS CLUB." IT'S SO HARD FOR WOMEN TO BREAK INTO THE WORLD OF CARTOON STONERS. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THEN THE INTERNET DISCOVERED PEPE AND TURNED HIM INTO A MEME, USING HIM TO CONVEY EMOTIONS LIKE SAD, ANGRY, SMUG-- AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY THREE EMOTIONS ALLOWED ON THE INTERNET THESE CAIZ. ( LAUGHTER ) SOON, PEPE BECAME SO BIG THAT CELEBRITIES LIKE NICKI MINAJ AND KATY PERRY WERE POSTING PICTURES OF HIM. THAT'S WITH HE RAN INTO THE NUMBER ONE RULE ON THE INTERNET: WHEN PEOPLE ONLINE LOVE A THING, PEOPLE ONLINE HATE THAT THING BECAUSE SOME-- LET'S SAY PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET-- DECIDED PEPE HAD GONE TOO MAINSTREAM, SO THEY DECIDED TO RUIN HIM FOR EVERYONE. AS ONE SELF-DESCRIBED WHITE NATIONALIST PUT IT, AS PART OF A "CAMPAIGN TO RECLAIM PEPE, WE BASICALLY MIXED HIM IN WITH NAZI PROPAGANDA"-- YOU KNOW, LIKE HOW WHEN THE HOT TUB GETS TOO CROWDED, YOU RECLAIM IT BY TAKING A DUMP IN IT. ( LAUGHTER ) MMMM. MMMM. MMMM. MORE FOR ME! MAO HERE'S THE THING: THIS ANTI-DEFAMATION BAN HAS GOT TO BE EMBARRASSING TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE BOTH HE AND DONALD JR.  HAVE POSTED IMAGES OF PEPE DRESSED AS TRUMP. AND USING PEPE JUST REINFORCES THE CONTINUING ACCUSATIONS THAT TRUMP HAS COURTED THE WHITE SUPREMACIST VOTE, CAN WHICH ISN'T FAIR. HE DID NOT COURT IT. HE JUST SAID EVERYTHING THEY WANTED TO HEAR. SPEAKING OF SCARY, HALLOWEEN IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. IT IS MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY. IT'S THE ONE TIME OF YEAR I CAN EAT AN ENTIRE BAG OF FUN-SIZE SNICKERS, AND IT'S NOT DEPRESSING. IT'S FESTIVE! AND EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, PEOPLE ARE HAWKING SPOOKY HALLOWEEN SWAG. BUT ONE PIECE OF MERCHANDISE HAS GOTTEN COMPLAINTS FOR BEING A LITTLE TOO SPOOKY. IT'S THE SCARY PEEPER CREEPER, "THE SUCTION-CUP-EQUIPPED HALLOWEEN DECORATION THAT MOUNTS OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW, SIMULATING A MAN PEERING INSIDE." AND THE WEBSITE SAYS IT'S A "SCARY, FUN HALLOWEEN DECORATION WITH REALISTIC DETAILS." ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S SUCH A REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF A PEEPING TOM, HOW COME YOU CAN SEE BOTH OF HIS HANDS?
Jon: OH, MAN! OH, MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH, MAN! ( LAUGHTER ) NO!
Stephen: NOW, YOU'VE GOT TO ACT FAST IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS ON THE CREEPER, BECAUSE HOME DEPOT HAS ALREADY PULLED THE ITEM FROM THEIR SHELVES IN CANADA. SO SAD. NOW THE PEEPER CREEPERS ARE OUTSIDE THE STORE SADLY LOOKING IN. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF CREEPY, AN AUSTRALIAN MAN, AFTER SITTING DOWN ON A PORTABLE TOILET, HAS BEEN BITTEN BY A VENOMOUS SPIDER ON THE PENIS, FOR A SECOND TIME.
Jon: THAT'S NASTIY!
Stephen: WOW.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOING WRONG, WHAT HE DOING WRONG? WHA
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT MUST BE LIKE BEING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING TWICE-- ON THE PENIS. HE WAS TAKEN TO THE SAME HOSPITAL WHERE THEY TREATED HIS FIRST BITE, AND THE MAN SAID "THEY GOT WORRIED THE FIRST TIME. THIS TIME, THEY WERE MAKING JOKES." WHICH PROVES THE OLD SAYING: "SPIDER BITES YOU ON THE PENIS ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. SPIDER BITES YOU ON THE PENIS TWICE, THAT'S HILARIOUS." ( LAUGHTER ) REMIND ME TO NEVER GO TO AUSTRALIA, BY THE WAY.
Jon: YOU BETTER WATCH THAT.
Stephen: BUT THE VICTIM DOESN'T AGREE SAYING: "I'M THE MOST UNLUCKY GUY IN THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT" UNLUCKY, SIR, UNLUCKY? YOU HAVE BEEN BITTEN TWICE IN THE PENIS BY A SPIDER. THAT'S NOT A TRAGIC TALE. THAT IS A SUPERHERO ORIGIN STORY. ♪ SPIDER WANG! SPIDER WANG! ♪ DOES WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN SPINS A WEB ANY SIZE ♪ CATCHES THIEVES WITH AN OPEN FLY ♪ LOOK OUT!

Stephen: AS YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I AM A DEVOUT THE CATHOLIC. BUT EVER SINCE I STARTED THIS SHOW, I OFTEN MISS CHURCH BECAUSE I'M SO BUSY NOT GOING. ( LAUGHTER ) GETS IN THE WAY.

SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES I PRETEND I RAN A MARATHON JUST TO GET A FREE CUP OF GATORADE. LAUGH SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT WHEN I GET TO HEAVEN, I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON. "SO, GEORGE, DID GOD LET YOU GROW YOUR REAL BATH BACK, OR WHAT?" ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVE NEVER CLEANED MY OVEN. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST MOVE EVERY FEW YEARS.

( LAUGHTER ) I JUST SAID THE WORD "ATTENTIONS" WHEN I MEANT TO SAY "ATTENTION." I'M GOING TO START THIS JOKE OVER AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) DURING PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES, I STOP PAYING ATTENTION.

AS I CAME HERE, I WAS KITTING IN THE GREEN ROOM, AND I REMEMBER YOU GAVE ME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIFT I HAVE KEPT FROM BEFORE SHOW LAUNCHED, YOU SENT A BEAUTIFUL GIFT BASKET-- WHATEVER IT WAS-- BUT YOU ALSO SENT A BEAUTIFUL GIFT CARD. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAID ON IT? "GO GET THOSE BASTARDS."
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT WE'D SAY ON "THE DAILY SHOW" WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO DO A FIELD PIECE, "GO GET THOSE BASTARDS?
I LOOK AT IT EVERY DAY. THERE'S MY SHINING STAR.
Stephen: BACK ON "THE DAILY SHOW "WHEN WE SAID GET THOSE BAFT ARTS IT WAS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED IN BIG FOOT. NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE TO GO AFTER THIS TIME. ARE YOU ENJOYING-- I MEAN THE THE SHOW IS GREAT, BUT ARE YOU ACTUALLY ENJOYING THIS CAMPAIGN? BECAUSE IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD BECAUSE YOU GET TO MAKE GREAT JONES ABOUT SOMEBODY LIKE DONALD TRUMP. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE COULD BE PRESIDENT.
"ENJOY" IS A STRONG WORD.
Stephen: YES.
I MEAN, IT IS-- IT'S CERTAIN A BUFFET OF WONDERFUL THINGS TO DRAW UPON TO MAKE A COMEDY SHOW.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
I WANT IT TO BE OVER SO BADLY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE! I WANT AMERICA TO BE HAPPY AGAIN.
Stephen: WELL, WERE YOU NERVOUS, LIKE, WERE YOU NEVER GOING INTO DEBATE ON MONDAY? A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NERVOUS HE WOULD COME ACROSS AS --
I WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS. WE HAD TERRIBLE ANXIETY IN OUR OFFICES ALL DAY. WE WERE ALL VERY PALE. WE'RE ALL VERY DRAWN. WE WERE CEEND OF SHIVERING. IT WAS KIND OF TERRIBLE.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU THINK IT WENT? THERE ARE POLLS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE SPINNING EITHER WAY. HOW DO YOU THINK IT WENT?
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WENT VERY WELL. I ACTUALLY WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME. I ENSCWOID, YOU KNOW, IN AFTER-- I FELT THAT TRUMP PEELED AWAY THE LAYERS OF THE ONION-- I FELT THAT HE REVEALED HIMSELF IN SMALL WAYS THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE IN A WAY THAT I REALLY DID-- I FELL-- I FELT QUITE-- I FELT QUITE GOOD ABOUT TA. THAT WAS NICE. AND THEN, OF COURSE, HE WENT ON "FOX AND FRIENDS" THE NEXT MORNING CAN REVEED EVEN MORE LAYERS. SO IT WAS GREAT.
Stephen: HE SAID THE FIX WAS IN.
UH-HUH, YEAH, YEAH, SO WE'LL SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS OUT. HA-HA! WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
Stephen: NEXT WEEK IS THE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE.
OH, YEAH...
Stephen: NOT AS-- NOAS HIGH STAKES.
NOT AS HIGH-- STILL IMPORTANT.
Stephen: STILL IMPORTANT BECAUSE EITHER ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE--
COULD BE PRESIDENT. AND IN FACT-- DIDN'T-- I FEEL LIKE DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID THAT MIKE PENCE WILL BE HIS DE FACTO PRESIDENT. I MEAN, WHILE HE'S BUSY MAKING AMERICA GREAT, MIKE'S GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF ALL THE POLICY AND ALL THAT OTHER ( BLEEP ).
Stephen: THE WORD IS DONALD TRUMP JR SAID WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT WILL BE BEST PRESIDENT EVER.
MAYBE WE SHOULD KEEP OUR EYES ON HIM.
Stephen: THEY'RE NOT BIGGEST FIRE BRANDS MET WORD, MIKE PENCE AND TIM KAINE.
MAYBE THEY'LL HAVE A BANJO DUEL.
Stephen: BANJO DUEL? I WOULD WATCH THAT.
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. THERE IS A SLIGHTLY INBRED QUALITY THERE.
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A DEBATE I COWED MODERATE, IN SOME WAYS.
Stephen: COPEOPLE EVER SAY TO YOU, "YOU SHOULD MOD RATE A DEBATE."
YES, BUT THEY DON'T MEAN IT.
Stephen: YES, THEY DO.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
Stephen: YES, THEY DO.
I WOULD DISAVOW THEM OF THAT NOTION QUICKLY, UNLESS IT'S A BANJO DEBATE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS UP TO ASK THEM?
I JUST WANT TO WATCH WHAT THEY DO AND I WANT SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS AND DO THEIR JOBS --
HOW ABOUT A FIGHT IN THE PIT?
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. LET'S GREASE THEM UP. ( LAUGHTER ) BACON GREASE.
Stephen: YOU CAN DO THAT. YOU CAN BE GREASE GIRL. GREASE THEM UP, AND SOMEBODY ELSE CAN MODERATE. "I'LL BE WITH YOU, IN JUST A MOMENT, ANDERSON COOPER."

Stephen: SNUCK UP ON ME. SNUCK UP ON ME. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM "THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS," "ENDER'S GAME," AND "HUGO." NOW HE IS THE LEADING MAN IN "MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN." PLEASE WELCOME, ASA BUTTERFIELD! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
HELLO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THOSE GUYS ARE GOOD.
Stephen: AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL?
AMAZING. FUNCY.
Stephen: THAT'S' GOOD DESCRIPTION. YOU HAVE KIND OF A MOHAWK. ARE YOU MOVING TOWARDS A MOHAWK OR IS THAT A MOHAWK GROWING OUT?
IT WAS A MOHAWK. I DID A FILM A COUP OF MONTHS AGO, I WAS PLAYING A PUNK, BASS GUITAR PLAYER AND THEY BUZZED IT.
Stephen: FROM THE 70S?
NO, MODERN-DAY PUNK FROM NEW WAVE. HE COMES IN THIS DOME AND GETS INTRODUCED INTO PUNK MUSIC.
Stephen: A DOME?
LIKE THE GEODISEASIC DOME. HE LIVES IN THERE WITH HIS NUTTY GRANDMA AND HAD A KIND OF ACEALATED EXISTENCE, AND SO THE PUNK MUSIC JUST BLOWS HIS MIND, BASICALLY.
Stephen: DID YOU LIKE IT? DID YOU GET A LOT OF ATTENTION WITH A MOHAWK WALKING DOWN THE STREET?
I WAS. I WAS SHOCKED WITH THE IMPRESSION IT GAVE OFF WALKING INTO STORES AND STUFF. EVERYONE WAS DOUBLE TAKE. I JUAN USED FOR IT FOR A WHILE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T SEEM LEAK A DANGEROUS PERSON.
NO I HAVE A NICE, INNOCENT VIBE AROUND ME AND THE MOHAWK WAS LIKE, "WHAT'S GOING ON IN?
Stephen: TIPS YOU OVER, COULD GO PSYCHOANY MOMENT. THAT'S A GOOD FEELING. HOW OLD ARE YOU?
19.
Stephen: OH, TO BE 19 AGAIN. LAUGH AND YOU JUST GOT YOUR FIRST APARTMENT, DIDN'T YOU?
I DID.
Stephen: IS THAT AS ADULTS IT SOUNDS, LIKE YOUR OWN APARTMENT, LIVING IN--
LONDON.
Stephen: NICE.
IT IS. I MEAN, I'M ENJOYING IT. I'VE HAD A PRETTY INDEPENDENT LIFE THE LAST YEAR JUST KIND OF ON THE ROAD, ACTING SO I'VE BEEN BY MYSELF. MOVING OUT IS FUN. GETTING MY OWN FURNITURE, LIKE, PAINTING WALLS. IT TOOK A WHILE. IT DID ATTACK A WHILE. I WAS ABOUT FOUR MONTHS BEFORE I HAD A COUCH, SO I JUST HAD, LIKE, CUSHIONS ON THE FLOOR. I GOT A TV. THAT WAS THE FIRST THING I GOT, TV.
Stephen, OF COURSE,, OF COURSE, YOU'RE 19. YOU DON'T NEED A COUCH. YOU NEED A TV. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE TIM BURTON. JOHNNY DEATH PENALTY IS NOT IN THIS TIM BURTON MOVIE, RIGHT? $LY, CAN IT BE A TIM BURTON MOVIE IF JOHNNY DEPP IS NOT IN IT?
JOHNNY IS NOT IN THIS ONE, SADLY.
Stephen: THERE ARE A LOT OF PALE, PEOPLE, RIGHT?
LOTS OF PALE PEOPLE. LOTS OF WHITE MAKE UP AND, YEAH, I MEAN, TIM BURTON MOVIE-- I MEAN, TIM IS SO ICONIC AND UNIQUE IN ITS STYLE. JUST WORKING WITH HIM. I WAS A MASSIVE TIM FAN BEFORE I DID THIS SO JUST BEING ON SET WATCHING WHAT HE DOES IS AWESOME.
Stephen: WHAT'S HE LIKE AS A DIRECTOR? IS HE VERY HANDS ON, OR IS HE LIKE, "JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT?"
IT'S A BIT OF BOTH. HE WANTS TO HEAR YOUR POINT OF VIEW AND HE'S VERY COLLABORATIVE. IF HE LIKES WHAT YOU'RE COULD GO YOU GET AN IMMEDIATE REACTION. "AWESOME, KEEP DOINGA THAT!" IF HE DOESN'T LIKE IT, HE'LL GIVE YOU DIRECTION. HE DOESN'T-- HE DOESN'T FINISH HIS SENTENCES SO YOU KIND VERY FAR TO KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DO YOU DO AN IMPRESSION OF HIM?
"SO IF YOU COULD COA LITTLE BIT MORE OF... YOU KNOW. AND JUST NOT SO MUCH... YEAH, RIGHT?" AND HEN HE WALKS OFF. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU GO, "YEAH, ALL RIGHT, TIM." ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANS?
IT TAKES A WHILE. IT TAKES A COUP OF WEEKS TO GET ON HIS WAVE LENGTH AND EVENTUALLY DO YOU. IT'S KIND OF CHAOTIC. BUT IT'S SO MUCH FUN. WOW.
Stephen: IT'S THE STORY OF-- I MEAN, IT'S A HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN. WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. DO WE NEED TO SET THIS UP?
THIS IS WHERE MY CHARACTER IS AT THIS HOME CAN HE'S KIND OF COMING TO TERMS WITH THE CRAZY ( BLEEP ) THAT'S GOING DOWN.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, JIM, LET'S SHOW THEM.
THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY?
LIKE CLOCKWORK.
WOULD YOU MIND TYING THAT ROPE AROUND MY WAIST. RIGHT, PROMISE TO HOLD ON TIGHT. ( APPLAUSE )
PRETTY COOL.
Stephen: DOES EVERYBODY HAVE A SPECIAL POWER?
EVERYONE HAS A SPECIAL POWER.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL POWER?
I DO HAVE A SUPERB POWER. IT'S NOT QUITE AS IMMEDIATELY EXCITING AS OTHER ONES.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS?
I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? DO YOU GUYS WANT TO KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SEE THE MONSTERS. YEAH SOERN ELSE THEY'RE ENVIB, BUT TO ME THEY ARE TERRIFYING. YEAH.
Stephen: WOW. AND TO FIEND OUT WHAT THE MONSTERS ARE, WE HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. GO WATCH IT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU PLEASURE.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. "MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN" IS IN THEATERS NOW. ASA BUTTERFIELD, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! TUNE IN NEXT WEEK WHEN I HAVE EMILY BLUNT, MINDY KALING, AND ARMIE HAMMER. JAMES CORDEN IS NEXT. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND! GOOD NIGHT!
