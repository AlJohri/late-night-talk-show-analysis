Stephen: THESE PEOPLE HAVE COME THROUGH STORMS. THEY HAVE COME THROUGH GIVING UP ON GOING TO THE GYM AFTER NEW YEAR'S. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: YUP, YUP, AIN'T GOING. AIN'T GOING.
Stephen: ANYWAY, T.G.I.F., IN WAYS I HAVE NEVER MEANT BEFORE, BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE WE'D MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE WEEK, GIVEN HOW THE OF WEEK STARTED WITH THE THERMONUCLEAR TWEET THREATS. ALL WEEK LONG TRUMP USED HIS TWITTER FEED TO JUST LASH OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION. SO, WHAT'S UP WITH GRANDPA CRANKY PANTS? APPARENTLY, IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP'S INFURIATED THAT HIS LEGAL TEAM HAS BEEN OFFERING SHIFTING TIMELINES ABOUT WHEN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WOULD END. AH, SO FRUSTRATING. IT'S LIKE THE CABLE COMPANY. THEY SAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET INDICTED BETWEEN NOON AND 3:00, AND YOU'RE WAITING AROUND AT 5:00 P.M. LIKE, "WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO PERP-WALK ME ALREADY?"
Jon: JUST LIKE THE CABLE COMPANY, JUST LIKE THEM.
Stephen: HERE'S THE DEAL. HIS LEGAL TEAM-- HE HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF LAWYERS-- HIS LEGAL TEAM TOLD HIM MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION WOULD BE OVER BY THE END OF 2017. SIR, I'M JUST AS DISAPPOINTED AS YOU ARE, BUT FOR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT REASON.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND WE, ALL OF US OUT HERE, US SANE PEOPLE WATCHING THIS, KNEW THAT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING WAS JUST SPIN, BUT TRUMP BELIEVED IT, JUST LIKE HE BELIEVES THE SELECTIVE GOOD NEWS THEY PUT IN FRONT OF HIM. NOW HE'S ANGRY AND NERVOUS AND HE'S GOT THAT SHINY BUTTON ON HIS DESK TELLING HIM HE CAN MAKE ALL THE PROBLEMS GO AWAY. LUCKILY, OUR IN-HOUSE NEWS NETWORK, "REAL NEWS TONIGHT," IS READY TO REASSURE OUR TROUBLED LEADER.
WELCOME TO "REAL NEWS TONIGHT." I'M JIM ANCHOR TON.
AND I'M JILL NEWSLADY. OUR TOP STORY-- THE ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE FAIR.
AND IT'S OVER.
WELL, SOON.
WHEN?
PRACTICALLY NOW. MAYBE IN THREE MORE SLEEPS.
I LOVE SLEEP. THERE'S NO F.B.I. THERE.
AND DONALD TRUMP CAN REST EASY BECAUSE ROBERT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION IS BASICALLY DONE.
YEAH, HE'S FREE TO GO BACK TO BEING OUR BIG, STRONG PRESIDENT.
YOU KNOW, JIM, I WISH I WAS A CHEESEBURGER SO HE WOULD DESIRE ME.
GIVE HIM THAT BEEF.
A REAL, "REAL NEWS TONIGHT" CORRECTION-- IT TURNS OUT STEVE BANNON IS NOT GOOD. HE'S BAD.
VERY BAD. WE REGRET THE ERROR.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, GUYS. SOLID. THE ONLY ONES I BELIEVE. THEATRE ONLY ONES I BELIEVE AT THIS POINT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS REMEMBER LAST SUMMER WHEN WE HAD THE BRIEF AND GLORIOUS REIGN OF FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR WIFE PROBLEM, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI. WELL, THE MOOCH SERVEDLET WHITE HOUSE FOR JUST 11 DAYS BUT HE'LL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER, MOSTLY FOR SAYING THAT STEVE BANNON COULD DRAIN HIS OWN SWAMP. HE'S POSSIBLY BRAGGING OF A POSSIBLE RETURN TO THE WHITE HOUSE. OH, PLEASE! OH, PLEASE COME BACK. BUT IT MAY NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE RUMOR HAS IT LAST YEAR, WHEN THE MOOCH WAS ON HIS FRONT-STABBING WORLD TOUR, THE PRESIDENT EARNESTLY ASKED PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, "IS HE ON DRUGS? I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:  DID HE BRING ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY? BECAUSE I COULD USE A LITTLE SOMETHING TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND THERE WERE SOME BIG CHANGES IN THE U.S. SENATE THIS WEEK. TWO NEW DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, INCLUDING DOUG JONES, WERE SWORN IN BY ANTI-GAY WARRIOR MIKE PENCE. CHECK ON THE EXPRESSION OF SENATOR JONES' SON, WHO HAPPENS TO BE GAY. OH, OH, YES.  ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T THINK PENCE IS GOING TO NEED SUNSCREEN FOR A WHILE BECAUSE HE'S GETTING A WHOLE LOT OF SHADE. JIMMY, CAN I SEE THAT AGAIN? THAT LOOK COULD NOT BE MORE SEARING.  (  LAUGHTER  ) I STAND CORRECTED.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE WAS ALSO-- THERE WAS ALSO A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT FROM UTAH SENATOR AND VENTRILOQUIST DUMMY PLOTTING AGAINST HIS MASTER, ORRIN HATCH.
AFTER MUCH PRAYER AND DISCUSSION WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, I'VE DECIDED TO RETIRE AT THE END OF THIS TERM.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S POSITIVE. THAT'S POSITIVE, YEAH. NOW THE REASON-- THE REASON THAT THIS IS NEWS IS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS TRYING TO GET HATCH TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION. HE'S ONLY 83. THAT'S THE PRIME OF YOUR 80s. TRUMP IS TERRIFIED THAT HATCH WILL NOW BE REPLACED BY FORMER G.O.P. NOMINEE AND MAN DAYDREAMING ABOUT TOAST, MITT ROMNEY. THAT'S RIGHT, ROMNEY'S BACK, BABY! AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. SURE, BACK IN 2012, I MADE A LOT OF JOKES ABOUT HIM, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE ROMNEY SEEMED SQUARE AND BORING. BUT NOW HE SEEMS SQUARE! AND BORING.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S HOW WE KNOW THAT MITT IS SERIOUS ABOUT RUNNING, BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER HATCH ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT PLANS, ROMNEY CHANGED HIS LOCATION ON TWITTER FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO HOLLADAY, UTAH. OH, COME ON, MITT. AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL SENATOR HATCH'S BODY IS COLD. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE THERE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. YOU GUYS LIKE NEIL TYSON?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) INCREDIBLE. MY FAVORITE GUEST. HE'LL BE OUT HERE. HE'LL BE OUT HERE IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAYBE TWO, THREE ACTS OR SOMETHING. INCREDIBLE. WHICH IS GREAT. I ALWAYS LOVE HAVING HIM OUT HERE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE NEWS OUT THERE. FOR ONE, A JAPANESE COMPANY IS PLANNING TO PUT A BILLBOARD ON THE MOON. NOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THE BILLBOARD FROM EARTH. THE COMPANY WANTS TO USE IT FOR MOON-SURFACE PHOTO OPS AND HOPES TO ATTRACT "CORPORATIONS LOOKING TO SHOW OFF THEIR LOGOS WITH EARTH IN THE BACKGROUND." NOW, I'M NOT SURE IF THEY KNOW THIS, BUT YOU KNOW WHERE ELSE YOU CAN GET PHOTOS WITH EARTH IN THE BACKGROUND? EARTH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT'S KIND OF HARD TO AVOID. BUT THIS IS A HUGE MILESTONE: HUMANITY'S FIRST AD IN SPACE. EVER SINCE OUR ANCESTORS FIRST RAISED THEIR EYES TO THE FIRMAMENT, THEY DREAMED OF TRAVELING TO THE STARS AND DECLARING TO THE COSMOS, "CHARMIN, ENJOY THE GO." IF THERE ARE BEARS WHO POOP IN SPACE. I DON'T KNOW. I JUST HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS JAPANESE COMPANY'S PLAN: IT SHOULD BE AMERICA'S PLAN. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LAW BANNING "OBTRUSIVE SPACE ADVERTISING." THAT'S TOO BAD. WE ALL REMEMBER THE HISTORIC MOMENT WHEN NEIL ARMSTRONG LANDED ON THE MOON.
THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND THAT CAN SAVE YOU 15% OR MORE ON YOUR CAR INSURANCE.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON RIGHT OVER THERE. STICK AROUND. NEIL!  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE BELOVE THE ASTROPHYSICIST, AUTHOR, AND DIRECTOR OF THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM AT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. PLEASE WELCOME MY FRIEND, NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ GOOD TO SEE YOU.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NEIL.
BEAUTIFUL-- I LOVE THE STARS.
Stephen: JUST FOR YOU, MY FRIEND, JUST FOR YOU.
LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: NOW, ON THE OLD GIG OVER ON THE OTHER NETWORK, UPPER THE GUEST I HAD MORE THAN ANY OTHER GUEST.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH-- YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW THAT --
COULD IT BE THAT I LIVE NEARBY, SO I WAS A CHEAP DATE?
Stephen: COULD IT BE WE MOVED THE STUDIO SOME PLACE CLOSE TO YOU SO WE COULD BE NEAR YOU, NEIL. I JUST FOUND OUT YOU'RE ALSO-- YOU'RE HOLDING A VAST LEAD ON ANYBODY ELSE ON THIS SHOW. YOU'VE BEEN ON NINE TIMES. NINE TIMES!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NUMBER TWO. DO YOU KNOW WHO NUMBER TWO IS.
NO.
Stephen: JOHN OLIVER.
IS THAT RIGHT?
Stephen: SIX.
OKAY, OKAY.
Stephen: BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BUT THE UNIVERSE IS VASTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? DON'T PRE-BLOW MY MIND. DON'T PRE-BLOW MY MIND BEFORE I'M READY FOR IT. WE HAVE TO LOT TO DO HERE.
THERE'S A LOT IN THE UNIVERSE TO TALK ABOUT, RELATIVE TO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, HAPPY NEW YEAR.
THANK YOU, HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU.
Stephen: NOW, DOES THE NEW YEAR HAVE ANY PARTICULAR ASTRONOMICAL SIGNIFICANCE?
NO.
Stephen: WHY NOT?
NOT, NOT --
Stephen: WE'VE GONE AROUND THE SUN ONCE.
THE PLACE WHERE WE RETURN TO, THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL OR INTERESTING ABOUT IT. IT'S A COMPLETELY ARBITRARY SPOT ON THE CALENDAR THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN TO CELEBRATE THE NEW YEAR. PLUS IT'S-- I THINK IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD THAT WE ALL CELEBRATE THAT INSTANT THAT THE BALL DROPS, AND THEN ONE HOUR LATER, THEY CELEBRATE EXACTLY THE SAME THING, AND THEN AN HOUR LATER, AN HOUR LATER-- THEY DO THAT 24 TIMES AROUND THE WORLD.
Stephen: I KNOW HOW CLOCKS WORK, NEIL.  ( LAUGHTER ).
THE WORLD IS NOT CELEBRATING THE SAME MOMENT. IT'S KIND OF-- IT'S ODD TO ME AS AN ASTROPHYSICIST. BUT THAT'S FINE. IT'S CULTURE. THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.
Stephen: COULD YOU BE MORE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON RIGHT NOW? YOU LIVE-- YOU LIVE TO SUCK THE JOY OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TRADITIONS.
NO, NO.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU LOVE? WHAT IS WORTH CELEBRATING? IF IT'S NOT NEW YEAR'S--
ALMOST EVERY OTHER HOLIDAY IN THE YEAR HAS SOME ASTRONOMICAL BASIS. THE CHINESE NEW YEAR, THE JEWISH NEW YEAR, RAMADAN, EASTER, LENT --
Stephen: TOYOTATHON. ALL OF IT!
ALL OF IT. SATURNALIA. CHRISTMAS --
Stephen: WHAT DOES SATURNALIA HAVE?
SATURNALIA, IT'S BACK IN THE WINTER IT'S SUN IS GETTING LOWER AND LOWER IN THE SKY EACH DAY AND WORRY THAT MAYBE IT WILL NEVER COME BACK.
Stephen: IS SATURN GETTING HIGHER IN THE SKY?
NO BUT SATURN IS THE GOD YOU PLAY TO AND CELEBRATE. SO SATURNALIA EVERYTHING SLIPS, THE MIDDLE EASTER SERVES THE SLAVES, THE SLAVES GIVE COMMANDS. IT'S AN INTERESTING ROMAN TRADITION THAT IS LONG GONE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
BUT I'M SAYING IT'S IN THAT TIME OF THE YEAR WHERE THE SUN IS BASICALLY REBORN, SO IT'S SOLSTICE CELEBRATIONS. AND CHRISTMAS WAS PUT THERE TO BE A GOOD PLACE TO SORT OF BRING IN ALL THE PAYING AN WORSHIPERS, WHO WERE ALREADY CELEBRATING THAT TIME OF YEAR.
Stephen: AND IT WORKED.
IT WORK, OH, YEAH.
Stephen: WE WON. SO 2018, WHAT'S GOT YOU EXCITED FOR 2018.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE WON. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE WON. WHAT'S GOT YOU EXCITED--
WAIT, JUST TO BE CLEAR.
Stephen: OKAY.
YOU NOT ONLY WON THERE. YOU WON THE CALENDAR RACE, TOO.
Stephen: HUH?
THE WORLD'S CALENDAR IS THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR AFTER POPE GREGORY PUT IN PLACE IN 1582. THE PREVIOUS JULIAN CALENDAR WAS MESSING UP IN THE YEAR.
Stephen: IT WAS OFF--
BY 10 DAYS! AND THE POPE SAID, "WE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS."
Stephen: THE POPE FIXED IT?
WELL, POPE, JESUIT SCIENTISTS, JESUIT PRIESTS WERE THE ACADEMIC ORDER OF THE CATHOLIC-- YOU'RE CATHOLIC. YOU SHOULD BE TEACHING THIS, OKAY?  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: I'M AWARE OF MY RELIGION.
OKAY! SO THERE'S A VATICAN OBSERVATORY TO THIS DAY THAT THAT AT THE TIME, BEFORE TELESCOPES WERE INVENTED, THESE JESUIT PRIESTS WERE PUT INTO THE SERVICE OF FIGURING OUT WHY THE CALENDAR WAS SHIFTING IN THE YEAR.
Stephen: AM I CORRECT IN SAYING THAT IT WAS A CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO FIRST PROPOSED THE IDEA OF THE BIG BANG?
YES, GEORGE LEMATRE, THE BIG BANG ITSELF, USING EINSTEIN'S EQUATIONS. EINSTEIN COULD HAVE DONE IT, BUT HE DID ENOUGH.
Stephen: HE WAS BUSY.
LAID DOWN THE EQUATIONS. OTHER PEOPLE CALCULATED WITH HIS EQUATIONS AND HE DEDUCED THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE MUST HAVE START WADE BANG.
Stephen: OKAY. GOING TO 2018--
SO CATHOLICS HAVE BEEN IN THERE IN MULTIPLE --
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
OKAY.
Stephen: I'M TEAM R.C. NOW--
TEAM ROMAN CATHOLIC.
Stephen: YES, OKAY.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW-- YOU'RE-- YOU'RE WALKING FOOTNOTE, NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU BROUGHT PEOPLE WITH YOU ON THAT COMMENT. SO I WAS JUST HELPING IT OUT.
Stephen: YOU WERE WITH ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY.
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU ASK IT. WHO WAS NOT WITH HIM?  ( APPLAUSE ) SEE? THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: I FEEL BETRAYED.  (  LAUGHTER  ) SO 2018, LET ME GET TO THE SECOND QUESTION OF THE INTERVIEW. IN 2018, WHAT MYSTERY ARE YOU MOST INTERESTED IN SCIENCE CRACKING? OR WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE LIKELY TO LEARN THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE CLOSE TO FIGURING OUT?
IN MY FIELD, THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS, GENERALLY WE MAKE DISCOVERIES WHEN A MISSION IS LAUNCHED. SO WE-- SO WE KNOW WHEN TO BEGIN TO EXPECT DISCOVERIES.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE BIG MISSION REACHING ITS FRUITION.
THE MISSION NOW IS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY MORE THAN WE CURRENTLY DO.
Stephen: OKAY.
WE KNOW IT'S THERE, BUT IT'S A COMPLETE MYSTERY. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN OF 85% OF ALL THE GRAVITY OF THE UNIVERSE. IT'S NOT BLACK HOLES, COMETS, STARS, PLANETS-- IT'S NONE OF THE ABOVE.
Stephen: SO THE MATH SAYS THERE SHOULD BE MORE THERE BUT WE CAN'T SEE IT?
RIGHT, IT'S MISSING GRAVITY RATHER THAN MISSING MASS-- I'M SORRY, IT'S GRAVITY WITH NO KNOWN SOURCE.
Stephen: WHICH IS WHAT I SAID. WHEN IS WHAT I SAID A MOMENT AGO.
IT'S DARK GRAVITY.
Stephen: WOW.
IS REALLY WHAT IT IS. THEN-- THEN THERE'S SOME MYSTERIOUS PRESSURE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHICH WE CALL DARK ENERGY. BEAUT BUTT WE SHOULD JUST CALL IT FRED AND WILMA-- I JOKE ABOUT THIS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. DON'T GIVE IT A NAME THAT MAKES PEOPLE THINK WE KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S A PRESSURE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE FORCING THE UNIVERSE TO ACCELERATE NONETHELESS EXPANSION. AND I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I LOSE SLEEP OVER THIS FACT--  (  LAUGHTER  ) CAN I SHARE THIS? I DON'T WANT TO BE BLAMED --
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD STOP YOU.  ( LAUGHTER ).
I DON'T WANT TO BE BLAMED IF YOU CANNOT GET TO SLEEP TONIGHT.
Stephen: DO IT. I'LL BE OKAY.
SO THIS DARK ENERGY IN THE FUTURE WILL RENDER THE UNIVERSE SO LARGE, HAVING ACCELERATED SO SIGNIFICANTLY, THAT ALL THE GALAXIES OF THE NIGHT SKY WILL HAVE ACCELERATED BEYOND OUR HORIZON.
Stephen: WHAT?
ALL THE GALAXIES ARE THE SOURCE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF COSMOLOGY, OF THE BIG BANG, EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE COMES TO US FROM THESE GALAXIES. IF THEY ACCELERATE BEYOND OUR HORIZON, THE NEXT GENERATION OF COSMIC EXPLORERS WILL ONLY HAVE THE STARS OF THE MILKY WAY TO THINK ABOUT. AND I-- SO, THERE'S AN-- THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ENTIRE CHAPTER OF THE UNIVERSE RIPPED FROM THEIR VIEW. AND THEY WILL BE TRYING TO CONTEMPLATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF WHAT ITS PAST WAS. AND SO I LOSE SLEEP WONDERING, TODAY, WAS THERE SOME PREVIOUS CHAPTER RIPPED FROM THE UNIVERSE ITSELF? AND HERE WE ARE--  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND HERE WE ARE, YOU KNOW, TOUCHING THE ELEPHANT, NOT KNOWING THAT IN FACT THERE'S AN ELEPHANT STANDING THERE. OR MAYBE THERE'S THE SHADOW OF THE ELEPHANT, AND THE ELEPHANT HAS BEEN MOVED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. AND THIS LEAVES ME WEAK AT NIGHT. I SLIEWZ SLEEP OVER THAT.
Stephen: I AM NOT GOING TO GET A WINK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S CRAZY. HOLD ON. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, EVERYBODY.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING SMALLER IN A WAY BUT IN SORT OF MENTALLY, ANOTHER THING THAT WILL KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT AND KIND OF MAKE YOUR BRAIN EXPLODE IS--
YOU KNOW, I'M SCARED WHEN YOU PULL STUFF OUT.
Stephen: LIKE THIS? YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: SO RECENTLY INTO OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, ABOVE THE-- WHAT'S IT CALLED, THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC?
SURE.
Stephen: WHERE THE PLANETS GO AROUND FROM ABOVE OR BELOW, OR WHATEVER, OFF THE AXIS OF WHERE THE PLANETS GO AROUND.
PLANETS DO THIS AROUND THE SUN.
Stephen: THIS CAME FROM DEEP SPACE.
FIRST TIME EVER AN OBJECT FROM INTERSTELLAR SPACE HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO VISIT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.
Stephen: NOW, THIS THING'S GOT TO BE LIKE A SHIP, RIGHT? THAT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE A SPACESHIP.
THIS IS NOT A PHOTOGRAPH.
Stephen: WHAT?
THIS IS AN ARTIST'S RENDERING. WE KNOW IT'S ELONGATED-- I DON'T BELIEVE--  (  LAUGHTER  ) JUST --
Stephen: YOU DON'T GET TO TAKE-- WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE RIGHT THERE? YOU HOLD IT WHATEVER--
YOU GOT PEOPLE. YOU GOT PEOPLE --
Stephen: I GOT PEOPLE. LOOK AT THAT BUT IT LOOKED LIKE THAT.
NO.
Stephen: IT WAS ELONGATED.
CIGARS DON'T COME JOURNEYING INTO SOLAR SYSTEM S.
Stephen:  WHICH IS WHY IT HAS TO BE AN ALIEN SPACESHIP.
SO, SO--  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: YEAH?
ASTEROIDS WE KNOW, MANY OF THEM, IN NOT MOST OF THEM ARE LOOSELY HELD TOGETHER RUBBLE PILES, AND IF THEY COME NEAR GRAVITATIONAL SOURCES, TIDAL FORCES CAN STRETCH THEM SO THEY BECOME A STREAM OF PART NELS RATHER THAN ONE SOLID MASS.
Stephen: THIS IS NOT SOLID?
IT IS LIKELY NOT SOLID.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT?
BUT THE SIGNAL WE GET FROM IT IS ELONGATED, BUT IT'S PROBABLY A RUBBLE PILE STRETCHED INTO THAT SHAPE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THAT BY NATURE. YOU DON'T GET THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S WHY IT'S MANMADE.
ALIEN.
Stephen: ALIEN MADE.
YOU WANT THAT TO BE ALIENS. FESS UP-- YOU WANT THAT TO BE ALIENS.
Stephen, OF COURSE, I WANT THAT TO BE ALIENS! THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS QUESTION THAT I'VE NEVER FINISHED.  ( LAUGHTER )
HERE'S THE PROBLEM-- HERE'S THE PROBLEM, THIS THING CAME IN MOVING FAST.
Stephen: YEAH.
IT HAS ESCAPE VELOCITY, HYPERBOLIC ORBIT, HYPERBOLIC TRAJECTORY, WE SAY "HYPER." IT'S GOT MORE ENERGY.
Stephen: THAN A BOLIC.
IT'S PARABOLIC, FOR EXAMPLE. SO, SO, THE REASON WHY IT'S PROBABLY NOT ALIEN ALIENS IS ITS TRAJECTORY AROUND THE SUN WAS COMPLETELY DETERMINED BY GRAVITATIONAL FORCES.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE BEE KNOW. WE CALCULATE THIS. THERE ARE LAWS OF GRAVITY, LAWS OF PHYSICS.
Stephen: LOOK, SEE THIS, SEE THAT? THAT TRAJECTORY WAS COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY GRAVITATIONAL FORCES AFTER IT REACHED ITS PEAK UP HERE AND CAME BACK DOWN, AND YET A THINKING CREATURE STARTED THE PROCESS, OKAY. IT DOESN'T MEAN-- IF THIS CAME IN AND YOU GO, "OH, GRAVITY DID THAT." BUT SOMEBODY MADE IT GO TO HERE. CHECKMATE!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PARABOLIC! PARA-BOLLIC GLIEWD #.
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT, MY FRIEND, IS CALLED A TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE.
ALL I'M SAYING IS IF IT'S ONLY MOVING BY THE FORCE OF GRAVITY, THEN IT'S NOT-- WE PRESUME IT DOESN'T HAVE, LIKE, ROCKETS AND THINGS. IF THIS WERE ALIENS.
Stephen: YEAH.
IN SOME KIND OF ADVANCED SHIP IT WOULD BE MAWFERG, DOING INTERESTING THING.
Stephen: MAYBE IT MANEUVERED ON ITS WAY IN, A PASS AROUND THE SUN, THE WAY THEY USE SATELLITES TO GO AROUND THE BACK OF A PLAN TOTE WHIP THEM AROUND OUTER SPACE.
IT'S CALLED THE SLINGSHOT EFFECT.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
SO, MAYBE THE ALIENS SHUT OFF THEIR ENGINES TO MASQUERADE AS A COSMIC OBJECT TO GET A SLINGSHOT EFFECT AROUND OUR STAR.
Stephen: MAYBE WE CAN'T PERCEIVE WHAT THEIR ENGINES ARE AND THEY HAVE A MODE--
I CAN JUST TELL YOU THEY'RE OFF.  ( LAUGHTER ) WHATEVER THEY ARE, THEY'RE OFF, BECAUSE IT'S-- BECAUSE A TENNIS BALL WOULD HAVE THAT TRAJECTORY MOVING AT THAT SPEED. THAT'S ALL.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY CHANCE?
NOT --
Stephen: THAT THAT'S A TENNIS BALL?
NO.  ( LAUGHTER ) NO, AND BY THE WAY, BIG NEWS WAS THAT THE PENTAGON, WAS TRACKING UFOs.
Stephen: RIGHT, WE SAW THE FOOTAGE. THEY RELEASED THE FOOTAGE FROM LIKE, F-18 FIGHTER PILOTS ON THEIR SCOPE, TABLET-SHAPED THING, ACCEL RATHE, STOPPING, ACCEL RATHE IN THINGS THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN.
THAT HAS A WAY BETTER CHANCE OF BEING ALIENS THAN THIS. THOSE OBJECTS WERE DOING THINGS THAT WERE NOT DPRAFITATIONAL.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING THERE?
I DON'T KNOW. HENCE THE "U" IN UFO.
Stephen: I'M WITH YOU. I'M ON BOARD.
ARE YOU GOING TO SAY-- ARE YOU GOING TO SAY-- THIS IS A UFO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, THEREFORE, IT'S INTELLIGENT ALIENS FROM OUTER SPACE. YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. YOU CAN'T BE CERTAIN OF ANYTHING.
Stephen: I'M HOPING.
I'M HOPING, TOO. I WANT TO MEET THE ALIENS. BY THE WAY, IF YOU EVER MEET THE ALIENS, THEY TAKE YOU ON BOARD, FIRST, TAKE SOME PHOTOS, FIRST. SECOND, WHEN THEY DO THE SEX EXPERIMENTS ON YOU, OKAY--  (  LAUGHTER  ).
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO--  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. WE ALL KNOW THAT.
Stephen: DON'T YOU HAVE TO CHECK A BOX TO, LIKE, OPT IN TO THAT.
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO-- TELL THE ALIEN-- SAY, "OH, LOOK OVER THERE," AND QUICKLY SNATCH SOMETHING OFF THE SHELF LEAK AN ASH TRAY OR SOMETHING AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET AND LAY BACK ON THE SLAB. THEN WHEN THEY LET GO OF YOU, YOU HAVE SOMETHING OF ALIEN MANUFACTURE.
Stephen: SO IN THIS SCENARIO, THE ALIENS SMOKE?
YES.
Stephen: IF I SEE THEM, I WILL GIVE THEM THIS, WHICH IS YOUR BOOK "NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, ASTROPHYSICS FOR PEOPLE IN A HURRY." A "NEW YORK TIMES" BESTSALER FOR 34 WEEKS.
CRAZY, CRAZY.
Stephen: EXTRAORDINARY.
I'M DELIGHTED APPETITE IS OUT THERE. MAYBE IT OPPOSE DOORS FOR MANY MORE SCIENCE BOOKS TO APPEAR THERE.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE THING?
OH! MAY I?
Stephen: IT'S YOUR BOOK, MAN. IT'S YOUR BOOK.
OH, MAY I?
Stephen: SURE.
SO REFLECTIONS ON THE COSMIC PERSPECTIVE. THE WORDS I'M ABOUT TO READ ARE NOT MINE. THEY'RE BY JAMES FERGUSON, A PHYSICIST FROM THE 1700s. IF I MAY.

YOU KNOW IT'S NO SECRET, I LOVE TALKING SPACE WITH TONIGHT'S GUEST, NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. IN FACT, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO UP IN SPACE, PARTICULARLY NOW. THAT'S WHY I WENT DOWN TO CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA, TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF NASA, TO FULFILL MY DREAM OF BECOMING AN ASTRONAUT. LUCKILY, WE BROUGHT CAMERAS TO FULFILL MY DREAM OF PROVIDING CONTENT FOR THIS SHOW. PLEASE ENJOY TONIGHT'S "LATE SHOW" CLASSIC." JIM.
RECENTLY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NASA INVITED ME TO THE COAST GUARD SPACE CENTER, WHERE AMERICAN HEROES CONTINUE TO SHOOT FOR THE STARS. ONE OF THOSE HERES SO COMMANDER CHRIS FERGUSON.
AND LIFTOFF.
Stephen: WHO PILOT THE THE FINAL MISSION OF NASA'S ICONIC SHUTTLE PROGRAM.
AMERICA WILL CONTINUE THE DREAM.
Stephen: TODAY, CHRIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF CREW AND MISSION OPERATIONS FOR BOEING, SO I ASKED TO MEET HIM TO SEE IF I HAD THE RIGHT STUFF. TO MAKE IT TO SPACE.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
THIS IS THE CENTAUR SECOND STAGE--
Stephen:  WE STARTED WITH A TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE STARLINER SYSTEM. HOW WILL THE STARLINER WORK?
UH...  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT'S A ROCKET.
Stephen: IT'S A ROCKET, OKAY. HOLD ON, LET ME GET THAT DOWN. LAUGH ROCKET.
SO THE STARLINER, IT'S-- WE'RE GOING TO RIDE ON AN ATLAS 5 BOOSTER.
Stephen: WHICH ONE OF THESE-- WHICH ONE OF THESE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
THEY'RE ACTUALLY BOTH MODELS OF THEAT LAS 5. ONE IS SHORTER THAN THE OTHER.
Stephen: THERE'S A SHORT ONE AND A LONG ONE?
IT'S ACTUALLY ONE MODEL.
Stephen: THAT'S TWO MODELS OVER THERE.
THAT'S TWO MODELS BUT THEY'RE JUST TWO DIFFERENT SIZES OF THE SAME ROCKET.
Stephen: OKAY, SO IT COMES IN TWO SIZES.
IT DOES NOT COME IN TWO SIZES.
Stephen: WHY ARE THERE TWO MODELS?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST PHALLIC ROCKET EVER SENT INTO SPACE. IS THAT CORRECT.
I'M NOT SURE.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WE CAN SHOW THAT ON CAMERA. THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW. THANK YOU. WHAT SHAPE ROCKET WILL FEMALE ASTRONAUTS GO UP IN, A GEORGIA O'KEEFE PAINTING?
THE SAME ROCKETS THE MALE ASTRONAUTS GO IN. AND THE STRAP-ON BOOSTERS.
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS ALWAYS TWO TWO STRAP-ONS?
FOR THIS PARTICULAR MISSION WE DO, YES.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT YOU CAN PUT UP TO FIVE.
Stephen: YOU CAN USE FIVE STRAP-ONS AT ONCE?
YES.
Stephen: WOW, YOU REALLY ARE BACK, IS WHAT I'M SAYING. WITH THE TECHNICALITIES BEHIND US, IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO TRY ON BOEING'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED NEW SPACE SUIT. UNLIKE THE BULKY SUITS OF YESTERYEAR, PRAISED FOR ITS LIGHT WEIGHT, FLEXIBLE DESIGN, IT IS THE NEXT GENERATION OF SPACE SUIT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?  (  LAUGHTER  ).
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT SUIT.
WHY NOT? LOOK HOW PRACTICAL IT IS. YOU  ( APPLAUSE ) TURNS OUT I HAD THE WRONG SUIT. THIS WAS THE SUIT. THIS FEELS RIGHT.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

RIGHT.
Stephen: I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE-- AND I WANT TO PUT THIS DELICATELY-- THAT WHEN YOU ATTACH THE TUBE IT GIVES YOU AN ENORMOUS ASS. IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT? THIS IS SWEET. LOOK AT THAT. I LOOK LIKE SPACE MICKEY MOUSE. IS IT JUST TO MAKE IT AS UNFLATTERING AS POSSIBLE?
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE YOU LOOK BAD, IT'S JUST WHEN YOU SIT DOWN, YOUR BUTT TAKES A LOT MORE MATERIAL, SO WHEN YOU STAND UP, IT'S UNFLATTERING.
Stephen: YOU THINK I'M FAT, JUST SAY SO.
YOU LOOK FINE.
Stephen: JUST SAY YOU'RE A LITTLE HEAVY AND COULD USE A FEW POUNDS.
YOU COULD LOSE A COUPLE OF POUNDS.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT. NEXT IT WAS ON TO THE STARLINER CAPSULE ITSELF WHERE I WOULD BE STRAPPED DOWN FOR AN INTENSIVE INTERVIEW.
CHA TYPE OF TECHNICAL DEGREE DO YOU HAVE THAT MAY HELP ON MISSIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.
Stephen: I HAVE A THEATER DEGREE. I CAN ACT LIKE I HAVE TECHNICAL SKILLS. WATCH THIS. LET'S GET THE DU-1 ON THE DONOR. I'M SIP-TID, WE ARE BURNING DAYLIGHT. WE ARE DETOXING. WE'RE STIRRING THE OXYGEN. I JUST BROKE A SWITCH. I'M SO SORRY. WHAT IS THE RCS-1. I JUST SNAPPED THAT PUPPY OFF.
WE NEED RCS-1 TO GET HOME.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT?
REACTION CONTROL JET NUMBER ONE.
Stephen: HOW AM I DOING? HOW AM I SCORING SO FAR?
I'M AFRAID BREAKING THAT SWITCH IS NOT GOING TO REFLECT WELL UPON YOU.
Stephen: I'M A LOT STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT. DO YOU GUYS ACTUALLY SAY, "LIGHT THIS CANDLE?"
WE NEVER SAY, "LIGHT THIS CANDLE."
Stephen: IF I SAID, LET'S LIGHT THIS CANDLE," NO ONE WOULD KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
I WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN BUT THE COOLER ASTRONAUTS DON'T SAY THAT.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE COOL THING TO SAY?
WE'RE READY TO FLY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S COOL.
YOU READY TO FLY? GLERKS.
Stephen:  OH, LET'S LIGHT THIS CANDLE.
YOU'RE NOT DOING EXCEEDINGLY WELL HERE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
FLYING WITH A CREW AND LIVING ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WITH OTHER ASTRONAUTS REQUIRES SOMEONE TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE AND GET ALONG WITH OTHERS.
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA.
Stephen: I'M FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF MY NEEDS. IS THAT IMPORTANT?
YES.
Stephen: ANOTHER GOOD. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS. I MADE A SMALL LIST OF THINGS THEY NEED WHILE I'M IN ORBIT. I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT A LAFANDER-SCENTED CANDLE. AND I ALSO HAVE A SERVICE ANIMAL FOR ANXIETY.
SERIOUSLY?
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S A POSSUM. I BOUGHT IT A LITTLE VEST. AND LEGALLY YOU HAVE TO LET ME TAKE IT BECAUSE IT'S A SERVICE POSSUM.
I'M NOT SURE IF A POSSUM IS IN THE MIX, STEPHEN.
Stephen: AGAIN, IT'S NOT A POSSUM. IT'S A SERVICE POSSUM.
I CAN JUST PUT "NO" HERE.
Stephen: HOW AM I DOING? DIPASS? OH! ♪ AIN'T SNOW STOPPING US NOW WE'RE GOING IT SPACE ♪ I HAD TAKEN EVERY TEST WITH FLYING COLORS AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR MY CRUCIAL ROLE WOULD BE IN AMERICA'S RETURN TO SPACE.
WE'RE GOING TO PROCLAIM YOU THE FIRST HONORARY STARLINER ASTRONAUT COMMANDER IN CHARGE OF STICKER PLACEMENT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. LET'S LIGHT THIS CANDLE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A LOOK AT THE YEAR SO FAR. DON'T GO AWAY.  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELL, WE MADE IT-- THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK. DADDY'S GOING TO GET PAID. NOW LET'S TAKE A FOND LOOK BACK AT WHAT THEY'RE PAYING ME FOR. THIS IS THE BEST OF THIS WEEK'S "THE LATE SHOW."
Stephen: TIMES SQUARE HAD THE SECOND COLDEST NEW YEAR'S EVE CELEBRATION ON RECORD. IT'S TRUE. THE BALL DID NOT DROP SO MUCH AS CIVILLE UP AND RISE BACK INTO 2017. COME ON DOWN! COME ON DOWN! "SINCE TAKING OFFICE I HAVE BEEN VERY STRICT ON COMMERCIAL AVIATION. GOOD NEWS-- IT WAS JUST REPORTED THAT THERE WERE ZERO DEATHS IN 2017, THE BEST AND SAFEST YEAR ON RECORD." TRUMP TOOK CREDIT FOR NO ONE DYING IN A PLANE CRASH THIS YEAR.  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT EXPLAINS HIS NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, "TRUMP 2020:  YOU GOT TO TULSA, DIDN'T YOU?"
YOU KNOW, LIKE, HE DOES THINGS AND I RECOGNIZE THE THINGS WHILE HE'S DOING IT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? RECOGNIZE WHAT?
RECENTLY HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING LIKE-- I GOT A BIGGER-- I GOT A BIGGER"--
Stephen: BUTTON.
YEAH, NUCLEAR BUTTON. LIKE THAT'S STUFF YOU DO IN NEIGHBORHOOD. LIKE, IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY GOT A PROBLEM YOU, YOU GO, "YOU WANT A PROBLEM? NO PROBLEM." AND HE'S DOING-- THAT'S LIKE HE'S BLUFFING. LIKE YOU BLUFF. THAT'S HOW YOU BLUFF. BUT YOU DON'T BLUFF WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD.  ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT THE (BLEEP)? YOU DON'T DO THAT  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IN AN EFFORT TO SHOW THEY'RE NOT ANTI-MUZZ HUM, THE ADMINISTRATION ADDED THROUGH 3 NEW COUNTRIES TO TRAVEL BAN 3.0. THEY ADDED NORTH KOREA, WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE COMING, BUT NOW THEY REALLY CAN'T COME. AND THEN THEY ADDED CHAD WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SOME GUY.  (  LAUGHTER  ) YEAH, I-- I HEARD IT, I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DID CHAD DO!"
WE ARE HERE NOW IN DENVER, COLORADO. GOOD EVENING TO YOU GUYS, ANDERSON AND ANDY. WE HAVE THE PARTY STARTED HERE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PURPLE HAZE.
OH, MY GOD, RANDY'S DOSE IS KICKING IN.
THIS IS FOR ANDY. ANDY, THIS IS FOR YOU.
Stephen: "ANDY! ANDY! THIS IS FOR YOU. COME ON, IT WILL GET YOU SO HIGH YOU'LL THINK YOU CAN PASS A JOINT THROUGH A TV CAMERA."
Stephen: IN A FLYING WITH LEGLESS OR ARAGONE.
ARE THOSE DRAGONS.
Stephen: OKAY! OKAY! YES. THEY ARE. YOU'RE A GUEST, SO I'M GOING TO SAY YES, THEY ARE. HAVE YOU SEEN "LORD OF THE RINGS?"
I'VE SEEN "GAME OF THRONES."
Stephen: OKAY. BANNON UNLOADED ON DON JR. FOR HIS INFAMOUS TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH RUSSIANS SAYING: SO HE THINKS MANAFORT, DON JR., AND KUSHNER DID SOMETHING TREASONOUS, UNPATRIOTIC AND BAD (BLEEP). COINCIDENTALLY, THOSE ARE ALSO THEIR SECRET SERVICE CODE NAMES.  ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP FIRED BACK HARD. : NOW ALL HE HAS TO DO IS LOSE HIS DOG, AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN AWESOME COUNTRY SONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT BEFORE. MY ENTIRE LIFE I HAVEN'T GOT IN ANY FIGHTS. I'M UNDEFEATED.  ( LAUGHTER ) I CAME VERY CLOSE TO GETTING IN A FIGHT RECENTLY. I WAS AT A BAR. IT WAS VERY BUSY. AND THIS GUY WALKED RIGHT INTO ME, STEPPED ON MY SNEAKERS. SO, NATURALLY, MY REFLEXES KICKED IN. I APOLOGIZED.  ( LAUGHTER ) I SAID, "SORRY." HE MUST NOT HAVE HEARD WHAT I SAID, BECAUSE NEXT THING HE DID, HE PUSHED ME, RIMS OFF THE SHIRT HE HAD ON, AND HE GOES, "WHAT? YOU THINK YOU'RE HARD?" I WAS LIKE, "NOW I AM."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: I'M HOPING TO BE NOMINATED IN ALL CATEGORIES, INCLUDING:  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ LATE SHOW. " JOIN ME NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE JOINED BY LIAM NEESON, JAMES AND A PERFORMANCE FROM ANDREW DAY AND COMMON. GOOD NIGHT.   Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
