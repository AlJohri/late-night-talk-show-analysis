ON FRIDAY NIGHT, VICE PRESIDENT ELECT MIKE PENCE WENT TO SEE THE MUSICAL "HAMILTON." THE NEXT DAY HE SAW "THE LION KING." ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE HAD A GUEST IN THE AUDIENCE THIS EVENING. VICE PRESIDENT ELECT MIKE PENCE. SIR,, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU. WE WELCOME YOU AT THE LION KING. AS SCAR, I WANT TO SAY YOU BEING BOOED ADD "HAMILTON" DOES NOT REPRESENT ALL OF BROADWAY. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOMED HERE AT THE LION KING BECAUSE I BELIEVE, TOGETHER, WE CAN KILL SIMBA! HEAR ME OUT! YOU WILL NOW HAVE ACCESS TO AN ARMY AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WE CAN KILL THE SON OF MY BROTHER MUFASA. YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING, WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU? SCAR IS SELFISH AND GREEDY AND HAS A HUGE EGO AND HANGS AROUND WITH HIDEOUS  HENCHMEN, AND WHAT'S THAT WEIRD THING ON HIS HEAD? SO, YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG GREAT!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MICHAEL WEATHERLY, CARRIE FISHER AND MUSICAL GUESTS THE PRETENDERS. JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." NOW LIVE FROM ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY! SIT DOWN! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, MY GOODNESS. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I AM HAPPY TO BE YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ DID EVERYBODY HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HAD A NICE ONE, TOO. I'M PRE-THANKSGIVING CARBOLOADING. JUST TO WORK EVERYTHING OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) I TOOK THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OFF. NICE, DIDN'T DO MUCH, HUNG OUT WITH FRIENDS, MADE A PIE.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF PIE.
Stephen: BUT, YOU KNOW, HAD TO WORK ALL WEEKEND.
Jon: UH-HUH.
Stephen: DONALD TRUMP -- POOR GUY CAN'T CATCH BREAK. HE DIDN'T KNOW BEING PRESIDENT WAS A FULL-TIME JOB. ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST, HE AGREED TO A $25 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN THE TRUMP UNIVERSITY FRAUD CASE. SETTLEMENT, OKAY? ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) SETTLEMENT. SO HE DIDN'T TECHNICALLY LOSE, HE SETTLED. JUST LIKE HOW HE DIDN'T TECHNICALLY WIN THE POPULAR VOTE, AMERICA SETTLED. ( APPLAUSE ) SEE, TRUMP WAS SUED FOR FRAUD BY STUDENTS AT HIS FOR-PROFIT SCHOOL, TRUMP UNIVERSITY. THE FIGHTIN' PAYDAY LOANS! I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MASCOT IS. I DON'T KNOW WHO THEIR MASCOT IS. THE FIGHTIN' GRABBERS! ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: HEY, HEY! MY MAN! HEY!
Stephen: I DIDN'T SAY WHAT HE WAS GRABIN', MAN! ( LAUGHTER ) ONE OF THE MANY ALLEGATIONS IN THIS SUIT WAS THAT TRUMP ADVERTISED HE WOULD PERSONALLY HAND-PICK INSTRUCTORS AND THEN UNDER OATH ADMITTED HE DID NOT PICK SEMINAR LEADERS. BUT GIVEN HIS CABINET PICKS, MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING. EVEN THOUGH HE CLEARLY SAID HE NEVER SETTLES, TRUMP DOESN'T SEE THIS AS A LOSS. ON SATURDAY MORNING HE TWEETED, "I SETTLED THE TRUMP UNIVERSITY LAWSUIT FOR A SMALL FRACTION OF THE POTENTIAL AWARD BECAUSE AS PRESIDENT I HAVE TO FOCUS ON OUR COUNTRY." YES, A SMALL FRACTION. TRUMP PAID $25 MILLION OF $40 MILLION THEY WERE SEEKING. AND $25 MILLION IS A SMALL FRACTION OF $40 MILLION, IF YOU LEARNED MATH AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Jon: YEAH, I GOT YA!
Stephen: WITH THE LAWSUIT SETTLED, THE STUDENTS OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY HAVE FINALLY FINISHED THEIR EDUCATIONS. SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT, TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE FINAL GRADUATING CLASS AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. ( ORGAN MUSIC ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GRADUATES OF TRUMP U, AS YOU LEAVE THESE HALLOWED HOTEL BALLROOMS TO START YOUR LIVES AND THEN RESTART YOUR EDUCATIONS AT AN ACTUAL SCHOOL, YOU WILL BE ENTERING A TROUBLED WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE: DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT,  BUT YOU ARE UNIQUELY POISED TO TAKE ON THAT CHALLENGE BECAUSE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER,  AND YOU'VE BEEN CONNED BY A MASTER. THE CONNECTIONS YOU'VE MADE HERE WILL LAST A LIFETIME. LOOK TO YOUR LEFT, AND LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU'LL BE SPLITTING THE SETTLEMENT MONEY WITH. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TAKE THE LESSONS OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY WITH YOU. THE FUTURE IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. ALSO, NEVER TAKE BUSINESS ADVICE FROM A MAN WHO CAN'T SELL VODKA OR STEAKS. YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYONE LOVES? BOOZE AND MEAT. SO, GO OUT THERE AND BE SHINING EXAMPLES OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY'S TIMELESS MOTTO: "CARPE CROTCH'EM." THAT'S MY TIME! EVERYBODY TAKE A DIPLOMA FROM THE BIN BY THE DOOR! PLEASE TIP YOUR WAITRESS. THANK YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO I HAVE TO GET THAT? I'M NOT SURE IF I WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE THAT AWAY. DO I HAVE TO GIVE THAT BACK? OKAY. THAT'S YOURS. NO, YOU CAN KEEP IT. THERE YOU GO. CONGRATULATIONS. PUT IT ON! PUT IT ON! PUT IT ON! PUT IT ON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ HOW PROUD HIS MOTHER MUST BE. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, AND I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP MAY BE COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU BECAUSE HE'S PLANNING A PRE-INAUGURATION "VICTORY TOUR." YES, TRUMP IS TAKING HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. IT'LL BE LIKE A ROLLING STONES REUNION TOUR, ONLY WITH MORE OLD WHITE PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH, THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED.
WE'RE WORKING ON A VICTORY TOUR NOW THAT WILL HAPPEN-- UH, WHEN, KELLYANNE? IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.
IT'S CALLED A "THANK YOU TOUR". IT'S NOT A VICTORY TOUR. IT'S A "THANK YOU TOUR."
A THANK YOU TOUR.
"THANK AMERICA TOUR."
STEPHEN: YES, IT'S A THANK YOU TOUR. IT'S A THANK YOU TOUR -- JUST LIKE THE ROMAN GENERALS USED TO DRAG THE CONQUERED PEOPLE BEHIND THEM IN THEIR "THANK YOU" PARADES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THEM FIGHT IN THE "YOU'RE WELCOME PIT." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT'S GOING TO FUN. PACE YOURSELF. IT'S FOUR YEARS. BUT THIS ISN'T A WORLD TOUR OR EVEN A NATIONAL TOUR BECAUSE TRUMP'S THANK YOU RALLIES WILL BE HELD ONLY IN THE STATES THAT TRUMP WON. NOW, TRUMP WON 30 STATES, SO I ASSUME HE'LL ALSO BE STANDING IN FRONT OF OUR NEW FLAG. OLD PARTIAL GLORY. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SAID ON ELECTION NIGHT.
I PLEDGE TO EVERY CITIZEN OF OUR LAND THAT I WILL BE PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS.
STEPHEN: YES, TRUMP IS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT FOR "ALL" AMERICANS. FROM THE SHORES OF WYOMING TO THE KENTUCKY BAY. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE MAP I JUST DESCRIBED. OF COURSE, THE STORY THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT IS VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT MIKE PENCE'S WENT TO SEE "HAMILTON." IT'S SURPRISING SINCE IT'S BROADWAY, AND PENCE BELIEVES THAT BEING ON BROADWAY IS A CHOICE THAT CAN BE CURED. ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S PRAY AWAY THE BROADWAY. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED. ( LAUGHTER ) PENCE GOT BOOED WHEN HE TOOK HIS SEAT AND THE CAST HAD A MESSAGE FOR PENCE DURING THE CURTAIN CALL:
WE, SIR, WE ARE THE DIVERSE AMERICA WHO ARE ALARMED AND ANXIOUS THAT YOUR NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT PROTECT US, OUR PLANET, OUR CHILDREN, OUR PARENTS, OR DEFEND US AND UPHOLD OUR INALIENABLE RIGHTS, SIR. BUT WE TRULY HOPE THIS SHOW HAS INSPIRED YOU TO UPHOLD OUR AMERICAN VALUES, AND TO WORK ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US.
STEPHEN: POWERFUL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SUPER POWERFUL. AND I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT PENCE REALLY ABSORBED THE MESSAGE OF HAMILTON, AND HAS PLEDGED TO HELP BRING THE COUNTRY BACK TO THE 18TH CENTURY. GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK. NOW, PENCE STAYED AND LISTENED AND AFTERWARDS SAID HE WASN'T OFFENDED. BUT DONALD TRUMP WAS, TWEETING "THE THEATER MUST ALWAYS BE A SAFE AND SPECIAL PLACE. THE CAST OF HAMILTON WAS VERY RUDE LAST NIGHT TO A VERY GOOD MAN, MIKE PENCE. APOLOGIZE!" FIRST OF ALL, MR. TRUMP, THE ONLY PRESIDENT WHO GETS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE THEATER IS LINCOLN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SECOND, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THE IDEA THAT THE THEATER IS SAFE. I'VE SEEN CATS-- YOU THINK YOU'RE SAFE, BUT THEN ALL THE CAT-PEOPLE START COMING OFF THE STAGE AND TRY TO SIT ON YOUR LAP! AND CRAWL UP THE WALLS! PRESIDENT TRUMP-- BUILD THE FOURTH WALL! ( APPLAUSE ) AND MAKE ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER PAY FOR IT! AFTER THAT, HE TWEETED, "THE CAST AND PRODUCERS OF HAMILTON, WHICH I HEAR IS HIGHLY OVERRATED..." OKAY, STOP. NOW YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. YOU CAN PULL OUT OF NATO, YOU CAN ROUND UP IMMIGRANTS, BUT HAMILTON OVERRATED? NO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO! YOU CAN'T SAY THAT! YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S OVERRATED! IT'S HAD A HUGE CULTURAL IMPACT. IT'S FINALLY GIVEN OLD WHITE PEOPLE A WAY TO ENJOY RAP! ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS RALLIED AROUND HIS TWEETS, CALLING FOR A 'HAMILTON' BOYCOTT TO DEFEND MIKE PENCE. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) OKAY, LET ME POINT OUT THAT YOU CAN'T BOYCOTT SOMETHING YOU CAN'T GET. YOU CAN'T GET INTO "HAMILTON," OKAY? THAT WOULD BE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON BOYCOTTING THE INAUGURAL. SHE DOESN'T NEED TO. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS WHOLE DRAMA WAS INSANE-- DONALD TRUMP JUMPING IN TO DEFEND HIS INNOCENT VICE PRESIDENT FROM THEATER BULLIES. THIS WILL GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. THIS IS HISTORY NOW.
Jon: IT'S HISTORIC. IT'S ABSOLUTELY HISTORIC.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WILL LEARN ABOUT IT IN THE FORM OF A HIP-HOP MUSICAL. THAT WE ARE PREMIERING RIGHT NOW: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ HOW DOES AN ORANGE, BULLY, SON OF A BITCH AND A CON MAN GRABBING (BLEEP) WITH GARY BUSEY, NO TAXES EVIDENT, GROW UP TO BE A HERO AND THE PRESIDENT? WELL, THE STORY OF MY REIGN STARTS ON THE GREAT WHITE WAY WITH A GREAT WHITE-HAIRED VEEP WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE GAY. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE THEATER WAS A SAFE AND SPECIAL PLACE, BUT WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT'S IN RESIDENCE SOME THUGS GET IN HIS FACE, CAMERAS BLAZING, COME RIGHT AT HIM IN THEIR SCARY TIGHTS. BLAST HIM-- BANG! -- WITH A REQUEST TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS STABBING HIM WITH RUDENESS, THE CAST CASTING ASPERSIONS-- BEFORE PENCE CAN HIT 'EM BACK WITH SOME GAY CONVERSIONS. HE GOT A LECTURE, GOT HECTORED IN HIS TINY LITTLE SEAT. I WON'T LET MY VEEP GO DOWN LIKE THAT. MEN, TO THE TWEETS! DROP THE TOILET SEAT, DROP THE BEAT, THUMBS SO FAST, DISAPPEARING LIKE MY BALANCE SHEETS. GONNA MAKE THE THEATER SAFE AGAIN AND END THE LIES. WATCH THIS, I'M GONNA TWEET: "APOLOGIZE." AND... DONE. BACK TO MAKING AMERICA GREAT. HANNITY, TRUCKASAURUS-- WHICH OF YOU WANTS SECRETARY OF STATE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MY GOODNESS, I NEED TO WET MY WHISTLE RIGHT THERE. I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO BRING IT SO HARD. ( LAUGHTER ) LET ME JUST CHECK. I THINK I STILL HAVE SOME OF THE MAKEUP PLAYING SCAR. HOLD ON A SECOND AND I'M ALL GOOD.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: WANT TO TAKE A BREAK FROM TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP FOR A MINUTE? A LITTLE PALLET CLEANSER? LET'S DO IT. YOU GUYS PLAY THE GOOGLE GAME QUICK! DRAW!"? IT SAYS, TRY TO DRAW A BENCH AND IT GUESSES THINGS, I SEE A SANDWICH, I SEE A BOOK. BUT IF YOU GET CLOSE YOU HAVE TO TO DRAWING THE BENCH IT GOES, I KNOW, A BENCH, AND YOU GET A POINT, AND WE'RE EVENTUALLY TEACHING THE COMPUTER HOW TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, I THINK. I'M NOT SURE. WE'RE DEFINITELY TEACHING IT SOMETHING. I'M NOT SURE WHAT. OR TAKE OVER ART SCHOOL. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT OVER. IT'S SUPER FUN, CHECK IT OUT. I'M NOT PAID FOR THIS PLUG. BUT THE REASON I BLOW IT UP IS A LOCAL SEATTLE MORNING SHOW WAS DEMONSTRATING THE GAME FRIDAY AND TWO OF THE ANCHORS WERE THERE AND THEY GOT THE SUGGESTION OF CANNON AND IT WENT A LITTLE AWRY.
A CANNON, A CANNON! I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW!
OH WHAT DO YOU DO, WHAT DO YOU DO?! THERE'S NO ERASING IS THE THING!
Stephen: OKAY, IF THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A CANNON. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY DID SOMEONE DRAW ALL THOSE CANNONS ON THE BATHROOM STALL IN MY HIGH SCHOOL? LOOK, IT'S A PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE DOODLEOOPS. NOBODY SHOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT. SO I WANT TO HELP. I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DRAWING THINGS ON THE AIR. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO DRAW A CANNON AND GET IN TROUBLE. IT'S REASONABLE CBS WON'T BLUR ANY OF THIS? I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. OKAY, LET'S SAY THE COMPUTER GIVES YOU THE SUGGESTION "CANNON." I'M GOING TO WRITE "CANNON" DOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM SO WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT I'M DRAWING AND NOTHING ELSE. HERE'S ONE WHEEL. HERE'S ANOTHER WHEEL. WE'LL GIVE IT SOME SPOKES JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN YOU GOT THE BARREL. YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE BARREL OF THE CANNON. LIKE THAT. SO FAR WE'VE STILL GOT A CANNON. AND OBVIOUSLY -- AND WE'VE GOT TO PUT THE CANNONBALL RIGHT THERE. THE CANNONBALL IS COMING OUT IN THAT DIRECTION. JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE. OKAY. THEN YOU WILL NEED A FUSE AT THE BOTTOM. ALL RIGHT? THERE IT IS, THAT'S HOW YOU DRAW A CANNON. ( APPLAUSE ) DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA IF CBS WILL LET ME DRAW A CANNON? THERE'S A SLIGHT CHANCE THEY WON'T LET ME DRAW THE CANNON, I'M BEING TOLD. WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT, THEN TUNE IN NEXT TIME AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DRAW A PENIS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MICHAEL WEATHERLY! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS 13 SEASONS ON NCIS. HE NOW STARS AS DR. JASON BULL ON CBS'S NEW "BULL." WELCOME BACK, MICHAEL WEATHERLY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ YOU SIT DOWN FIRST. YOU'RE THE GUEST. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR RUBBING YOUR ASS ON MY DESK. SO FEW OF MY GUESTS --
THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM AND CRISSY HEINZ IS CAUSING A RUCKUS AND CARRIE FISHER IS RUNNING AROUND LIKE A NUT JOB.
Stephen: CARRIE FISHER IS HERE WITH HER DOG.
IT IS SO CRAZY THERE BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: CHESTERFIELD KING GIRLS AND THEIR CIGARETTE BOXES AND EVERYTHING.
EVERYONE'S TRYING ON YOUR TRIANGLE TRUMP HAD. IT'S GONE CRAZY BACK THERE.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, BULL. 15 MILLION PEOPLE, HUH? THEM'S IS RATINGS.
I PROBABLY COULD HAVE BETTER THINK B AT IT. DENOSEO FOR 13 YEARS PEOPLE YELLED THE DENOSEO! WHICH IS FINE, BUT WHEN PEOPLE IN TRAFFIC RANDOMLY GO, "BULL"! ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE IT WOULD FEEL LIKE AN ACCUSATION, MY NAME.
Stephen: WELL, THERE'S PASSION BEHIND IT.
YEAH, "BULL"! YEAH, THAT'S ME, THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE SHOW ITSELF, THE PREMISE IS YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO HELPS YOUR PSYCHOLOGIST PUT TOGETHER JURIYS, RIGHT?
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE SHOW?
Stephen: WE'LL TAKE IT AWAY FOR ME IN A MOMENT. YOU HELP TO PUT TOGETHER JURIES FOR LAWYERS?
YES.
Stephen: IN THE SERVICE OF JUSTICE OR --
WE LIVE IN INTERESTING TIMES. CERTAIN MORAL AMBIGUITIES ARE FASCINATING. SO ON THE SHOW "BULL"! ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT WE DO IS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT, WHEN YOU'RE DOING A -- SELECTING A JURY, WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY DOES A PERSON HAVE A CERTAIN SET OF BELIEFS THAT ANOTHER PERSON, SAY, HAS A COUNTER, CONTRARY SET OF BELIEFS AND, BOY, HOW DO WE GET THOSE TWO PEOPLE TO HAVE THE SAME PERSON THAT THEY VOTE FOR?
Stephen: DR. PHIL STARTED HIS CAREER DOING THIS.
HE HAD A COMPANY CALLED C.S.I. BEFORE THERE WAS A SHOW C.S.I. AND HE LOOKED INTO COURT SCIENCES, AND THAT'S REALLY A REMARKABLE THING. LIKE THE O.J. TRIAL HAPPENED ABOUT 20-SOMETHING YEARS AGO, BUT THEN THEY DID THE DOCUMENTARY LAST SUMMER AND IT WAS FASCINATING. YOU LOOK HOW THE JURY WAS SELECTED AND RATHER THAN SANTA MONICA THEY WERE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND HOW THAT AFFECTED THE OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL.
Stephen: SO IS YOUR CHARACTER'S GOAL TO HAVE JUST AS EFFECTIVE JUSTICE AS WAS IN EVIDENCE IN THE O.J. TRIAL? ( LAUGHTER ) IN OTHER WORDS, DOES IT MATTER TO YOUR CHARACTER -- DOES IT MATTER TO THE SHOW WHETHER THE PERSON IS INNOCENT OR NOT OR JUST IF YOU WIN?
YES, OF COURSE. WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES AND WHO NEED THAT EXTRA LEG UP WHEN THE LAW GETS TRICKY.
Stephen: AND YOUR CHARACTER DOES IT FOR FREE?
SOMETIMES.
Stephen: WELL, OBVIOUSLY, HE DOESN'T NEED THE MONEY, HE'S GOT A TV SHOW.
YEAH!
Stephen: HE'S DR. PHIL. HE'S DR. PHIL! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DOES THE FINAL EPISODE END UP WITH YOU BEING BALD AN ON AN EPISODE? THE SUPERHERO THAT IS DR. PHIL. MM-HMM. BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE OPRAH AND -- ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'VE JUST BLOWN MY MIND!
Stephen: YEAH. WE'VE GOT A CLIP HERE. THIS IS A CLIP OF YOU DOING WHAT BULL DOES, MAN. JIM?
WE MOVE TO STRIKE THIS JUROR. DON'T SMILE. YOU CAN'T SMILE. YOU DIDN'T JUST WIN THE LOTTERY, YOU STRUCK A JUROR. YOU GIVE ANYTHING AWAY, THE PROSECUTION ARE CATCH ON. SO JUST SHOW ME. BUT DON'T LOOK NERVOUS. SHOW ME YOUR NEUTRAL FACE. THAT'S MORE SAD CLOWN. WE'LL WORK ON THIS. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
OH, BOY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP THE PEOPLE.
Stephen: TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE. WELL, YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD SHOW BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST SCREENS PER CAST MEMBER OF ANY SHOW. WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SCREENS? WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SCREENS IN AREHEAD SCREENS CHEAPER THAN SHEETROCK NOW? ( LAUGHTER )
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, SOMEBODY MUST HAVE DONE SOME FOCUS TESTING AT SOME POINT AND THEY DEDUCED SCREENS PEOPLE LIKE, RIGHT?
Stephen: EXCELLENT. I HEARD IF YOU PUT MAPS ON A SCREEN, PEOPLE REALLY LIKE IT. LOOK AT THAT! SEE? THEY LIKE IT.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A MAP. IT'S NOT?
Stephen: THAT'S A PHOTOGRAPH. THAT'S A PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRAL PARK.
OH, GOSH! I'M SORRY.
Stephen: REMIND ME NEVER TO GO CAMPING WITH YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE OF YOUR CAST MEMBERS, CHRISTOPHER JACKSON, WAS THE ORIGINAL GEORGE WASHINGTON IN "HAMILTON."
OH, YES ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM AT ALL ABOUT HIS REACTION TO THIS MIKE PENCE "HAMILTON" THING?
YEAH, I TALKED TO CHRIS LAST NIGHT AND WE WORKED EARLY THIS MORNING. IT WAS ABOUT 28 DEGREES WITH THE WIND CHILL FACTOR. SO WE HAD A VERY COLD CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. SO I WAS TOTALLY WEIRD, THE MIKE PENCE THING? HE'S LIKE, YEAH, ITS A LITTLE WEIRD BUT IT'S FREEDOM AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT YOU THINK AND THE THEATER IS A SAFE PLACE BUT IT'S ALSO THE SAFE PLACE TO SAY WHAT YOU THINK, CAN QUESTION GO GET IN THE CAR NOW AND GET WARM?

WELL, I WOULD PROBABLY GET EARLY ONSET ALZHEIMER'S AND FORGET AND THEN YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW.
Stephen: OKAY. NO, I FOUND THE DIARIES AND DECIDED TO PUBLISH THEM AND IT WAS A MISTAKE.
Stephen: IT WAS A MISTAKE, REALLY?
NO, BUT IT IS TOO BIG OF A STORY THAT I CAN'T HANDLE.
Stephen: EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOUR STORY.
IT'S MY STORY.
Stephen: CAN YOU NOT HANDLE IT OR CAN HARRISON FORD NOT HANDLE IT?
I'M SURE HE CAN'T HANDLE IT AT ALL. ( LAUGHTER )

THEY DID. THEY ALWAYS DO. THEY WANT TO HIRE PART OF ME, NOT ALL OF ME. SO THEY WANT TO HIRE ABOUT THREE-FOURTHS.
Stephen: UH-HUH. O I HAVE TO GET RID OF THE FOURTH SOMEHOW.
Stephen: FOR THE FIRST MOVIE OR THE BLONDE --
I MADE A JOKE, THE FOURTH CAN'T BE WITH ME. I MADE IT JUST FOR YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: LET ME SAY ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF PRINCESS LEIA. SHE HAS THE FORCE, WHY DOESN'T SHE GET A LIGHT CABER?
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE WHOLE WOMEN -- IT'S A BAD THING FOR WOMEN. EVEN IN SPACE, WOMEN ARE -- YOU KNOW, THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD WITH THE FORCE, EVEN WITH THE FORCE.
