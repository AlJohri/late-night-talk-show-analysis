I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE HER OR DONALD TRUMP.
I WISH THEY COULD JUST GET ALONG.
DONALD TRUMP. HILLARY CLINTON IS A LIAR. A BIG LIAR.
THE INSIDE OF MY EYE PATCH SMELLS LIKE HOT DOGS.
HISTORY, FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.
WHEN WILL THIS BE OVER. DONALD TRUMP IS ALWAYS SHOUTING.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? I DON'T KNOW. OBVIOUSLY, HILLARY IS STEEPED IN THE SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION OF WASHINGTON, BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS IS OFFSET BY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH A COMPLICATED WORLD. I LIKE BUTTER FINGERS THE MOST.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! AND WELCOME RUTH WILSON, J.B. SMOOVE! AND THE GHOST BROTHERS! JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANK YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK YOU FOR BEING IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. HAPPY HALLOWEEN, EVERYBODY! HAVING A GOOD TIME? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY NICE. HOPE YOU LIKE MY COSTUME. I'M DRESSED AS THE SPOOKIEST OCTOBER SURPRISE: F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COOOO-MEYYYY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE WAS HE REALLY HERE? BECAUSE, ON FRIDAY, COMEY RE-ANIMATED THE CORPSE OF THE HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL. IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE! COMEY SENT A LETTER TO CONGRESS SAYING THE F.B.I. MAY HAVE FOUND MORE CLINTON E-MAILS. AND THAT'S SPURRED A LOT OF QUESTIONS LIKE "HOW DAMAGING IS THIS?" "WILL IT THROW THE ELECTION FOR TRUMP?" AND "WHAT'S A LETTER? IS THAT LIKE A GIF THAT DOESN'T MOVE?" THE F.B.I. FOUND THE EMAILS WHILE INVESTIGATING ILLICIT MESSAGES SENT TO AN UNDERAGE GIRL BY CLINTON AIDE HUMA ABEDIN'S ESTRANGED HUSBAND AND ES-STRANGE GUY ANTHONY WEINER. ( LAUGHTER ) APPARENTLY, THEY FOUND THEM WHILE SEARCHING HIS LAPTOP. DEAR GOD, I HOPE THEY USED GLOVES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SOME PURELLE, JUST SOAKED IT DOWN. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, IN A SHOCKING TWIST, ANTHONY WEINER'S PENIS MIGHT DESTROY TWO POLITICAL CAREERS. ( LAUGHTER ) POWERFUL! THAT'S POWERFUL! IT'S A MONSTER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GET OUT OF THERE! GET OUT! THE CALLS ARE COMING FROM INSIDE HIS PANTS! ( LAUGHTER ) THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING EVEN MESSIER THAN WIKILEAKS. IT'S WEINER LEAKS. ( LAUGHTER ) AGAIN, AGAIN, THIS IS WHY YOU WANT TO USE TONGS. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS OCTOBER SURPRISE COMES RIGHT AS SECRETARY CLINTON WAS RIDING HIGH IN THE POLLS IN THE WAKE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. TRULY, FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, HORNY MEN GIVETH, AND HORNY MEN TAKETH AWAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THIS --
Jon: WOW...
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. WHAT'S AMAZING IS, THIS IS A HUGE BOMBSHELL TO COME JUST DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, AND TRUMP WASTED NO TIME GRABBING THIS STORY BY THE WEINER.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL SINCE WATERGATE. HER CRIMINAL ACTION WAS WILLFUL, DELIBERATE, INTENTIONAL AND PURPOSEFUL.
STEPHEN: UH... IT WAS ALSO VOLUNTARY, CONSCIOUS, RESOLVED, DESIGNFUL AND AFORETHOUGHT. ( APPLAUSE ) SO THAT GUY'S GOING TO ACE. I'M TELLING YOU, HE MAY NOT WIN THE ELECTION BUT HE'S GOING TO ACE THE A.C.T.s.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: SO THIS IS IT. E-MAILS THAT COULD TIP THE ELECTION IN FAVOR OF A SEXUALLY RAVENOUS, SHAMBLING, ORANGE BABY MAN. SO WHAT DO THEY SAY? THESE EMAILS MUST BE EXPLOSIVE, TO DEFY THE LONGSTANDING POLICY OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT DISCUSSING INVESTIGATIONS COULD TAINT THE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION, NOW A MERE EIGHT DAYS AWAY. THEY MUST BE PACKED WITH DAMNING REVELATIONS, INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE OF MALFEASANCE, ABUSE OF OFFICE, AND UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. SO WHAT DOES THE LETTER SAY? "THE FBI CANNOT YET ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THIS MATERIAL MAY BE SIGNIFICANT." SO NOTHING. OR EVERYTHING. THAT'S LIKE A CAPTAIN YELLING "ALL HANDS ON DECK! HEAD TO THE LIFEBOATS! AT SOME POINT, MAYBE. I HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE F.B.I. DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A WARRANT TO READ THE EMAILS UNTIL LAST NIGHT. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE, BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY NOW HAVE TO READ 650,000 EMAILS. MY GOD! HOW MUCH BONER PILL SPAM DOES ANTHONY WEINER GET? ( LAUGHTER ) SO TO RECAP: HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. NOTHING. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE E-MAILS. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE E-MAILS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EFFECT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON THIS ELECTION. I DON'T KNOW WHY COMEY SENT THIS LETTER. IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE FOREST AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, IT'S STILL MORE INFORMATIVE THAN JAMES COMEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, COMEY DEFENDED HIS ACTIONS IN A LETTER TO F.B.I. EMPLOYEES, "OF COURSE, WE DON'T ORDINARILY TELL CONGRESS ABOUT ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, BUT HERE I FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO, GIVEN THAT I TESTIFIED REPEATEDLY IN RECENT MONTHS THAT OUR INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED COLLECTION OF EMAILS, I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A MISLEADING IMPRESSION." YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO CREATE A MISLEADING IMPRESSION. HE'S LIKE A DETECTIVE WHO GATHERS ALL THE SUSPECTS IN A ROOM AND ANNOUNCES "ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM IS A MURDERER! NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE DINNER RESERVATIONS." ( LAUGHTER ) BOO! RIF SO, JAMES COMEY, IT'S NOT A LETTER, BUT I DO HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU, AND IT'S BEHIND THIS HAND... ( CHEERING ) BUT I CAN'T RELEASE  WHAT IT IS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. AND HILLARY'S NOT THE ONLY POLITICIAN WHO HAD A TOUGH WEEKEND. REMEMBER CHRIS CHRISTIE? HE SURE WISHES YOU DID. ( LAUGHTER ) POOR CHRIS.
Jon: TOUGH SITUATION.
Stephen: ONCE A BIG DEAL. HE WAS ONE OF 700 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO GOT BEATEN LIKE A RENTED MULE BY TRUMP. THEN AFTER CHRISTIE DROPPED OUT, HE BECAME TRUMP'S LACKEY, STANDING AWKWARDLY BEHIND HIM AT RALLIES, AND EVEN GETTING TRUMP'S MCDONALD'S ORDERS. OF COURSE, WHEN YOU GO GET McDONALD'S FOR TRUMP, IT'S NOT CALLED A HAPPY MEAL -- IT'S CALLED A SAD MEAL, AND, INSTEAD OF A TOY, IT COMES WITH CHRISTIE'S BALLS. ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER ALL THAT, NOW IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT BACK IN JULY "TRUMP OFFERED CHRISTIE HIS V.P. SLOT, THEN RESCINDED THE OFFER." APPARENTLY, TRUMP TOLD CHRISTIE HE WAS IN, BUT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER PAUL MANAFORT DIDN'T THINK CHRISTIE WAS A GOOD CHOICE. HE MUST HAVE RECEIVED A TIP FROM ANYONE LIVING IN NEW JERSEY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOT A POPULAR FELLA. SO MANAFORT PULLED OFF A DARING BIT OF POLITICAL ESPIONAGE. DURING A CAMPAIGN STOP IN INDIANA, MANAFORT LIED AND SAID TRUMP'S PLANE NEEDED REPAIRS, FORCING TRUMP TO SPEND AN EXTRA NIGHT IN INDIANAPOLIS, THEN MANAFORT SET UP A MEETING WITH MIKE PENCE... AND THE REST IS HISTORY. JUST LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAYBE. WHO KNOWS. WHO KNOWS. YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW. THOSE PLANE REPAIRS ARE THE SECOND TIME A MADE-UP TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM KILLED CHRIS CHRISTIE'S CAREER. SO, ON TOP OF BEING A CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST, PAUL MANAFORT IS THE QUIRKY BEST FRIEND IN A ROMANTIC COMEDY WHO GOES TO ELABORATE LENGTHS TO MAKE SURE THE COUPLE MEETS. THIS NOVEMBER, KEEP YOUR EYES OUT FOR "MY BEST FRIEND'S VETTING" AND THE SEQUEL "YOU'VE GOT WHITE MALE." I'D WATCH THAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A GOOD MOVIE! I'D WATCH THAT IN A MINUTE! ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ALL OF THIS EMAIL STUFF DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF ME WATCHING THE CUBS THIS WEEKEND. YOU GUYS WATCH THE GAMES THIS WEEKEND? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOST THE FIRST TWO AT WRIGLEY, BUT LAST NIGHT BROUGHT HOME THE FIRST WINNING WORLD SERIES GAME AT WRIGLEY SINCE 1945. AND AS A FAN OF THE CUBS, I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL NOT BLOW IT TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO, IN FOOTBALL, THE NEW -- YOU THINK FOOTBALL, THING WITH THE POINTY ENDS. A LOT OF FUN. THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS PLAYED THE BUFFALO BILLS RIGHT HERE ON CBS, AND THERE WAS SOME QUITE UNUSUAL  UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT BECAUSE  SOMEONE THREW A SEX TOY ON THE FIELD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. RIGHT BY THE END ZONE. COME ON! COME ON! WHEN YOUR COACH TOLD YOU TO "LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FIELD," THIS IS NOT WHAT HE MEANT! ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT WAS THROWN BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH IT ORIGINALLY BROADCASTED ON CBS, THEY WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO NAME WHAT SEX TOY IT WAS. BUT LET'S JUST SAY, IF BILBO BAGGINS HAD A "D" IN HIS NAME INSTEAD OF A "B," YOU'D HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA, BECAUSE IT'S A (BLEEP). ( APPLAUSE ) IT WOULD TOTALLY CHANGE THE LORD OF THE RINGS, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) THANKFULLY, THE REFEREES DISPOSED OF THE SEX TOY IN ACCORDANCE WITH N.F.L. REGULATIONS BY KICKING IT OFF THE FIELD. ( LAUGHTER ) ANNNND IT'S GOOOOOD! AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL BE LOOKING AT DONALD TRUMP'S OUTREACH TO MINORITY VOTERS. SO STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK! GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU GOT IT!
Stephen: I STILL GOT IT, BABY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, FOLKS, DESPITE THE THE F.B.I. E-MAIL FROUFRAH, HILLARY  CLINTON STILL LEADS IN THE POLLS. SO DONALD TRUMP NEEDS EVERY VOTE HE CAN GRAB. WHICH IS WHY HIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN REACHING OUT TO MINORITY VOTERS. LIKE THIS NEW AD TARGETING INDIAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. BEFORE YOU WATCH PART OF IT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW, WE DIDN'T EDIT THIS CLIP. THIS IS REALLY HOW IT GOES. ♪
THE INDIAN AND HINDU COMMUNITY WILL HAVE A TRUE FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE WILL DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PRIME MINISTER MODI. AB KI BAAR TRUMP SARKAAR. WE LOVE THE HINDUS, WE LOVE INDIA! I AM DONALD TRUMP, AND WE APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
STEPHEN: WOW. THAT IS JARRING, CONVOLUTED, AND CONFUSING. I GUESS WHOEVER CUTS HIS HAIR ALSO CUTS HIS ADS. NOT ALL HIS MINORITY OUTREACH IS GOING THAT WELL. CHECK OUT A TRUMP RALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA THIS WEEKEND.
WE HAVE A PROTESTER. BY THE WAY, WERE YOU PAID $1,500 TO BE A THUG? WHERE'S THE PROTESTER? WHERE IS HE? WAS HE PAID? IF YOU CAN GET HIM OUT, GET HIM OUT.
Stephen: HERE'S THE DEAL -- THAT GUY WAS A TRUMP SUPPORTER. PROVING THAT NOT EVEN DONALD TRUMP CAN BELIEVE HE HAS A BLACK SUPPORTER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? OKAY. SO HERE'S THE THING -- ONCE AGAIN, THAT SUPPOSED THUG THAT TRUMP THREW OUT OF HIS RALLY WAS A MAN NAMED C.J. CARY A LONG TIME TRUMP SUPPORTER WHO WAS TOLD BY SECURITY HE JUST WANTED TO GIVE HIM A NOTE. NOW HE'S TOLD, WE'LL MOVE YOU TO A SEPARATE BUT EQUAL TRUMP RALLY. THIS SUPPORTER DID NOT LET IT DISCOURAGE HIM. HE SAID IT WAS ALL FINE AND STILL PLANS ON VOTING FOR TRUMP. I WANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE FOR TRUMP BLACK SUPPORTERS. A DONAL TRUMP RALLY IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN. TRUMP BUPTER BILL FARBER, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME STEPHEN. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
STEPHEN: THANKS, BILL. HAVE YOU HAD THE SAME KIND OF PROBLEMS AT TRUMP RALLIES THAT C.J. CARY HAD?
NO, NOT AT ALL, STEPHEN. IN FACT, THEY TREAT ME LIKE A CELEBRITY. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TAKING MY PICTURE. AND I GET ALL THE FREE "BLACKS FOR TRUMP" SIGNS I CAN HOLD.
STEPHEN: SO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAID BY DEMOCRATS TO DISRUPT THIS RALLY?
NO, I'M JUST HERE TO OFFER MY SUPPORT AND TO GIVE MR. TRUMP THIS LETTER. AHHH!
STEPHEN: TRUMP SUPPORTER BILL FARBER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH RUTH WILSON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A GOLDEN GLOBE WINNING ACTRESS AND STAR OF THE AFFAIR ON SHOWTIME. PLEASE WELCOME RUTH WILSON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH! THIS IS THE SCARIEST HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN I'VE EVER SEEN.
I REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS AND I BROUGHT THIS FOR YOU.
Stephen: AWFUL NICE. IT EVEN HAS TRUMP'S TINY MOUTH AND I'M SURPRISED HOW BIG HIS STEM IS BASED ON THE SIZE OF HIS HANDS. ( LAUGHTER )
YEAH!
Stephen: LET'S PUT IT RIGHT HERE.
I REALIZE PUMPKINS, LIKE HUMANS, HAVE ON THEIR BOTTOM A HOLE.
Stephen: THEY DO HAVE A HOLE. CBS IS GOING TO BLUR THAT, YOU REALIZE.
SUDDENLY, THIS SUITED THE HOLE VERY WELL, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Stephen: THAT'S WHERE ALL HIS IDEAS COME OUT OF.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: AND YOU KNOW, FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO DON'T HAVE THE KEEN EAR THAT I DO -- YOU'RE ENGLISH.
VERY ENGLISH.
Stephen: DO THEY DO HALLOWEEN IN ENGLAND?
WE DO. IT'S A LITTLE MORE CYNICAL THAN HERE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE DON'T REALLY GET DRESSED UP. IF WE DO, IT'S GHOSTS, SHEETS. IT'S 20 YEARS AGO HALLOWEEN.
Stephen: CUT THE EYE HOLES OUT, SHEETS?
WE DO A VERY LOW-KEY VERSION OF IT. MY FAMILY AND I WERE VERY CYNICAL AND USED TO PLAY TRICKS ON THE TRICK OR TREATERS.
Stephen: IN AMERICA, THE KIDS SAY TRICK OR TREAT.
NO, WE GOT TO THEM FIRST.
Stephen: PREEMPTIVE STRIKE. O ME AND MY THREE BROTHERS, ONCE WE PULLED A HOSE OUT THE TOP WINDOW OF OUR HOUSE, TURNED ON THE GARDEN HOSE AND, EVERY TIME THEY CAME WE WOULD SPRAY THEM WITH FREEZING COLD WATER. IT'S MEAN. IT'S MEAN. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.
YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOUR KIDS GO OUT WITH YOUR SACKS AND COSTUMES AND GO AROUND AND GET CANDY.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHA WHAT KIND OF CANDY DO YOU GET OVER THERE?
HARROW BOW.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT? LIKE TURKISH DELIGHT?
IT'S NUGGET.
Stephen: EVERYTHING SOUNDS FANCIER.
WE WANT TO BE FRENCH.
Stephen: YOU HATE THE FRENCH.
NOOGET. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
Stephen: NUGGET. THE PART NO ONE WANTS.
I'LL TAKE IT BACK WITH ME.
Stephen: TO ENGLAND? YES.
Stephen: SO YOU WOULD SPRAY THE CHILDREN WITH WATER.
YES. IT'S NOT A DUMB THING, IT'S JUST OUR FAMILY.
Stephen: YOU'RE PARTICULARLY TERRIBLE.
YES. MEAN.
Stephen: YOU GOT A NEW MOVIE COMING UP CALLED "I AM THE PRETTY THING THAT LIVES IN THE HOUSE."
A LONG TITLE.
Stephen: IT IS A LONG TITLE.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S A SPOOKY MOVIE.
YEAH, IT'S A SPOOKY MOVIE.
Stephen: IS IT HORRIFYING? IT'S FUN. IT'S UNUSUAL. IT'S MORE LIKE A POEM. IT'S VERY STILL. IT'S LIKE ONE CHORD BEING PLAYED.
Stephen: LIKE THE RAVEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
YEAH, AN EDGAR ALLAN POE MOVIE.
Stephen: DO YOU SCARE EASY? OMETIMES THE DARK SCARES ME, CREEKY SOUNDS. SHARKS.
Stephen: THERE IS A REASON TO BE SCARED OF SHARKS. NO ONE HAS TO SAY, LIKE, DO YOU BELIEVE IN SHARKS? ( LAUGHTER )
TRUE.
Stephen: I'VE GOT NO PROOF SHARKS EXIST.
REAL THINGS SCARE ME.
Stephen: WHY SHARKS COMING TO SNIEND.
I THINK STEPHEN SPEILBERG DID A SERVICE TO ME AS A CHILD.
Stephen: DID YOU SEE JAWS IN A THEATER?
I WATCHED IT AT HOME AND BEHIND THE COUCH.
Stephen: I WATCHED IT FROM OUTSIDE THE THEATER.
AWAY FROM THE SCREEN.
Stephen: JUST TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENS.
YEAH.
Stephen: PEOPLE DO CRAZY THINGS AND DO SHARK DIVING AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
I HAVE BEEN SHARK DIVING.
Stephen: WHAT? I TRY TO FACE MY FEAR. IT DIDN'T WORK. I ALWAYS THINK THE SHARK MIGHT ENTER ONE OF THOSE FLAPS.
Stephen: THE GREAT WHITES? YES, IN SOUTH AFRICA.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
IT WAS EXHILARATING. I DO LIKE BEING SCARED. I WAS IN THAT CAGE AND IT WAS GNAWING ON THE SIDE OF THE CAGE AND, YEAH, IT WAS VERY SCARY.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT YOU WERE? NOO-GOT! THIS CAGE IS FULL OF DELICIOUS NOOGOT! ( LAUGHTER ) THERE IS A SPOOKY MOVIE HERE. JIM, LET'S SHOW THE SPOOKINESS.
WELL, NO NEED TO BE RUDE. (GASPS) OH... YOU SCARED ME. ( APPLAUSE ) SEEMS LIKE A VERY HAPPY HOUSE YOU'RE LIVING IN THERE.
IT'S VERY HAPPY. IT'S SORT OF DEATH.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT KIND OF AN ODD AFFECTED VOICE IN THAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE? IS THAT YOUR SPOOKY VOICE?
IT DOES SOUND SPOOKY. BASED ON CINDERELLA, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK OF CINDERELLA AS A HORROR STORY?
YES.
Stephen: HOW SO? HE WAS TRAPPED IN A HOUSE. SHE HAS TO CLEAN. THAT FOR ME IS VERY SCARY. SHE'S GOT A HORRIBLE, SCARY STEP-MOTHER.
Stephen: YES. I MEAN, AND SHE'S GOT A WEIRD VOICE AND SHE TALKS TO MIKE. SHE'S WEIRD. AND SHE SINGS. SHE HAS A VERY HIGH VOICE. I THOUGHT, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO BASE THIS CHARACTER ON.
Stephen: CINDERELLA? YES, SO I BASED THE VOICE ON CINDERELLA.
Stephen: SHE SOUNDS SO INNOCENT.
EXACTLY, SOUNDS SO INNOCENT, VIRG NAIL, BUT UNDERNEATH, SOMETHING IS WRONG.
Stephen: THE PRINCE IS IN FOR A HORRIBLE SURPRISE.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: OFF MOVIE CALLED "DARK RIVER" COMING UP.
NEXT YEAR.
Stephen: YOU DESCRIBED IT AS THE ENGLISH VERSION OF THE REVENENT.
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU FIGHT A BEAR?
NO BEARS BUT I FIGHT SHEEP.
Stephen: THAT IS THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "THE REVENANT"! COME AT ME! ( LAUGHTER )
THEY'RE EVIL. THEY HAVE HORNS, COME AT YOU, THEY DON'T CARE AND THEY'RE A BIT STUPID. ( LAUGHTER )
