I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. (APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW-- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD TO HEAR YOU IN A GOOD MOOD, SCARY MORNING IN NEW YORK CITY. A MAN SET OFF AN IMPROVISED BOMB IN THE SUBWAY NEAR THE PORT AUTHORITY. LUCKILY NONE OF THE BYSTANDERS WERE SERIOUSLY HURT AND THE POLICE GOT THE GUY. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YEAH, ISN'T THAT NICE? THE MAN IS IN CUSTODY RIGHT NOW. THE SUSPECT WHO WAS BANGLADESHI IS 27 AND LIVES IN BROOKLYN SO HE USED ONLY LOCALLY SOURCED HANDMADE ARTISANAL BOMB PARTS. (LAUGHTER) PROBABLY A PICKLE IN THERE SOMEWHERE. BUT I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO THIS GUY. SERIOUSLY? YOU TRIED TO TERRORIZE NEW YORK SUBWAY COMMUTERS? NICE TRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TRY. NEW YORK COMMUTERS DON'T EVEN FLINCH WHEN THE SUBWAY BRAKE DANCERS KICK TWO INCHES AWAY FROM THEIR FACE. THEY HAVE TO BATTLE RATS FOR THE SEAT WHICH FOR THE RECORD YOU SHOULD ONLY GIVE UP IF THE RAT IS PREGNANT. COME ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: COME ON. YOU, YOU TRIED TO S OW CHAOS AND CONFUSION IN THE PORT AUTHORITY BUS STATION? THAT IS THE NORMAL STATE OF AFFAIRS AT THE PORT AUTHORITY BUS STATION. THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE YOUR LITTLE EXPLOSION MAY HAVE SCOURED SOME OF THE GRIME OFF THE WALL, THANKS, THE NOW YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL FOR A LONG, LONG, LONG TIME AND ALL NEW YORKERS WANT TO KNOW IS, DOES THAT MEAN YOUR APARTMENT IS FREE AND IS IT RENT CONTROLLED? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YOU TRIED TO TERRORIZE NEW YORK AND YOU FAILED. WE'RE STRONGER THAN THAT, THE WORST YOU DID WAS MAKE THE SUBWAYS RUN LATE. AND THE MTA DOES THAT JUST FINE WITHOUT YOUR HELP. (LAUGHTER) SPEAKING, SPEAKING OF TERRIFYING, THE ALABAMA SENATE ELECTION IS TOMORROW. AND ROY MOORE SUPPORTERS SPENT THE WEEKEND GOING DOOR TO DOOR JUST LIKE ROY MOORE HAS TO DO WHEN HE MOVES INTO A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT-- PLAWS.
Stephen: HELLO, I'M ROY MOORE, I JUST MOVED IN DOWN. THERE BUT YOU KNOW WHO IS NOT EXCITED ABOUT A ROY MOORE WIN, OF THE REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING ALABAMA SENATOR AND BOY WHO SEES A BIG TRUCK, RICHARD SHELBY.
THE STATE OF ALABAMA DESERVES BETTER. I COULDN'T VOTE FOR ROY MOORE. I DIDN'T VOTE FOR ROY MOORE. BUT I WROTE IN A DISTINGUISHED REPUBLICAN NAME.
Stephen: SO JUST ANY DISTINGUISHED REPUBLICAN NAME? OKAY. I'M GOING TO SAY CHRIS MASS CUE TRICKLE DOWN THE FLORIST AND GOOD FAMILY, THE TRICKLEDOWNS. AND MOORE'S CAMPAIGN JUST GOT WORSE BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE FOUND OUT THAT A PRO-TRUMP GROUP SENT A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL TO INTERVIEW ROY MOORE. THIS IS THE WORST MATCHUP FOR AN INTERVIEW SINCE THEY SENT THAT HONEY GLAZED HAM TO INTERVIEW CHRIS CHRISTIE. YES. PLAWS PLAWS SURE, WHY NOT, CHRIS CHRISTIE, EVERYBODY. WHY NOT. YOU KNOW WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO ENDORSE ROY MOORE, DONALD TRUMP. ON FRIDAY TRUMP EXPLAINED WHY.
WE WANT JOBS, JOBS JOBS. SO GET OUT AND VOTE FOR ROY MOORE.
THIS GUY IS SCREAMING WE WANT ROY MOORE, HE'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT IS TRUE, THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THAT GUY MAY NOT BE A VOTER. HE MIGHT BE MALL SECURITY. WE WANT ROY MOORE. HAS ANYONE SEEN ROY MOORE? SANTA'S ELVES ARE PRESSING CHARGES. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT TRUMP IS SUPPORTING MOORE. THEY BOTH HAVE A DEEP LOVE OF COUNTRY. THE COUNTRY'S RUSSIA BUT STILL-- (LAUGHTER) MOORE WAS RECENTLY ASKED ABOUT RONALD REAGAN'S CLAIM THAT RUSSIA WAS THE FOCUS OF EVIL IN THE MODERN WORLD.
YOU COULD SAY THAT VERY WELL ABOUT AMERICA, COULDN'T YOU. WELL, WE PROMOTE A LOT OF BAD THINGS, YOU KNOW. LIKE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. >>.
THAT IS THE VERY ARGUMENT PUTIN MAKES.
WELL, MAYBE PUTIN IS RIGHT, MAYBE HE'S MORE AKIN TO ME THAN I KNOW.
Stephen: TO WHICH PUTIN RESPOND I LIKE TO DISTANCE MYSELF TO ROY MOORE, YES, I KILL JOURNALIST BUT THIS SICKO HAS GOT A PROBLEM. NO, NEIT. THAT IS MY PUTIN. I'M SORRY, IT WENT ON.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM?
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN (.
Stephen: OH MY GOD, THE RUSSIANS HAVE HACKED ROY MOORE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DID IT. THEY GOT IN THERE.
Jon: THEY GOT IN THERE.
Stephen: THEY WIKI LEAKED HIM. NO, I DON'T SPEAK FLUENT RUSSIAN BUT WE DO HAVE A TRANSLATION.
HELLO WHAT IS YOUR SHOPPING MALL'S POLICY ON PERVERTS?
Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW. GOOD TO KNOW. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS HE HAS TO SAY WHEN HE GOES DOOR TO DOOR. OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP AND ROY MOORE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON. AT LEAST 16 WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED DONALD TRUMP OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND TODAY THREE OF TRUMP'S ACCUSERS RETOLD THEIR STORIES ON THE "TODAY SHOW" AFTER BEING ASSURED 30 ROCK HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY DE-LAUERED. ONE WOMAN DESCRIBED BEING ASSAULTED BY TRUMP ON AN AIRPLANE. THE WOMAN ACTUALLY LEFT HER SIT AND HID IN THE BACK OF THE PLANE AFTER TRUMP GROPED HER BUT RAN INTO HIM TWO YEARS LATER AT AN EVENT.
HE SAYS I REMEMBER YOU. YOU WERE THAT-- WOMAN FROM THE AIRPLANE. HE CALLED ME THE WORST NAME EVER.
DOES IT AGAIN WITH A C.
YES, YES.
DOES IT END WITH T.
YES.
Stephen: HE CALLED HER A CAT? (LAUGHTER) THAT, AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HOPE HE CALLED HER. BECAUSE IF HE CALLED HER THE OTHER THING THARK WOULD MAKE OUR PRESIDENT A HUGE, BEGINS WITH AN A, ENDS WITH A HOLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT? GOOD, GOOD. WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
Jon: WE CAN GUESS.
Stephen: WE HAVE ANOTHER-- GLIMPSE INI HAD INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. ON SATURDAY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" GAVE A DETAILED LOOK OF TRUMP'S DAY TO DAY LIFE THAT PAINTS A PORTRAIT OF AN ANGRY PARANOID MAN CONSTANTLY UNDER ATTACK. FOR DONALD TRUMP EVERY DAY IS AN HOUR BY HOUR BATTLE FOR SELF-PRESERVATION. TRUMP FEELS UNDER ATTACK BUT TRIES TO STAY POSITIVE ABOUT MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN'S POSSIBLE COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA TELLING SEVERAL PEOPLE IT'S LIFE. YES, IT'S LIFE. BUT YOU COULD PLEAD THAT DOWN TO 30 YEARS IF YOU RAT OUT DON, JR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT WOULD BE THE THING, THAT WOULD BE THE THING. OH MY GOODNESS. AND IT TURNS OUT THE REPORTING OF THAT DONALD TRUMP IS DROWNING HIS SOR ROWS IN A DOZEN DIET COKES EACH DAY. WHICH EXPLAINS DIET COKE'S NEW SLOGAN, DIET COKE, 12 IS TOO MANY! I COULD GO FOR ONE RIGHT NOW. I COULD GO FOR ONE. TRUMP VIEWS HIS WHOLE PRESIDENCY AS A WAR AGAINST HIS ENEMIES. BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE HE TOLD TOP AIDES TO THINK OF EACH PRESIDENTIAL DAY AS AN EPISODE IN A TELEVISION SHOW IN WHICH EVAN QUISHES RIVALS. THOSE TV SHOWS, HOW TO GET AWAY WITH TREASON, FOLLOWED BY GRABS ANATOMY. WE ALREADY KNEW, YES, ALL RIGHT CANCELLED. (APPLAUSE) ALREADY CANCELLED. WE ALREADY KNEW THAT DONALD TRUMP LOVES HIS TV. MOSTLY WATCHING FOX NEWS BUT TRUMP SOMETIMES HATE WATCHES CNN TO GET WORKED UP, ESPECIALLY DON LEMON. DON LEMON. WHAT IS IT ABOUT DON LEMON? IS IT THAT HE'S SO CITRUS-Y? NATURALLY TRUMP IS FURIOUS ABOUT THE PIECE TWEETING ANOTHER FALSE STORY. THIS TIME IN THE FAILING@NEW YORKTIMES THAT I WATCH FOUR TO EIGHT HOURS OF TELEVISION A DAY. WRONG. ALSO I SELDOM IF EVER WATCH CNN OR MSNBC, BOTH OF WHICH I CONSIDER FAKE NEWS AND NEVER WATCH DON LEMON WHO I ONCE CALLED THE DUMBEST MAN ON TELEVISION. BAD REPORTING. DON LEMON WHO I HAVE NEVER SEEN, IS HORRIBLE. NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW, WHICH I TOTALLY DO, HASHTAG WHO'S DON LEMON. (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME MOMENTS WHEN THE PRESIDENT ISN'T WATCHING FOX NEWS. SOMETIMES HE HAS FOX NEWS HOSTS COME TO HIM LIKE FORMER JUDGE AND WOMAN WHO JUST PURCHASED AN ORPHANAGE AT AUCTION, JEANINE PIRO. JUDGE JEANINE RECENTLY MET WITH TRUMP AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE SHE SPENT MORE THAN AN HOUR WHIPPING UP THE PRESIDENT AGAINST ROBERT MUELLER. IT'S HIS DREAM COME TRUE, A LIVE PERFORMANCE OF FOX NUSES. IN THE COMMERCIAL BREAK THEY EVEN SOLD HIM A SELF-LUBRICATING CATHETER. BUT-- YOU'RE GOING TO WANT IT, WILL YOU THANK ME. WILL YOU THANK ME FOR THE LUBRICATION. BUT JUDGE JEANINE EVIDENTLY OVERSTAYED HER WELCOME BECAUSE TRUMP EVENTUALLY GOT TIRED OF HER SCREED AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.
THANKS, LOOK, WHAT ROOM IS DON LEMON IS, CUZ WHO IS DON LEMON, I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM. (APPLAUSE) DON, DON,-- (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: BUT JUDGE PIRO HAS A NEED, A NEED FOR SCREED. SO SHE KEPT UP HER ATTACK ON MUELLER AND THE FBI ON WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS HER TELEVISION SHOW.
THERE IS A CLEANSING NEEDED IN OUR FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT NEEDS TO BE CLEANSED OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD NOT JUST BE FIRED BUT WHO NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT IN HANDCUFFS. THE STENCH COMING OUT OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FBI IS LIKE THAT OF A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. WELL, IT'S TIME TO TAKE THEM OUT. IN CUFFS. AND THAT'S MY OPEN, TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM HASHTAG JUDGE JEANINE.
Stephen: MUELLER AND HIS CORRUPT JUNTA ARE MAGGOTS GORGING ON THE CORPS OF LADY LIBERTY AND FREEDOM-LOVING PATRIOTS MUST DRINK THEIR BLOOD FROM THE CHALICE OF JUSTICE. AND THAT'S MY OPENING, JOIN THE CONVERSATION ON INSTA, WITH HASHTAG PUSH MUELLER INTO TRAFFIC. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MATT DAMON IS HERE, AND CHICAGO MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKING, EVERYBODY, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, JON, I'M PRETTY EXCITED, CHRISTMAS IS COMING. CHRISTMAS IS COMING.

Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE MATT DAMON, STICK AROUND. ♪ WELCOME BACK TO THE LATE SHOW, WE'RE HERE WITH MATT DAMON, STAR OF DOWNSIZING. NOW MATT T IS NOW THE 209 ANNIVERSARY OF GOOD WILL HUNTING. YOU WON THE OSCAR-- OSCAR FOR WRITING THAT. I REMEMBER SEEING IT 20 YEARS AGO. AND I WAS TELLING YOUR FRIEND BEN THERE, I WAS WATCHING THIS SAYING I DON'T WORK HARD ENOUGH, THESE ARE YOUNG GUYS WHO ARE IN IT, THEY WROTE IT, GOT IT MADE. THAT IS REALLY PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. DO YOU LOOK BACK AT IT AND SAY THAT SCRIPT IS, THAT DESERVED AN OSCAR OR NOW DO YOU GO I COULD HAVE WRITTEN THAT LATER, 20 YEARS LATER I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SCRIPT.
NO, WE PUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE HAD AND WE WERE INTO THAT SCRIPT. AND I-- I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT REWRITING IT.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BUT YOU ARE THE ARTIST.
NO I HOPE NOT. I THINK THAT WAS THAT TIME IN OUR LIVES. IT REALLY WAS THE-- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE STARTED WRITING THAT, BEN WAS 20 AND I WAS 22.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, YOU GO TO HELL.
WELL, BUT IT WAS FIVE YEARS, IT CAME OUT WHEN I WAS 27 AND HE WAS 25 AND SO IT REALLY JUST DOMINATED OUR WHOLE KIND OF, THE BEGINNING OF OUR ADULT LIVES WERE COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY TRYING TO GET THAT MOVIE MADE.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT FILM MEAN TO YOU NOW?
IT MEANS, IT'S A VERY-- IT'S DEEPLY PERSONAL. CUZ IT'S ALL TIED IN WITH HOW OUR LIVES, THE TRAJECTORY OF OUR CAREERS COMPLETELY CHANGED. YOU KNOW, AND NOW, YOU KNOW, 20 YEARS LATER, IT WAS SUCH A POSITIVE THING. AND NOW TO LOOK BACK AND KNOW THAT ROBYN GOT THIS HORRIFIC DEGENERATIVE BRAIN DISEASE AND LOST HIS LIFE, ELLIOTT SMITH WHO WROTE THAT BEAUTIFUL MUSIC AND THOSE SONGS IS GONE AS WELL. AND NOW WITH THE REVELATIONS ABOUT HARVEY, YOU KNOW, AND KNOWING THAT THERE WERE WOMEN WHO WERE REALLY BEING TRAUMATIZED, YOU KNOW, BY THE PERSON WHO FINANCED THE MOVIE, ITS' WEIRD. CUZ IT COLLIDES WITH ALL THESE INCREDIBLY POSITIVE FEELINGS LIKE BEN AND I HAVE THESE CAREERS 20 YEARS LATER THAT WE'RE SO GRATEFUL FOR. AND OUR PRIVILEGE, AS YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT, YOU GOT TO KEEP WORKING AT IT, YOU KNOW. IF PEOPLE STOP GOING TO THE MOVIE I'M OUT OF A JOB AND IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE. AND SO IT'S ALL JUST TIED UP, IN ALL THESE KIND OF HEAVY FEELINGS KIND OF COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER. AT THE SAME TIME I REMEMBER GOING BACK TO BOSTON A FEW YEARS AGO FOR MY DAD'S BIRTHDAY AND WE TOOK A PICTURE ON THE PARK BENCH. I WALKED INTO THE BOSTON COMMON WITH MY KIDS AND WE FOUND THE BENCH THAT ROBIN AND I DID THAT SCENE, YOU KNOW, WHERE HE-- IT IS A LONG MONOLOGUE FOR ROBIN AND I BARELY SAY ANYTHING. BUT WE WROTE, WE WERE REALLY PROUD OF THAT SCENE AND IT WAS KIND OF A BIG MOMENT IN THE MOVIE. AND I HADN'T BEEN THERE SINCE ROBIN HAD PASSED AWAY. AND WE WENT AND TOOK A PICTURE SITTING ON THE BENCH WITH MY KIDS. THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT, MY WIFE DID AND MY FATHER WAS WITH US SO YOU KNOW, SO IT'S VERY, VERY POWERFUL FEELINGS, KIND OF, YOU KNOW, CONFLICTING, YOU KNOW, CONFLICTING AND COLLIDING WITH EACH OTHER.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR THAT MOVIE, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT MOVED ME THEN AND IT IS STILL BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WELL, IT WAS ALL DOWN HILL FROM THERE. YOU PLAYED THE KRILL.
I DID PLAY THE KRI WILL, L.
Stephen: THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED DOWNSIZING T IS AN UNUSUAL PREMISE, TELL THE PEOPLE THE UNUSUAL PREMISE OF THIS MOVIE.
IT ST ALEXANDER PAYNE WHO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS AND HAVE I BEEN DESPERATE TO WORK WITH HIM.
Stephen: THE DESCENDANTS, SIDEWAYS, ELECTION.
ABOUT SCHMILT, HE HAS JUST-- HE NEVER MADE A MOVIE THAT WASN'T FANTASTIC. AND SO HE CAME TO ME WITH THIS IDEA B OKAY, SO NORWEGIAN SCIENTISTS FOUND A WAY TO SHRINK HUMANS DOWN TO FIVE INCHES IN HEIGHT AND SIX PERCENT OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION DECIDES TO DO THIS AS A WAY TO OFFSET CLIMATE CHANGE AND I JUST LOOKED AT HIM AND I JUST DIDN'T THINK HE WAS BEING SERIOUS WITH ME. I THOUGHT HE WAS-- IT WAS LAKE A TEST. BUT THEN HE GAVE ME THIS SCRIPT THAT HE AND JIM TAYLOR, HIS COWRITER HAD BEEN WORKING ON. AND THEY HAD IT FOR TEN YEARS. AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. AND HE DESCRIBED IT TO ME AS HE WANTED IT TO BE A HAL ASHBY MOVIE WITH GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND THAT IS REALLY-- HAL ASHBY WAS A BRILLIANT FILM MAKER WHO MADE IN THE 1970S KIND OF IN THE WHEELHOUSE OF AMERICAN CINEMA MADE SOME INCREDIBLE MOVIES AND THIS MOVIE TO ME FEELS LIKE IT IS A GIANT SATTIRE, FEELS LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE '70S. I AM ENORMOUSLY PROUD OF IT AND WOULDN'T CHANGE A FRAME OF IT AND EXACTLY WHAT ALEXANDER SAID IT WOULD BE.
Stephen: FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LESS OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SO IT LITERALLY REDUCES THEIR FOOTPRINT. THEY ARE ONLY ABOUT THIS TALL.
YEAH. BECAUSE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE START TO GO FOR T THEY SAY IT IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO THEIR PART, YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY CUZ THEY REALIZE THEY CAN CONSUME MORE, RIGHT.
Stephen: FOR LESS.
SO YOU IF YOU ARE FIVE INCHES YOU CAN HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A 6,000 SQUARE FOOT HOUSE AND TWO ACRES FOR THE SIZE OF YOUR DESK.
Stephen: IF YOU HAVE 50,000 IN SAVINGS YOU HAVE $10 MILLION.
EXACTLY. SO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN HAVE THIS AMERICAN DREAM THAT THEY CAN'T QUITE ATTAIN IN THE BIG WORLD AND SO THEY DOWNSIZE.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE WITH YOU AND I THINK IT IS SAY JOHN SEDAKIS AND IS HE EXPLAIN TOWG.
HE HAS DOWNSIZED WE ARE HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES AND HE HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND HE HAS COME TO A REUNION AS A SMALL PERSON. AND WE'RE CATCHING UP.
Stephen: OKAY.
Stephen: JIM.
SO THE DECISION TO.
WELL, THAT'S THE THING. DOWN SIEZING TAKES PRESSURE RIGHT OFF, ESPECIALLY MONEY PRESSURE.
PLUS IT MUST FEEL GOOD TO KNOW YOU ARE REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
YOU MEAN ALL THAT CRAP ABOUT SAVING THE PLANET?
YEAH.
DOWN SIEZING IS ABOUT SAVING YOURSELF. NOW CAROLINE, WE LIVE LIKE KINGS.
I'M STILL LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE I GREW UP IN. AUDREY IS DYING FOR US TO MOVE BUT WE ARE REALLY STRAPPED.
LISTEN, THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL COMMUNITIES CROPPING UP BUT DON'T MESS AROUND. LEISURE LAND IS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. BEST HOUSES, BEST APPLIANCES, BEST DOCTORS, ALL THE GREAT RESTAURANTS. ITS KIDS LOVE CHEESE CAKE FACTORY AND LEISURE LAND HAS THREE OF THEM.
SORRY, MAYBE BACK UP A LITTLE. THINK THERE MIGHT BE TOO MUCH GARLIC IN THE SALSA HERE.
OH, YEAH, RIGHT. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MATT, IT WAS GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
I HOPE SO TOO.
Stephen: DOWN SIEZING IS IN THEATERS FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2 2-7BD. MATT DAMON, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE) WITH RAHM HE MANUEL. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST THIS EVENING IS A FORMER CONGRESSMAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, FORMER BALLET DANCER AND CURRENT MAYOR OF CHICAGO, PLEASE WELCOME HIS HONOR RAHM EMANUEL. (APPLAUSE) DO YOU KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT YOU CAN POINT AT THAT MANY PEOPLE? I DON'T KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE.
THAT IS THE EMANUEL FAMILY.
Stephen: OH, OKAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU RECENTLY DECLARED CHICAGO SCHOOLS A TRUMPFREE ZONE.
THE CITY OF CHICAGO, YEAH.
Stephen: THE WHOLE THING.
THE WHOLE THING, MAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? HOW DO YOU-- I MEAN, THE DE BLASIO, CAN HE DECLARE NEW YORK A TRUMPFREE ZONE.
HE CAN TRY, OUR MOTTO, A CITY HE WILL NEVER SLEEP IN WE DON'T WANT HIM. SO-- .
Stephen: HOW DO YOU ENFORCE IT YOU HAVE A TRUMP HOTEL RIGHT ON THE RIVER.
THIS IS VERY SERIOUS, I'M NOT JOKING. IN CHICAGO IF YOU GET A B AVERAGE IN HIGH SCHOOL WE MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE AND IT'S THE ONLY PUBLIC SCHOLARSHIP THAT A DREAMER CAN GET. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: BUT THIS ISN'T SPECIFICALLY ABOUT DREAMERS AND DACA.
NO, SECOND WHEN U.S. STEEL UMP DIDDED IN LAKE MICHIGAN EPA DID NOTHING UNDER DN ALD TRUMP SO WE SUED. THIRD AND THIS IS, THE OTHER THING IS ON CLIMATED CHANGE, WE HAVE ADOPTED RECENTLY WITH A NUMBER OF MAYORS POLICIES THAT WILL MOVE US FORWARD. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP IS DRIVING FORWARD LOOKING THROUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR AND I'M NOT GOING THAT WAY BECAUSE I WANT MY CITY GOING THAT WAY AND I WANT IT TO BE A TRUMP FREE GLOAN. IT'S THE SEQUEL OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO. I THINK WHAT HE IS DOING IS WRONG FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY T IS NOT HOW I WANTED THE ELECTION TO TURN OUT. AND SO WE DECLARED CHICAGO IS GOING TO BE A TRUMPFREE ZONE. HE REALLY NEVER REALLY LIKED IT WHEN DO I THAT THOUGH.
Stephen: CHICAGO IS ALSO A SANCTUARY CITY, RIGHT.
TOTALLY.
Stephen: OKAY, HOW DOES THAT WORK? HOW DOES THAT WORK AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ENTHUSIASM FOR THAT IDEA AND I AM JUST CURIOUS, HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN SAY JOHN C KAL HUMAN DECLARING NULLIFICATION OF FEDERAL LAW. HOW IS THAT NOT A SORT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.
FIRST OF ALL, I CALL IT A WELCOMING CITY, NOT A SANCTUARY CITY.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND WE WELCOME IMMIGRANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD THERE ARE 140 LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. A HUNDRED YEARS AGO MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO CHICAGO 13 YEARS OLD BY HIMSELF, CHICAGO WELCOMED HIM AND HIS GRANDSON NOW IS THE MAYOR. CHICAGO, THE UNITED STATES, IS THE GREATEST CITY IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. BEAR NONE, THAT AN IMMIGRANT GRANDSON CAN BE THE MAYOR. AND HERE IS THE OTHER THING. LITTLE HISTORY OF CHICAGO. THE ONLY CITY NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT, OF RETURNING SLAVES BACK TO THE SOUTH, THE CITY OF CHICAGO. SO BEING A SANCTUARY CITY IS IN OUR HISTORY. THE ONLY CITY-- .
Stephen: DOESN'T NESESLY ANSWER MY QUESTION. I'M ALL FOR WHAT YOU ARE DG BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW IT DOESN'T VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW FOR YOU TO DO THIS.
BECAUSE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS NO NOT N THE CITY OF CHICAGO IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCING THE IMMIGRATION LAWS OF THE UNITIED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT IS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FOR, WHAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND HERE IS THE OTHER THING, BIGGER PIECE OF THIS, WE ARE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT DRIVING A WEDGE, THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS IS A WEDGE BETWEEN, ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMMUNITY POLICING IT IS ABSOLUTELY ANTITHETICAL OF EVERYTHING WE ARE TRYING TO DO AND WHICH IS WHY POLICE CHIEFS AROUND THE COUNTRY, BIG CITIES, SMALL CITIES, MEDIUM SIZED CITIES, ALL THINK WHAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, SPECIFICALLY UNDER DONALD TRUMP IS DRIVING A WEDGE AND A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD THAT TRUST STVMENT ABSOLUTELY ANTITHETICAL TO COMMUNITY POLICING.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PODCAST BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS FREE TIME, YOU HAVE A PODCAST. HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT MUCH FREE TIME TO HAVE A PODCAST.
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT-- FIRST OF ALL IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME.
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A PODCAST.

Stephen: AND SEARS OR WILLIS? I'M FOR SEARS BUT HAVE I TO GO BY WILLIS LAKE OR RIVER.

Stephen: 12 INCH OR 16 INCH.
16 INCH SOFTBALL.
THIS IS A FAMILY FRIENDLY SHOW, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IF YOU ARE NOT FROM CHICAGO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
Stephen: ONLY IN CHICAGO IF YOU HAVE LIKE AN OFFICE LEAGUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THE SOFTBALLS THEY USE ARE BASICALLY, THEY TAKE A BASKETBALL AND WRAP IT IN HORSE HAIR.
HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS, 16 INCH.
Stephen: THEY ARE HUGE TRK LOOKS LIKE THE MOON IS ECLIPSING THE ENTIRE THING WHEN IT COMES AT YOU.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ONE LAST THING, YOU WORK FOR TWO ADMINISTRATIONS, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION JUST ACKNOWLEDGED JERUSALEM AS THE CAPITOL OF ISRAEL. WHY DIDN'T THE TWO ADMINISTRATIONS YOU WORKED FOR DO THAT?
FIRST OF ALL, NO DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WOULD EVER DO THIS.
Stephen: JUST ASKING ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIONS YOU WORKED FOR.
BECAUSE IT'S BAD POLICY.
Stephen: WHY?
BECAUSE.
Stephen: IT'S THE CAPITOL OF ISRAEL.
THE FACT IS BECAUSE FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS, YOU DO NOT WANT THE UNITED STATES IN THE MIDDLE OF NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT TWO STATE SOLUTION, AND I'M, YOU KNOW, MY FATHER IS FROM ISRAEL. BEEN TO ISRAEL, MY SON HAS BEEN BAR MITZVAHED THERE. THIS IS NOT WHAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE DOING.
Stephen: YOU DON'T-- HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.
NOT ONLY DON'T I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT, BY BIGGER WORRY IS HE IS MOVING THE NATION'S CAPITOL TO ALABAMA AND I'M REALLY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HE IS DOING THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. GOOD TO HE SA YOU. (APPLAUSE) THE CHICAGO STORY PODCAST IS AVAILABLE NOW. THE HOST, MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY JUANES.
