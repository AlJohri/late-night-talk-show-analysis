Stephen:  WELCOME, WELCOME, ONE AND ALL, TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A LOT OF EXCITEMENT. GREAT AUDIENCE. I CAN'T BLAME THEM. FIRST OF ALL, HAPPY HANNUKAH, EVERBODY. TODAY'S THE FIRST NIGHT OF HANNUKAH, WHEN GOOD JEWISH BOYS AND GIRLS SPRING FROM THEIR BEDS TO SEE THEIR PARENTS GOING TO WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE DAY OFF. IT'S ALSO A BIG ELECTION DAY IN ALABAMA. AND NOW IT'S OFFICIAL: ROY MOORE IS OR IS NOT OUR NEWEST U.S. SENATOR. LONG BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSED. ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS HOW ROY MOORE GOT TO THE POLLS. HE ARRIVED ON HORSEBACK! YES! AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO ROY MOORE, "HELLO YOU AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S A BIT OF AN EYEBROW RAISER: THE HORSE'S NAME IS SASSY. WELL, I MEAN, THAT IS A LOVELY NAME FOR A MAGAZINE TARGETED AT TEENAGE GIRLS. "HIYO, SASSY! OFF TO THE MALL!" ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CLAPPING )  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OBJECT WORK! APPARENTLY, RIDING TO THE POLLS ON HORSEBACK IS A FAMILY TRADITION. OH, ROY MOORE LOVES TRADITIONS FROM THE 1800s, LIKE CHILD BRIDES AND THE DRED SCOTT DECISION.
Audience: OOOH!
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: HEY, MAY BE HE LOST. WE DON'T KNOW. AND LAST NIGHT, MOORE MADE HIS FINAL PUSH AT A RALLY FEATURING A SPEECH BY HIS WIFE, KAYLA. AND SHE EMPHASIZED THAT HER HUSBAND IS A FRIEND TO ALL, NO MATTER WHAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA SAYS.
FAKE NEWS WOULD TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T CARE FOR JEWS, AND I TELL YOU ALL THIS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IT ALL, SO I JUST WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT WHILE THEY'RE HERE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ONE OF OUR ATTORNEYS IS A JEW.
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: WOW. "WE'RE NOT HOMOPHOBIC BECAUSE MY HAIRDRESSER IS A GAY. I MEAN, REALLY,  REALLY GAY. I MEAN--  ( APPLAUSE ) HE RIDES A BIKE AND EVERYTHING."  (  LAUGHTER  ) MRS. MOORE CONTINUED HER TORAH PORTION.
WE'VE HAD VERY CLOSE FRIENDS THAT ARE JEWISH AND RABBIS, AND WE ALSO FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM.
Stephen: "OH, WE FELLOWSHIP ALL THE TIME. I MEAN, JEWISH GIRLS KNOW, ROY WILL SHOW UP AT YOUR BAT MITZVAH."
Jon: WHOA!
Stephen: BUT THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT WAS ONE OF MOORE'S OLD WAR BUDDIES WHO VOUCHED FOR MOORE'S CHARACTER. THIS GUY DESCRIBED A TIME WHEN THEY WERE BOTH IN VIETNAM, AND A FRIEND OF THEIRS TREATED THEM TO A NIGHT ON THE TOWN.
HE TOOK US TO THIS PLACE WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A BROTHEL. THERE WERE CERTAINLY PRETTY GIRLS-- AND THEY WERE GIRLS. SOME WERE YOUNG. SOME WERE PROBABLY VERY YOUNG
Stephen: IUST WANT TO PAUSE IT RIGHT THERE, PAUSE IT RIGHT THERE. AND POINT OUT THAT MAN, DESCRIBING ROY MOORE'S VISIT TO AN UNDERAGE BROTHEL, IS ON HIS SIDE. BUT, APPARENTLY, ROY ACTED THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN UPON LEARNING WHERE HE WAS.
ROY SAID TO ME, "WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE. I'M LEAVING," OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT.
Stephen: YES, "WORDS TO THAT EFFECT." LIKE, "I'M LEAVING... TO GO FIND AN A.T.M." HOOO! ♪ ♪ ♪  (  LAUGHTER  ) SPEAKING OF SHADY CHARACTERS, DONALD TRUMP.  (  LAUGHTER  ) YESTERDAY, WE HEARD FROM THREE OF THE 19 WOMEN WHO HAVE ACCUSED DONALD TRUMP OF SESUAL MISCONDUCT. WELL, THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT FIRED BACK. "DESPITE THOUSANDS OF HOURS WASTED AND MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SHOW ANY COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA-- SO THEY ACCUSATIONS AND FABRICATED STORIES OF WOMEN WHO I DON'T KNOW AND/OR HAVE NEVER MET." "AND THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND/OR A COMPLETE LIE."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE-- BECAUSE THAT IS A LIE. INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF HIS ACCUSERS ARE A FORMER BUSINESS PARTNER; WOMEN FROM THE MISS U.S.A. PAGEANT, WHICH TRUMP OWNED; AND A CONTESTANT IN SEASON FOUR OF "THE APPRENTICE." "YOUR CHALLENGE IS FOR ME TO SEXUALLY HARASS YOU AND THEN YOU HAVING TO WATCH ME BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES." ENJOY!" WELL THIS AFTERNOON--  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THANK YOU. "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE RELEASED A PHOTO OF NATASHA STOYNOFF, ONE OF TRUMP'S ACCUSERS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. IN WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL "THE GROPE ZONE." SO, YOU KNEW THEM. BUT YESTERDAY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEFENDED TRUMP.
THE PRESIDENT HAS DENIED ANY OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, AS HAVE EYEWITNESSES, AND SEVERAL REPORTS HAVE SHOWN THOSE EYEWITNESSES ALSO BACK UP THE PRESIDENT'S CLAIM IN THIS PROCESS.
Stephen: HOW CAN YOU HAVE EYEWITNESSES TO SAY YOU DIDN'T DO SOMETHING?  (  LAUGHTER  ) "YOUR HONOR, I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER SEEING HIM NOT MURDER THAT MAN ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS." I REST MY CASE. SORRY. WRONG GUY. WRONG STORY. I APOLOGIZE. BUT YOU KNOW-- IT'S JUST TOO ENJOYABLE. BUT YOU KNOW WHO BELIEVES THE WOMEN? THE WOMAN WHO LED THE CALL FOR AL FRANKEN'S RESIGNATION LAST WEEK, NEW YORK SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. SAYING NOW:
THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE CREDIBLE. THEY ARE NUMEROUS. I'VE HEARD THESE WOMEN'S TESTIMONY, AND MANY OF THEM ARE HEARTBREAKING. PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD RESIGN.
Stephen: OKAY, MAYBE, BUT FOR THAT TO WORK, YOU HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WITH A SENSE OF DECENCY AND A SHRED OF DECENCY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE THAT. INSTEAD, HE'S GOT A LABEL ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK: "WARNING: CONTAINS NO SHAME." IT'S RIGHT BELOW "PROPERTY OF VLADIMIR PUTIN."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE,-- YEAH, LOOKS GOOD. GOOD WORK. THAT'S SOME NICE INK. OF COURSE, TRUMP COULDN'T LET THAT GO, TWEETING, "LIGHTWEIGHT SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, A TOTAL FLUNKY FOR CHUCK SCHUMER AND SOMEONE WHO WOULD COME TO MY OFFICE 'BEGGING' FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS NOT SO LONG AGO-- AND WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR THEM-- IS NOW IN THE RING FIGHTING AGAINST TRUMP.

(  LAUGHTER  ) IT IS ANTI, RIGHT? I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT-- THAT DESCRIPTION AND IMPLICATION OFFENDED A LOT OF PEOPLE, SO HUCKA-SANDS WAS ASKED ABOUT IT.
IS SENATOR GILLIBRAND OWED APOLOGY FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET THIS MORNING, BECAUSE MANY, INCLUDING THE SENATOR, THINKS THAT IT'S ABOUT SEXUAL INNUENDO?
I THINK ONLY IF YOUR MIND IS IN THE GUTTER WOULD YOU HAVE READ IT THAT WAY.
Stephen: "YEAH, GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER. THAT'S DISGUSTING. NOW LET'S GO BACK TO TALKING ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTING SERIAL TEEN-SQUEEZER."  (  LAUGHTER  ) OF COURSE, AMERICA IS BEING TORN APART BY BITTER PARTISAN DIVIDE. BUT YESTERDAY EVENING, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND CAME TOGETHER AT THE CONGRESSIONAL DOG HOLIDAY PARTY. ISN'T THAT ADORABLE! IT'S THE ONE PLACE ON CAPITOL HILL YOU CAN ENGAGE IN HEAVY PETTING AND NOT HAVE TO RESIGN.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE DOGS ARE THE ONES HUMPING YOUR LEG. AND THE PARTY WAS VERY DIVERSE, RIGHT? THERE'S A LITTLE CHRISTMAS PRESENT PUP PLAYING WITH A HANNUKAH HOUND. OR AS KAYLA MOORE WOULD PUT IT, "ONE OF OUR CANINES IS A JEW."

SEE, I'VE COME LATE TO THE GLASS THING. I'VE HAD SO MANY IN MY POCKET-- READING GLASSES, BY AND LARGE.
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
BUT I JUST DECIDE, SCREW IT, MAN, I'M JUST GOING TO GO --
Stephen: VERY DISTINGUISHED.
THANK YOU. NOT ONLY-- NOT AM I ONLY AN ACTOR, BUT I'M ALSO A MILD-MANNERED REPORTER FOR A GREAT ME METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPER. LAUGH.
Stephen: TOM, HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
THANK YOU.

MERRY CHRISTMAS. HAPPY HANUKKAH.
Stephen: HAPPY KWANZAA. ALL THE GOOD STUFF.
HAPPY HOLIDAY S.
Stephen:  ARE YOU GOING TO BE HOME WITH YOUR LOVELY WIFE, REET AFOR THE HOLIDAYS?
YES, WE WILL HAVE OUR TRADITIONAL TRINSLE WAR WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE TINSEL WAR.
HERE'S THE THING, I GREW UP WITH A CHRISTMAS DECORATION SCHEME BY WAY OF WOOLWORTH'S, THE FIVE AND DIME-- MORE SHINY OBJECTS ON THE TREE, THE BETTER. MY WIFE GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE THE KIDS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DECORATE THE TREE. HER MOM DID TWHILE THEY WERE AT SCHOOL. THEY WOULD COME HOME AND IT WOULD BE ALL DONE. AND SHE WOULD SAY, "HONEY, YOU WON'T DO IT GOOD, SO I HAVE TO DO IT." SO RITA HAS THIS THING ABOUT DECORATING THE TREE. AND MY THING HAD ALWAYS BEEN TINSEL, OLD-SCHOOL TINSEL.
Stephen: THE INDIVIDUAL STRANDS.
THE ICICLE STUFF. BUT REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS, BEFORE I NEEDED GLASSES, IT WAS MADE OUT OF LITERALLY A TOXIC SUBSTANCE.
Stephen: SURE, SURE  (  LAUGHTER  ).
IT SHOULD HAVE HAD, "DO NOT USE HANDS TO DECORATE YOUR TREE WITH THIS."
Stephen: IT WAS DEVELOPED AT LOS ALAMOS.
YES. HAD A HALF-LIFE AND IT WAS A CARCINOGEN, YOU COULD GET DIABETES FROM IT.  ( LAUGHTER ) IT GAVE YOU ZITS. IT WAS REALLY BAD STUFF.
Stephen: AND DELICIOUS.
AND IT TASTED GOOD.
Stephen: YEAH.
TASTED LIKE CHRISTMAS. YOU KNOW? IT REALLY DID. AND I-- I-- WHEN WE ALL-- I ALWAYS PUT TINSEL ON THE TREE, EVEN THOUGH NOW --
Stephen: DO YOU DO STRANDS OR DO YOU JUSTING CHUCK IT?
WELL, NOW, YOU CAN ONLY CHUCK IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME CARCINOGEN IT HAD BEEN. IT'S NOT THE SAME CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. IT'S STRANDS OF MYLAR THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO STATIC ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR AND YOU CAN'T GET IT TO DRAPE OVER THE BRANCHES. IT'S LIKE A SERIES OF RATS' NESTS THAT COLLECT ON IT. WE ALWAYS SAY-- THIS YEAR-- WE ALTERNATE THE YEARS. THERE ARE SOME YEARS THEY-- I-- IS THIS AN ODD-NUMBERED YEAR?
Stephen: IT IS, YEAH.
I THINK IN EVEN-NUMBERED YEARS-- I CAN'T REMEMBER-- BUT I GET TINSEL ON THE TREE.
Stephen: YES.
AND IT'S-- WE NEGOTIATE IT, BUT I HAVE A FEELING WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS, IS EVERY YEAR, RITA CONVINCES ME THAT LAST YEAR WE HAD TINSEL ON THE TREE.  ( LAUGHTER ) SO WE-- WE DO NOT-- I THINK WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TINSEL ON THE TREE  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SHE'S COUNTING ON THIS SLIPPING.
AND I AM-- I-- I START FIGHTING, BUT THEN I "HONESTLY, HONE, I DON'T REMEMBER, OKAY, NO TINSEL ON THE TREE."
Stephen: THEN YOU HAVE A HAPPY CHRISTMAS. DO YOU PUT THE LIGHTS ON YOURSELF.
I DIDN'T THIS YEAR.
Stephen: DO YOU PUT THEM TOP TO THE BOTTOM OR BOTTOM TO THE TOP.
YOU HAVE TO START FROM THE TOP.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I SAY. MY WIFE SAYS GO BOTTOM TO THE TOP.
THAT'S NUTS. DO YOU HAVE MULTICOLORED LIGHTS OR WHITE LIGHTS.
Stephen: MULTICOLORED.
OH, INTEREST EXPWRG.
Stephen: WHAT! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I JUST THINK IT CUTS DOWN ON THE-- ON THE-- LOOK, I LIKE THEM TO FLASH. DO YOU HAVE THE FLASHING LIGHTS AT LEAST?
Stephen: THAT'S INSANE! FLASHING LIGHTS? WE'RE NOT LANDING A PLANE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE'RE TRYING TO GET SANTA TO STOP BY. I GUESS THAT WOULD BE--
IF YOU HAVE MULTICOLORED LIGHTS THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT COLOR THE DECORATIONS ARE, BLASE BLUE ONE WILL BE RIGHT FIXTURE TO A GOLD BULB, AND YOU'LL SAY IT'S A GOLD BULB, IT'S A BLUE BULB. I DON'T KNOW WHAT COLOR IT IS.
Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING YOU COORDINATE YOUR LIGHTS AND YOUR BULBS?
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.
Stephen: THEY HAVE MEDICINE FOR THAT NOW!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK, IF YOU WANT--
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BEAUTY OF A SYMMETRICALLY DESIGNED AND DECORATED CHRISTMAS TREERK GET OFF MY SHOW.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND!
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
Stephen: SORRY, IT JUST-- YOU HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY. AND AS WELL YOU SHOULD. GOLDEN GLOBE NOD YESTERDAY. GOLDEN GLOBE, CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND YOU HAVE THE OSCARS, YOU HAVE THE EMMIES, YOU HAVE THE GRAMMYS, YOU HAVE THE EVERYTHING. YOU HAVE MAYBE THE CLASSIEST SOUNDING, THE MOST HIGH-STATUS AWARD I CAN IMAGINE-- AND YOU ALREADY HAVE THE KENNEDY CENTERS AWARD, THE RAINBOW SUSPUNDERS. BUT YOU GOT THIS YESTERDAY-- CAN YOU EXPLAIN?
THIS IS-- THIS IS GIVEN OUT BY THE NATIONAL...
Stephen: ARCHIVES.
ARCHIVES FOUNDATION.
Stephen: YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO GAVE IT TO YOU!
TO ME IT WAS DINNER WITH KEN BURNS. THAT WAS DOCUMENTARI DOCUMENTARI BURNS. WE HAD A GREAT DINNER, BUT THE TRUE GREAT THING ABOUT IT-- IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO WASHINGTON, D.C., YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE IT, IF YOU GO TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES BUILDING THEY HAVE A FANTASTIC ARRAY OF ARTIFACTS AND DOCUMENTS THAT YOU REALLY, REALLY QUITE CAN'T BELIEVE. INCLUDING THE CONSTITUTION-- NOT THAT. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE THE ACTUAL-- LIKE, THIS WAS WRITTEN DOWN INK ON PARCHMENT, CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: WOW.
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB IN OUR NATION, I BELIEVE, IS ONE OF THE TWO OUT-OF-SHAPE BORED COPS WHO STAND RIGHT NEXT TO THAT.  ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THEY STAND THERE ALL DAY... YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING? THEY'RE PRESERVING, PROTECTING, AND DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY HAVE DONE A HELL OF A JOB!
Stephen: WOW.
BECAUSE --
Stephen: DO YOU GET TO TOUCH IT OR ANYTHING?
IT'S BEHIND GLASS. YOU CAN LEAN OVER IT. AND THEY DON'T EVEN ALLOW PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT. YOU HAVE TO BUY A $60 REPLICA OF THE GIFT SHOP IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE AS AN AMERICAN.
StepheWE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO FORM A--
TO PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, DO HEREBY-- GUARANTEE THESE-- ASSURE THESE --
Stephen: FOR OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY TO HEREBY ORDAIN AND DECLARE--
ESTABLISH AS PRESIDENT-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT WAS THE FIRST DRAFT. THAT WAS THE FIRST DRAFT.
WERE YOU READING THE SAME CONSTITUTION THAT I WAS?
Stephen: YEAH.
OR WERE YOU DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE MAGNA CARTA? YOU TELL ME.
Stephen: MY LAT SIN PRETTY GOOD.
UNDERSTAND, THIS IS THE ARCHIVE. THEY HAVE THE RECORDES OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED IN AMERICA. AND WHILE I WAS THERE, THEY PULLED THIS OUT FOR ME --
Stephen: THIS IS FANTASTIC.
THIS ALMOST MADE ME CRY.
Stephen: WHO IS THIS GENTLEMAN?
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS? MY DAD, ON HIS 18th BIRTHDAY 1942. THAT IS HIMSELF JOINING THE NAVY JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER PEARL HARBOR. HE JOINED THE NAVY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OR AS-- OR AS HE IS KNOWN IN THE FAMILY AS "OLD 779159." THAT'S WHAT OUR NICKNAME WAS FOR HIM.
Stephen: HE LOOKS EYE GOTTA SAY, HE LOOKS TOUGH.
I HAD NO IDEA MY DAD WAS AS BAD-ASS AS HE WAS. WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU MESS WITH THAT GUY?
Stephen: NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: THIS IS HOW WE WON THE WAR.
THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST PUBLISHED THAT PICTURE IN 1942 AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO GO TO IWO JIMA.
Stephen: HEROIC, HEROIC UNIBROW.  ( LAUGHTER ).
CAN WE SEE IT UP CLOSE? CAN WE SEE A SHOT.
Stephen: LOOK AT THAT.
I GUESS SO.
Stephen: I ASSUME YOU PLUCK.
ACTUALLY, PEOPLE PLUCK FOR ME.
Stephen: YOU'RE TOM HANKS, OF COURSE, YOU ARE.
I HAVE A STAFF. MY CRACK STAFF.

NOW, ARE YOU STARRING IN A WONDERFUL MOVIE A STEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIE WITH MERYL STREEP AND TOM HANKS CALLED "THE POST." IT'S ABOUT "THE POST" AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES," RACING TO PUBLISH THE PENTAGON PAPERS.
IN ALL FAIRNESS AND THE HISTORICAL RECORD, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BROKE THE STORY, THEY PUT THIS TOP-SECRET STUDY. THEY HAD THE PAPERS AND THEY PUT IT-- THEY RAN IT I THINK A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ENJOINED THEM, CONJOINED THEM-- ENJOINED THEM. STOPPED THEM FROM PUBLISHING THIS-- THIS REPORT THAT HAD BEEN AROUND AN AWFUL LOT, ABOUT THE HISTORY-- AMERICA'S HISTORY RECORD IN VIETNAM.
Stephen: AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS THE RECORD SHOWS THAT--
EVERY SINGLE PERSON SAID WE SHOULD NOT BE THERE.
Stephen: EVER-- EISENHOWER, KENNEDY, JOHNSON.
THEY ALL SAID THE WAR IS NOT UNWINNABLE. WE SHOULD NOT BE THERE, AND YET WE KEPT BEING THERE. BY THE TIME 1970 ROLLED AROUND, 30,000, 40,000 TROOPS HAD ALREADY BEEN KILLED, NEVER MIND COUNTLESS VIETNAMESE. IT WAS ACTUALLY ALREADY FIVE YEARS OLD, ROBERT MACK NAMARA, THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, COMMISSIONED IT, AND IT GOT OUT. AND BECAUSE OF-- IT'S REALLY THE WEEK-- WHEN KATHERINE GRAHAM BECAME KATHERINE GRAHAM, AND BEN BRADLEE --
Stephen: WHO YOU PLAY.
WHO I PLAY. IT'S FUNNY, THOUGH, "THE WASHINGTON POST" AT THE TIME, CERTAINLY WANTED TO COMPETE WITH THE "NEW YORK TIMES" ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, BUT THEY ALSO WANTED TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PAPER IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WHICH WAS CALLED "THE WASHINGTON STAR." THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE PAPER IN D.C. AT THE TIME. AND WHERE IS "THE WASHINGTON STAR" NOW, MY FRIEND IS IT'S ON THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IN THIS SCENE, "THE WASHINGTON POST," WHO WAS BEATEN--
YOU HAVE A SCENE?
Stephen: WE HAVE A SCENE. WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE. I BELIEVE IT'S AFTER "THE WASHINGTON POST" HAS ACQUIRED A LARGE PORTION OF "THE PENTAGON PAPERS" DIRECTLY FROM DANIEL ELLSBERG, WHO IS THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN A MARINE, WORKED FOR THE RAND CORPORATION, AND HAD STOLEN IT FROM THE RAND CORPORATION.
HE HAD SPIRITED IT AWAY FROM THE RAND CORPORATION. THE PROBLEM WAS IS THAT IF THEY RAN-- IF "THE WASHINGTON POST" RAN THE STORY, THEY COULD ALL BE FOUND GUILTY OF TREASON AND THEY COULD ALL HAVE GONE TO JAIL.
Stephen: AND KATHERINE GRAHAM COULD LOSE "THE WASHINGTON POST."
AND HER FROOEM, AMONG OTHER THINGS.
BEN, HOW ARE WE SPEZZED TO COMB THROUGH 4,000 PAPERS.
WE'VE GOT LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS.
HEY, HEY, THE LAST SIX YEARS WE'VE BEEN PLAYING CATCH-UP, AND NOW THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO, BY THE WAY, HAS TAKEN (BLEEP) ALL OVER THE FIRST AMENDMENT, WE HAVE THE GOODS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMPETITION. THERE'S DOZENS OF STORIES IN HERE. "THE TIMES" HAS BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE. WE HAVE 10 HOURS TILL THE DEADLINE, SO WE DIG IN.
Stephen: "WE DIG IN."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE WAS LIKE A MOLD OF A NEWSMAN. HE WAS LIKE A MODEL OF A NEWSMAN, LIKE A LOT OF--
OH, HE LIVED AND DIED FOR IT. BEN BRADLEE-- THERE WAS A GREAT, THERE WAS ALL SORT OF-- ACTUALLY, I MET THE MAN. I HAD DINNER WITH HIM. AND HE WAS JUST LIKE THAT. HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA MAKE SURE-- IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WRONG, YOU GOTTA EAT IT FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS!"

CAN I SAY YOU MEAN MERRILL "HIGH MAINTENANCE" STREEP.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? REALLY? YEAH? DIVA?
LOOK, THE SHOES ALONE, MAN, THE BIG DEAL-- NO, I-- I AM SO-- I AM SO JOKING. SHE'S-- SHE'S FABULOUS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S SCARY ABOUT MERRILL? SHE COMES IN AND DOES IT JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES, YOU KNOW. YOU'RE EXPECTING FRENCH HORNS BEFORE SHE ENTERS THE STAGE. YOU EXPECT A GUY IN LIVERY TO COME OUT, "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE ACTRESS KNOWN AS MERYL STREEP." AND THEN DA-DA-DA! LITTLE FLAGS HANGING DOWN. AND SHE COMES IN AND WAVES TO THE CREW THE WAY THE ROYALS USED TO, YOU KNOW. SHE DOESN'T GO LIKE THIS. SHE KIND OF LIKE WAVES LIKE, "HELLO, HELLO. SHALL WE RUN THE SCENE? SHALL WE RUN THE SCENE?" SHE WAS MAD AT ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T HER HER THAT STEPHEN DOESN'T REHEARSE.
Stephen: SPIELBERG DOESN'T REHEARSE?
HE DOESN'T REHEARSE.
Stephen: WHY?
SHE HEE JUST WANTS TO-- HE WANTS TO FIGURE IT OUT AS HE GOES ALONG. HE SAYS, "I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO SHOOT THE SCENE. I NEED YOU GUYS TO HELP ME. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS? AND I SAY, "YES, STEPHEN, AS A MATTER OF FACT I I DO. I THINK I'LL BE SITTING HERE LIKE THIS." AND I DO THE WHOLE SCENE. NOW HE'S A VERY-- HE'S ALMOST LIKE A GUERRILLA FILMMAKER. HE HAS THE SET AND HE HAS THE SPACE AND HE WANTS TO FILL IT UP AS SOMETHING HE HASN'T IMAGINED BEFORE. I DON'T MEAN THAT HE IS NOT PREPARED. HE'S THE MOST PREPARED MAN IN THE WORLD. BOB OWEN, KIRK, KERI-- A MURDERERS' ROW.
Stephen: IF YOU WORK ON A SPIELBERG FILM, EVERYBODY IS GOOD. THEY SHOW UP-- HE'S NOT GOING TO HIRE SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T GOOD.
HE MAKES THIS THING WHERE THERE'S A GUY WHOSE JOB-- ACCORDING TO AS HE KNOWS IT-- HE'S GOING TO DELIVER A SHOE BOX, AND HE'S GOING TO SAY, I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING." THAT'S THE ONLY LINE HE HAS IN THE SCRIPT, "I THINK I HAVE SOMETHING." WELL, THE FELLOW THAT DID IT, WE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING A SCENE ABOUT US-- THE CAST TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THE PAPER TOGETHER. WE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL ABOUT US. AND THEN WE STARTED SHOOTI SHOOT STEPHEN SAID, "OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE JUST GOING TO BE OVER IN YOUR OFFICE. YOU'LL BE SAYING YOUR LINES THERE." AND WE THOUGHT THEY'LL COVER US AND GET BIG CLOSE-UPS OF ME, AND BOB ODEN KIRK-- IT TURNED UP ON THE THE CAMERA WAS FOLLOWING A GUY WITH A SHOE BOX. HE'S THE STAR OF THE SCENE NOW BECAUSE THE SHOE BOX HOLDS 200 PAGES OF "THE PENTAGON PAPERS." AND THIS WAS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. SO I THOUGHT THE SCENE WAS ABOUT BEN BRADLEE!  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND IT WAS INSTEAD "GUY WITH SHOE BOX."  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. YOU'LL THINK-- YOU THINK YOU'RE JUST A GUY IN A MOVIE, AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW STEPHEN WILL SAY, "HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO." IT TURNS OUT TO BE GREAT-- I WISH I KNEW THE GUY'S NAME. BUT I DON'T LEARN ANYBODY'S NAPE IN THE COURSE OF MOVIES.
Stephen, OF COURSE,.
IT'S ALL "SKIPPER AND BUDDY AND CAPTAIN." AND IF I DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES IT'S ALWAYS, "THERE YOU ARE! THERE YOU ARE."  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE TOM HANKS, EVERYBODY.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. THAT'S TOM HAIFNGS. WE HAVE A NEW BOCH HERE BY TOM HANKS CALLED "UNCOMMON TYPE." SOME STORIES. I DID NOT KNOW YOU SHORT STORIES.
I DID THERE.
Stephen: 17 SHORT STORIES.
I HAD-- I HAD A STORY PUBLISHED IN 2014, AND THEY CALLED UP AND THEY SAID, "YOU GOT ANY MORE IN YET?" AND I SAID, "WELL, HOW MANY?" THEY SAID MEEH, 15." "15! HOW LONG DO THEY HAVE TO BE?" "HOWEVER LONG THEY ARE." AND MY QUESTION WAS, "IS THERE ANY MONEY TO BE MADE IN SHORT STORIES? AND THEY SAID, "YEAH, QUITE A BIT." AND IT'S-- IT'S BEEN ON-- I MUST SAY, IT'S BEEN ON THE BESTSALER LIST FOR A WHILE.
Stephen: VERY NICE.
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AND I HAVE MADE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A NEW SET OF SNOW TIRES.
Stephen: NOT BAD. NOT BAD.
SO IT'S DAY JOB-- NO, IT WAS REALLY-- IT WAS WONDERFUL AND FUN TO MAKE.
Stephen: THE DEDICATION, "FOR RITA AND ALL THE KIDS, BECAUSE OF NORAH."
YES. ON "SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE" I MET NORAH, AND I WAS-- I WAS-- I WAS CLOCK A LOT OF THEM OVER THE LEFT FIELD FENCE THERE. I WAS DOING PRETTY GOOD IN THE OLD CAREER-WISE THING.
Stephen: YOU GOT A NECKLACE.
DI. I SAID I WAS A BIG SHOT AND PEOPLE SHOULD FEAR ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T. SO NORAH HAD DIRECTED ONE MOVIE THEY ACTUALLY LIKED, AND WE WERE-- WE MET, YOU KNOW, AND I MET NORAH, AND SHE HAD WRITTEN THE SCREEN PLAY WITH HER SISTER, DEALIA. AND I SAID THINGS LIKE, IT'S CUTE. IT'S A CUTE SCREEN PLAY. I LIKE IT, I LIKE IT. I COULD SEE-- I COULD SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS. YEAH, I COULD SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR. THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH IT." AND SHE SAID, "WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS WITH IT?" AND I SAID, "I'LL SHARE THEM WITH YOU." WE STARTED WORKING ON IT, AND SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT COLLABORATOR. THERE WAS ONE-- THERE WAS ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A THING FOR THE SCRIPT.
AND SAID, "DEALIA, NORAH, YOU DON'T KNOW SQUAT ABOUT BEING A MAN!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHAT I MEANT WAS BEING A FATHER. THEY HAD WRITTEN THIS SCENE WHERE THE FATHER WAS GOING TO GO OFF FOR EYE WEEKEND WITH A LADY THAT HE MET. AND THE SON DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GO BECAUSE HE WANTED HER-- HIM TO STAY AND TALK TO THE LADY ON THE RADIO.
Stephen: WE'VE ALL SEEN THE MOVIE.  ( LAUGHTER ).
ANYWAY. SO, SO --
Stephen: IT'S ON RIGHT NOW ON TBS.
MIGHT BE ON THE GRID. SO I SAY THE, "LOOK, NO GUY'S-- GUYS, GUYS, GUYS NO MAN DOES THAT! NO FATHER DOES THAT! NO WAY WOULD THEY DO THAT! "WHAT WOULD A FATHER DO?" I SAID I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE FATHER WOULD DO. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND. I'M GOING OUT WITH CARLA. YOU KNOW WHY, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GET LAID THIS WEEKEND YOU SQUIRT. I'VE ONLY BEEN LAID EIGHT TIMES." AND THEY SAYS, "WELL, LET'S PUT THAT IN THE MOVIE." AND THEY SORT OF DID. WHEN IT ALL CAME OUT AND A FEW OTHER BEATS LIKE THAT. AND I SAID TO NORAH, "THAT REALLY WORKED." SHE SAID, "YOU WROTE THAT." I SAID, "I COMPLAINED DURING REHEARSALS." SHE SAID, "THAT'S WHAT IT IS. YOU COME UP WITH THINGS, AND YOU DIDN'T TYPE IT BUT YOU ACTUALLY WROTE IT."
Stephen: THAT'S WHERE IT AGAIN.
SHE AND I FROM THAT MOMENT ON, WE EXCHANGED EVERYTHING WE WERE SORT OF WORKING ON AND GOING BACK AND FORTH SAYING THIS IS A THING. I SENT HER A PIECE I HAD WRITTEN ON MY MAKEUP MAN THAT RAN IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES," AND I SAID, "IS THIS-- IS THIS ANYTHING?" AND SHE SAID, "YES, IT IS, BUT REMEMBER, VOICE, VOICE, VOICE, VOICE, VOICE." WHICH MEANS-- SHE SAW WHAT I WAS GOING FOR. IT WAS KIND THEREOF, BUT IT HAD NO VOICE. AND SHE KNEW HOW-- THAT A WRITER NEEDS TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING MORE THAN-- YOU GOTTA HAVE-- YOU GOTTA HAVE A CADENCE. YOU GOTTA HAVE A PERCUSSION. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A MELODY TO YOUR VOICE THAT I DID NOT HAVE. I WAS JUST WRITING DOWN SOME THINGS. SO SHE-- SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS A WRITER LONG BEFORE I THOUGHT SUCH A THING WOULD BE POSSIBLE, SO THE BOOK IS FOR HER.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: GREAT.

YES.
Stephen: THE NAME OF THE SHOW IS?
"LIVE ON MSNBC WITH KATY TUR."
Stephen: THERE IT IS, KEEP IT SIMPLE. I WATCH IT EVERY DAY BECAUSE THAT'S THE PERIOD OF TIME I'M PREPARING TO COME DOWN HERE.
AND I GIVE YOU TIP S.
Stephen:  I HAVE YOU ON IN THE BACKGROUND. THE ALABAMA SENATE RACE WAS TODAY. AND, AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YET, BECAUSE IT'S TOO EARLY. WE'RE PRETAPING THIS INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW. YOU FOLLOWED TRUMP FOR 500 DAYS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
510.
Stephen: 510 DAYS. AND HE HAD HIS OWN SHARE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDALS. YOU TALKED TO THE VOTERS WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP AFTER THE "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE CAME OUT, WHO STILL SUPPORTED HIM.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THESE KIND OF ACCUSATIONS WHICH IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE DESTROYED A CANDIDATE HAVEN'T DESTROYED DONALD TRUMP, AND MAY NOT HAVE DESTROYED ROY MOORE? WHY DON'T VOTERS CARE?
IT IS TRIBALISM AT ITS WORST. IT'S PEOPLE JUST DECIDING, "I LIKE THIS PERSON. I WANT HIM IN OFFICE. I DON'T CARE WHAT HE DID. I'M GOING TO FIND ANY EXCUSE I CAN TO-- TO EXCUSE HIS BEHAVIOR." I WAS TALKING TO A LADY OUTSIDE OF A RALLY IN FLORIDA, AND THIS NICE OLDER WOMAN-- SHE WAS WEARING A FLOWERY DRESS, GRANDMOTHER-- AND ONE LONE PROTESTER WAS PLAYING THE "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE ON REPEAT. "GRAB THEM BY THE-- GRAB THEM BY THE--" AND I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?" AND SHE SAID, "WHO HASN'T SAID THAT?" AND I SAID, "GOSH, I HAVEN'T SAID THAT." AND SHE GOT VERY CONDESCENDING. "OH, WELL AREN'T YOU SO-- SO SPECIAL." AND I SAID, "WELL, HAVE YOU SAID IT?" AND SHE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I HAD ASKED THE HER IF SHE KILLED A PUPPY. "NO, OF COURSE, I HAVEN'T SAID IT," AND SHE WALKED THROUGH. IT UNDERSCORES THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO GIVE HIM ANY EXCUSE BECAUSE THEY JUST LIKED HIM. THEY WERE ENTERTAINED BY HIM. THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE SYSTEM. THEY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE A CHAMPION OF THEIR VALUES-- WHATEVER IT WAS.
Stephen: SURE.
AND THAT'S WHY ROY MOORE IS ENJOYING SOME OF THE SAME SUPPORT IN ALABAMA-- NOT, YOU KNOW, STATEWIDE, BUT A LOT OF IT.
Stephen: WELL, THE OLD SAW, THE APHORISM NOW MADE FAMOUS, YOU KNOW, BY THE 1992 CAMPAIGN IS THAT "IT'S THE ECONOMY STUPID." ARE THESE PEOPLE ALL VOTING ON ECONOMIC INTERESTS ESSENTIALLY, AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE DUMB TO RUN ON THINGS LIKE THESE CHARACTER ISSUES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM?
THAT'S WHAT STEVE BANNON SAYS. THAT'S HIS WHOLE IDEA --
Stephen: STEVE AND I ARE VERY CLOSE.
I HEARD. HE SAID SO LONG AS THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING ON IDENTITY POLITICS, WE'RE GOING TO WIN, BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY. AND THAT DID RESONATE WITH A LOT OF DONALD TRUMP VOTERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER MIDWEST, WHERE HE BROKE DOWN THAT BLUE WALL. SO THERE IS AN ASPECT OF THAT, ABSOLUTELY. BUT IT WAS ALSO SOME VOTER APATHY DURING 20 16. IT WAS A DISLIKE FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THE COUNTRY WAS GOING, AS IN THE WAY THE COUNTRY LOOKED, AS IN WHO THE PRESIDENT WAS IN 2008 TO 2016.
Stephen: AS IN-- WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE PARTICULARLY?
DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSION.
Stephen: WHAT COLOR CRAYON WOULD I USE TO DRAW THAT CONCLUSION?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DON'T-- DON'T PAINT WITH A BROAD BRUSH. BUT THERE WAS DEFINITELY A LOT OF THAT.
Stephen: WELL, AGAIN, 510 DAYS ON THE ROAD WITH DONALD TRUMP. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A BOOK OF THAT EXPERIENCE CALLED "UNBELIEVABLE:  MY FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE CRAZIEST CAMPAIGN IN AMERICAN HISTORY."
THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
Stephen: IT IS. SO WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE IN THE FRONT ROW OR EVEN THE BACK ROW-- BECAUSE THE PRESS WAS OFTEN IN THE BACK ROW AT THESE RALLIES, AND HE WOULD USE YOU GUYS--
AS PROPS.
Stephen: AS PROPS.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU WERE THE BOGEYMAN AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM.
WE WERE ACTUALLY IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. WE WOULD GO TO THESE ARENAS, AND THERE WOULD BE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AROUND US, UP IN THE STANDS, AND WE WOULD BE DEAD CENTER IN THE ROOM, ALMOST LIKE A ROMAN COLISEUM. AND DONALD TRUMP AT ONE POINT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN, HOW MUCH HE ADMIRED HIM, AND HE HAD BEEN ASKED ABOUT VAD PIRMUTEIN KILLING JOURNALISTS-- AND HE WAVED IT WAY, "I WOULD NEVER KILL JOURNALISTS WELL, MAYBE, I'M NOT SURE, BUT I REALLY HATE THEM." AND WE'RE, MEANWHILE, IN THE CENTER OF THIS ARENA, WITH 500,000 PEOPLE AROUND US AND TURN ON US AND BOO AND LAUGH, LAUGH AT THE IDEA OF US GETTING MURDERED. SO IT WAS SURREAL. IT WAS BIZARRE. IT WAS SCARY. IT WAS DISHEARTENING, AND IT WAS ALSO JUST COMPLETELY THRILLING BECAUSE NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY OR EVEN THE WORLD HAD SEEN ANYTHING QIEK QOOIT LIKE THIS. AND I GOT TO SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY UP CLOSE FOR THE GOOD, BAD, AND THE UGLY.
Stephen: NOW, YOU'VE SAID THAT EVERYBODY COVERING TRUMP NEEDS TO TONE THE-- RHYMES WITH A DUCK-- DOWN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? WITH YDO PEOPLE NEED TO CALM DOWN COVERING HIM?
I THINK IF YOU TAKE EVERYTHING AT A-- IF SCREWER SCREAMING ABOUT EVERYTHING, AND EVERYTHING IS THE END OF THE WORLD-- AND A LOT OF IT IS VERY, VERY SERIOUS. I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, WITH THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
Stephen: POSSIBLE NUCLEAR WAR WITH NORTH KOREA.
POSSIBLE NUCLEAR WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, THANK YOU FOR REMIND MEEG. I THINK THOSE ARE VERY SERIOUS THINGS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT WE GET BREATHLESS ABOUT, BECAUSE IF YOU GET BREATHLESS ABOUT EVERYTHING, EVEN A RIDICULOUS TWEET, PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY AND YOU GIVE FODDER TO THE IDEA THE MEDIA IS ALL OUT TO GET DONALD TRUMP AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY REASON TO CRITICIZE HIM, I THINK THAT'S A BAD IDEA. I DON'T THINK IT'S HEALTHY. SO THAT'S WHY I SAY TONE DOWN. I DON'T MEAN IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND NUCLEAR WAR BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S TERRIFYING.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CRITICIZE PRESIDENT TRUMP.
NO, WE'RE NOT.
Stephen: SO SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT HIM.
HISITIZE ARE VERY LONG.
Stephen: THEY DIDN'T HEAR YOU. WHAT IS IT?
HIS TIES ARE VERY LONG.
Stephen: YES, HE'S WELL ENDOWED IN THAT AREA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: "UNBELIEVABLE" IS OUT NOW. YOU CAN CATCH KATY TUR ON MSNBC LIVE." LATE SHOW." PLEASE TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE NICK JONAS, DENNIS RODMAN, AND MUSICAL GUEST JEEZY, FEATURING TORY LAYNEZ. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, H  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
