HE DID LEAVE THIS STATEMENT. I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY  ACTIONS. AND THEN HE TRACED THE OUTLINE  OF HIS PENIS ADDING THE PHRASE,  SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE. JOINING ME IS MY NEW CO HOST. DARRYL FARBLA.
EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE  USA TEAM
I SINCERELY REGRET MY  ACTIONS.
APPARENTLY IN THE 11 SECONDS  DARRYL WAS PART OF THE TEAM, HE  MANAGED TO HARASS EVERYONE.
HE DID LEAVE A STATEMENT
I'M SORRY, AND THEN HE ALSO  TRACED HIS PENIS.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH  STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,  STEVEN WELCOMES KATE WINSLET. LAURA BONANTE. FEATURING JOHN BAPTISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN  THEATER IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT. ♪ ♪. ♪ ♪. ♪ ♪. >
WHAT'S GOING ON GUYS? NICE TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU ALL. HEY, WELCOME TO LATE SHOW. NICE. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. MY GOSH. WOW. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT A LOVELY CROWD. WELCOME. ONE AND ALL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TO THE  LATE SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST,  STEPHEN COLBERT. NOW, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I LOVE MY  JOB. UNLIKE SECRETARY OF STATE AND  MAN WITH RESTING KILL ME FACE,  REX TILLERSON. BUT TILLERSON'S LONG NIGHTMARE  OF NATIONAL SERVICE MAY SOON BE  OVER. TODAY WE LEARNED THE WHITE HOUSE HAS A PLAN TO FORCE OUT  SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON. YES, IT'S A COMPLICATED PLAN. THAT INVOLVES TELLING HIM HE CAN GO AND THEN PLASTERING OVER THE  WRECKED SHAPE HOLE IN HIS OFFICE WALL. TILLERSON WAS ALWAYS KIND OF AN  UNUSUAL PICK FOR SECRETARY OF  STATE. HE WAS A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE OIL  EXECUTIVE WITH NO DIPLOMATIC  EXPERIENCE. THOUGH HE WASN'T AFRAID TO STAND UP TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST  DANGEROUSLY UNHINGED LEADERS, HE CALLED ONE OF THEM A MORON. HE HAS CLEARLY CLASHED WITH  PRESIDENT TRUMP AT ONE POINT HE  HE HAS CLEARLY CLASHED WITH  PRESIDENT TRUMP AT ONE POINT HE  PROPOSED AN IQ FACE-OFF WITH  TILLERSON
MEET AT DAWN, BRING A LOADED  NUMBER TWO PENCIL. THIS IS IMPORTANT. GOLF RULES, LOW SCORE WINS. OK? AND BOOM. LIKE THAT. LIKE THAT. BUT TILLERSON IS FOR THE READY  TO LEAVE JUST YET. ACCORDING TO REPORTS, HE WAS  INTENT TON FINISHING OUT THE  YEAR TO RETAIN WHATEVER DIGNITY  HE COULD. DEAR SANTA, ALL I WANT IS THE  DIGNITY TO WORK FOR A MORON  UNTIL CHRISTMAS. AND MORE DELICIOUS OIL. THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF SIGNS  THAT TILLERSON IS NOT HAPPY. THIS IS IS WHAT HE SAID WHILE  LOOKING AT A STATUE IN  SWITZERLAN SWITZERLAND.
SOME DAYS I FEEL LIKE I NEED  TO DO THAT.
AG! AG! YEAH. YEAH. THIS DOES FEEL PRETTY GOOD. WE DIDN'T TIME HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE ME TO STAND UP. DID WE? THE WHITE HOUSE DENIED THAT  TILLERSON IS ON THE WAY OUT. THIS AFTERNOON IN AN APPEARANCE  WITH THE CROWN PRINCE. THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS  STRONG CONFIDENCE IN THE  SECRETAR SECRETARY.
REX IS HERE.
YEAH, HE'S FIRED. DARLING ARE WE GETTING DIVORCED?
YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE STILL HERE. BUT STILL, STILL,. >
IT'S REFRESHING FOR A  POWERFUL MOON MAN BEING FIRED  FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN  FLASHING HIS JUNK. HE APPARENTLY PLANS TO REPLACE  TILLERSON WITH MIKE POMPEY,  KUSHNER WITH JEFF SESSIONS AND  SESSIONS WITH A BUTTON THAT  FIRES ROBERT MUELLER. MEANWHILE, THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION IS VEERING  DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO  ACCOMPLISHMENT. BECAUSE THE GOP TAX BILL LOOKS  LIKE IT WILL PASS. YES. AFTER MONTHS OF -- I KNOW, BUT  AFTER MONTHS OF CLENCHING AND  PUSHING LOOKS LIKE THE  REPUBLICANS MAY FINALLY PINCH  OUT A STEAMING LOAF OF  LEGISLATION. THE NONPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL  BUDGET OFFICE FOUND THE SENATE  VERSION OF THESE CUTS WOULD  CREATE A $1.4 TRILLION HOLE IN  THE BUDGET. I DON'T EVEN CUT EVERYONE'S  TAXES EQUALLY. BY 2027, PEOPLE MAKING 40 TO  $50,000 A YEAR WILL PAY A  COMBINED 5.3 BILLION MORE IN  TAXES WHILE THE GROUP EARNING 1  MILLION OR MORE WILL GET A 5.8  BILLION DOLLAR CUT. DON'T WORRY, THAT WILL TRICKLE  DOWN TO THE RICH WHEN THEY THROW THEIR MONEY IN THE AIR AND DANCE UNDERNEATH IT IN JOY. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY ENJOYABLE. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES A  LUCRATIVE BREAK FOR GOLF COURSE  OWNERS AND THOSE WHO OWN OR  LEASE PRIVATE PLANES PRIVATE  PLANES. I PUT ON MY PANTS THE SAME WAY  YOU DO, ONE BUTLER AT A TIME. YESTERDAY TRUMP CLAIMED THE BILL WAS NOT GOOD FOR HIM
I THINK MY ACCOUNTANTS ARE  GOING CRAZY. THIS WILL COST ME A FORTUNE. BELIEVE ME.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. BECAUSE TRUTH IS TRUMP COULD  SAVE MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS UNDER HIS NEW PLAN. WITH THAT KIND OF CASH, HE CAN  QUIT THAT DEAD END GOVERNMENT  JOB. ONE FORMER CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER PUT IT BEST WHEN HE SAID THIS  BILL IS NOT AIMED AT GROWTH THE  MIDDLE CLASS. IT IS AT EVERY TURN CAREFULLY  ENGINEERED TO DELIVER A KISS TO  THE DONOR CLASS AND JUDGING BY  THE BILL, THEY DIDN'T KISS THEM  ON THE MOUTH. AND.
UGH!
I SPEAK OF THE BUT HOLE. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS  JAMMED IN THAT BILL THAT DON'T  HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TAXES  SUCH AS THE LIFTING OF A 1954  BAN ON POLITICAL ACTIVISM BY  CHURCHES. WHEN YOU'RE AT MASS THIS  CHRISTMAS, EXPECT TO SEE JESUS  WITH A NEW LOOK. WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT YESTERDAY  MATT LAUER WAS FIRED FROM THE  "TODAY" SHOW FOR SEXUAL  MISCONDUCT IS INCLUDING EXPOSING HIMSELF AND GIVING COLLEAGUES  SEX TOYS AS GIFTS. YOU DO NOT WANT MATT LAUER AS  YOUR SECRET SANTA BUT, NO, RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY. BUT THERE'S ONE MAN, THERE IS  ONE MAN, DON'T BOO ME, I DIDN'T  DO IT. THERE WAS ONE MAN WITH THE  COURAGE TO DEFEND MATT LAUER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTE OR, RIVERA WHO  TWEETED HIGHLY SKILLED AND  EMPATHETIC AND A REAL GENTLEMAN  TO MY FAMILY AND ME, NEWS IS A  FLIRTY BUSINESS, SEEMS LIKE  CURRENT EPIDEMIC OF #SEX  HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS MAY BE  CRIMINALIZING COURT SHIP. YES, MATT LAUER WASN'T SEXUALLY  HARASSING WOMEN, IT WAS GOOD OLD FASHION COURT SHIP. SEX TOY, MY LADY? A PUDDLE, A PUDDLE BEFORE YOUR  FEET. ALLOW ME TO LAY MY PENIS ACROSS  IT. SO YOU MAY PASS. FOR YOUR PLEASURE. WHAT HARK I HAVE BUNDLED MY BITS AND PIECES IN A CORSAGE. MAY I PIN INTER? HE KNOW THAT IS A GENTLEMAN  EXPOSING HIMSELF TO HER FATHER  FIRST, SIR, I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR  YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MY  PANTS. WE GOT GREAT SHOW. KATE WINSLET IS HERE. BUT I SIT DOWN WITH FIRST LADY  MILANIA TRUMP. STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪. >
GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND,  JOHN BAPTISE AND STAY HUMAN  RIGHT OVER THERE. JOHN. I NOTICE YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY  YOUNG BASIST JOINING THE BAND  IT'S YOUR FATHER, MICHAEL  BAPTISTE. GIVE IT UP FOR MICHAEL RIGHT  THERE. MICHAEL GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I KNOW WEEDS YOU LAST NIGHT. IS THERE ANY CHANCE COULD ICO  CONVINCE YOU TO STAY FOR FRIDAY  AS WELL? IS THAT POSSIBLE? YOU CAN STAY WITH ME. ALL RIGHT. WELL WELL. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH ON  IMMIGRANTS BUT IT HASN'T ALL  BEEN DEPORTATIONS. HE'S ALONGSIDE DETAINING SOME  FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR WILL. FOR INSTANCE, MILANIA. NOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT THE FIRST LADY IS HAPPY IN WASHINGTON, DC. JUST LOOK AT THIS RECENT TWEET  FROM HER COMMUNICATIONS  DIRECTOR. THE HOLIDAYS ARE UPON US, RIGHT  NOW, FLOTUS IS SEEING TO EVERY  LAST DETAIL AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT'S GREAT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK  AT THE PHOTO OF THE FESTIVE  HOLIDAY DECORATIONS, SHE TWEETED ALONG WITH IT. GA A A:  WHICH HOLIDAY IS THAT  FOR? ST. GAR LON'S FEAST OF HUMAN? COME CHILDREN YOUR CHRISTMAS  GUESTS ARE LEAR, THOSE PALE  YOUNG GIRLS WE ALL THOUGHT DIED  OF THE PLAGUE THEY'RE WAITING  FOR THEIR KISS IN THE HALL OF  ETERNAL SHADOW. BENEATH THE MISSING MISSILE TOE. SHE SHARED A VIDEO OF THAT SAME  HALLWAY LOOKING A LOT MORE  CHEERFUL WITH THE LIGHTS ON AS  WELL AS A BEAUTIFUL LOOK AT THE  WHITE HOUSE'S OFFICIAL CHRISTMAS TREE BUT THAT'S NOT ALL THE  FIRST LADY HAS TO DEAL WITH. SHE'S ONCE AGAIN GETTING FLACK  FROM TRUMP'S FIRST WIFE, IVANA  TRUMP. SHE WAS OUT PROMOTING HER NEW  MEMOIR
I HAVE THE DIRECT NUMBER TO  THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I NOT REALLY WANT TO CALL HIM THERE BECAUSE  MILANIA IS THERE I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY JEALOUS I'M BASICALLY  FIRST TRUMP WIFE, I'M FIRST  LADY.
YOUCH. MILANIA DIDN'T LIKE THAT TOO  MUCH. CLAPPING RIGHT BACK IN  STATEMENT. THERE'S CLEARLY NO SUBSTANCE TO  THE STATEMENT FROM AN EX-X, THIS IS ATTENTION SEEKING AND  SELF-SERVING NOISE. TO BE FAIR, ATTENTION SEEKING  AND SELF-SERVING NOISE IS THE  MOTTO IN THE TRUMP FAMILY. AND SOUNDS BETTER IN LATIN. AND JUST THIS WEEKEND, I IVANA  WAS AT IT AGAIN. SHE SAID THIS ON A TALK SHOW IN  IRELAND.
I MENTIONED THIS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU EARLIER ON YOU WERE THE FIRST LADY.
WELL, I SAID I'M FIRST TRUMP  LADY.
DO YOU THINK SHE'S DOING A  GOOD JOB AS FIRST LADY MILANIA
I THINK SHE'S TRYING HER  BEST.
MEOW. WITH ALL THIS GOING ON I FEEL  BAD FOR THE FIRST LADY I WANTED  TO GIVE HER EQUAL TIME TO  RESPOND. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE LATE  SHOW, FIRST LADY MILANIA TRUMP. MADAM FIRST LADY THANK YOU.
HELLO STEVEN, THANK YOU FOR  HAVING ME
I WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE THE  LATE SHOW IS YOUR HOME
CAN I MOVE IN HERE
IT'S JUST A SAYING, MADAM  FIRST LADY YOU'VE BEEN IN THE  NEWS A LOT. LET'S WITH IVANA TRUMP
THAT'S WHAT MY HUSBAND DID  BUT THEN HE MOVED ON.
SETTLE DOWN THERE. WERE YOU HURT BY IVANA'S  COMMENTS
THEY DID NOT AFFECT ME,  STEPHEN. I WANT MRS. TRUMP KNOW I HAVE  TREMENDOUS ADMIRATION OF RESPECT FOR I IVANKA
HER NAME IS IVANA.
I KNOW. BUT THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS  BULLYING. NO ONE SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO  CRUEL AND BASE LESS INSULTS. THAT'S WHY WHEN SHE GOES LOW, I  GO BYE, BITCH.
MAKE A NICE BUMPER STICKER. ACCORDING TO RECENT REPORTS, YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE FIRST  LADY. IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THAT
THIS IS A LIE, I'M HAPPY TO  BE FIRST LADY. LOOK AT ME BEING HAPPY.
I'M -- YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL  SMILE. OFF BEAUTIFUL SMILE. WELL, I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR, MADAM FIRST LADY BECAUSE SOUNDS LIKE  YOU'RE ONE WHO CONVINCED YOUR  HUSBAND TO JUMP INTO THE RACE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SOUNDS LIKE YOU TOLD HIM QUOTE  YOUR FRIENDS OF TIRED OF THIS  TRIP TEASE. IS THAT TRUE
YES, NO ONE CAN STAND HIS  STRIP TEASE. I USUALLY STOP WATCHING AROUND  THE TIME HE GETS HIS BELT BUCKLE TANGLED IN HIS GIANT TIE
YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY
YES. IN FACT, I WAS RECENTLY TREATED  WITH SPECIAL WHITE HOUSE BALLET  PERFORMANCE BY WONDERFUL  BALLERINAS, THERE I AM ALONE ON  MY STAIRCASE OF HAPPINESS,  ADMIRING THEIR FREEDOM OF  MOVEMENT. FLY AWAY LITTLE BIRDS. FLY AWAY.
THAT LOOKS LOVELY. AND WE SAW HOW MUCH CARE YOU PUT INTO DECORATING THE WHITE HOUSE  FOR CHRISTMAS
MORE PROOF OF MY HAPPINESS IS HOW MUCH I LOVE TO DECORATE. IT'S SO MERRY THE STRINGING OF  THE LIGHTS, THE BAKING OF THE  COOKIES AND SANTA CLAUS, SUCH AN INSPIRATION TO ME.
HOW SO?
WELL, IF YOU CAN COME DOWN A  CHIMNEY TO GO INTO A HOUSE, THEN YOU CAN GO UP A CHIMNEY TO GET  OUT OF A HOUSE. I HAVE GOTTEN ALL THE FAMILY  CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS AND TIED  THEM INTO A ROPE. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO  ALL A GOOD-BYE.
MILANIA TRUMP, EVERYBODY. STEVE MARTIN'S METEOR SHOWER ON  BROADWAY RIGHT NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KATE  WINSLET. >

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
I JUST 88 AN ALTOID SO IF I  HAVE THE
I HAD ONE BEFORE THE SHOW  EVERY NIGHT
THEY NORMALLY MAKE ME SNEEZE, WHEN YOU'VE HAD THREE CHILDREN  CAN BE A BIT OF A PROBLEM
I DON'T SNORT THEM
I DON'T EITHER, THEY JUST  MAKE ME SNEEZE. I DON'T KNOW WHY. ANYWAY I'M GOING TO SIP THE  WATER.
WE HAVE THE ROOM ABOUT AN  HOUR.
HELLO. HELLO
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. WE WERE TALKING BACK STAGE. I FELT LIKE I'VE MET YOU BEFORE. BUT
NO, WE'VE NEVER MET
JUST A FAN, I GUESS, EVEN  FROM WAY BACK IN THE DAY,  HEAVENLY CREATURES, WHICH WAS  YOUR FIRST MOVIE
THE FIRST -- YES.
24 YEARS AGO SOMETHING LIKE  THAT
SINCE I'M SUCH AN OLD LADY  NOW, IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO.
YOU WERE LITERAL AL TEENAGER  AT THE TIME
I WAS 17
HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT, IT'S WITH ONE OF MY FAVORITES  DIRECTORS PETER JACKSON
THE FILM WAS ABOUT TWO YOUNG  GIRLS, ONE WAS ENGLISH AND ONE  WAS FROM NEW SEE LAND, AND MY  CHARACTER WAS LIVING IN NEW SEE  LAND WITH HER FAMILY, THEY CAME  TO ENGLAND AND FOUND A CASTING  DIRECTOR IN THE U.K. TO FIND  SOMEONE WHO LOOKED SIMILAR TO  THE GIRL I ENDED UP PLAYING.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT 17?
I HAD
WERE YOU AN ACTRESS
I HAD FINISHED MY SCHOOL  EXAMS, AND YOU SEE, CONTRARY TO  WHAT PEOPLE OFTEN THINK ABOUT ME PEOPLE OFTEN THINK I MUST HAVE  ALL THESE, YOU KNOW, DIPLOMAS  AND THINGS AND RUBBER STAMPS  NEXT TO MY NAME AND CRESTS AND  THINGS AND TRAINING AND ALL  THIS, I LEFT SCHOOL AT 16 IS AND I WANT TO WORK IN A DELICATESSEN TO SAVE MONEY TO GET THE TRAIN  TO LONDON TO GO ON I WAS  ADDITIONS, SO I WAS WORKING IN A DELICATESSEN SAVING MONEY TO GO  TO LONDON TO GO ON I WAS  ADDITION
YOU WERE MAKING SANDWICH
I WAS MAKING SANDWICHES AND  I'D GO TO LONDON AND DO THE I  WAS ADDITIONS, IT WAS ABOUT  THREE MONTHS AFTER MY FIRST  AUDITION THEY CALLED ME BACK. AND THE PHONE RANG AND IT WAS  THE STRANGEST THING THERE WAS  SOMETHING ABOUT THE PHONE RANG I THOUGHT IT'S FOR ME AND THE MAN  WHO OWNED, KATE, PHONE FOR ME  NOW, AND I'M LITERALLY MAKING A  TURKEY SANDWICH. I'VE GOT TURKEY IN ONE HAND AND  MAYO IN THE OTHER AND I LOOK AT  THIS GUY AND I'M SO SORRY, I --  I -- I'M SO SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE  THIS SANDWICH FOR YOU ANYMORE. AND RAN TO THE TELEPHONE AND IT  WAS, I HAD THIS CHILD AGENT AND  I NEVER REALLY GOT ANY JOBS AT  ALL OR A AUDITIONS. AND SHE SAID WELL DONE YOU GOT  THE PART AND I HAD TO LEAVE WORK AND GO HOME. I GOT THE BUS AND WENT HOME AND  TOLD MY FAMILY
THIS WAS AN AGENTS FOR  CHILDREN, NOT A CHILD AGENT
IT WAS AN AGENT FOR CHILDREN
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
I KNOW THEY DO. THEY DO.
YOU TOOK THE BUS TO NEW Z  EALAND FROM THERE.
YES, I DID
DID YOUR FAMILY COME WITH YOU
NO, I WENT BY MYSELF AND IT  WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. I WAS QUITE -- I WAS PROBABLY  QUITE GROWN UP FOR MY AGE MORE  THAN PROBABLY MOST I THINK
WHAT LOVELILY PEOPLE TO GO  WORK FOR, PETER JACKSON
AND FRAN
I LOOK BACK NOW,  EXTRAORDINARY STORY, BUT THE  SCRIPT WAS SO INCREDIBLE AND  LOOKING BACK AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS SO MANY BOXES THAT I WAS  ABLE TO TAKE IN THAT ONE FIRST  MOVIE EXPERIENCE, I LEARNED SO  MUCH. AND SORT OF BECAME A TEMPLATE  FOR ME IN TERMS OF HOW I TRY AND APPLY MYSELF WHENEVER I'M IF YOU RECOLLECT FIGURING OUT A NEW  CHARACTER.
DID YOU LOVE NEW Z EALAND?
LOVED IT SO MUCH, I HAVE  FRIENDS AND FAMILY THERE AND I  KNOW YOU HAD A TRIP THERE, ISN'T IT THE MOST INCREDIBLE PLACE
YOU WANT TO STAY AND SAY HERE I WILL BE A MAN, THE WHOLE  COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD WAS JUST BORN MINUTES BEFORE
IT'S SO VERY BEAUTIFUL
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN  KILL YOU, NO PREDATORS
THEY TALK ABOUT THAT ALL THE  TIME. THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL KILL  YOU, GUYS AND IT'S TRUE.
YOU'VE BEEN BOTH IN HUGE  COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES, YOU KNOW,  LIKE TITANIC, COMING UP ON THE  20TH ANNIVERSARY RIGHT NOW.
CRAZY. SO STRANGE
SMALL ART HOUSE CRITICAL  HITS, HOW DO YOU MAKE THE  DECISION?
SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- THE  HONEST ANSWER IS I DON'T REALLY  KNOW HOW I MAKE THE DECISION.
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO
I JUST KIND OF GO ON  INSTINCTS
IT'S HOW THE TELEPHONE RING
HONESTLY IT CAN BE THE SOUND  OF THE TITLE. THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING. IT CAN BE THE WAY, YOU KNOW,  TITLE SITS ON THE FRONT, WOW,  THAT LOOKS GOOD. THE NAME OF THE CHARACTER, I'D  QUITE LIKE TO PLAY THAT  CHARACTER
YOU LITERALLY JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
NO, I DON'T, THERE'S LOTS OF  THINGS LIKE WHO THE DIRECTOR IS  GOING TO BE
WILL YOUR KIDS WEIGH IN
THEY GET VERY INVOLVED, MY  DAUGHTER IS 17 AND MY SON JOE IS ABOUT 14 AND THE LITTLE ONE  THERE IS NEARLY FOUR BUT THEY DO NOW THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT OLDER  AND WE SIT DOWN WE HAVE A BIG  FAMILY POW WOW. MOM READ THE SCRIPT. WOULD LOVE TO DO IT
DO YOU HAVE TO SAY DESCRIBE  IT
I HAVE TO DESCRIBE THE WHOLE  STORY AND THEY SAY YEAH, YOU  SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THAT OR  THEY WILL SAY WELL, I DON'T  KNOW, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW  SORT OF
MY MIDDLE SON SORT OF SOUNDS  LIKE YOU KIND OF PLAYED THAT  ROLE BEFORE, MOM, AND I'LL BE  LIKE, DAMN IT, HE'S RIGHT. FORGET IT.
YOU'RE DOING A NEW AVATAR
YES, WITH AVATAR, DON'T EVEN  READ THE SCRIPT, OBVIOUSLY, YES. WHY, OK. IT'S NOT EVEN A CONVERSATION. IT'S NOT -- JUST NOT UP FOR  DISCUSSION, YOU HAVE TO DO IT.
DID THEY EVEN ASK, YOU KNOW,  ARE YOU ONE OF THE BIG BLUE  CREATURES
I DON'T ASK ANY
ARE YOU ONE OF THE BIG BLUE
I DON'T THINK I'M ALLOWED TO  SAY
THEY SAID YOU CAN SAY. THE GUY SAID YOU CAN SAY. ARE YOU A BIG BLUE CREATURE? HE WOULD KNOW.
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SAY.
YOU'RE A BIG BLUE CREATURE  THEN, IF YOU CAN'T SAY THEN YOU  ARE BECAUSE IF YOU SAY I'M A  HUMAN, THEN YOU COULD JUST BE  LIKE DOING
MY CHARACTER IS SO FANTASTIC. AND I'M SO EXCITED.
GOOD
AND I SHOULD CAN'T TELL YOU  ANYTHING ELSE. AN I'M SO SORRY.
IS THAT GOING TO SHOOT IN NEW Z EALAND?
THEY SHOT THE FIRST ONE AT  PETER JACKSON'S PLACE IN NEW  SEELAND
AND I HAVE BEEN THERE AND  IT'S SPECTACULAR
SO HAVE I. YOU GOT -- YOU WORKED WITH  JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE ON WEDNESDAY  AND HE'S IN WONDER WHEEL WITH  YOU. HE TOLD ME OR I READ THAT HE  SHARED A TRAILER WITH YOU.
THAT'S TRUE.
SO WOODY ALLEN FILMS ARE  TYPICALLY, THEY'RE EXTREMELY LOW BUDGET. BUT THEY REALLY ARE. LIKE IT'S NOT A PRETEND THING,  LEAK THEY'RE MADE WITH VERY  LITTLE MONEY AND YOU JUST, YOU  KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU GET THERE AND YOU'RE VERY MUCH  SHARING TRAILERS, WHICH I DIDN'T MIND SHARING WITH JUSTIN  TIMBERLAKE
HE KIND OF WAS INTIMIDATED BY YOU.
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE SAID THAT WHAT MADE HIM  NERVOUS IS THAT BECAUSE THE  WALLS ARE SO THIN,
I COULD HEAR HIM PEEING. IT'S TRUE.
YES.
IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE. I WOULD ALWAYS BE AT WORK A  LITTLE BIT BEFORE JUSTIN. SO I WOULD GET TO WORK AND I  WOULD PUT THE KETTLE ON AND  MISTAKE MYSELF A CUP OF TEA  BEING BRITISH AND I'M AFRAID IT  IS SOMETHING THAT I DO AND I  WOULD KNOW HE WAS THERE BECAUSE  I WOULD HEAR THIS TRICKLING  SOUNDS. I WOULD GO, MORNING, DARLING. MORNING. AND I GO, SING ME A SONG.
WOULD HE SING YOU A SONG  WHILE HE WAS -- WOW.
YEAH. I MEAN, YOU GOT -- COME ON. I HAD TO ASK HIM
THAT SHOULD BE IN THE MOVIE
IT SHOULD BE.
IN THE MOVIE, YOU PLAY A  CHARACTER NAMED GINNY.
SO GINNY, THE FILM IS CALLED  WONDER WHEEL AND IT'S SET IN  1950 AND GINNY IS AN OYSTER BAR  WAITRESS, SHE WAS ONCE AN  ACTRESS, NOT A PARTICULARLY IF  ONE AND SHE'S LIVING A LIFE THAT SHE DIDN'T REALLY THINK SHE  WOULD BE LIVING, SHE LIVES IN  CONEY ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AMUSEMENT ARCADE. AND SHE'S MARRIED TO A MAN A  PLAYED BY JIM BLEW SHE. UNTIL SHE MEETS AND FALLS IN  LOVE WITH MICKEY THE LIFEGUARD  PLAYED BY JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE AND  STARTS TO IMAGINE A DIFFERENT  LIFE UNTIL HER STEPDAUGHTER,  WHO'S 21 YEARS OLD AND BEAUTIFUL TURNS UP AND ALSO TAKES A  SHINING FROM MICKEY THE  LIFEGUARD AND THIS MAKES GINNY  LIGHTLY LOSE HER MIND. AND DO SOMETHING QUITE TERRIBLE.
WE HAVE A SCENE HERE WHERE I  THINK YOU'RE REVEALING YOUR  PRACTICING
I'M PRACTICING -- SO BECAUSE  GINNY FANCIED HERSELF AS THIS  GREAT ACTRESS, WHICH SHE REALLY  TRULY NEVER WAS, SHE SAID IN THE FILM, I WAS IN THAT PLAY, I  PLAYED ONE OF THE WHORES, THAT  WAS THE LEVEL OF HER CAREER. SHE'S REHEARSING. SHE'S ADMITTING TO THE  LIFEGUARD, JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,  SHE'S REALLY A MARRIED WOMAN AND SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS LIFE  AFFAIR WITH HIM.
I WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, MICKEY. I'M MARRIED. I'M A MARRIED WOMAN. I WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,  MICKEY. I'M MARRIED WOMAN. I'M MARRIED. MICKEY. I FELT STRANGE MENTIONING IT. NOW THAT YOU ASKED. I GOT MYSELF INTO A BAD  SITUATION. I GOT MYSELF, I GOT MYSELF INTO  A BAD SITUATION.
HOW HARD MUST THAT BE
CAN I TELL A LITTLE STORY?
OF COURSE.
SO I ACTUALLY AM REALLY GLAD  THAT YOU SHOWED THAT CLIP,  BECAUSE WOODY ALLEN IS A REALLY  EXTRAORDINARY ARTIST AND GREAT  DIRECTOR TO WORK WITH. BEFORE YOU START SHOOTING HE'S A MAN OF FEW WORDS. I WAS QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT THE  DIALECT BECAUSE I THOUGHT I  DON'T WANT TO CHOOSE SOMETHING  THAT IS GOING TO OFFEND HIM AND  PRACTICING THESE DIFFERENT  VOICES AND I THOUGHT I'M JUST  GOING TO RECORD A PIECE OF  DIALOGUE INTO MY iPHONE AND I'LL JUST SEND IT TO HIM AND SAY IS  THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING  ON, WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT WAS THAT PIECE OF DIALOGUE  THAT I SENT TO HIM
WITH THAT HE ACCENT.
WITH THAT ACCENT AND THE  RESPONSE I GOT BACK AFTER THREE  AGONIZING DAYS WAS VERY GOOD  NICE JOB. I THOUGHT, OK, I'M IN.
BUT YOU'RE AN ACTRESS  PRETENDING TO BE AN ACTRESS  PRACTICING HER LINES. HOW DID YOU PRACTICE PRACTICING  YOUR LINES AS AN ACTRESS BEING  AN ACTRESS
ACTUALLY, IN TERMS OF  PRACTICING LINES, IT WAS, THE  SUMMER BECAUSE WE SHOT THIS  MOVIE LAST AUTUMN AND THE SUMMER WAS QUITE A WHITE KNUCKLE RIDE  PREPARATION. AND ALL OF MY OUT OF WORK ACTOR  FRIENDS, I SAID I'LL COOK FOR  YOU, IT WILL BE ALL EXPENSES,  I'LL GIVE YOU TRAIN FARE, PLEASE COME DOWN AND AND HAVE LUNCH  WITH ME. FIVE DAYS WE'LL LEARN THE LINES  AND ANYONE I COULD FIND TWO HELP ME, SO EVEN MY LITTLE TODDLER, I WOULD SAY TO HIM, JUST SIT  THERE, DARLING, JUST SIT AND I  WOULD TRY AND JUST DO THE LINES  JUST AT HIM, JUST SO I COULD  FEEL LIKE, AND HE'S LIKE WHAT  ARE YOU DOING THAT SILLY VOICE  FOR? OF COURSE HE'S SAYING THAT
I'LL RUN LINES WITH YOU THE  NEXT TIME
YOU'LL HATE IT
WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT  OF A COMMERCIAL BREAK BUT DON'T  GO AWAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK  WITH WERE KATE WINSLET,  EVERYBODY. >
HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE LATE SHOW, ALREADY IN  PROGRESS. WE'RE HERE WITH MY NEW FRIEND  KATE WINSLET. KATE, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WE'RE COMING UP ON THE 20TH  ANNIVERSARY OF TITANIC, HAVE YOU SEEN IT IN THE MOVIE THEATER  RECENTLY
OBVIOUSLY NOT
I DON'T KNOW.
OF COURSE NOT.
THERE ARE DIE HARD TITANIC  FANS HERE AT THE LATE SHOW AND  IN THE STAFF
I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT  LOVELY.
I'VE GOT A SEPARATE CARD OF  QUESTIONS HERE JUST FROM MY  STAFF. WE'LL DO A LIGHTENING ROUNDS,  ARE YOU READY TO ANSWER A COUPLE OF 20TH INTERACTION QUESTIONS. HOW OFTEN DO YOU LISTEN TO MY  HEART WILL GO ON
ABSOLUTELY NEVER.
THE SWEATY HASN'T PRINT  SCENE, THE SEX IN THE CAR, WAS  THAT SCRIPTED AND HOW SWEATY DID IT GET
I DON'T THINK IT WAS SCRIPTED WE CAME UP WITH IT. IT DID GET QUITE SWEATY BUT WE  WERE SPRITZED DOWN TO MAKE US  LOOK LIKE WE WERE IN THE THROWS  OF
ACTING BY BOTTLE. DID YOU GET -- DID YOU REALLY  GET PNEUMONIA AFTER FILMING THE  SCENE IN THE WATER
NO, BUT I DID GET HOOP  THERMIA
YOU WERE REALLY COLD
YEAH, I WAS REALLY -- COLD.
WHY WAS IT -- IT'S PRETEND,  WHY DID THEY MAKE IT SO COLD? YOU GET HYPO THERMIA? WHY DIDN'T THEY ACT IT.
WE DID DO A BIT OF ACTING.
WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE COLD
I'LL TELL YOU WHY. I THINK THIS IS WHY.
BECAUSE IT WAS A BIG TANK IN  TIME
THERE WERE LOTS OF BIG TANKS  AND LOTS OF WATER AND THAT  AMOUNT OF WATER I THINK HONESTLY THEY COULDN'T HEAT IT.  IT WAS  JUST TOO MUCH OF IT.
COULD YOU KEEP A STRAIGHT  FATE WHEN YOU SAID DRAW ME LIKE  ONE OF YOUR FRENCH GIRLS.
WHAT KIND OF A QUESTION IS  THAT?
IT'S A REGULAR QUESTION, IT'S NOT MINE, SOMEBODY ELSE WROTE  THAT.
COULD YOU KEEP A STRAIGHT  FACE
I THINK I PROBABLY DID. I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED. I SHOULD HAVE LAUGH AND GONE  DON'T BE RIDICULOUS
HAVE YOUR KIDS SEEN THE MOVIE
HALF
HAVE THEY SEEN THAT PART OF  THE MOVIE, NO, I DON'T THINK SO. ACTUALLY, NO, I DO REMEMBER  COVERING MY SON'S EYES.
OR YOU COULD COVER THE SCREEN ONE OF THOSE TWO
NO, BECAUSE IT WAS IN A BIG  MOVIE THEATER, I FORGOT WOULD  ABOUT THIS BIT, IT WAS IN 3D
THAT MAKES EIGHT TOTALLY  DIFFERENT SCENE
EXACTLY
COMING AT YOU
HE SAID CAN WE GO BACK TO THE HOTEL AND GET PUDDING? YES, ABSOLUTELY LET'S LEAVE. WE'RE LEAVING
DID LEO DRAW THAT PICTURE
NO, JIM CAMERON DREW IT. THAT'S MAYBE NO ONE KNOWS THAT  UNTIL THIS MOMENT RIGHT NOW. JIM CAMERON DREW IT AND HE DID  SKETCH ME BUT HE DID ACTUALLY  SKETCH ME IN BATHING SUIT. IN A BATHING SUIT.
PARAMOUNT WANTED MATTHEW  McCON HEY AS JACK
I AUDITIONED WITH MATTHEW. YES, I DID, I AUDITIONED WITH  MATTHEW
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY  DIFFERENT SOUTHERN ACCENT
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE  WHOLE JACK AND ROSE
IN THE FAMOUS LINE YOU SAY  I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO, JACK, BUT YOU DO
I LIED. I KNOW.
YOU LET HIM GO.
I KNOW. I AGREE, I LIE, I FULLY LIE. I HOLD MY HAND UP I LET HIM GO. PLUS HE JUST SHOULD HAVE TRIED  HARDER TO GET ON THAT DOOR. BECAUSE I THINK HE COULD HAVE -- WE COULD REENACT IT NOW.
HOLD ON.
WE'RE NOW RUNNING AROUND THE  COUNTER
OK. PROMISE ME, ROSE, PROMISE ME  THIS, ROSE.
WHAT
YOU'LL LET ME GET UP ON THAT  DOOR WITH YOU
COME ON, DARLING, THERE'S  ROOM FOR TWO.
YES.
WONDERFUL
WE DONE IT. WONDERFUL WHEEL IS IN THEATERS  TOMORROW, KATE WINSLET. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
