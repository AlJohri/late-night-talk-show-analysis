ALL RIGHT BOYS TIME TO HIT THE TENT.
COME ON, JUST ONE MORE STORY.
ONE MORE.
OKAY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER SCARY ONE.
YES, YES, YES!
ONCE UPON A-- THIS WEEK AFTER A BOY SCOUT JAMBOREE, MUCH LIKE THE ONE YOU HAD, A PHONE RANG IN AN OLD WHITE HOUSE, AND IT WAS ANSWERED BY THE BLOATED PUMPKIN MAN WITH HAIR LIKE MOLDY HAY.
IS THAT THE MAN WITH THE DOLL HANDS?
THAT'S THE ONE.
WHAT DID THE CALLER WANT?
THE CALLER TOLD THE PUMPKIN MAN HIS SPEECH AT THE JAMBOREE WAS THE GREATEST SPEECH EVER MADE.
WAS IT?
NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
THE PHONE KEPT RINGING, AND THE COMPLIMENTS KEPT COMING. BUT THEN, THE POLICE TRACED THE CALL, AND IT WAS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE! TURNS OUT, THE PUMPKIN MAN WAS CALLING HIMSELF. ( PHONE RENGING ) WHAT'S THAT? IT'S THE PUMPKIN MAN! AARRGGHH!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT STEPHEN TALKS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S SUMMER VACATION. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES SENATOR AL FRANKEN AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY JOE WALSH. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! GOOD TO SEE YOU! HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY, WE'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY FRIDAY. FIRST OF ALL, HAPPY FRIDAY, EVERYBODY. YOU MADE IT, ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF THE WEEK. THAT'S A GOOD FEELING, YOU KNOW, TOUCH BASE, YOU'RE SAFE FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE YOU'RE BACK IN THE GRIND. YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO HAVE A NICE, FUN LONG WEEKEND? THAT'S DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE STARTING TODAY, HE BEGINS A 17-DAY VACATION.
Audience: BOOO!
Stephen: NO, HE'S EARNED IT, IS A PHRASE THAT YOU DON'T SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE VACATIONING AT HIS PRIVATE GOLF CLUB IN NEW JERSEY. AND NOW, BACK IN 2011, TRUMP TWEETED "@BARACKOBAMA PLAYED GOLF YESTERDAY. NOW HE HEADS TO A 10-DAY VACATION IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD. NICE WORK ETHIC." OKAY.
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THAT TWEET. DONALD TRUMP HAS HEARD THE WORD "ETHICS. OF T"ETHICS." ( APPLAUSE ) THERE'S BEEN NO EVIDENCE UP TILL NO, NO EVIDENCE UP TILL NOW. WHILE TRUMP IS GONE, THE WHITE HOUSE WILL UNDERGO MAJOR RENERATIONS. IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME. I HEARD THAT PLACE SAY DUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE REPLACING THE HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM. THAT REALLY NEEDS IT, BECAUSE SOMEHOW, THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY HOTTER AND COOLER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, I DON'T KNOW, THEY'VE GOT TO ADJUST THE ZONES. THEY'VE GOT TO ADJUST THE ZONES.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND WHILE THEY'RE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE WHITE HOUSE, CAN I MAKE ONE SUGGESTION? CHANGE THE LOCKS! DO IT! NOW'S YOUR CHANCE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHHH! THEY'RE COMING! OF COURSE, TRUMP HAS SPENT THE LAST YEAR TELLING US THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS "FAKE NEWS." SO NOW HE'S FINALLY FIGHTING BACK, BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LAUNCHED HIS OWN NEWS PROGRAM ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE STATE-SPONSORED PROPAGANDA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP'S NEWS PROGRAM IS HOSTED BY HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW LARA, WHO IS MARRIED TO ERIC. WAIT, ISN'T BEING MARRIED TO ERIC A FULL-TIME JOB? THOSE VELCRO SHOES DON'T STRAP THEMSELVES. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, YOU GOTTA, YOU GOTTA PULL THEM TIGHT. WELL, I WENT ON TO THE FACEBOOK PAGE. I LOOKED FOR THIS BROADCAST. I WATCHED IT. THIS NEWS BROADCAST HAS A REFRESHINGLY LOW LEVEL OF PRODUCTION. I BELIEVE THE SHOW IS CALLED, "WOMAN SPEAKS IN FRONT OF TARP." AND SOMEHOW SHE HAS THE COURAGE TO BE PRO-TRUMP.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. THE UNEMPLOYMENTVIATE AT THE LOWEST POINTS IT HAS BEEN SINCE 2001. THAT IS QUITE AN INCREDIBLE FACT. THE STOCK MARKET IS UP. THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AND JOBS!
Stephen: I THINK THE TELEPROMPTER IS JUST THE PRESIDENT'S TWITTER FEED. BUT THE CRAZIEST THING ABOUT LARA TRUMP'S ONLINE PROPAGANDA BOOK REPORT IS HOW SHE ENDS IT.
THANKS FOR JOINING US, EVERYBODY. I'M LARA TRUMP, AND THAT IS THE REAL NEWS.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, THE REAL NEWS? IF THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR, IT'S BECAUSE "REAL NEWS" IS THIS THING WE'VE BEEN DOING SINCE TRUMP GOT ELECTED, WHERE WE MAKE UP NEWS WE THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE. ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, IN LIGHT OF LARA TRUMP'S WORK, I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE "REAL NEWS TONIGHT" TEAM HAS ADDED A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.
WELCOME TO REAL NEWS TONIGHT. I'M JISM ANCHORTON.
AND I'M JILL NEWS LADY.
PART 17 IN OUR ONGOING SERIES ON WHY TRANSGENDER IMMIGRANTS ARE THE REAL RUSSIA COLLUDERS. FIRST, WE'LL THRILLED TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW CORRESPONDENT, LARA TRUMP.
LARA, HOW ARE THE JOBS JOBBING?
THERE HAVE BEEN ALMOST 800,000 NEW JOBS CREATED IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE IN JANUARY.
WOW, 800,000. THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
THE BIGGEST ONE THERE IS, JILL. TELL US, LARA, WHAT'S LATEST ON THE PRESIDENT'S GENEROSITY?
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS DONATED HIS SALARY. HIS FIRST QUARTER SALARY WENT TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. HIS SECOND QUARTER SALARY HAS NOW BEEN DONATE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
WOW, TRUMP IS LIKE MOTHER THERESE AOR'S MEAT-EATING GANDHI ARE POWERFUL PARMS THANKS FOR THAT REPORT, LARA.
LARA TRUMP, ANOTHER INCREDIBLE TRUMP.
A VESSEL FOR CHILDREN WITH SACRED TRUMP BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS.
WE'RE GETTING BREAKING ECONOMIC NEWS FROM OUR OTHER NEW CORRESPONDENT, WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL ADVISOR AND IVANKA AND JARED'S DOG. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING, BOY?
GOOD BOY.
GREAT BOY, JIM.
COMING UP NEXT, HOW LONG UNTIL I'M REPLACED AT THE NEWS DESK BY A WHITE MAN? CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT. THEY'VE BEEN OPPRESSED FOR TOO LONG.
SO SAD.
SAD.  . ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THERE'S ALSO-- THEY DO A GREAT JOB. GREAT NEWS TEAM. THERE'S ALSO REAL NEWS IN THE WORLD OF RELIGION AND WRESTLING TONIGHT, BECAUSE THE W.W.E. HAS TRADEMARKED THE BIBLE VERSE NUMBERS 3:16. IT IS THE MOST INAPPROPRIATE CASE OF COMMERCIALIZING THE BIBLE SINCE KING SOLOMON'S BABY-SIZED GINSU KNIVES. "CUT THAT BABY IN ONE SWIPE!" ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THE W.W.E. TRADEMARKED 3:16 REFERS TO ONE OF THE BIBLE'S MOST QUOTED VERSES, JOHN 3:16: "FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY SON, THAT THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN HIM SHALL NOT DIE BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE." OR, AS THE W.W.E. WILL NOW PUT IT, "CHRIST-A-MANIA IS RUNNING WILD! WOO, BABY!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THIS ALL HAPPENED. STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN STARTED USING 3:16 WHEN HE BEAT JAKE "THE SNAKE" ROBERTS IN THE "KING OF THE RING" MATCH IN 1996. ROBERTS HAD BEEN USING JOHN 3:16 AS PART OF HIS ENTRANCE ROUTINE AND CHARACTER. HERE'S WHAT AUSTIN SAID WHEN HE BEAT HIM:
TALK ABOUT YOUR PSALMS, TALK ABOUT JOHN 3:16. AUSTIN 3:16 SAYS I JUST WHUPPED YOUR ASS.
Stephen: THIS IS NOT THE FIRST RUN-IN JESUS HAS HAD WITH THE W.W.E. ANYONE WHO'S READ THEIR BIBLE KNOWS JESUS WAS BETRAYED BY JUDEA'S FAMOUS WRESTLING HEEL "RUDE JUDAS THE BETRAYIN' DUDUS!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, IF THE W.W.E. OWNS 3:16, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO UPDATE THE WAY WE TEACH THE STORY OF JESUS. SO NOW, INTRODUCING... WEIGHING IN AT 120 POUNDS, HAILING FROM NAZARETH, JUDEA, THE MESSIAH OF MUSCLE, THE SAVIOR OF STEEL! JESUS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. LISTEN UP. I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE, AND NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME! YOU HEAR THAT, STONE COLD? I'M GOING TO WALK ALL OVER YOU LIKE WATER! AND GO AHEAD AND BRING THE PAIN, BECAUSE WHOSOEVER SHALL SMITE ME ON MY RIGHT CHEEK, I WILL TURN TO YOU THE OTHER! AND THEN I'M GONNA FORGIVE YOU. OH, YEAH! ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS MY BODY! THIS IS MY BELT! I'M THE CHAMPION OF THE WORLD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JESUS. TOUGH COMPETITOR. A TOUGH COMPETITOR. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, INCLUDING A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY THE GREAT JOE WALSH. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, IT'S FRIDAY, AND THAT MEANS "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK! HOW ABOUT JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY? SAY HI TO THAT MAN OVER THERE!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T THINK I'M GIVING ANYTHING AWAY RIGHT NOW WHEN I SAY-- JON, DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? YOU CAN HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT IS, LIKE, PARTICULARLY FROSTY TONIGHT.
Jon: YEAH, IT'S KIND OF GOT A NICE CHILL TO IT--
Stephen: I CANNOT FEEL MY TOES RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU GUYS OKAY OUT THERE? ARE YOU COLD ENOUGH?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. IF YOU KEEP THE ROOM COLD, THEY'RE LIKE A CRISP CARROT.
Jon: OH YEAH, OH YEAH.
Stephen: IT JUST SNAPS, IT'S SO FRESH.
Jon: COMEDY TEMPERATURE.
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT, WE CALL IT COMEDY WEATHER, BECAUSE IF YOUR TEETH ARE CHATTERING, YOU'RE THAT CLOSE TO LAUGHING, ALREADY.
Jon: (  LAUGHS  ) OH, I SEE, I SEE.
Stephen: IT'S A SURVIVAL MECHANISM. REALLY, MORE THAN ENTERTAINMENT.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: FOLKS, NOT SURE I HAD TO CONFESS ALL THAT TO YOU. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW BY NOW, I'M A CATHOLIC. BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH LATELY, BECAUSE I GAVE IT UP FOR LENT.  ( LAUGHTER ) I DO MISS MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITION-- CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience: OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, WAIT THERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE--  ( ORGAN PLAYING SOFTLY ) WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "GOD ONLY GIVES YOU AS MUCH AS YOU CAN HANDLE," I WONDER IF THEY COULD HANDLE GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE.  ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, YOU KNOW THAT POLICY AT BASKIN ROBBINS WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR I.D. TO PROVE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TO GET A FREE CONE? THAT'S BECAUSE OF ME.  ( LAUGHTER ) EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S STUPID, I KIND OF WANT TO TRY VAPING.  ( LAUGHTER ) MMM, VANILLA CAR EXHAUST.  ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS DUMB.  ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I LOVED THE MOVIE "MOONLIGHT," BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IT DIDN'T HAVE ONE WEREWOLF. ONE WOULDN'T HAVE HURT THE PLOT.  ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, I TELL PEOPLE I WISH MY SUPER-POWER WAS INVISIBILITY, BUT I REALLY JUST WISH I COULD JUST EAT PIZZA ALL DAY WITHOUT GETTING FAT.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHENEVER MY MEDICINE SAYS TO TAKE IT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, I NEVER TAKE IT, BECAUSE I NEVER HAVE AN EMPTY STOMACH.  ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN I GO THROUGH A DRIVE- THROUGH CAR WASH, I PRETEND I'M ON ANOTHER PLANET WHERE IT RAINS SOAP.  ( LAUGHTER ) TO GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE, I READ KEROUAC'S "ON THE ROAD" WHILE DRIVING.  ( LAUGHTER ) FOR TAX PURPOSES, AUDIENCE, THE "LATE SHOW" IS A WORKING RANCH.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL REALLY DUMB.  ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, I KNOW I'M A BIT OF A LITTER BUG. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO DUMP ALL MY DEAD BUGS.  ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, WHEN I'M IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WAITING ROOM AHEAD OF ME, A LITTLE PART OF ME WISHES THEY WOULD DIE.  ( LAUGHTER ) I SAID I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THESE.  ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT EATING A BAG OF FAMILY-SIZE DORITOS TAKES THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS A SPIN CLASS.  ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE?
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!

Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. GIVE IT UP FOR THAT BAND SITTING RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU. NICE WELCOME.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: WE FIRST MET WHEN YOU WERE A COMEDIAN.
YES, YES. I USED TO DO KIND OF WHAT YOU DO A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: COMEDY, VARIETY.
YES. AND SATIRE.
Stephen: YOU DID THE ORIGINAL "INDECISIONS" OVER AT COMEDY CENTRAL, '92 AND '96.
WOW, YES, IT'S IN THE BOOK. IT'S IN MY BOOK.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS SO IMPORTANT AND NOW-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, FOR MANY YEARS-- FOR MANY YEARS, I DID WORK AT IMPORTANT CENTRAL.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T WANT YOU FOR A MOMENT-- NOW THAT I'M A SENATOR-- I DON'T WANT YOU FOR A MOMENT TO THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO HERE EVERY NIGHT IS ANY LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT I DO, EVEN THOUGH IT IS LESS IMPORTANT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO THINK IT. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO THINK THAT. THAT'S VERY KIND. THAT'S SUPER GENEROUS OF YOU. THAT'S SO BIG OF YOU. WHEN I FIRST MET YOU 15, 16 YEARS AGO I WAS AT A ROAST, A CHEVY CHASE ROAST. YOU WROTE IN YOUR BOOK THE LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM. RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT. STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU MADE A LOT OF FUN-- POKED A LOT OF FUN AT POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. NOW THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THEM, DO YOU THINK YOU WERE BEING UNFAIR TO THEM.
NO.
Stephen: NO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE YOU WONDER SOMETIMES, YOU DO THIS WORK EVERY DAY AND YOU WONDER ARE THEY REALLY AS VENAL AS THEY LOOK?
GO BACK, I MAKE FUN OF THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVED IT. I MADE FUN OF NEWT GINGRICH. I MADE FUN OF RUSH LIMBAUGH. IBILITY O'REILLY-- O'REILLY --
Stephen: WHO IS THAT?
HE USED TO BE AT FOX NEWS. ( LAUGHTER ) HE AND FOX SUED ME. AND IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING.
Stephen:  OKAY.
BILL O'REILLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT SATIRE IS PROTECTED SPEECH IN THE UNITED STATES, EVEN IF THE OBJECT OF THE SATIRE DOESN'T GET IT.
Stephen: AL HAS A NEW BOOK. IT IS CALLED "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IS THIS YOUR OFFICIAL PORTRAIT?
THAT IS, THAT IS. IT'S AN OIL PAINTING. AND IT HANGS... IN THE SENATE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: JUST IN THE SENATE. JUST IN THE SENATE.
IN MY OFFICE.
Stephen: YOUR OFFICE.
Stephen: WE WERE TALKING ABOTALKBEFORE THE BREAK, OBVIOUS THE BULK OF YOUR CAREER YOU HAVE BEEN A COMEDIAN, A SATIRIST. ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE SENATE FUN? BECAUSE THEY SEEM LIKE THEY'RE A BORING THUNDERDOME.
NO. ACTUALLY, A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE FUNNY. AND THAT'S HOW I BOND WITH THEM. FROM YOUR STATE-- OKAY, I GET SWORN IN. I WAS SWORN IN A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE MY ELECTION WAS VERY CLOSE. AND JIM DEMINT, A VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, A COUPLE OF MINUTES AFTER I'M SWORN INY, HE COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS, "HOW ARE THINGS ON THE FAR LEFT?" AND I SAID, "THEY'RE GREAT. HOW ARE THINGS ON THE NUT CASE RIGHT?" AND HE LAUGHED, AND WE WERE FRIENDS EVER SINCE. LINDSEY GRAHAM FROM YOUR STATE, SOUTH CAROLINA, IS VERY FUNNY. I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS RUNNING, LIKE, 15th OUT OF 17 IN THE REPUBLICAN --
Stephen: I THINK HE WAS 17 OUT OF 15, ACTUALLY. I WENT UP TO HIM IN THE SENATE AND SAID, LINDSEY, IF I WERE VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, I WOULD VOTE FOR YOU." AND WITHOUT HESITATION HE SAID, "THAT'S MY PROBLEM." LINDSEY IS VERY FUNNY. BUT WE-- THERE ARE SOME SENATORS WHO AREN'T VERY FUNNY. AND TOM COBURN FROM OKLAHOMA, DON'T AS "DR. NO."
Stephen: HE IS A PHYSICIAN.
HE IS AN OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST. AND HE WAS NO BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE ANY FEDERAL SPENDING SO HE WOULD SAY NO TOEG OTHER. HE WILL ADMIT THAT HE IS NOT A VERY GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR INTERACTIONS WE HAD, WE JUST KIND OF MISSED. SO I WENT TO TOM, AND I SAID, "TOM, CAN I TAKE YOU TO LUNCH?" AND HE SAID, "TELL YOU WHAT. YOU CAN TAKE ME TO BREAKFAST." I SAID OKAY. SO WE MEET FOR BREAKFAST A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER IN THE SENATE DINING ROOM, AND I SAID, "TOM, LET'S JUST HAVE FUN." AND HE SAID, "OKAY, FUN." ( LAUGHTER ) AND I SAID, "WE CAN TALK ABOUT OUR FAMILIES. TALK ABOUT POLITICS. TALK ABOUT THE CAREERS WE HAD BEFORE THE SENATE. BUT LET'S HAVE FUN." HE GOES, "OKAY." I SAID, "OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. TO BE A DOCTOR IN OKLAHOMA, DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ANY FORMAL EDUCATION?" ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE-- AND HE SAID, "YES! YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND I SAID-- I SAID, "OKAY, TOM, THAT WAS A JOKE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S WHAT I USED TO DO IN MY CAREER." AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE BREAKFAST, WE HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME. I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT JOKES WERE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHAT THE PROPER REACTION TO A JOKE IS. AND I GOT A NOTE LATER FROM HIM THAT DAY SAYING, "I HAD A LOT OF FUN."
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
YEAH, AND WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK-- "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." WHEN I WAS WRITING THAT, I WANTED TO GET PERMISSION FROM MY COLLEAGUES WHO I WROTE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE. SO I CALLED HIM UP-- HE'S IN RETIREMENT. HE'S IN OKLAHOMA. AND I SAID, "TOM, DO YOU REMEMBER--" "HI, AL." I SAID, "DO YOU REMEMBER THAT BREAKFAST WE HAD?" AND HE SAID, "YEAH, YEAH." AND I SAID, "I WANT TO USE THAT IN THE BOOK, AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR PERMISSION." AND HE SAID, "WE HAVE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. YOU CAN WRITE ANYTHING YOU WANT!" ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) SO HE HASN'T-- HE HASN'T CHANGED.
Stephen: NO. YOU COULD HAVE SAID, "WE ALSO HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT, AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT GUNS."
HE WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE RIGHT FOR AMERICANS TO BEAR ARMS. HE IS.
Stephen: NOW, YOU SAID-- YOU WROTE IN THE BOOK "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." YOU SAY IN THE BOOK YOU'VE LEARNED WEIRD, SOCIOPATHIC POLITICAL SKILLS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT IS THE WEIRDEST POLITICAL SKILL YOU'VE HAD TO LEARN?
PIVOTING.
Stephen: PIVOTING.
PIVOTING. PIVOTING IS NOT ANSWERING A QUESTION. AND JUST PIVOTING.
Stephen: PIVOTING IS A WAY OF PIVOTING OFF, "I'M NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION."
OR I'D BE ASKED, "YOU'RE 10 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS TO NORM COLEMAN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONVINCE DEMOCRATS TO NOMINATE YOU?" AND I'D GO, LIKE, "YOU KNOW, WHEN I GO AROUND MINNESOTA, MINNESOTANS DON'T CARE ABOUT POLLING. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT IS HEALTH CARE AND THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION." THAT'S PIVOTING.
Stephen: AND YOU WERE NOT GOOD AT THAT?
I WAS NOT GOOD AT THAT. I WAS TAUGHT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, AND IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO LEARN HOW TO PIVOT.
Stephen: CAN YOU DO IT NOW?
I'M OKAY AT IT.
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS AND YOU PIVOT OFF OF THEM?
OKAY, OKAY. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TELL YOU WHAT. NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE." NO MATTER WHAT I ASK YOU, STAY ON MESSAGE AND PROMOTE YOUR BOOK. IF NORTH KOREA CONTINUES TO ADVANCE ITS MISSILE PROGRAM, SENATOR FRANKEN, SHOULD WE TAKE MILITARY ACTION?
YOU KNOW, IN MY BOOK, STEPHEN, I WRITE A LOT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVEL-HEADED LEADERSHIP, WHICH IS WHY I'M TERRIFIED OF TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SENATOR FRANKEN, DO YOU PLAN TO RUN FOR ARE PRESIDENT IN 2020?"
YOU KNOW, IN MY BOOK, STEPHEN-- "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE--" I TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVEL-HEADED LEADERSHIP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU WIN. YOU WIN.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: "AL FRANKEN, GIANT OF THE SENATE," IS AVAILABLE NOW. SENATOR AL FRANKEN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. EVERYBODY. I WAS ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST TAKING SOME NOTES. WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WHAT AN AMAZING WEEK. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE, UNBELIEVABLE WEEK WE'VE HAD HERE. HIRINGS, FIRINGS. WE'RE STILL SORTING THROUGH WHAT HISTORIANS WILL CALL THE AFTER-MOOCH. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AS CRAZY AS IT'S BEEN, AS CRAZY AS IT'S BEEN, I BELIEVE ONE DAY WE'LL LOOK BACK AT THIS WEEK AND LAUGH. SO LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT. THIS IS THE BEST OF THIS WEEK'S "THE LATE SHOW."
ROBERT MUELLER HAS EMPANELLED A GRAND JURY IN HIS INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. AND I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING RIGHT NOW-- NOBODY HAS EVER SAID BEFORE, "GOD, I WISH I HAD JURY DUTY!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M AVAILABLE! I'M AVAILABLE!
AS A CANDIDATE, I CAMPAIGNED ON CREATING A MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS U.S. WORKERS AND TAXPAYERS, AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY, MERIT-BASED.
Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, WHEREVER YOU TODAY, IT'S NOT BASED ON MERIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FLAFT SIX MONTHS, I THINK WE'RE ALL GETTING AN EDUCATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER HEARD POPULAR DISCOURSE PEOPLE DISCUSSING ETHICS THIS MUCH. AND I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HOW ETHICS WAS NECESSARILY SUPPOSED TO WORK AT THAT LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. AND HE'S PUTTING ALL THIS STUFF ON THE FOREFRONT.
Stephen: WELL, NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT OXYGEN UNTIL SOMEBODY HAS THEIR HANDS AROUND YOUR THROAT.
A PRANKSTER TRICKED WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS INTO REPLYING TO HIS EMAILS. HE MUST HAVE USED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DONALD, YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S LIKE BEING A PARENT. YOU HAVE TO LOVE ALL THE STATES EQUALLY. EVEN IF ONE OF THEM IS ERIC. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT BACKSTAGE, RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED, WE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WE HAVE NEVER MET BEFORE. THIS IS IT TONIGHT.
I KNOW.
Stephen: AND I'VE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS FOREVER.
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS SINCE 1994 WHEN YOU WERE STEFAN COLBERT.
I COULD NOT BOOK A COMMERCIAL TO SAVE MY LIFE.
Stephen: IF YOU CAN'T BOOK A COMMERCIAL HOW WILL YOU EVER WORK?
EXACTLY. THAT'S A STEPPING STONE. I CAN'T GET A CORN POPS COMMERCIAL. I WANTED THAT CORN POPS COMMERCIAL YOU.
Stephen:  COULDN'T GET THE CORN POPS COMMERCIAL.
OH, MAN.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE COPY? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY?
GOTTA HAVE MY POPS.
THE MOOCH IS OUT.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, GONE AFTER JUST A WEEK AND CHANGE ON THE JOB. THE MOOCH IS TOAST.
Stephen: YES, THE MOOCH IS TOAST. THE FRONT-STABBER HAS BEEN BACKSTABBED. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO FIRE EVERYBODY, AND I GOTTA ADMIT, HE DELIVERED. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS THOROUGH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT IS-- THAT IS THOROUGH. AFTER BEING FIRED, SCARAMUCCI ATE AT TRUMP'S HOTEL. WOW! OUCH! I CAN'T BELIEVE BE THE MOOCH HAD TO EAT TRUMP'S CRAP TWICE IN ONE DAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I KNOW THAT YOU'RE-- YOUR SISTERS, MARY KATE AND ASHLEY, HAVE A FAMOUS BRAND.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU SAID YOU'RE READY TO SELL OUT.
YES, THOSE WERE MY EXACT WORDS. I WAS LIKE, "I'M SELLING OUT, GUYS. I'LL SELL ANYTHING AND ON THE MARKET."
Stephen: YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT FIT TEAS RIGHT. YOU DRINK TEA AND YOU'RE FIT. WE HAVE NEW, IT'S A FIT MALT LIQUOR.
WAIT, THAT'S THE BEST --
Stephen: YES. THIS IS 40 OUNCES OF FITNESS. IT'S A FIT MALT LIQUOR, CALLED F-IT.
