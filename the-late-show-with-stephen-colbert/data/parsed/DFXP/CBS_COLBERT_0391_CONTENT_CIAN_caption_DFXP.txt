PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED THE NEW RUSSIAN SANCTIONS BILL INTO LAW. THE MOVE PUNISHES MOSCOW FOR MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION AND FOR INVADING CRIMEA. THE KREMLIN HAS OBVIOUSLY SLAMMED THE MOVE, SAYING THAT IT HURTS ANY CHANCES OF IMPROVING RUSSIA-U.S. RELATIONS.
AND NOW A RESPONSE FROM PRESIDENT PUTIN.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, WHY WOULD YOU SIGN THE SANCTIONS BILL? I THOUGHT WE WERE B.F.F.s LIKE GAYLE AND OPRAH IF GAYLE HACKED INTO OPRAH'S COMPUTER TO GET INFORMATION ON STEDMAN. DID ALL THAT COLLUDING MEAN NOTHING? JUST COLLUDE, SCREWED, THANK YOU, DUDE? UNFORTUNATELY, YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOIRKS I'M GIVING BACK MY HALF OF THE FRIENDSHIP LOCK ET. OUR BROMANCE IS OVER. I EVEN PUT TOGETHER THIS VIDEO TO EXPLAIN HOW I FEEL. ♪ ALL BY MYSELF ♪ ♪ DON'T WANT TO BE ALL BY MYSELF ♪ ♪ ANYMORE ♪ ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
NOW ALL I HAVE LEFT TO REMEMBER YOU BY IS THE PEE-PEE TAPE.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES ANTHONY MACKIE, ELIZABETH OLSEN, AND MUSICAL GUEST ARCADE FIRE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WHOO! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY, HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO NICE. YOU'RE TOO NICE. WELL, FOLKS, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. I HAVE A LOT. YEAH, YEAH, I HAVE A LOT OF STUFF I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT, BUT FIRST, THIS.
BREAKING NEWS TO REPORT. THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" IS REPORTING ROBERT MUELLER, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATING RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION, HAS IMPANELED A GRAND JURY. HE IS ALSO INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE COLLUSION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND WHETHER THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAD ENGAGED IN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. GRAND JURY.
Jon: THAT'S BIG.
Stephen: ROBERT MUELLER HAS IMPANELED A GRAND JURY IN HIS INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN! I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING NOBODY HAS EVERY SAID BEFORE: "GOD, I WISH I HAD JURY DUTY!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I'M AVAILABLE! BUT REALLY, HOW ARE THEY EVER GOING TO FIND UNBIASED PEOPLE TO SERVE ON THIS JURY? ( LAUGHTER ) "MA'AM, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A MAN BY THE NAME OF DONALD TRUMP?" "NO. FATHER NEVER MENTIONED HIM IN OUR CAVE DWELLING CULT. ( LAUGHTER ) MAY THE SHADOWS PROTECT." ( LAUGHTER ) I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT CULT, SUDDENLY. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS NEWS MEANS THAT THE INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN MEDDLING IS KICKING INTO ANOTHER GEAR BECAUSE "GRAND JURIES ARE POWERFUL INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS THAT ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS, PUT WITNESSES UNDER OATH AND SEEK INDICTMENTS, IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A CRIME." SO IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S GOING TO BE A TRIAL BUT THERE IS A STRONG INDICATION SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S LIKE PICKING UP A BLIND DATE, AND THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS, "HEY, I NEED SOME CONDOMS. COULD WE SWING BY THE STORE?" ( LAUGHTER ) NO RAN, NO RAN. WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS, I BET YOU ANYTHING. SPEAKING OF THE END OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT? I CAN'T REMEMBER. I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THE BEGINNING OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? SEVEN MONTHS AGO, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. JIM, DO WE HAVE A PICTURE OF WHAT I LOOKED LIKE BACK THEN? THERE YOU GO. YEAH. YOU'LL RECALL THAT IN THE FIRST WEEK, BACK WHEN WE WERE GIVING HIM A CHANCE, TRUMP WAS CALLING ALL THE WORLD LEADERS, YOU KNOW, GETTING TO KNOW THEM. "HI, HELLO. HI. MY NAME IS DONALD. I LIKE TO EAT STEAK. WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? HELLO? HELLO?" ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) TWO OF THE CALLS WERE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA. RUMOR IS, THE CALLS DID NOT GO WELL. FIRST, TRUMP TALKED TO MEXICAN PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO AND, WENT HE GOT OFF THE PHONE, SAID, "GREAT NEWS, THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE WALL." BUT PEÑA NIETO SAID, "QUE ESTAS HABLANDO, WILLIS?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING )
Jon: WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT, WILLIS?
Stephen: WILLIS KNOW SPANISH? ( LAUGHTER ) SO, WHO DO YOU BELIEVE? THE GUY WHO DENIED IT? OR THE GUY WHO WAS LYING? THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW-- UNTIL THIS MORNING, WHEN THE "WASHINGTON POST" PUBLISHED FULL TRANSCRIPTS OF TRUMP'S CALLS WITH THE LEADERS OF MEXICO AND AUSTRALIA. OKAY? MEXICO AND AUSTRALIA. OR AS TRUMP REFERS TO THEM, "BAD HOMBRESTAN" AND "KOALA LAMPUR." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THAT'S WHERE THAT IS, RIGHT? NOW, THESE TRANSCRIPTS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LEAKED. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT CAN SAY TO OTHER WORLD LEADERS WHERE HE CAN SPEAK FRANKLY OR NOTHING CAN GET DONE. SO BAD LEAKER, SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. BUT YOU DID, SO LET'S JUST KEEP GOING. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WITH MEXICAN PRESIDENT PEÑA NIETO, TRUMP SHOWED THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE WALL, SAYING, "BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS THE LEAST IMPORTANT THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT." OH, I BELIEVE IT. BECAUSE PEÑA NIETO SAID THIS: "MY POSITION HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE VERY FIRM, SAYING THAT MEXICO CANNOT PAY FOR THAT WALL." "BUT YOU CANNOT SAY THAT TO THE PRESS. THE PRESS IS GOING TO GO WITH THAT AND I CANNOT LIVE WITH THAT. YOU CANNOT SAY THAT TO THE PRESS." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) NO, LISTEN -- "HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. JUST LIE TO THEM AND, LATER WHEN YOU'RE CAUGHT, CALL IT FAKE NEWS. IT WORKS." ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, TRUMP TRIED TO CONVINCE PEÑA NIETO THAT THE WALL WAS HIS PROBLEM TOO. "THE FACT IS WE ARE BOTH IN A LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL BIND BECAUSE I HAVE TO HAVE MEXICO PAY FOR THE WALL-- I HAVE TO." ( LAUGHTER ) YES, THEY WERE BOTH IN A BIND. TRUMP NEEDS MEXICO TO PAY FOR THE WALL, AND PEÑA NIETO NEEDS TO GET HIS ENTIRE STAFF IN HERE QUICK TO LISTEN TO THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) SAY IT AGAIN! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) THEN TRUMP STARTING TALKING SMACK ABOUT AMERICA: "I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A DRUG-INFESTED DEN." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) NO, NO, LISTEN! YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM. IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE WELCOME SIGN -- WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE: A DRUG-INFESTED DEN. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, DONALD, YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! IT'S LIKE BEING A PARENT. YOU HAVE TO LOVE ALL THE STATES EQUALLY, EVEN IF ONE OF THEM IS ERIC. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND NEW HAMPSHIRE? WHY? I DON'T -- IN SUMMATION, HE LIED -- AGAIN. THE NEXT DAY TRUMP HAD A CALL WITH AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER AND GUY EXPLAINING THE REVERSE TOILET WATER THING FOR THE LAST DAMN TIME, MALCOLM TURNBULL. AT THE TIME, PEOPLE SAID TRUMP LASHED OUT AT THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER ON THE PHONE CALL. TRUMP VEHEMENTLY DENIED THIS STORY: "WE HAD A GREAT TELEPHONE CALL. YOU GUYS EXAGGERATED THAT CALL. THAT WAS A BIG EXAGGERATION. WE'RE NOT BABIES." ( LAUGHTER ) "NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. I'VE GOT A LOAD IN MY PANTS. REINCE, IT'S BOOM-BOOM TIME." ( LAUGHTER ) ROUGH RIFF COME ON. WARM IT UP. WARM IT. WARM UP THE WIPES. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT NOW WE HAVE A TRANSCRIPT OF THAT CALL AND... HE LIED AGAIN. BECAUSE TRUMP WAS REALLY UPSET ON THE PHONE CALL ABOUT A DEAL PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE ABOUT ACCEPTING REFUGEES WHO WERE WAITING IN AUSTRALIA, SAYING, "MALCOLM, WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT? I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. THIS IS GOING TO KILL ME. I AM THE WORLD'S GREATEST PERSON THAT DOES NOT WANT TO LET PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) WAIT, HOLD ON -- I'D BOO, TOO, BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT HE'S SAYING. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IS HE THE WORLD'S GREATEST PERSON, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THEM HERE? OR IS HE THE WORLD'S GREATEST PERSON AT KEEPING THEM OUT? OR IS THAT JUST HOW TRUMP DESCRIBES HIMSELF, NO MATTER WHAT HE'S DOING? "HELLO, DOMINOS. I AM THE WORLD'S GREATEST PERSON, WHO WOULD LIKE A MEDIUM PEPPERONI." THANK YOU ( LAUGHTER ) GREATEST. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP EXPRESSED IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS WHY HE DIDN'T WANT THEIR DAMN REFUGEES. "I HATE TAKING THESE PEOPLE. I GUARANTEE YOU THEY ARE BAD. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO GO ON TO WORK FOR THE LOCAL MILK PEOPLE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( BOOING ) ( PIANO RIFF ) LOCAL. MILK. PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: IS THAT A BAND?
Stephen: IS THAT THE NAME OF A BAND?
Jon: YEAH, I THINK SO.
Stephen: LOCAL MILK PEOPLE?
Jon: LOCAL MILK PEOPLE.
Stephen: "WE ARE THE LOCAL MILK PEOPLE! THANK YOU, CHICAGO!" OR ARE THEY A RACE OF "STAR TREK" ALIENS? "WE ARE THE MILK PEOPLE OF CREAMOLON FIVE. MAY THE KURDS BE WITH YOU." ( LAUGHTER ) COME WITH US INTO THE CAVE --    FOR SOMEONE WHO TALKS CONSTAN ABOUT REPRESENTING THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN, HE CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE JOB "DAIRY FARMER." ( LAUGHTER ) "I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS. I WILL PROTECT THE SMALL TOWN JOBS OF THE MILK PEOPLE AND THE UNDERGROUND-SHOVELLING- ELECTRICITY FOLKS, AND THE MAKE-THE-CORN-NOT-BE-ON-THE- PLANT-BUT-IN-MY-MOUTH GUYS!" ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE THOSE GUYS -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THEN HIGH-ENERGY DON, ONE WEEK INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, JUST GIVES UP. "I HAVE HAD IT. I HAVE BEEN MAKING THESE CALLS ALL DAY, AND THIS IS THE MOST UNPLEASANT CALL ALL DAY. PUTIN WAS A PLEASANT CALL." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) "I GOTTA TELL YA, PUTIN WAS SO EASY. I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO DIAL. I JUST PICKED UP THE PHONE AND HE WAS LISTENING." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ANTHONY MACKIE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'M GOING TALK ABOUT STEPHEN MILLER, CAN WE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND RIGHT THERE! LITTLE STEVIE, CAN'T GO WRONG THERE. JON, I'M SUPER EXCITED TONIGHT. WE HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE BUT WE HAVE ARCADE FIRE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AN AMAZING NEW ALBUM. BECAUSE IT'S THEM AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THEM, IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE INDULGE IN OFTEN ON THE SHOW, BUT TONIGHT'S MUSICAL PERFORMANCE IS BEING BROUGHT TO YOU THROUGH PAID SPONSORSHIP. WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE "EVERYTHING NOW CORPORATION." ( APPLAUSE ) SO EVERYTHING NOW FANS OUT THERE! I HADN'T HEARD OF "EVERYTHING NOW," BUT, APPARENTLY, THEY MAKE ENERGY DRINKS... AND OTHER STUFF. THEY ARE "AMERICA'S SECOND FASTEST-GROWING MULTI-PLATFORM DISTRIBUTOR OF ALL RETAIL CONTENT." IN OTHER WORDS: "ROCK AND ROLL!" ( LAUGHTER ) YOU EVER HEARD OF "EVERYTHING NOW"? YOU HEARD OF THESE PEOPLE?
Jon: I DON'T THINK SO, BUT I HAVE NOW.
Stephen: WE'RE LOOKING TO THE BAND LATER.
Jon: YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA KICK.
Stephen: BUT NOW I'M SURE YOU WILL HARDLY EVEN NOTICE THEIR SPONSORSHIP. A LITTLE BIT. OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) LAST NIGHT, I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S NEW IMMIGRATION PLAN, WHICH WOULD CUT LEGAL IMMIGRATION BY 50%. IT DOES IT BY ISSUING VISAS BASED ON A POINT SYSTEM. KIND OF LIKE WEIGHT WATCHERS, BUT THE GOAL IS TO LOSE BROWN PEOPLE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THE POINTS WOULD BE AWARDED BASED ON DIFFERENT QUALIFICATIONS, LIKE AGE AND EDUCATION, WHICH WOULD MEAN THE HIGHEST POINT-GETTING CANDIDATE, NOT INCLUDING SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD BE A 26- TO 31-YEAR-OLD WITH A U.S.-BASED DOCTORATE OR PROFESSIONAL DEGREE, WHO SPEAKS NEARLY PERFECT ENGLISH AND WHO HAS A SALARY OFFER THAT'S THREE TIMES AS HIGH AS THE MEDIAN INCOME WHERE THEY ARE. AH, THE CLASSIC IMMIGRANT TALE: YOU CAME HERE AT 28, SPEAKING PERFECT ENGLISH WITH A BRIEFCASE FULL OF CASH AND A DREAM THAT, IF YOU WORK HARD, YOUR KIDS MIGHT GO TO THE SAME COLLEGE YOU DID. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, YESTERDAY, TO EXPLAIN THIS PLAN, THE WHITE HOUSE SENT OUT SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR AND NATIONAL FOREHEAD RESERVE, STEPHEN MILLER. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHEN REPORTERS ASKED MILLER HOW THIS IMMIGRATION PLAN LINED UP WITH THE FAMOUS POEM ON THE STATUE LIBERTY-- YOU KNOW, "YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR, YOUR HUDDLED MASSES"-- MILLER GAVE AN ASTONISHING REVISION OF HISTORY. WE PLAYED THIS CLIP LAST NIGHT, BUT LET'S SEE IT AGAIN.
I DON'T WANT TO GET OFF INTO A WHOLE THING ABOUT HISTORY HERE, BUT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IS A SYMBOL OF LIBERTY, ENLIGHTING THE WORLD. IT'S A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN LIBERTY LIGHTING THE WORLD. THE POEM YOU WERE REFERRING TO WAS ADDED LATER. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A PART OF THE ORIGINAL STATUE OF LIBERTY.
STEPHEN: "AH, LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GIVE YOU A WHOLE HISTORY LESSON, BUT THE POEM WAS ADDED LATER AND DISTORTED THE MEANING OF THE STATUE. THE TORCH WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS A WEAPON TO WARD OFF IMMIGRANTS, WHO NATURALLY FEAR FIRE, AND THE SPIKES ON HER CROWN WERE MEANT TO DETER FOREIGNERS FROM LANDING IN HOT AIR BALLOONS." LOOK IT UP. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THERE'S A LOT OF CRAZY THERE. FIRST OFF-- I'VE NEVER SEEN A PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION REFUSE TO FULLY ENDORSE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. WHAT'S NEXT? "LIBERTY BELL? I LIKE BELLS THAT DON'T CRACK." ( LAUGHTER ) "OKAY? DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. ALL RIGHT?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THE POEM AND THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, I AGREE WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE UP TO IT. IT'S AN ASPIRATIONAL DOCUMENT LIKE "LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF," OR "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL," OR "EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S WHAT WE STRIVE FOR, BUT JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE IT DOESN'T MAKE IT MEANINGLESS. BUT MAYBE HE'S RIGHT. MAYBE WE NEED TO PUT A NEW POEM ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. LET'S GIVE THIS A SHOT. OKAY. HERE WE ARE.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH!
Stephen: GIVE ME YOUR WEALTHY, YOUR RICH, YOUR HUDDLED M.B.A.S YEARNING TO BE TAX FREE. SEND THESE, THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING, FULLY INSURED, TO ME. I LIFT MY LAMP BESIDE THE GOLDEN DOOR! AND LIFT MY LEG UPON YOUR FILTHY POOR. P.S. NO FATTIES." ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT ARCADE FIRE COMING UP! WHEN WE COME BACK, ANT A PRESIDENT IS HERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. FOLKS, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM "THE HURT LOCKER," "MILLION DOLLAR BABY," AND OF COURSE AS FALCON IN THE "AVENGERS" SERIES. HE NOW STARS IN THE NEW MOVIE "DETROIT." PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY MACKIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. LOOKS GREAT IN HERE.
Stephen: THANKS VERY MUCH. WE KEEP IT SPRUCED UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU WERE SAYING HI TO JON AS YOU CAME OVER HERE.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: I KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU'RE FROM NEW ORLEANS, HIS FAMILY IS FROM NEW ORLEANS.
SOME 504 BOYS.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WE TALKED ANT GETTING FRIED FISH AT GAS STATIONS NEXT TIME YOU'RE HERE.
WHEN I'M NOT WORKING I'M FAT MACKEY, SO.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT MUSCLE MACKEY BECAUSE ARE YOU PRESENTLY IN FALCON MODE? ARE YOU MARVEL JACKED NOW?
I'M IN BETWEEN AVENGERS 3 AND 4. SO YOU HAVE TO BE READY, MAN. NUTS ABOUT NUTS GUYS OUT HERE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: "INFINITY WARS, YOU FINISHED SHOOTING THAT.
YES.
Stephen: AND I UNDERSTAND YOU SPENT THE BETTER PART OF A MONTH MAKING FUN OF INFINITY WAR CO-STAR TOM HOLLAND.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT GUY, REALLY?
Stephen: YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT HIS SQUEAKY VOICE?
IT'S A PROBLEM. HE'S A WILDLY ANNOYING PERSON. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
Stephen: WHAT'S ANNOYING? EVERYTHING. HE'S SO LITTLE. HE'S LIKE A SHIH TZU. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S LIKE, ANTHONY! TAKE OFF THE SPANDEX, MAN. IT'S TOO MUCH.
Stephen: HOW DID HE TAKE IT?
HE'S ONE OF THOSE KIDS THAT WHEN YOU TELL HIM TO SHUT UP, HE SHUTS UP. WHEN YOU LEAVE, HE'S BACK TALKING. YOU LEAVE, HE'S TEXTING YOU -- HEY, WHERE DID YOU GO? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHAT THE FALCON DOES OR THE INFINITY WAR?
I KICK A LOT OF -- I CAN'T SAY THAT ON HERE, CAN I?
Stephen: SURE, YOU CAN SAY IT.
I KICK A LOT OF ASS, DAWG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT I DO.
Stephen: SURE. "DETROIT" IS ABOUT AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED 50 YEARS AGO THIS YEAR. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT?
BASICALLY, THERE WAS A BAR IN NEW YORK -- I MEAN, IN "DETROIT" CALLED "THE BLIND PIG" AND THE POLICE RAIDED THE BAR LOOKING FOR AN INSPECTING PERSON IN THE BAR, HE WASN'T THERE AND ENDED UP ARRESTING EVERYBODY AND IT SPARKED AN UPRISING IN 1967, YOU KNOW, AMERICA WAS A BOILING POT, AND THAT KIND OF JUST TOOK OVER AFTER THEY RAIDED THIS BAR AND JUST SPARKED WHAT WE KNEW AS THE DETROIT RIOTS.
Stephen: HOW LONG DID THEY LAST AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CITY?
THE CITY WAS DECIMATED. OVER 40 PEOPLE WERE INJURED AND KILLED. OVER 40 PEOPLE DIED DURING THE RIOT. ONCE IT WAS ALL SAID AND DONE, THE CITY WAS JUST LEVELED.
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE SAID DETROIT NEVER REALLY RECOVERED FROM THIS EVENT, THAT IT'S STILL USING IN THE SHADOW OF 1967.
YES, BUT DETROIT IS THE GROWTH PLACE OF AMERICA, I FEEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DETROIT IS TRULY THE ROSE THAT GREW FROM CONCRETE. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED IN AMERICA, EVERY TIME IT'S TURNED THAT CURVE AND HAD A GREAT INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, IT STARTED IN DETROIT AND IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR CULTURE. SO IT MIGHT BE DOWN NOW, BUT IT'S GROWING AND SHOWING THAT WE AS A COUNTRY ARE GETTING BETTER.
Stephen: WHO DO YOU PLAY IN THIS MOVIE?
I PLAY ROBERT GREEN, A VIETNAM VET THAT JUST GOT BACK TO AMERICA AND LIKE MOST AFRICAN-AMERICAN SOLDIERS FROM VIETNAM, THEY WERE VERY DISHEARTENED BY THE WAY THEY WERE TREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND SPECIFICALLY THE MILITARY WHEN THEY GOT BACK TO THE STATES. HE WAS AT THE ALGIERS HOTEL WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE, JUST MAN LOOKING FOR WORK.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP. JIM?
THIS RIGHT THERE, PARATROOPER EIGHT YEARS, TWO DEPLOYMENTS, HONORABLE DISCHARGE.
Stephen: DISCHARGE. THIS IS A FAKE. NO, SIR. THIS YOUR GIRL? I JUST MET HER. WHAT'S HIS NAME? I DON'T KNOW. HIS NAME IS KARL GREEN. I WASN'T ASKING YOU, I WAS ASKING HER.
YOU JUST SAID WHAT'S HIS NAME.
YOU'RE LUCKY I HAVEN'T BROKEN YOUR (BLEEP) NECK YET.
ALL RIGHT, MAN, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I'M NOT GOING TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE, OKAY? BUT I'M NOT GONNA LIE DOWN FOR YOU EITHER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BASED ON A TRUE PERSON, THAT PERSON BASED ON A REAL CHARACTER?
YEAH, YEAH. IN THE MOVIE, IT'S KARL GREEN. IN REAL LIFE, HIS NAME WAS ROBERT GREEN, AND HE WAS THE PERSON WHO CAME OUT AND SPOKE OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE HOTEL. HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO SPEAK UP AND TALK ABOUT THE INJUSTICE THAT WAS GOING ON DURING THE UPRISING IN DETROIT.
Stephen: NOW, 50 YEARS LATER, THERE IS STILL A STRAINED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND A LOT OF CITIES.
YEP.
Stephen: MAKING THIS MOVIE, DID IT TEACH YOU ANYTHING? DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION TODAY?
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, THERE'S THIS GREAT THING THAT WE HAVE AS A GENERATION THAT'S BEEN LOST CALLED COMMUNICATION. IT'S REALLY AN ART FORM. YOU KNOW, I WENT TO ACTING SCHOOL FOR FOUR YEARS AT JUILLIARD TO LEARN HOW TO LISSEN AND I FEEL LIKE NOW SO MANY YOUNG MEN WANT TO YELL AND TALK ABOUT THE POLICE AND THE POLICE WANT TO YELL AND TALK ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN BUT NEITHER ONE IS HEARING WHAT THE OTHER IS SAYING. IF YOU JUST STOP AND LISTEN, I THINK IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING FEAT FOR OUR GENERATION. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU SAID AGAIN YOU WENT TO JUILLIARD. I WAS JUST WONDERING, YOU STILL HAVE A LITTLE NEW ORLEANS ACCENT.
LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: WHEN YOU FIRST GOT TO JUILLIARD, I ASSUME YOU HAD A THICKER ONE.
OH, I STILL DO. I'M JUST BEING POLITE SINCE WE'RE ON TV. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IT'S A CLASSIC ACTING EDUCATION THERE. I'M SURE YOU DO THE CLASSICS THERE. DID THEY TRY TO BREAK YOU OF YOUR ACCENT BEFORE YOU COULD DO SHAKESPEARE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
OH, YEAH. GOING TO JUILLIARD IS LIKE WORKING AT MCDONALD'S. YOU ARE IN CLASS ALL DAY EVERY DAY.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THAT McDONALD'S. ( LAUGHTER )
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOT TRYING TO SAY WHERE I STARTED MY CAREER, BUT -- BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT -- ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, YEAH, DID A LOT OF VOICE AND SPEECH AT JUILLIARD LEARNING FROM THE GREAT EDITH SKINNER TECHNIQUE.
Stephen: WAS THERE A SHAKESPEARE MONOLOGUE THEY HAD YOU DO TO BREAK YOU OF YOUR --
MY AWE DINGS MONOLOGUE WAS EDMUND FROM KING LEAR, AND, IRONICALLY ENOUGH, DURING MY AWE DINGS, I DIDN'T THINK I GOT IN BECAUSE THEY LAUGHED DURING THE MUD -- MIDDLE OF MY AWE DINGS, I WAS SO BAD. BUT IT WORKED OUT. I GUESS I WAS JUST COUNTRY ENOUGH.
Stephen: A LITTLE SHAKESPEARE WITH A NEW ORLEANS ACCENT?
OH, WOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. THOU NATURE ARE MY GODDESS. TO THY LAW MY SERVICES ARE BOUND. WHEREVER SHOULD I STAND IN THE PLAGUE OF CUSTOM AND PERMIT THE CURIOSITY OF NATIONS TO DEPRIVE ME FOR I AM SOME 12 OR 14 MOON SHINES LAG OF A BROTHER. WHEREFORE BEST. WHERE ART THOU BASE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.
THANKS, MAN.
STEPHEN: "DETROIT" OPENS NATIONWIDE TOMORROW. ANTHONY MACKIE, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT AS THE SCARLET WITCH IN "THE AVENGERS" MOVIES. SHE NOW STARS AS AN F.B.I. AGENT IN THE NEW FILM, "WIND RIVER."
I'M JUNE BANNER. YOU BY YOURSELF? EAH, JUST ME. I'M THE TRIBAL POLICE CHIEF. THAT'S COREY LAMBERT WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE. THAT'S WHERE I FOUND THE BODY. THIS IS HIS FATHER-IN-LAW, DAN. HE DON'T DO NOTHING.
WE GOT THE SAME JOB, ED. LL, I'M SORRY TO MEET UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME THE BODY? I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE. I'M JUST FREEZING MY ASS OFF HERE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME ELIZABETH OLSEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HI. HI!
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
Stephen: NOW, LISTEN THE AVENGERS ARE TAKING OVER THE SHOW TONIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE, SCARLETT WITCH, ANTHONY MACKIE WAS THERE. IS THERE ANY CHANCE I'M IN THE AVENGERS AND I DON'T KNOW IT? HAVE I BEEN CAST BY LOKI?
HAVE YOU SIGNED ANY TOP SECRET PAPERS RECENTLY?
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO SIGN TOP SECRET PAPERS TO BE IN THE MARVEL N.C.U.?
I THINK SO. I THINK I SIGNED A LOT OF THINGS BEFORE I JOINED.
Stephen: I'M A FAN. EVERYBODY I HAVE ON FROM ONE OF THESE MOVIES, I TRY TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THEM, AND THEY'RE SO TIGHT-LIPPED. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT AVERSION MOVE -- AVENGERS MOVIE?
THIS TIME, THEY DECIDED NOT TO GIVE US SCRIPTS.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE AND DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT?
THEY GAVE ME MY PAGES AND ARE EXPLAINING WHAT OTHER THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
Stephen: SO WHEN YOU DO SEE THE MOVIE --
I WILL BE SO SHOCKED AND SURPRISED. I WILL BE, LIKE, OH, I SEE, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE WORLD AT THAT TIME.
Stephen: THE NEW MOVIE IS "WIND RIVER," YOU PLAY AN F.B.I. AGENT. WHAT KIND OF F.B.I. AGENT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? ARE WE TALKING ABOUT LIKE X FILES OR SILENCE OF THE LAMS?
SHE'S ON A RESERVATION, DOESN'T KNOW THE LAND OR THE COMMUNITY, BUT IT'S A CRIME THRILLER.
Stephen: THE WIND RIVER RESERVATION IN WYOMING.
YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU FILM THERE?
NO, IN PARK CITY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Stephen: THERE GO MY NEXT QUESTIONS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO GO TO THE WIND RIVER RESERVATION, IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL. IT'S GREAT. ( LAUGHTER ) STHA IS THAT REAL SNOW?
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO GET IT DONE IN ONE TAKE? DO THEY GO, IT'S SNOWING, GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.
WHEN WE WOULD HAVE A BLIZZARD, WE WOULD BE REALLY EXCITED. IT WAS FRUSTRATING WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE SNOW BECAUSE WE'RE RIDING SNOWMOBILES IN THE MOVIE.
Stephen: THEY'RE SUPER FUN. I DON'T LIKE ADRENALINE RUSHES.
Stephen: YOU'RE IN "THE AVENGERS"! ( LAUGHTER )
BUT THOSE ARE REALLY SAFE ENVIRONMENTS. YOU HAVE, LIKE, A STUNT COORDINATOR --
Stephen: THEY PUT YOU ON WIRES AND STUFF, DON'T THEY?
WHICH IS SO MUCH FUN.
Stephen: IS IT? YEAH, I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING THE FIRST TIME THEY DID A PULL WITH ME. I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES STRAIGHT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY STOMACH WAS UNCONTROLLABLE.
Stephen: I'VE DONE IT ONCE. THEY HAVE YOU CRANKED IN THERE TIGHT.
YEAH, THEIR HIPS ARE REALLY IN THERE.
Stephen: THEY HAVE LITTLE BOLTS THAT CAN DIG INTO YOU.
IT'S A CORSET.
