THIS FALL ON T.N. -- OOPS, NEVER MINDISH IT'S ALREADY BEEN CANCELED.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN --
COLBERT! IT'S "RUSSIA WEEK"! TONIGHT STEPHEN W WELCOMES KENNE BRANAGH AND CARA DELEVINGNE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! PLUS, STEPHEN FEATURES AMERICANS WITH RUSSIANS IN MOSCOW! AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING RUSSIAN VERSION OF THEME SONG ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU! OH, I SEE. I DIDN'T KNOW.
HEY, EVERYBODY! HOW ARE YA?
Stephen: PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. OH, THAT'S A FRIDAY CROWD RIGHT THERE. IT'S MAGICAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S ELECTRIC! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEAR THAT? THAT IS FRIDAY. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU MIGHT BE UPSET ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE MAN WHO WON IT. BECAUSE TRUMP'S COMMISSION ON ELECTION INTEGRITY HELD ITS FIRST MEETING.
I'M HONORED TO WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY AS THE PRESIDENTIAL BIPARTISAN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON ELECTION INTEGRITY PREPARES TO CONDUCT THEIR FIRST MEETING. VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. THIS COMMISSION IS TASKED WITH UPHOLDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOT BOX, AND THE PRINCIPAL OF ONE CITIZEN, ONE VOTE.
STEPHEN: YES. ONE CITIZEN, ONE VOTE. BUT HE DIDN'T SAY CITIZEN OF WHAT COUNTRY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH, WHOA! HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY THAT!
Stephen: WE CALL THAT A LOOPHOLE. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS WHOLE COMMISSION STARTED AFTER TRUMP LOST THE POPULAR VOTE AND TWEETED THIS, BACK IN NOVEMBER -- "IN ADDITION TO WINNING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IN A LANDSLIDE, I WON THE POPULAR VOTE, IF YOU DEDUCT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED ILLEGALLY." ( BOOING )
Stephen: I KNOW. BUT REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO READ A TRUMP TWEET AND THINK, "WELL THAT'S IT. IT'LL NEVER GET CRAZIER THAN THIS!" ( LAUGHTER ) JUST A REMINDER, THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY EVIDENCE THAT WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD EXISTS. A REVIEW OF THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FOUND JUST FOUR CASES OF DOCUMENTED VOTER FRAUD, OUT OF MORE THAN 134 MILLION BALLOTS CAST. AND HALF OF THOSE WERE PEOPLE TRYING TO VOTE FOR A NEW SKITTLES COLOR. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S GOT TO BE BLUE. BUT, IF WE ALREADY KNOW THERE WEREN'T MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL VOTES, THEN WHAT IS THIS COMMISSION DOING? THE MAN WITH THE ANSWER IS KANSAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND GUY WHO HAS DEFINITELY HIT A MANATEE WITH HIS BOAT, KRIS KOBACH, WHO THE A.C.L.U. HAS CALLED "THE KING OF VOTER SUPPRESSION." AND THE COMMISSION ISN'T JUST QUESTIONING THE LAST ELECTION. THEY'RE ALSO MESSING WITH THE NEXT ONE BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST ACTIONS WAS REQUESTING THE FULL NAMES, ADDRESSES, BIRTH DATES, POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND VOTING HISTORIES OF EVERY REGISTERED VOTER IN THE COUNTRY. THAT -- THAT -- ( BOOING ) -- YES, THAT IS SO WRONG. VOTING IN THIS COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THOSE BOOTHS WITH THE CURTAIN-- SO YOU CAN GO IN THERE, VOTE IN SECRET, AND TRY ON A FEW PAIRS OF PANTS WHILE YOU'RE AT IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: SO PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THEY HAND THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION OVER TO THE COMMISSION. SO, TRUMP FOLKS CALMED THOSE FEARS BY RELEASING 112 PAGES OF UNREDACTED EMAILS OF PUBLIC COMMENTS, WITHOUT DELETING THE SENDERS' EMAIL ADDRESSES. IT'S A SIMPLE MISTAKE. YOU KNOW THAT THING WHERE YOU ACCIDENTALLY HIT "C.C." INSTEAD OF "B.C.C."? AND THEN HIGHLIGHT ALL THE EMAILS AND HIT "CONTROL C," AND THEN PASTE THEM ONTO YOUR WEBSITE AND HIT "PUBLISH"? OOPS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TRUMP HAD SOME ENCOURAGING WORDS FOR ANY STATES THAT ARE FEELING HESITANT ABOUT VIOLATING THEIR VOTERS' PRIVACY.
IF ANY STATE DOES NOT WANT TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION, ONE HAS TO WONDER WHAT THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT. AND I ASK THE VICE PRESIDENT, I ASK THE COMMISSION, WHAT ARE THEY WORRIED ABOUT? THERE'S SOMETHING. THERE ALWAYS IS.
STEPHEN: "IF YOU LOOK INTO ANYTHING, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING-- EXCEPT WITH RUSSIA, THAT'S FAKE NEWS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SOMETHING, NOTHING. SPEAKING OF WHICH, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DON, JR.'S RUSSIA MEETING LAST YEAR. IN FACT, THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JUST ANNOUNCED THEY'VE SCHEDULED HIM TO TESTIFY ON JULY 26 -- OR AS DON JR. WOULD SAY, "SOME PEOPLE ASKED ME TO COME TO A MEETING, I DON'T WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT IT'S ABOUT. MAYBE ADOPTIONS? I LOVE IT, ESPECIALLY LATER THIS SUMMER." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD SAY.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD SAY!
Stephen: NOW, IF YOU RECALL, AT FIRST, WHEN HE WAS FIRST CONFRONTED WITH THE EVIDENCE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS MEETING, DONALD, JR. SAID THE ONLY PERSON, THEN THERE WAS TWO, THEN THERE WAS-- WHAT COMES AFTER TWO? FIVE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: YES.
Stephen: FIVE. AND WE FINALLY FOUND OUT WHO THE FIFTH RUSSIAN AT THE MEETING WAS. HE'S A RUSSIAN AMERICAN NAMED IKE KAVELADZE, WHO IS, REPORTEDLY, A MONEY LAUNDERER, ACCUSED OF LAUNDERING MORE THAN $1.4 BILLION. YEAH, WELL, LISTEN -- MAKES SENSE THAT TRUMP WOULD NEED A RUSSIAN GUY WHO'S GOOD AT LAUNDERING, JUST TO GET THE STAINS OUT OF THE MATTRESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ALLEGEDLY. THANK YOU. AND THIS NEW GUY JUST ADDS INTRIGUE TO A GROUP THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A "VARIED CAST OF CHARACTERS." WAIT A MINUTE! WAIT A MINUTE! A VAIR YESTERDAY CAST OF CHARACTERS? I JUST REALIZED WHAT THIS MEETING IS. IT'S A HEIST MOVIE! THEY GOT THE WHOLE RAG-TAG TEAM. THERE'S THE MONEY LAUNDERER. THE FIXER. THE MASTER OF DISGUISE. THE ONE WOMAN. THE BUMBLING RICH KID TRYING TO PROVE HIMSELF TO HIS DAD. HIS MUTE BROTHER-IN-LAW. AND A COUPLE GUYS WHO AREN'T GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE MOVIE. THEY JUST NEED THE BLONDE BOMBSHELL AND THE BUMBLING LOOK-OUT WHO GETS DISTRACTED BY A SANDWICH. IT ALL GOES DOWN IN "COLLUSION'S 11." COMING THIS SUMMER TO A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION NEAR YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. KENNETH BRANAGH IS HERE, BUT POUR YOURSELF A GLASS OF VODKA BECAUSE, WHEN WE COME BACK, MORE FROM MY TRIP TO RUSSIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! GIVE IT UP RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAPPY FRIDAY, JON. I'M ALMOST SAD IT'S FRIDAY BECAUSE THAT MEANS WE'RE SAYING GOODBYE TO THE HISTORIC "RUSSIA WEEK," NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN LATE NIGHT, AND IT'S THE EXCITING FINALE OF THE "RUSSIA WEEK" NOW BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A A FIVE-DAY CELEBRATION OF ME BEING ALLOWED TO COME BACK TO AMERICA. TONIGHT, WE THANK THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AND BID THEM FAREWELL.
STEPHEN:  I'VE SPENT A WEEK WITH THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, WHO HAVE TAUGHT ME SO MUCH ABOUT THEIR CULTURE. SO, BEFORE I LEFT, I HIT THE STREETS OF MOSCOW TO REPAY THEM WITH A TASTE OF AMERICANA. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO TEACH YOU SOME AMERICAN PHRASES.
OH, GREAT.
STEPHEN: SO WE CAN BRIDGE A CULTURAL CONNECTION. OKAY? CASH ME OUSSIDE, HOW BOUT DAT?
OH!
STEPHEN: DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?
FOR ME, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
STEPHEN: IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE FOR ME EITHER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD COVFEFE MEANS?
IN RUSSIA, PEOPLE ARE CRAZY ABOUT THIS WORD BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT MEANS EMBARRASSMENT. OR SOMETHING. JUST NO, IT'S JUST FAILURE. AND JUST--
STEPHEN: COVFEFE IS A RUSSIA WORD THAT MEANS EMBARRASSMENT AND FAILURE?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
STEPHEN: BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS IN ENGLISH RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A FOOD IN AMERICA, THAT WE CALL SLIM JIM. OKAY? IT IS A PROCESSED MEAT STICK. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TASTE THAT?
YES.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
MMMMN. IT'S LIKE SAUSAGES.
STEPHEN: IT IS LIKE SAUSAGE, YEAH. IT'S AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF SALT.
IS IT NATURAL?
STEPHEN: IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL. AND YOU CAN SEE, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST HAIR PACKED INTO A TUBE. BUT IT'S DELICIOUS MEAT. THIS IS CALLED A POP TART. OKAY? THAT'S A BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON POP TART. YOU MIGHT HAVE THIS FOR BREAKFAST, IF YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE MOTHER.
( LAUGHS )
STEPHEN: HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
I FEEL ENERGY.
STEPHEN: YOU FEEL ENERGY. THAT'S THE POP TART WORKING. IT'S DELICIOUS.
IS IT FULL OF PROTEINS?
STEPHEN: OH, IT'S PACKED WITH PROTEINS, YES. AND, IS SUGAR A PROTEIN?
UM, YES.
STEPHEN: THEN IT'S GOT A LOT OF PROTEIN. THIS IS CALLED THE HALF-HUG.
HALF HUG.
STEPHEN: OR THE BRO-HUG.
BRO HUG.
STEPHEN: SO WE SHAKE HANDS LIKE THIS, AND THEN--
OKAY.
STEPHEN: THEN WE COME IN...
OKAY.
STEPHEN: AND WE DO THIS.
OKAY.
STEPHEN: BUT WE KEEP THIS BETWEEN US--
OKAY.
STEPHEN: --SO THERE'S NO SENSE OF REAL AFFECTION. THIS IS THE TRUMP HANDSHAKE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SHOW YOU HOW THE PRESIDENT SHAKES HANDS?
OH YEAH, I LIKE THIS.
STEPHEN: OKAY, READY?
SURE. I'M READY. YOU'RE GOING TO TRUMP, YEAH?
STEPHEN: MMM-HMM, I'LL BE TRUMP.
OH, OKAY. OKAY, I WILL BE JUSTIN TRUDEAU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: EVER HAD A RICE KRISPIES TREAT? THIS IS THE GREATEST INVENTION AMERICA EVER CAME UP WITH. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PROTEIN THERE WAS IN THAT POP TART? NOTHING COMPARED TO HOW MUCH PROTEIN YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN THIS. DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS?
IT'S THE WIFE OF--
IT'S THE WIFE OF--
PRESIDENT CLINTON.
PRESIDENT CLINTON.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. SHE USED TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
GOD DECIDED--
STEPHEN: GOD DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT.
YES.
STEPHEN: SO THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS? ( FIREWORKS GOING OFF )
STEPHEN: OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO. IT'S A CHEESE IN A CAN. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN CHEESE IN A CAN?
NO. NEVER.
STEPHEN: IT'S CHEESE. AND YOU SQUEEZE THIS, AND CHEESE SHOOTS OUT. YOU CAN PUT IT ON A CRACKER, OR YOU CAN JUST GO, AHHHH-- MMM, MMM! I REGRET THAT.
WHAT ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS?
STEPHEN: WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS? YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. OKAY THIS ONE'S CALLED TICKLE THE ROCKS.
OKAY.
STEPHEN: PUT YOUR FISTS OUT LIKE THIS.
STEPHEN: THIS WAY, YES? NOW DO THIS.
OH, WHAT IS DOING?
Stephen: I'M TICKLING THE ROCKS.
OH.
STEPHEN: AND THIS IS CALLED THE ARMS RACE, OKAY?
ARMS RACE.
STEPHEN: SHAKE, AND THEN--
OH, JESUS CHRIST!
STEPHEN: YOU DO IT TO ME, TOO, READY? SOMEONE MUST HAVE TOLD VLADAMIR I WAS HERE. THIS IS SO THOUGHTFUL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THIS ON A POP TART?
YES.
STEPHEN: OKAY GREAT.
DO YOU LIKE IT?
YES.
STEPHEN: DO YOU WANT SOME MORE? ME, TOO.
ME, TOO.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE ANY WATER STANDING BY? ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN YOU THINK OF AMERICANS, WHAT QUALITIES DO YOU THINK OF?
TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH FAT. TOO MUCH WEIGHT.
TOO MUCH FAT.
STEPHEN: OKAY, WELL, WE'RE WORKING ON IT. IT'S A PASTRY. THERE'S CREAM INSIDE. IT'S VACUUM-FORMED AND INJECTED UNDER HIGH PRESSURE. YOU LIKE THAT?
INTERESTING. YES.
STEPHEN: CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE AN AMERICAN NOW.
( LAUGHS ) THANK YOU.
STEPHEN: WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HAILED AT THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING, WHOSE BROAD STRIPES--
IS THIS JANET JACKSON?
STEPHEN: YES, THIS IS A JANET JACKSON HIT. SHE SANG IT. SHE HAD A BIG HIT WITH THIS SONG. AND WHAT BETTER FINALE TO BRIDGING THE CULTURAL DIVIDE, THEN SINGING THE RUSSIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM WITH THE LYRICS TO OURS? ( RUSSIANS SINGING THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM )
STEPHEN: OH, SAY CAN YOU SEE BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT OH, OH, OH, OH IT'S A PARTY IN THE U.S.A. OH, PARTY IN THE U.S.A. OH, PARTY IN THE U.S.A. ( RUSSIANS SINGING THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM )
STEPHEN: I'M A JOKER AND A SMOKER I'M A MIDNIGHT TOKER SOME CALL ME SPACE COWBOY SOME CALL ME THE GANGSTER OF LOVE FROM MOSCOW, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY JULY 4TH! WHOOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: THAT'S IT FOR RUSSIA WEEK. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY. PLEASE STOP BY! WE LOVE YOU! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! WITH KENNETH BRANAGH! STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU HAVE SEEN HIM IN EVERYTHING FROM "HAMLET" TO "HARRY POTTER." PLEASE WELCOME FIVE-TIME ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE KENNETH BRANAGH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) GOOD TO SEE YOU! COME RIGHT OVER HERE, SIR. AH, WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE.
WE HAVE NOT.
Stephen: I'M SUCH A FAN. EVER SINCE HENRY V. WE GOT TO KNOW YOU IN AMERICA, EXTRAORDINARY DEBUT FOR US. CHEERS AND "DUNKIRK."
YEAH.
Stephen: WHICH HASN'T BEEN RELEASED. IT'S GOING TO BE THE MOVIE OF THE SUMMER. PEOPLE SAY IT'S INCREDIBLY EXCITING, DEEPLY AFFECTING, SHOWING BOTH THE HORROR OF WAR AND THE BEAUTY OF HUMAN SACRIFICE AND LOVE FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN AND WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO FOR BOTH COUNTRY AND HUMANITY. BUT WE IN AMERICA DON'T KNOW THE STORY OF "DUNKIRK" VERY WELL. DID YOU GROW UP WITH THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED?
WE GREW UP WITH "DUNKIRK" SPIRIT WHICH IS THIS SENSE OF NEVER SURRENDER, AND IT WAS BORN OUT OF 1940, 40,000 MEN, MOSTLY BRITISH, WERE FORCED ON THE ISLAND OF "DUNKIRK."
Stephen: "DUNKIRK" IS THERE, THEN FRANCE. 26 MILES?
26 MILES. THE ENTIRE BRITISH ARMY WERE TRAPPED THERE AND THE GERMAN FORCES HAD THEM UNDER ATTACK WITH LAND FORCES FROM ABOVE AND SEA. THERE WAS A THING CALLED OPERATION DYNAMO AND IT WAS TO GET THE MEN BACK HOME. IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND PRODUCED AN AMAZING MIRACLE WHICH WAS TO INVITE THE CIVILIAN FLEET OF BOATS FROM THE SOUTHERN HALF OF ENENGLAND TO COME AND HELP.
Stephen: FISHING BOATS. 15-FOOT BOTH.
26 MILES. 400,000 PEOPLE, THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE EXPECTATION, THE HOPE FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL WHO HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER FOR 16 DAYS AT THAT POINT WAS THAT MAYBE THEY WOULD GET 30,000 MEN BACK. THAT'S WHAT THEY HOPED FOR. IN THE END, 360 PEOPLE WERE RESCUED FROM THAT BEACH ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AMAZING. AND THE THING IS THAT THIS IS THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE, THIS IS THE BRITISH ARMY.
EXACTLY IS THAT YOU'RE ALL IN HERE. IF THIS FORCE GETS WIPED OUT, IT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH DIFFERENT WAR FOR ALL THE ALLIES.
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. IF THAT RESCUE HADN'T OCCURRED, IF HOME HADN'T COME FOR THEM, IF EVERY SORT OF MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD HADN'T COME ACROSS THE 26 MILES OF WOULD YOU HAVE WATER UN-- COME ACROSS ROUGH WATER UNDER ATTACK, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED FOR EUROPE AND THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF YOURS. THANK GOODNESS. PART OF WHAT HAPPENED WAS I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE RESPONDED WITH SOME DELIGHT AND SURPRISE AND AWE AND SAW SOME "DUNKIRK" SPIRIT AND I THINK IT HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE DECISION TO COME HELP US.
Stephen: D.-DAY WAS A DIRECT REVERSAL FROM THIS MOMENT, NOT FAR FROM THAT SPOVMENT NORMANDY IS JUST DOWN THE BEACH A BIT.
IT'S AMAZING. ALL THOSE PEOPLE LEFT IN 1940 AND WITH YOUR HELP CAME BACK FOUR YEARS LATER. WE MET SOME "DUNKIRK" VETERANS LAST WEEK AT THE PREMIERE.
Stephen: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY.
AMAZING. I SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE FILM? THEY SAID, THE FILM WAS LOUDER THAN THE BATTLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS. WHICH I THINK REALLY TICKLED CHRIS NO LAND. THEY SAID EVERYTHING CHRIS NO LAND PUTS IN THE MOVIE WAS AS THEY EXPERIENCED IT. IN THAT SENSE, IT WAS BEYOND EXHILARATING AND SCARY, BUT THE NOISE OF THE BOMBS AT "DUNKIRK" DID FOUL ON THE AIR. IT'S A MASSIVE STRETCH OF BEACH. BUT TRAPPED IN CHRIS NO LAND'S AMAZING VISION OF THIS CONFLICT, YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE SOUND OF THE BOMBS.
Stephen: NING THIS CLIP, YOU ARE ROYAL COMMANDER WHO?
BOLTON, A NAVAL COMMANDER. THIS WAS A PIECE WHERE THE TENSION BETWEEN THE NAVY AND THE ARMY ABOUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET THE MEN OFF THIS BEACH.
Stephen: JIM? BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN PRACTICALLY SEE IT.
SEEING HOME DOESN'T HELP US GET THERE, COLONEL.
THEY NEED TO SEND MORE SHIPS. EVERY HOUR THE ENEMY PUSHES CLOSER.
THEY'VE ACTIVATED THE SMALL VESSELS.
SMALL VESSELS? THE LIST OF CIVILIAN BOATS FOR REQUISITION.
CIVILIAN? WE NEED DESTROYERS.
SMALL BOATS GET CLOSER TO THE BEACH.
NOT IN THESE CONDITIONS. I WOULD RATHER FACE WAVES THAN DIVE BOMBERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I LOVE THIS STORY. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE. WHEN I WAS A BOY THE FIRST BOOK I CHOSE TO READ IN A SINGLE SITTING WAS SILENCE OVER "DUNKIRK." IT'S AN AMAZING STORY. I CAN'T WAIT. ONE OF THE INCREDIBLE THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT, ACE SAID, WE FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOU IN "HENRY V," WHICH ENDS WITH A BATTLE WHICH IS JUST BELOW WHERE THAT D IS IN "DUNKIRK" THERE, AND THAT'S, WHAT, 800 YEARS AGO?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: SO BATTLES HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THIS.
THEY HAVE. I THINK IN HENRY, THIS BATTLE WAS ANOTHER AMAZING UNDERSTORY PIECE OF DRAMA. 5,000 BRITS AGAINST 30,000 FRENCH AND THEY WON IN AN INCREDIBLE REVERSAL OF FORTUNE. SOMETHING ABOUT THE UNDERDOG STORY, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS PART OF YOUR INTEREST IN READING THAT BOOK, BUT THE HUMAN MIRACLE OF "DUNKIRK" IS WHAT TAKES YOU PERSONALLY INTO THE HEART OF THESE STORIES. ONE OF THE AMAZING THINGS OF CHRIS NO LAND'S FILM IS YOU'RE AWARE OF ITS SCALE. SUCH A WHITE KNUCKLE EXPERIENCE. IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE, YOU NEED TO GET READY FOR SOMETHING. BUT YOU EXPERIENCE THE EPIC THING, BEING AMONG THE 4 MILLION, AND FEELING THE BOMBS AND BOATS AND WEATHER CHANGING, BUT YOU RELIVE IT IN PERSONAL STORIES AND INVITE YOU TO GO, WHAT WOULD I DO? I'VE SEEN IT THREE TIMES. THE FIRST TIME, I WAS AWASH, IT WAS SO EMOTIONAL. THE SECOND TIME, I FOUND MYSELF UNDERSTANDING HOW BRILLIANT CHRIS NO LAND'S SCHEME WAS, AND THE THIRD TIME I WAS EXHILARATED BIT, ADMIRING IT SO MUCH. IT'S THAT HUMAN TOUCH. HE PUTS THE PERSONAL AND THE EPIC TOGETHER. HE'S DONE A WONDERFUL THING. HATS OFF TO HIM. IT'S MARVELOUS.
Stephen: I HAD A FRIEND WHO SAW IT AND SHE SAID IT IS A DEEPLY EMOTIONALLY AFFECTING MOVIE, AND SHE SAID IT'S LIKE A TWO-HOUR PANIC ATTACK THAT YOU'RE SO GLAD YOU HAD.
I FEEL YOU SHOULD TAKE A BOX BEFORE YOU GO IN AND SAY FIGHT OR FLIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY IN AN ADRENALIZED MOMENT. WHAT HE DOES, HE SEEMS TO MAKE THE AUDIENCE SORT OF SIGN SOMETHING THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK. YOU WILL ONLY HAVE TIME TO FEEL AND REACT JUST LIKE THESE PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE SO THAT BY THE END OF IT YOU FEEL YOU ARE RIGHT THERE WITH THEM.
Stephen: AS I WAS SAYING, I FIRST GOT TO KNOW YOU IN HENRY V AND WE'VE SEEN YOUR HAMLET AND YOUR "AS YOU LIKE IT." DID YOU ALWAYS LOVE SHAKESPEARE? EVEN AS A BOY DID YOU TAKE TO IT?
NO, I CAME FROM A WORKING CLASS BELFAST FAMILY AND MY PARENTS WERE NOT REMOTELY ASSOCIATED WITH BOOKS OR SHAKESPEARE.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ACCENT?
I GUESS WHEN I WAS NINE I CAME TO ENGLAND, AND AT THAT TIME I GUESS YOU WANT TO JUST KIND OF BLEND IN AND FIT.
Stephen: SURE. FRANKLY, ALSO, YOU WANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD. AND PEOPLE WERE SO INCREDIBLY INTOLERANT OF ACCENTS. I THINK PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE TOLERANT OF ACCENTS NOW, DON'T YOU THINK.
Stephen: AH -- SURE. ACCEPTING THIS GREAT DIVERSITY.
Stephen: SURE, YEAH. BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE YOUR ACCENT AS A BOY?
WELL, I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF RIBBING ABOUT IT.
Stephen: DOES IT COME BACK IS THIS.
OF COURSE, IT DOES, STEPHEN. MY ACCENT COMES BACK BECAUSE I THINK IF THERE WAS A SECOND MOVIE OF TIRKIN I COULD POSSIBLY PLAY LIAM NEESON'S GRAND-DAD AND SAY I HAVE A VERY PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS ( LAUGHTER ) AND IF YOU DO NOT RETURN MY DAUGHTER TO ME, I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL KILL YOU. ( IN IRISH ACCENT ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I INTERRUPTED YOU BE SHAKESPEARE. YOU'RE A YOUNG BOY OR MAN AND DIDN'T LIKE IT?
WE WERE ASKED TO READ IT WHEN I WAS 13 IN SCHOOL. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN READING THE PHONE DIRECTORY. WE WENT TO SEE ROMEO AND JULIET. I FELT DURING THAT SHOW I WENT THROUGH PUBERTY. IT WAS SO THRILLING. THERE WERE FIGHTS AND GANGS. I WANTED TO BE IN THE GANGS. IT SEEMED KIND OF COOL. THE GUY CLIMBED THE BALCONY LOOKED PRETTY BUTCH, THAT WOULD BE THE WAY TO GET THE GIRL, YOU KNOW, HE SPOKE A LOT. I THOUGHT, THAT'S A TECHNIQUE AS WELL. I THOUGHT, MAYBE I SHOULD SPEAK A LOT AND HANG OUT ON THE BALCONIES. BUT IT WAS MAINLY, I THINK, FRANKLY, SHAKESPEARE EQUALS SEX, THAT'S WHAT GOT ME.
Stephen: YEAH, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ALONE. LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
Stephen: "DUNKIRK" OPENS TODAY. IT'S OUT NOW. KENNETH BRANAGH, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ACTRESS AND MODEL YOU KNOW FROM "SUICIDE SQUAD" AND EVERY MAGAZINE COVER. SHE NOW STARS IN "VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS."
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU GUYS HOW TO DO YOUR JOBS BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD CUFF ME? FIRST BECAUSE IT'S PROTOCOL BUT SECONDLY BECAUSE I'M VERY TERRORISTED TO ESCAPE.
GOOD JOB, BOYS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME CARA DELEVINGNE!
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL OUTFIT! YOU JUST LOOK LIKE A FLOATING HEAD WHEN THIS WAS BROADCAST.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING.
Stephen: YOU EVEN HAVE CLOTHING ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD LOOK AT THAT!
I THINK I MUST HAVE LAID DOWN IN THE TINFOIL AGAIN.
Stephen: IT'S GREAT. YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR HEAD IS FROM THE FUTURE.
GOT TO KEEP IT FUTURISTIC. AHEAD OFFOF THE TIMES.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST MODELING?
I THINK I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT EIGHT, NINE OR TEN, YEAH.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU IN THIS PHOTO RIGHT HERE? CAN I ASK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PHOTO RIGHT THERE?
WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE? SO BASICALLY, I WAS A BIT OF A -- I THINK MY, UM, RELATIONSHIP WITH FASHION, I THINK MY PARENTS TRIED TO KEEP CLOTHES ON ME MOST OF THE TIME. I WAS MORE INTO THE NUDEST THING AS A KID AND ONE DAY AFTER SCHOOL MY MOM PICKED ME UP AND TOOK ME TO A PLACE WHERE A GUY WAS WITH A CAMERA. THAT SOUNDS WEIRD, DOESN'T IT?
Stephen: MM-HMM. BUT ACTUALLY, IT WAS FUNNY. I I WAS DOING A SHOOT WITH A DOG. AND EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING. THE PUG KEPT GETTING AN ERECTION AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON.
Stephen: THE STORY IS NOT GETTING BETTER.
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHY DO YOU HAVE LIZA MINELLI? WHAT PRODUCT IS BEING SOLD IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH? ARE WE SELLING THE HAT, THE POCKETBOOK? THIS MICK JAGGER T-SHIRT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I HAVE NO IDEA.
Stephen: WERE YOU EXCITED? DID YOU ENJOY THIS? OR DID YOU SAY, MOM, DO I HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN?
I WANTED TO GO BACK TO SPORTS DAY.
Stephen: YOU PLAYED SPORTS? YEAH, I LOVE GAMES A LOT.
Stephen: OKAY. ANYTHING I CAN WIN.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT? WHAT CAN YOU WIN? OH, HELL, YEAH!
OH, NO. I STOPPED TRAINING, SO THIS IS A BAD IDEA.
Stephen: YOU KICK AS IN THIS MOVIE. ONE --
OH, GOSH, DON'T HANDCUFF ME.
Stephen: -- TWO -- YOU CHEATED!
DID I?
Stephen: DO YOU START ON TWO IN ENGLAND? I'LL COUGH ON YOU. THERE YOU GO. SORRY. I BEAT A GIRL! I BEAT A GIRL!
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, RIGHT?
Stephen: I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOVIE, VALERIAN AND THE MOVIE OF A THOUSAND PLANETS AND NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE KICKING AS. AMAZING, UNBELIEVABLE HERO.
CINEMATIC, EXACTLY.
Stephen: I'VE SEEN CLIPS AND THE TRAILER. DID YOU SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE NOT WEARING PING-PONG BALLS?
IT WAS ABOUT 90% BLUE SCREEN. THERE WERE VERY LITTLE SETS. THE THING IS ABOUT LUKE INTRODUCED ME TO SCI-FI, THE FIFTH ELEMENT. HE PUSHES BOUNDARIES, AND IN THIS MOVIE ESPECIALLY, HE'S WANTED TO MAKE IT SINCE HE WAS A KID. VALERIAN IS A FRENCH COMIC BOOK THAT INSPIRED HIM TO WRITE AND DIRECT. ALL THE THINGS YOU SEE HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE HIS ENTIRE LIFE. HIS PASSION AND HIS LOVE, EVERY DAY, WE WALK IN, HE HAS THE BIGGEST SMILE. HE WALKED ON THE STAGE FOR TEN YEARS. AFTER FILMING HE WALKED ON IT ANOTHER YEAR, HE'S SO PASSIONATE AND HAPPY ABOUT IT.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED AN INDY.
YES.
Stephen: BUT THE MOST EXPENSIVE AT $180 MILLION.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT WAS SO EXPENSIVE?
WELL, I AM PRETTY EXPENSIVE ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WOW. I SAW YOU IN PAPER TOWNS FIRST, WHICH IS A REALLY LOVELY MOVIE. I WATCHED IT WITH MY KIDS AND YOU'RE AN AMERICAN IN THAT. AND SPOILER ALERT, YOU HAVE AN ENGLISH ACCENT.
YES.
Stephen: BUT IN THIS MOVIE YOU DON'T HAVE AN ENGLISH ACCENT. WHY IF YOU'RE IN SPACE YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR ENGLISH ACCENT?
IT WAS MEANT TO BE A MID ATLANTIC THING.
Stephen: OUT WITH THE TITANIC? YOU CAN DROWN OUT THERE. DON'T GO THERE.
IT WAS A MIXTURE OF WHAT AN ENGLISH-AMERICAN ACCENT WOULD SOUND LIKE. EVERYONE HAS A GENERAL ACCENT. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE STRANGE IF I HAD AN ENGLISH ACCENT AND DANE HAD AN AMERICAN ONE.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
I'VE NEVER DONE A MOVIE WITH AN ENGLISH ACCENT.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO? NO. I LOVE DOING ACCENTS. I GREW UP DOING THEM AS A KID. ACTUALLY, IT ANNOYED MY FAMILY A LOT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE ACCENT OTHER THAN AMERICAN? CAN YOU DO AN AMERICAN SOUTHERN ACCENT IN.
OKAY, SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT AND I'LL COPY.
Stephen: MY NAME IS STEPHEN COLBERT.
MY NAME IS STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: THAT'S REAL GOOD. THAT'S REAL GOOD.
Stephen: I NEVER MET A GIRL LIKE YOU BEFORE.
I NEVER MET A GIRL LIKE YOU BEFORE.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO ARM WRESTLE? ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S LOVELY.
I LIKE AN IRISH ACCENT.
Stephen: THAT'S TOUGH FOR AMERICANS TO DO.
DDO YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE BLAC OR WHITE.
Stephen: SOUTH AFRICAN IS THE HARDEST BECAUSE IT SLIPS INTO AUSTRALIAN FOR US. YOU GO BELOW THE EQUATOR AND WE'RE TOTALLY LOST. ( LAUGHTER ) DID YOU PRETEND YOU HAVE AN ACCENT WHEN YOU MEET STRANGERS.
WHEN I MEET SOMEBODY I GO OFFGRID AND SWITCH INTO ACCENTS AND FOR THEM TO GUESS WHERE I'M FROM, IT FREAKS PEOPLE OUT.
Stephen: WHERE IN ENGLAND ARE YOU FROM?
LONDON.
Stephen: STANDARD ENGLISH ACCENT.
MOST PEOPLE THINK I'M AUSTRALIAN. I'M, LIKE, SURE.
Stephen: THERE'S NO CANNING ROORKS YOU DON'T HAVE A KNIFE.
I DON'T. I'M NOT PUTTING SHRIMP ON THE BARBEE.
Stephen: WE BOTH ROCK A HARD EYEBROW GAME.
WE BOTH MODEL.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT. I JUST DO IT FOR SPORT. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY ASK ME TO LEAVE. BUT YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC EYEBROWS.
I MEAN, YOU ARE AN EYEBROW INSPIRATION TO ME. I'VE WATCHED THE THINGS YOU DO.
Stephen: AN EYEBROW-SPIRATION? ( LAUGHTER )
YOU BASICALLY HAVE A SIX-PACK RUNNING DOWN, I CAN SEE IT.
Stephen: IT'S THE ONLY PART OF MY BODY THAT'S FIT ARE MY EYEBROWS. DO YOU DO ANY EYEBROW TRICKS? I'LL DO MINE. LET'S DO THEM TOGETHER.
I LITERALLY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH RANGE. I'M SO IMPRESSED.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO DO A WAVE DOWN THEM. WE COULD HAVE PASSED IT ALONG.
Stephen: THE -- I KNOW, THE HOURS I'VE WASTED TRYING. THIS IS THE NEW COVER OF VOGUE, BY THE WAY, RIGHT HERE.

Stephen: THE MEETING ACTUALLY LASTED AS LONG AS AN HOUR. GENTLEMEN, IF YOUR COLLUSION LASTS LONGER THAN AN HOUR, PLEASE CONSULT THE F.B.I. SEE, THIS IS HOW THINGS WORK OVER IN RUSSIA. OVER THERE, THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS CONTROLLED BY WEALTHY ELITES WHO BUY INFLUENCE AND PULL STRINGS OF THE GOVERNMENT, WHEREAS IN AMERICA WE SPEAK ENGLISH.
THE COOLEST HAD THERE IS BECAUSE WE'RE OLIGARCHS. IT'S NOT A DUMB HAT AT ALL. CAN WE TOUCH TIPS? THERE. NOT A LOT OF MEN ARE COMFORTABLE DOING THAT.
