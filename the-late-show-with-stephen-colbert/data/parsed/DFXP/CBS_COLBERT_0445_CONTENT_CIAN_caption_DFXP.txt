TELLS REPORTERS IN ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE ROY MOORE QUOTE THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR PEOPLE WHO PREY ON CHILDREN.
AND NOW A RESPONSE FROM SATAN.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, I DON'T WANT ROY MOORE DOWN HERE, THAT GUY'S CREEPY. I DON'T WANT HIM SULLYING THE GOOD NAME OF OUR LAKE OF FECES. BESIDES WE HAVE SHOPPING MALLS DOWN HERE TOO. IN FACT, ONE OF MY FAVORITE TORTURES IS FORCING THE DAMNED TO SPEND ETERNITY IN A YANKEE KANDEL. VANILLA MANGO PEACH SALSA IN A CANDLE SCENT. THAT'S BAR BARIC. ALL THAT SAID, WE SHOULDN'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT ROY MOORE. I KNOW I'M WITHHOLDING MY JUDGEMENT UNTIL I HEAR FROM SEAN HANNITY, BIG FAN.
IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT ETTU FRANKEN, PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES BEN AFFLECK, GRETA GERWIG AND MUSICAL GUEST DEAD & COMPANY FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOOO! HOW ARE YOU? HEY, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU. PLEASE SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS-- (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: EVERY DAY IT SEEMS LIKE WE FIND OUT ABOUT ANOTHER HIGH-PROFILE SEXUAL HARASSER. AND TODAY IS NO EXCEPTION. BRACE YOURSELF, BECAUSE IT IS SENATOR AL FRANKEN. HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF KISSING AND GROPING A WOMAN WITHOUT HER CONSENT. COME ON, FRANKEN! I GUESS THERE ARE NO GOOD PEOPLE LEFT SO LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH. JUST TELL US WHATEVER YOU DID, JIMMY CARTER, BARACK OBAMA, TOM HANKS, MALALA. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: OH MY.
Stephen: AS A FELLOW COMEDIAN I LONG ADMIRED AL FRANKEN BUT I GOT TO SAY THIS DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR LOUIS C.K.'S SENATE HOPES. (LAUGHTER) HERE ARE THE DETAILS. STRAP IN. WHILE TOURING WITH THE USO IN 2006 FRANKEN YET A SKETCH WHERE HE GOT TO KISS THE FEMALE EMCEE LEANN TWEED EN, ACCORDING TO TWEEDEN DURING REHEARSAL HE CAME AT HER, PUT HIS HAND ON THE BACK OF HER HEAD, MASHED HIS LIPS AGAINST HERS AND AGGRESSIVELY STUCK HIS TONGUE IN HER MOUTH. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT IN SHOWBIZ, ACTORS CALL THAT TECHNIQUE, SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND IT DIDN'T STOP THEREMENT ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE TOUR, SHE FELL ASLEEP ON THE PLANE AND FRANKEN DECIDED TO TAKE THIS GOOFY PIC. OH BOY. THAT IS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE. SO THIS IS BAD. FRANKEN HAS RESPONDED SAYING I CERTAINLY DON'T REMEMBER THE REHEARSAL FOR THE SKIT IN THE SAME WAY BUT I SEND MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES TO LEANN. AS TO THE PHOTO, IT WAS CLEARLY INTENDED TO BE FUNNY BUT WASN'T. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. OKAY, INTENDED TO BE FUNNY BUT WASN'T. NO. YOUR MOVIE INSTITUTE SAVES HIS FAMILY WAS INTENDED TO BE FUNNY BUT WASN'T. THAT PHOTO WAS INTENDED TO EMBARRASS HER. THAT'S WHY HE DID IT WHILE SHE WAS ASLEEP. NOBODY GOES UP TO THEIR BUDDY WHEN IS HE AWAKE AND SAYS HEY, CAN I DRAW A PENIS ON YOUR FOREHEAD. FRANKEN LATER RELEASED A MORE COMPLETE APOLOGY IN WHICH HE SAID I'M ASKING THAT AN ETHICS INVESTIGATION BE UNDERTAKEN. AND I WILL GLADLY COOPERATE. WELL, THAT'S NICE. IT WOULD BE WRONG IN IF AN ETHICS INVESTIGATION WAS DONE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT. OF COURSE, FRANKEN IS JUST THE LATEST POLITICIAN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ALL WEEK WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE AND MAN WITHOUT BUYS HIS WARDROBE AT PARTY CITY, ROY MOORE. (LAUGHTER) YESTERDAY, YOU REMEMBER, YESTERDAY FOUR, FOUR, COUNT THEM, FOUR MORE WOMEN ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BRINGING THE GRAND TOTAL TO WAY TOO MANY. (LAUGHTER) AND GOOD NEWS FOR MOORE, ONE OF YESTERDAY'S ACCUSERS WAS NOT A MINOR. WHOOO? I DID NOT EXPECT THAT. THIS WOMAN WAS 28 WHEN SHE HIRED MOORE TO HANDLE A CUSTODY PETITION AND WHEN SHE WENT TO HIS OFFICE TO SIGN THE PAPERS HE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT HER YOUNG DAUGHTERS. AND IF THEY WERE AS PRETTY AS SHE WAS. WELL THAT'S JUST FAMILY VALUES. AND THAT EVAL US DATING YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY. ANOTHER NEW ACCUSER SAYS THAT MOORE HIT ON HER WHEN SHE WAS 17. AND WORKING AS A HOSTESS AT RED LOBSTER. UH. THAT IS DISGUSTING. RED LOBSTER. (LAUGHTER) GOD INTENDED SHRIMP TO BE LIMITED. APPARENTLY, NO ONE HAS THE UNLIMITED SHRIMP? ALL RIGHT. APPARENTLY MOORE ASKED THE TEEN OUT AND SHE SAID DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD I AM. TO WHICH HE RESPONDED, YEAH, I GO OUT WITH GIRLS YOUR AGE ALL THE TIME. TO WHICH I RESPOND, AGGH-- REMEMBER, MONDAY WE LEARNED THAT MOORE HAD BEEN BANNED FROM HIS LOCAL MALL AND APPARENTLY HIS BEHAVIOR WAS SO BAD THAT SEARS HAD A WHOLE ROY MOORE PROTOCOL. ONE STORE MANAGER TOLD NEW HIRES TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS GUY. AND MOORE'S BEHAVIOR CAUSED WOMEN TO HIDE FROM HIM WHEN HE CAME IN THE SEARS. OKAY. OKAY. WELCOME TO TRAINING, COUPLE THING TO THE REMEMBER, ALWAYS WEAR YOUR NAME BADGE ON THE FLOOR, OKAY. YOU GOT TO CASH OUT BEFORE YOU PUNCH OUT. AND IF YOU SEE ROY MOORE, PRETEND TO BE A MANNEQUIN. (LAUGHTER) DON'T BLINK OR HE WILL KNOW YOU ARE A REAL GIRL.
Jon: OH MY.
Stephen: AND OF COURSE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ROY MOORE, THESE SEARS EMPLOYEES WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. ONE OF THE WOMEN SAYS THAT MOORE ASKED HER WHERE SHE WENT TO SCHOOL AND THEN FOR HER PHONE NUMBER. WHICH SHE SAYS SHE DECLINED TO GIVE TELLING HIM THAT HER FATHER WAS A SOUTHERN BAPTIST PREACHER, WOULD NEVER APPROVE. BUT THAT DID NOT STOP MOORE. A FEW DAYS LATER ITS GIRL WAS SUM MONDAYED TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE OVER THE INTERCOME IN HER CLASSROOM. SHE HAD A PHONE CALL. PHSSHHT, PLEASE REPORT TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, AN UNIDENTIFIED WEIRDO IS CALLING FOR A HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT. I HAVE NO PROBLEM MAKING THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE I'M TERRIBLE AT MY JOB. THAT IS ALL. AND THE CALL-- (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THE CALL DIDN'T GO SO GREAT. SHE ANSWERED THE PHONE AND THE MALE ON THE OTHER LINE SAID GENA, THIS IS ROY MOORE. I WAS LIKE WHAT. HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I SAID I'M IN TRIG CLASS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. ROY MOORE ACTUALLY MADE TRIGONOMETRY THE MORE APPEALING OPTION. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) ALL THESE ALLEGATIONS HAVE PUT REPUBLICANS IN A TOUGH POSITION. THEY WANT TO HOLD ON TO THE SENATE BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BACK A PERV. THAT'S WHY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND INSPIRATION FOR THE SAD FACE EMOJI MITCH McCONNELL, HE THINKS ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS SHOULD RUN AGAINST MOORE AS A WRITE-IN CANDIDATE.
HE FITS THE MOLD OF SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL OFF A WRITE-IN. THE ALABAMAN WHO WOULD, YOU KNOW, FIT THAT STANDARD WOULD BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHO IS TOTALLY WELL-KNOWN AND EXTREMELY POPULAR IN ALABAMA.
Stephen: YES, WELL-KNOWN AND EXTREMELY POPULAR IN ALABAMA ARE THE ONLY CRITERIA. IN THAT CASE YOUR OTHER CHOICES ARE FORREST GUMP, A STATUE OF BEAR BRYANT OR A JUG OF SWEET TEA WITH SUNGLASSES. BUT IT IS GOING TO BE SWEET TEA.
I LIKE FORREST.
Stephen: BUT MOORE ISN'T AFRAID OF THE WASHINGTON REPUBLICANS TWEETING DEAR MITCH McCONNELL, BRING IT ON. A STRONG SENTIMENTS LEADING THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE TO TWEET BRING IT ON IS A MOVIE ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NO, OH. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT THERE.
Stephen: TO WHICH ROY MOORE REPLIED, AND? WELL, MOORE IS FIGHTING BACK. YESTERDAY ONE OF HIS ATTORNEYS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE INTENDING TO PUT ALL OF THIS BEHIND THEM.
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM IN PROBABLY OVER A HUNDRED DIFFERENT MEETINGS AND BEEN AROUND PROBABLY IN EXCESS OF 10,000 DIFFERENT LADIES IN JUDGE'S MOORE PRESENCE AND NOT ONCE, NOT ONE TIME HAVE I EVER SEEN HIM ACT EVEN REMOTELY INAPPROPRIATE AGAINST ANY WOMAN.
Stephen: OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T SEE IT YOU WEREN'T IN THEIR TRIGONOMETRY CLASS. BUT THE MAIN-- THE MAIN-- (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THRUST, THE MAIN THRUST OF YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE WAS MOORE'S ATTORNEY TRYING TO DISCREDIT A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE. ONE OF THE ACCUSER'S HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK WHICH MOORE SIGNED.
RELEASE THE YEAR BOOK SO THAT WE CAN DETERMINE IS IT GENUINE OR IS IT A FRAUD.
Stephen: YEAH, IT COULD BE A FRAUD. LET'S COMPARE ROY MOORE'S KNOWN SIGNATURES, OKAY, UP HERE, KNOWN SIGNATURES WITH THAT IN THE YEAR BOOK, SEE? THREE TOTALLY DIFFERENT SIGNATURES BY THE SAME GUY. (APPLAUSE) NOW THE WOMAN, THE WOMAN'S ATTORNEY SAYS THEY MIGHT LET INDEPENDENT HANDWRITING EXPERTS LOOK AT THE YEAR BOOK BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I TOOK A COLLEGE COURSE IN HANDWRITING ANALYSIS. AND I THINK I COULD HELP, NOW LET'S SEE, LIKE RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK UP HERE, TURN THIS ON IT'S SIDE, HERE IS THE SIGNATURE I FOUND HERE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WIDE LOOP OF THE R UP HERE, THAT IS A CLASSIC FORENSIC INDICATOR THAT THE ACCUSED MIGHT BE HIDING SOMETHING PLUS THE ELONGATED Y LOOP DOWN HERE, THIS STEM DOWN HERE TELLS US HE HAS NO PROBLEM ENCROACHING ON THE SPACE OF OTHERS. NOW THERE'S ANOTHER VERY SMALL INDICATOR, AND THIS IS EXTREMELY TECHNICAL BUT IF YOU LOOK REALLY CLOSELY, IT'S WRITTEN IN A GIRL'S HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK. HE'S A PRE-VERT. (APPLAUSE) TODAY ROY MOORE HELD ANOTHER PRESS CONFERENCE AND BEGAN WITH A STORY ABOUT SOME ADVICE A SEASONED JUDGE GAVE HIM IN IS EARLY DAYS IN POLITICS.
WHAT YOU NEED TO DID IS HAVE, EYEGLASSES THAT SHOWS PEOPLE THAT YOU STUDY A LOT AND READ A LOT. THEN HE SAID AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OTHER THING, HE SAID WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE HEMORRHOIDS. I SAID WHY. HE SAID WELL TRK GIVES YOU A CONCERNED LOOK. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: LIKE THIS? (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT YOUR BUTT HOLE? AND MOORE BLASTED THE MEDIA FOR FOCUSING ON HIM.
TODAY WE GOT A CALL FROM ONE BIG MAGAZINE, THAT Y'ALL RECOGNIZE IF I SAY THE NAME. I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT.
Stephen: I WILL SAY IT, IT'S BARELY LEGAL AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A NEW EDITOR IN CHIEF. BUT MOORE WAS DEFIANT.
THERE'S BEEN COMMENTS ABOUT ME TAKING A STAND. YES, I HAVE TAKEN A STAND IN THE PAST. I WILL TAKE A STAND IN THE FUTURE. AND I WILL QUIT STANDING WHEN THEY LAY ME IN THAT BOX AND PUT ME IN THE GROUND.
Stephen: YOU CAN TAKE MY TEENAGE SALES CLERK WHEN YOU PRY HER FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS. (APPLAUSE) WE GT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. BEN AFFLECK IS HERE. RIGHT OVER THERE. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. ♪
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK. JON BATISTE, STAY HUMAN, RIGHT OVER THERE. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL Y'ALL. I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO TELL THESE PEOPLE HOW MUCH I WISH THIS WAS FRIDAY RIGHT NOW.
Jon: FEELING GOOD, REAL GOOD.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'VE GOT GREAT STUFF TO HOLD US OVER TO FRIDAY BECAUSE LATER ON IN THIS SHOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DEAD & COMPANY, THE GRATEFUL DEAD AND JOHN MAYER PLAYING HERE. THEY'RE HERE TONIGHT AND THEY'RE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT, YOU WILL NOT GOING TO WANT TO MISS A MINUTE OF ANY ONE OF THESE SHOWS.

HE COULD BE. THAT GUY SHOULD BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO HIM, EVER MET HIM.
NO.
Stephen: COME ON.
I PASSED BY-- .
Stephen: ARE YOU A BIG FAMOUS GUY OUT IN THE WORLD AND FOR YEARS COULD YOU STILL TALK TO DONALD OFFER AND NOT GO.
I PASSED HIM AT A COUPLE OF PARTIES AND I HEARD THAT IN ORDER TO GET PERMISSION TO FILM AT HIS PROPERTIES, HE INSISTED ON BEING PUT IN THE MOVIE AS AN EXTRA.
Stephen: WOW.

Stephen: HOME ALONE 2.
IS THAT WHAT IT IS.
Stephen: HOME ALONE 2, YEAH, THE KID ASKED WHERE THE BATHROOM IS. HE GOES DOWN THE HALL TO THE LEFT.
THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: IT IS NOT BELIEVABLE BUT HE SAYS DOWN THE HALL AND TO THE LEFT. OKAY. SO WERE YOU A SUPERHERO? BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING A SUPERHERO NOW. THAT IS A CULTURAL TOUCHSTONE NOW, LIKE ALL MOVIES HAVE SUPERHEROES AT THIS POINT. ALL OF THEM.
IT SEEMS THAT WAY, DOESN'T IT.
Stephen: YOU WERE ALSO.

Stephen: EXACTLY. YOU CUT THAT PART OUT OF ARGO. AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU DID HAVE LASER VISIONMENT SO BUT YOU WERE A SUPERHERO FAN AS A CHILD.

Stephen: DID YOU ACTUALLY STEAL SOMETHING.

YEAH.
Stephen: EXTRAORDINARY MOVIE. (APPLAUSE) I WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY AND I WAS A YOUNGER PERFORMER.
SURE, SURE.
Stephen: YOU GUYS WERE LIKE IN IT AND WRITTEN IT AND YOU PRODUCED IT ALSO.
DEFACTO.
Stephen: DEFACTO, LIKE I'M NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH. THESE GUYS DID ALL OF THIS THEMSELVES. HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ON THIS FILL SNM.
YEARS. I MEAN WE WROTE IT, IT TOOK US ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO WRITE AND THEN WE REWROTE IT AND REWROTE IT AND THEN WE HAD IT IN DEVELOPMENT AND NO ONE WOULD MAKE IT AND SHOPPED IT AROUND AND FINALLY WE GOT SOMEONE TO MAKE THE MOVIE.
Stephen: AND YOU ALWAYS WROTE IT WITH YOURSELF IN MIND, THIS WOULD BE OUR.
MATT DAMON AND I. THE IDEA WASN'T REALLY TO, PRESS OURSELVES AS WRITERS BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOOK COOL IN AS ACTORS SO WE COULD GET ACTING.
Stephen: SO EGO FIRST.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE IN MIND FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTS, LIKE IN MY DREAMS, CUZ NOBODY KNEW WHO YOU WERE. YOU BOTH WORKED BUT YOU WEREN'T.
WE WERE LIKE HUSTLING AROUND HOLLYWOOD DOING LITTLE PARTS AND WE THOUGHT IT WAZ EASIER FOR US TO WRITE IT DOING IMITATIONS OF FAMOUS ACTORS THAT WE IMAGINED MIGHT ONE DAY BE IN THE MOVIE. AND THEN WE WOULD RECORD THESE IMPROVISATIONS AND WRITE DOWN-- .
Stephen: LIKE WHO WOULD YOU IMPROADVICE.
I DO REMEMBER FOR AWHILE WE HAD DE NIRO AND MORGAN FREEMAN IN THE MOVIE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Stephen: SHOOT RIGHT FOR THE TOP.
WE WERE PRETTY SURE THAT THAT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN, AT LEAST ONE OF THE TWO.
Stephen: WHO DID DE NIRO PLAY.
DE NIRO WAS THE ROBIN WILLIAMS CHARACTER AND MORGAN FREEMAN WAS PLAYING THE SCARSGUARDS THE MORE SUCCESSFUL MATHEMATICIAN.
Stephen: DID YOU DO DE NIRO.
I DO THE TERNL DE NIRO. I JUST DO THE FACE.
Stephen: I DO A PRETTY GOOD DE NIRO. I KNOW SOME OF THOSE LANES.
YOU DO.
Stephen: YEAH, DO YOU WANT TO MARY HEE.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ME DO SOME DE NIRO, ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHEN MATT DAMON'S CHARACTER, WILL, IS BREAKING DOWN.
OKAY, YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT SEE, I'M BOBBY DE NIRO SEE, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
GREAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
WONDERFUL.
Stephen: DID I HAVE THE LINE RIGHT, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
BASICALLY NAILED IT.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T DO IT.
I WOULDN'T NITPICK.
Stephen: IT IS YOUR SCRIPT, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY NITPICK.
WONDERFUL STUFF.
Stephen: NOW THE PERSON WHO MADE THAT FILM FOR YOU, THE PERSON WHO STARTED YOUR CAREER WAS HARVEY WEINSTEIN. NOW.
A COMEDY SHOW, CORRECT.
Stephen: THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SUBJECT OF MOMENT, WITH THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: AND AFTER THE REVELATIONS, DISTURBING AND TRULY HORRIFYING REVELATIONS ABOUT WHAT HARVEY WEINSTEIN DID, DID YOU FEEL BECAUSE YOU HAD SUCH A CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH HIM AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER THAT YOU HAD TO DO MORE THAN SIMPLY DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM HARVEY WEINSTEIN? BECAUSE EVERYBODY RAN FOR THE EXIT.
YES. AND UNDERSTANDABLY SO. YOU KNOW, FOR ME IT WAS A LITTLE BIT, I MEAN IT WAS AWFUL TO SEE THE EXTENT OF THESE TERRIBLE CRIMES AND IT WAS HIDEOUS. I HADN'T WORKED FOR HARVEY FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS. BUT NONE THE LESS I FELT THIS ATTACHMENT TO MOVIES LIKE GOOD WILL HUNTING AND SHAKESPEARE AM LOVE AND EARLY MOVIES THAT I REALLY LOVED DOING WHEN I STILL WAS TOTALLY BRAND NEW. AND SO IT SORT OF TAINTED THAT A LITTLE BIT TO REALIZE WHILE WE WERE HAVING THESE EXPERIENCES AND MAKING THEETION MOVIE THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING AND DEALING WITH AWFUL EXPERIENCES. SO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT. YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO KNOW. BUT I DECIDED TO GIVE BACK THE RESIDUALS THAT I'M GETTING FROM THE MIR AMAX MOVIES AND GIVE THEM TO RAIN AND FILM INDEPENDENT WHO YOU CAN ALSO DONATE TO JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SORT OF CASH A CHECK FROM THE GUY. AND I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE HERE, YOU KNOW, CAN I STILL FEEL OKAY ABOUT IT IF ITS' GOING TO A GOOD CAUSE.
Stephen: WELL, AFTER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE ACCUSATIONS AND REVELATIONS ABOUT VARIOUS PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD HAS BEEN FOCUSED FOR THE MOST PART UNTIL RECENTLY. AND YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A FEW THINGS, SEXUAL IMPROPRIETY, YOU HAVE APOLOGIZED FOR SOME OF THAT. AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS MORE THAT YOU OR ALL MEN, ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD HAVE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T A PASSING THING. WHERE WOMEN ARE.
I THINK SO. I THINK WE HAVE TO, WHAT I WAS ACCUSED OF BY A WOMAN WAS OF TOUCHING HER BREAST WHILE I GAVE HER A HUG. I DON'T REMEMBER IT. BUT I ABSOLUTELY APOLOGIZED FOR IT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK SHE'S LYING OR MAKING IT UP. THIS IS JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT WE HAVE TO, AS MEN, I THINK, IN THIS, AS WE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THIS, BE REALLY, REALLY MINDFUL OF OUR BEHAVIOR AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AND SAY IF I WAS EVER PART OF THE PROBLEM, I WANT TO CHANGE. I WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND TO NOT SHY AWAY FROM, YOU KNOW, THESE UNCOMFORTABLE OR AWKWARD OR STRANGE ENCOUNTERS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD WHERE WE WERE SORT OF NAVIGATING AND NOT KNOWING. I JUST DID AN INTERVIEW WHERE SOMEBODY ASKED PEA A QUESTION AND I KIND OF, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A SERIOUS QUESTION. AND I KIND OF FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY AND LAUGH AWKWARDLY IT IS JUST A TRICKY THING TO TRY TO HANDLE. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO SUPPORTED THE VOICES THAT ARE COMING FORWARD. BELIEVE THEM AND CREATE A BUSINESS WHERE MORE WOMEN ARE EMPOWERED AND IN PLACE SO THAT LESS OF THIS HAPPENS AND SO THAT THERE IS A WAY OF REPORTING THIS STUFF THAT PEOPLE CAN FEAL SAFE DOING, YOU KNOW (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I COMPLETELY AGREE. AND ALSO MIGHT BE NICE IF WE HAD LIKE A JUSTICE LEAGUE OUT THERE.
THAT WAB NICE.
Stephen: BRING A LITTLE JUSTICE DOWN ON TOP OF THE PEOPLE WHO.
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A JUSTICE LEAGUE.
Stephen: WHO RUN AWAY FROM THE ACCUSATIONSMENT BECAUSE EVENTUALLY EVERYTHING COMES OUT.
I THINK SO. IT CERTAINLY IS NOW. YOU KNOW, I MEAN IT DIDN'T, CLEARLY IT DIDN'T BEFORE. I THOUGHT I HAD A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. AND I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD IT. AND THE TRUTH IS I REALLY DIDN'T. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE GROPED, TO BE HARASSED, TO BE INTERRUPTED, TALKED OVER, PAID LESS, YOU KNOW, PUSHED AROUND, BELITTLED ALL THE THINGS THAT WOMEN DEAL WITH THAT FOR ME AS A MAN I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH. AND PART OF THIS FOR ME HAS BEEN LISTENING TO PEOPLE I REALLY CARE ABOUT AND LOVE AS THEY TELL ME STORIES OF STUFF THAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM. THIS IS MEN AND WOMEN. AND YOU KNOW, RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S A REAL THING. I'M NOT A SPOKESMAN. I'M NOT A SUPERHERO. I CAN'T CHANGE IT BY MYSELF. I CAN JUST BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY ACTIONS.
Stephen: I THINK ALL MEN ESPECIALLY NEED TO EXAMINE THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE TO BE AWARE OF WHAT THEY MAY VE DONE IN THE PAST AND HOW IN THE FUTURE THEY CAN TREAT WOMEN WITH GREATER RESPECT AND IT STARTS WITH BELIEVING THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE ACCUSATIONS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WELL SOCKER NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: JUSTICE LEAGUE IS IN THEATERS TOMORROW. BEN AFFLECK, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GRETA GERWIG.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR AND A SCREEN WRITER KNOWN FOR FRANCES HA AND 20th CENTURY WOMEN, SHE'S NOW MAKING HER DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH LADY BIRD.

Stephen: BUT YOU ARE ALSO AN ACCOMPLISHED ACTRESS IN YOUR OWN RIGHT AND A SCREEN WRITER AS I SAID BEFORE. AND I UNDERSTAND AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THE STORY BEHIND THIS. YOU WERE ALMOST ON A CBS SITCOM, WE WERE ALMOST COWORKERS.
YES, WE WERE ALMOST IN THE SAME CBS FAMILY THERES WITH A SHOW CALLED HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.
Stephen: I REMEMBER THAT. I'M FAMILIAR, I'M FAMILIAR.
IT'S HE A GREAT SHOW. I LOVED IT. EVERYONE LOVES IT. AND THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE CALLED HOW I MET YOUR DAD, STARRING ME. AND WE SHOT THE PILOT AND IT WAS SO MUCH FUN AND I LOVED WORKING ON IT. AND THEN THEY TAKE THE PILOT TO LAS VEGAS. AND THEY-- .
Stephen: FOCUS GROUP.
THEY TEST IT. AND THE AUDIENCE, THEY'RE GIVEN NOBODIES AND THEY TURN THE NOBODIES TO THE RIGHT IF THEY LIKE IT AND THE LEFT IF THEY DON'T. AND APPARENTLY THEY TRNED THE NOBODIES TO THE LEFT EVERY TIME I CAME ON.
Stephen: OH NO.
SO YEAH, THEY DIDN'T-- IT DIDN'T-- THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT. AT ALL.
Stephen: NOW NOW YOU'VE GOT LADY BIRD.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: WHICH IS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT AND IT IS GETTING AMAZING NOTICES. IT WAS CALL PERFECTION BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES." IT'S GOT A 100% ON ROTEN TOMATOES. (APPLAUSE)
YES, YES.
Stephen: WAS IT, WE SAW THAT GREAT CLIP THERE, IS IT BASED ON YOUR CHILDHOOD, YOUR TEENAGE YEARS.
IT'S INSPIRED BY PARTS OF MY CHILDHOOD, BUT IT IS NOT LITERAL LEIGH.
Stephen: TELL PEOPLE THE STORY.
LADY BIRD ABOUT A GIRL NAMED CHRISTINE McFEARSON WITHOUT MAKES EVERYONE CALL HER LADY BIRD AND TAKES PLACE OVER THE SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND IT IS KIND OF A LOVE STORY BETWEEN HER AND HER MOM, HOW LIKE HARD IT IS TO SAY GOOD-BYE AND HOW ONE PERSON IS COMING OF AGE IS ANOTHER PERSON'S LETTING GO. AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY BUT IT WILL ALSO MAKE YOU CRY AND CALL YOUR MOM.
Stephen: DID YOU CRY AND CALL YOUR MOM.
YEAH, YEAH AND THEN MY MOM CRIED AND CALLED ME WHEN I SHOWED IT TO HER.
Stephen: SO BUT SHE RECOGNIZED SOME OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP IN THIS MOVIE.
YES, SHE RECOGNIZED SOME OF IT I MEN SHE KNOWS MORE THAN ANYONE WHAT IS NOT REAL AND WHAT'S REAL.
Stephen: DID SHE SAY LIKE WHY DID YOU PUT THAT IN. NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THAT ABOUT US, ANY OF IT TOO PERSONAL.
NO, NO, SHE WAS VERY FLAT ERRED BY IT. SHE HAS SEEN IT SIX TIMES.
Stephen: DID YOU AT ANY POINT JUMP OUT OF YOUR MOTHER'S CAR.
NOT A MOVING CAR.
Stephen: AT A STOP LIGHT.
IT WAS IDLING, YES. BUT I-- I EXITED.
Stephen: NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WENT TO AN ALL-GIRLS CATHOLIC SCHOOL.
THAT'S RIGHT, YES.
Stephen: LIKE TYPICAL LIKE KNEE SOCKS AND PLAID SKIRTS.
YEAH.
Stephen: WITH NUNS MEASURING THE LENGTH OF THE SKIRT.
WE HAD SKIRT CHECK.
Jon: THAT.
Stephen: THAT WHAT IT IS CALLED SKIRT CHECK.
IF IT GOES BELOW YOUR FINGER-- OR ABOVE YOUR FINGER TIPS T IS BAD.
Stephen: WOW. BUT ARE YOU NOT A CATHOLIC.
NO, I'M NOT A CATHOLIC BUT I ACTUALLY LOVED CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING IN IT BECAUSE I-- I MEAN TO BE TOTALLY HONEST BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF A THEATRICAL KID I FEEL LIKE THEY HAD REALLY GOOD OUTFITS AND REALLY GOOD MUSICAL NUMBERS.
Stephen: STAGECRAFT.
YEAH.
Stephen: OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS-- I WAS AN ALTAR BOY AND THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING ON STAGE, I'M ON STAGE, EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT ME.
AND THE SMOKE AND ALL THE STUFF.
Stephen: THE INCENSE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: INCENSE ON THE CHAIN BALL, THE BELLS.
EXACTLY. AND IT FELT-- .
Stephen: THE NUNS ARE WITCHES.
IT FELT VERY CLOSE TO LIKE SOUND OF MUSIC OR, IT FELT.
Stephen: VERY CLOSE TO SOUND OF MUS ECK. EXCEPT THE NUNS DON'T RUN OFF WITH THE BARON.
THAT'S RIGHT, THEY DIDN'T, THEY DON'T.
Stephen: THEY DON'T DO THAT.
BUT WE HAD NURNS, WE HAD PLETTEE GROOVY NUNS.
Stephen: LIKE FOLK MASS LIKE-- THOSE KIND OF NUNS, SINGING.
SORT OF UKULELE PLAYING NUNS MUSICAL NUNS. BUT THEY DIDN'T, LIKE WE WOULD DO SHALL-- .
Stephen: I'VE NEVER PLAYED MUSICAL NUNS.
IT'S A GREAT GAME. BUT WE WOULD DO LIKE, WE WOULD HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW, I BOOK THEOLOGY FOR FOUR YEARS.
Stephen: OF COURSE.
BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF IT. AND THE SCHOOL I WENT TO WAS ST. FRANCIS AND BASED ON ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI SO WE WATCHED THE BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON.
Stephen: ABOUT DISCOVERING HIS ST.HOOD.
BECOME ST. FRANCIS AND THE WAY HE DOES IS IT PRETTY DRAMATIC. HE TAKES OFF ALL OF HIS CLOTHES IN THE TOWN SQUARE AND IT'S LIKE, I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY, FATHER. AND I ALWAYS IDENTIFIED WITH THE FATHER BEING LIKE OH NO. MY SON JUST HEARD FROM GOD AND NOW HE'S TAKING OFF HIS CLOTHES. BUT-- I REMEMBER IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM.
Stephen: THE ACT CERTIFICATE CUTE.
SO CUTE. HE'S A BEAUTIFUL GUY. BUT THE NUNS PUT POST IT NOTES OVER THE PLACE WHERE SHE KNEW HIS BUTT WOULD BE. NOT TODAY, LADIES. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: YEAH, WELL, MISSED OUT ON A CONVERT.
IT WOULD HAVE, THAT, THE COSTUMES, I WAS LIKE I'M IN.
Stephen: WELL, LOVELY TO MEET YOU, THANK YOU.
SO NICE TO MEET YOU. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: LADY BIRD IS IN THEATERS NOW. GRETA GERWIG, EVERYBODY.
