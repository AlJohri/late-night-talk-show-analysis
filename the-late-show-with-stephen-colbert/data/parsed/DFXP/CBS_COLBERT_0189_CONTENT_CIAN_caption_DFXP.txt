Stephen: LET'S SEE WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON NOW.
SHE'S DEVIL.
Stephen: I WONDER IF THAT'S TRUE. AMY, YOU CAN GET ME THE DEVIL, PLEASE?
HELLO.
Stephen: THANK YOU!
SHE'S GOOD.
Stephen: OKAY, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HILLARY CLINTON IS YOU.
I'M COOL WITH THAT.
Stephen: WAIT, WAIT, YOU ARE?
YEAH, I MEAN, WE DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT HER NOMINATION IS HISTORIC. I FEEL LIKE I'M PART OF SOMETHING. WAIT, HAS ANYONE COP PAIRLD ME TO TRUMP?
Stephen: NO, NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.
GOOD, I MAY BE PRINCE OF LIES, BUT I PAY MY SUBCONTRACTORS. WELL, I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE FLAMING EXCREMENT YOU.
Stephen:  MEAN HELL?
NO, I'M GOING TO THE OLYMPICS.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES WILL SMITH, LOGAN LERMAN, AND MUSICAL GUEST, TONY BENNETT. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU .
HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY, YOU'RE VERY KIND.
Jon: STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY, HAVE A SEAT. OH, MY GOODNESS. THAT'S VERY CEEND OF YOU, BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW YOU'RE ONLY APPLAUDING SO YOU CAN FEEL YOUR FINGERS AGAIN. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT THIS EVENING. AND LISTEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE FEELING IS MUTUAL. THE FEELING IS MUTUAL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING. I COME TO WORK EVERY DAY WANTING TO START THE SHOW WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YET, EVERY DAY, MORE WORDS COME OUT OF HIS FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHERE TO BEGIN. WHERE SHOULD WE START WITH THIS ONE? PLAU IT'S A LOT THE FACE. HERE'S ONE-- DONALD'S IN HOT WATER FOR SOME COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT FORMER FOX NEWS C.E.O. AND ALLEGED UNCLE TOUCH-TOO-MUCH, ROGER AILES. ( LAUGHTER ) ALLEGED. WHEN ASKED HOW HE WOULD FEEL IF HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA WAS SEXUALLY HARASSED, TRUMP SAID, "I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SHE WOULD FIND ANOTHER CAREER OR FIND ANOTHER COMPANY, IF THAT WAS THE CASE." YEAH. IS THAT SO HARD? WHEN A WOMAN IS SEXUALLY HARASSED, IT'S UP TO HER TO LEAVE THAT COMPANY AND SIMPLY FIND A NEW JOB AT ALL THOSE OTHER COMPANIES WHERE WOMEN ARE LEAVING FOR SOME REASON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS. IT'S MUSICAL CHAIRS. BUT WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS, YOU HAVE TO SIT ON YOUR BOSS' LAP. NOW, SOME ARE POINTING OUT THAT IVANKA HAS WORKED ONLY FOR HER FATHER AND, THEREFORE, WOULD NEVER BE THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
IF IVANKA WEREN'T MY DAUGHTER, PERHAPS I'D BE DATING HER.
Stephen: SHE SHOULD REALLY REPORT THAT TO THE HEAD OF HER COMPANY. YOU KNOW, TRUMP'S HAD SUCH A ROUGH COUPLE OF DAYS, YOU KNOW, SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. I THINK HE DESERVES A MEDAL. AND TODAY, HE GOT ONE.
A MAN CAME UP TO ME, AND HE HANDED ME HIS PURPLE HEART. NOW, I SAID TO HIM, I SAID TO HIM, "IS THAT, LIKE, THE REAL ONE, OR IS THAT A COPY?" AND HE SAID, "THAT'S MY REAL PURPLE HEART. I HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOU." AND I SAID, "MAN, THAT'S LIKE-- THAT'S LIKE BIG STUFF. I ALWAYS WANTED TO GET THE PURPLE HEART."
Stephen: YEAH, HE SAYS, "I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A PURPLE HEART." HE ALWAYS WANTED THE AWARD YOU GET FOR BEING WOUNDED IN BATTLE. HE JUST NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. MAN, HE MUST KICK HIMSELF OVER THOSE FIVE DEFERMENTS HE REQUESTED FROM THE VIETNAM DRAFT. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? DARN IT! DARN IT! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO! WELL, MAYBE HE'LL GET A PURPLE HEART FOR SHOOTING HIMSELF IN THE FOOT. ( APPLAUSE ) IT MIGHT BE STUFF LIKE THIS THAT INSPIRED THE PRESIDENT TO SAY TODAY TO SAY THAT "DONALD TRUMP IS UNFIT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT." KEEP IN MEEND, KEEP IN MIND, HOWEVER YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE CANDIDATES, THOSE WORDS HAVE NEVER BEEN SAID BY A SITTING PRESIDENT OF ANY NOMINEE, EVER. THAT INCLUDES WHEN CHESTER A. ARTHUR REFUSED TO QUESTION THE QUALIFICATIONS OF STINK EYE WILLIE, THE PIE-STEALING HOBO. ( LAUGHTER ) VERY CLOSE. STINK EYE. VERY STRONG ON TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE, VERY STRONG. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T CARE IF THE ESTABLISHMENT THINKS HE'S FIT FOR THE JOB. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S A MAN OF THE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY YESTERDAY, TRUMP TWEETED THIS PHOTO OF HIMSELF ON THIS PRIVATE JET, EATING K.F.C. THERE IT IS, EXTRA CRISPY AND SOME CHICKEN. STUCK IN MY THROAT. THAT JOKE STUCK IN MY THROAT, LITERALLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT PUNCH LINE STUCK IN MY THROAT LIKE A CHICKEN BONE. IT DOES BOLSTER HIS MILITARY CREDENTIALS, BECAUSE HE CLEARLY HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE COLONEL. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I THINK-- JUST LOOKING AT THAT PHOTO, I THINK HE IS BLOWING THE WHOLE "MAN OF THE PEOPLE" THING BY EATING HIS K.F.C. WITH SILVERWARE! EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME! MR. TRUMP, WHAT PART OF "FINGER LICKIN' GOOD" DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S RIGHT THERE. I THINK THAT'S ILLEGAL. I THINK THAT'S ILLEGAL. AND JUST SOME ADVICE, IF YOU WANT TO SEEM RELATABLE, DON'T EAT J.F.K. ON A PRIVATE JET. IF YOU WANT TO BE RELATABLE, EAT LOBSTER ON A CROSSTOWN BUS.  ( APPLAUSE ) I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT. THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE MORE DONALD TRUMP. TODAY TRUMP HELD A RALLY WHERE HE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC YOUTH OUTREACH.
I HAVE THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD, IS A TENANT OF MINE, THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD, A CHINESE BANK. (BABY CRIES) DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT BABY. I LOVE BABIES. I LOVE BABIES. I HEAR THAT BABY CRYING. I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT. WHAT A BABY. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BABY. DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY. THE MOM IS RUNNING AROUND LIKE-- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL AND HEALTHY, AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.
Stephen: YOU SEE? YOU SEE? HE CAN BE A NICE GUY. I SHOULD APOLOGIZE-- WHAT'S THAT?
ACTUALLY, I WAS ONLY KIDDING. YOU CAN GET THE BABY OUT OF HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH! YEAH! GET THE BABY OUT OF HERE! GET OUT OF HERE, YOU CRYING BABY! THAT BABY-- SO CLOSE TO HUMANITY. THAT CRYING BABY WANTS TO STAY HERE, IT NEEDS TO ACT LIKE AN ADULT. BECAUSE WHEN WE ADULTS LISTEN TO TRUMP, WE WEEP SILENTLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, AND IN-- THERE IS-- GET OUT OF HERE, BABY! OH, AND IN RARE NON-TRUMP NEWS, I AM FEELING HORRIBLY BETRAYED THIS EVENING. THERE ARE CERTAIN-- THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO DO IN ORDER TO LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE:  EAT VEGETABLES, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE DISGUSTING. DRINK WATER, EVEN THOUGH IT'S DISGUSTING ( LAUGHTER ) AND, OF COURSE, FLOSS YOUR TEETH. WELL, IT TURNS OUT, FLOSSING MIGHT BE UNNECESSARY BECAUSE AFTER LOOKING AT 25 STUDIES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FLOSSING, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EVIDENCE FOR FLOSSING IS "WEAK, VERY UNRELIABLE," OF "VERY LOW" QUALITY, AND CARRIES "A MODERATE TO LARGE POTENTIAL FOR BIAS." OH, BUT THE HELL YOU HAVE TO PAY IF YOU DON'T FLOSS. OH, THEY SHAME YOU WHEN YOU GO IN FOR THE CLEANING, DON'T THEY? YEAH, YEAH. THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU ALWAYS GO, "OH, DAMN, I'VE GOT TO FLOSS NOW."
Jon: THEY KNOW.
Stephen: THEY KNOW THAT YOU DIDN'T FLOSS.
Jon: YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FLOSSING.
Stephen: THE WHOLE TIME.
Jon: YOU'LL BE SWOLLEN.
Stephen: YOUR GUMS ARE BLEEDING. YOUR SINK WILL LOOK LIKE A QUENTIN TARANTINO MOVIE IN THERE. IT LOOKS LIKE "THE HATEFUL EIGHT EIGHT" WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU'RE SO DESPERATE. WE'VE BEEN LIED TO. YOU LIED TO ME, DENTAL HYGIENIST DAWN. BASED ON THIS NEWS, I'M GOING TO STOP FLOSSING 38 YEARS AGO. STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE GREAT WILL SMITH. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR AND IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO SEE PLEASE WELCOME WILL SMITH! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET ME GO KISS THAT LADY. I'M GOING TO GO KISS THAT LADY. OH, MAN. HEY! OH, MAN! WOOO!  ( CHEERS ) I WAS WATCHING-- I WAS WATCHING IN THE BACK WHEN-- THE --
AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MISS?
DEBBIE.
HOW YOU DOING, DEBBIE?  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH, WILL. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE, ALWAYS A PLEASURE. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON. YOU KNOW-- THAT'S A REAL SUPERSTAR, A GUY WHO CAN TAKE HIS TIME WITH THE AUDIENCE LIKE THAT. NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO THAT. THAT IS A SKILL TO DO THAT.
I CUT THAT DOWN. THAT IS THE SHORT VERSION. I DIDN'T WANT TO MESS YOUR TIME UP.
Stephen: THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU WAS IN 2008. YOU WERE ON THE OLD SHOW.
YUP.
Stephen: 3,000 PEOPLE I'VE INTERVIEWED. YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAME STRAIGHT INTO THE REWRITE ROOM AND CAME OVER AND SAID, "HI, I'M WILL SMITH. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE." I SAID, "I THINK THIS GUY IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF MY SHOW THAT NIGHT." OBAMA WAS RUNNING THAT YEAR AND YOU SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT.
YEAH, I MISSED IT. I MISSED IT. I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT. BUT I WATCHED OBAMA FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S A HARD JOB, MAN.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, IT IS, IT IS, YEAH. EIGHT YEARS AGO, HE LOOKED LIKE YOU LOOK NOW.
YEAH, RIGHT, EXACTLY, EXACTLY. I WAS LIKE, MAN! ( APPLAUSE ) NO, THAT--
Stephen: YOU EVER THINK ABOUT IT? BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD VOTE FOR YOU? YOU'D VOTE FOR HIM, WOULDN'T YOU?
DEBBIE WOULD FOR SURE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO GET THE DEBBIES. DOES POLITICS HOLD ANY INTEREST FOR YOU?
YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY HAVE HAD THE ITCHING, YOU KNOW. I'VE HAD-- YOU KNOW, I HAVE LOTS OF VIEWS AND IDEAS AND SOMETIMES I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THINGS ON TELEVISION, AND I JUST WANT TO RUN AGAINST THEM. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: RUN STRAIGHT AT THEM?
JUST STRAIGHT AT THEM AND KNOCK THEM OVER. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S-- IT'S SOMETHING-- I THINK IT'S NOT WHERE MY GREATEST GIFTS ARE, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: LIKE POLITICS AND ACTING, IT'S A FINE LINE.
YEAH, IT REALLY IS. IT REALLY IS.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION.
AND THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS IN THE SAME WAY. I'VE DEFINITELY THOUGHT ABOUT IT. MY WIFE HAS SAID ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, "HELL NO." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IS THAT A DIRECT QUOTE?
YES, IT'S A DIRECT QUOTE.
Stephen: LET ME WRITE THAT DOWN, "HELL MOW."
I'M NOT SURE WHAT SHE MEANS.
Stephen: YOU WOULD DO A GREAT JOB PLAYING THE ROLE OF BARACK OBAMA.
THAT MIGHT BE GOOD. THAT MIGHT BE GOOD.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE-- HAVE YOU WORKED ON YOUR OBAMA? BECAUSE YOU GUYS BOTH HAVE SWAGGER?
YEAH, SWAGGER. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE OF TIMES.
Stephen: YOU AND OBAMA HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT?
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT.
Stephen: HOLD ON.
YEAH, ME AND "B" WAS TALKING ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY.
Stephen: LIKE YOU DO.
YOU KNOW, WE WAS JUST CHATTING. BUT WE TALKED ABOUT-- WE TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE OF TIMES. HE SAID THE ONE THING WHAT IS FOR SURE, I HAVE THE EARS TO PLAY HIM. YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. I THINK THAT IS --
THE THE MAN DOES NOT NEED THE N.S.A. HE CAN HEAR WHAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING ALL THE THE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF THE BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENCY, THERE WAS ALL THIS SORT OF HOPE THAT WE WERE IN A SORT OF-- OR TALK AT LEAST WE WERE MOVING INTO A POST-RACIAL SOCIETY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RACE RELATIONS, GIVEN THE THE TENSION NOW IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY?
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING. I ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE THINGS IN TERMS OF A MARRIAGE, YOU KNOW. SO I-- I'VE DONE MY 10,000 HOURS OF MARRIAGE COUNSELING, RIGHT. SO, YOU KNOW, JADA AND I HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO DEVELOP A SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP. SO I ALWAYS LOOK AT THINGS IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT RACE RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY NOW, THERE'S A THING THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THINGS ARE CLEANED UP. THERE'S A DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN THAT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT, YOU KNOW ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: SO NOW--
SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE-- WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY, "IT'S WORSE THAN IT'S EVER BEEN, "I DISAGREE COMPLETELY. IT'S CLEARLY NOT WORSE THAN IT WAS IN THE 60s, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AS BAD AS IT WAS IN THE 1860s. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT? YOU KNOW. SO --
SORT OF LIKE A DOCTOR HAS TO GO OPEN THE ABSCESS TO DRAIN THE WOUND. YOU'VE GOT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RACE IN THIS COUNTRY MORE CLEARLY AND OPENLY THAN WE HAVE ALMOST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IT'S ON THE THE TABLE.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW.
Stephen: BECAUSE WE HAVE A HISTORY OF SORT OF IGNORING PROBLEMS UNTIL YOU CAN'T ANYMORE.
YEAH, I THINK RACISM IS NOT GETTING WORSE. IT'S GETTING FILMED, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW. SO I THINK-- I THINK THAT --
THE REVOLUTION MAY NOT BE TELEVISED BUT IT'S BEING TWEETED.
IT'S BEING TWEETED FOR SURE. I REALLY THINK THIS DARKNESS, AS BAD AS IT IS AND AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS, THE PROBLEMS ARE ON THE THE TABLE, YOU KNOW. SO I-- I VIEW THAT IN SAME WAY AS JADA AND I HAD TO WORK THROUGH THINGS IN OUR MARRIAGE. WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUT, WHEN IT GETS ON THE TABLE AND YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT WHAT'S REAL, IT SUCKS.
Stephen: SOMETIMES ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE SAYS, "OH, HELL NO."
IS OH, HELL NO. OH, HELL NO. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT IN THIS RELATIONSHIP, YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THING COMING. YOU KNOW. NO BUT I DO VIEW IT AS A DIFFICULT TIME, BUT I THINK-- I THINK IT'S-- THE THE PROBLEM'S ON THE TABLE. AND I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY MORE THAN EVER FOR A LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE, YOU KNOW,.
Stephen: THAT IS A VERY HOPEFUL WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
ABSOLUTELY.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M HOPEFUL ABOUT. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO, AND THIS IS SINCERE, IS "SUICIDE SQUAD." I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ) I HAVE RARELY BEEN AS EXCITED FOR A SUMMERTIME MOVIE THAN THIS ONE. YOU PLAY DEADSHOT.
DEADSHOT, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN ASSASSIN.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU ALSO HAVE SOMETHING OF A HEART.
AN ASSASSIN WITH A HEART. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: AND I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE. JIMMY.
HEY, ANGELO, THIS IS THE EXTERMINATOR YOU CALLED FOR YOUR RAT PROBLEM. MY ACCOUNT'S LOOKING A LITTLE THIN.
NO ONE GETS PAID UNTIL WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE GETS DONE.
NOPE, THAT'S NOT THE RULES. NO MONEY, NO HONEY. THEY'RE TAKING HIM OUT OF THE CAR NOW. IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS YOUR WINDOW'S GOING TO CLOSE FOREVER.
OKAY, RELAX. THERE WAS AN ACCOUNTING ERROR. WE SENT IT.
DOUBLE IT. YOU'VE GOT 10 SECONDS.
WE'RE NOT THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU PLAY WITH.
DID YOU THREATEN ME? THIS DUDE IS ABOUT TO GET A SORE THROAT FROM ALL OF THE SINGING HE'S ABOUT TO DO.
YOU SON OF A--
PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU, ANGY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I CAN'T WAIT. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE WILL SMITH. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH WILL SMITH. NOW--
YEAH!
Stephen: YOU PEOPLE AT HOME, YOU-- YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD HE JUST MADE THESE PEOPLE FEEL. CHECK IT OUT ONLINE. I'M SURE WE'LL PUT IT UP SOME PLACE. I ACTUALLY HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT "SUICIDE SQUAD."
YES.
Stephen: THIS IS GREAT ENSEMBLE OF BIG STARS, EACH PLAYING THESE SORT OF SUPER VILLAINS. AND WE HAD MARGOT ROBBIE ON HERE, WHO PLAYS HARLEY QUINN.
YEAH, SHE'S FANTASTIC.
Stephen: AND SHE SAID SHE HAS HER OWN TATTOO GUN, LIKE--
YES, YES.
Stephen: AND THAT SHE WAS TATTOOING THE WORD "SQUAD" ON ALL OF YOU ALL.
NOT ALL OF US.
Stephen: DID YOU NOT GET THE "SQUAD" TATTOO?
HERE'S THE THING. SEE I TRY-- I TROO TO KEEP MYSELF YOUNG AND IN SHAPE AND, YOU KNOW, THIS CAST IS A THE LOT OF, YOU KNOW, 20-YEAR-OLDS. RIGHT? AND THE THING ABOUT A 40-YEAR-OLD HANGING WITH A 20-YEAR-OLD IS YOU REALIZE REALLY QUICK YOU'RE NOT A 20-YEAR-OLD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD. PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, MAN.
SO SHE COMES IN, YOU KNOW, WITH HER --
WITH THE NEEDLE.
HER FULL 20-YEAR-OLD GLORY AND A TATTOO GUN, "HEY, EVERYBODY! LET'S GIVE EACH OTHER TATTOOS." "NO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOT EVEN LIKE-- NOT EVEN LIKE IN, LIKE, A HIDDEN PLACE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO, JUST NO. NO. SO SHE STARTED GIVING EVERYBODY TATTOOS, AND I AM EASILY INFLUENCED. SO I DIDN'T GET ONE, BUT I GAVE A REALLY BAD ONE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU USED IT AND GAVE SOMEBODY ELSE--
YEAH, I GAVE SOMEBODY A REALLY BAD, REALLY BAD TATTOO. JOEL KENNEMAN, HE PLAYS LIEUTENANT FLAK. AND HE WAS LIKE, "COME ON. TATTOO! TATTOO! TATTOO!" AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH! "AND I WAS LIKE, "OH! TRAGEDY."
Stephen: SO YOU-- SO YOU SHOWED SOME RESERVE THERE.
YEAH, NO, I MEAN, I DIDN'T DO IT, BUT IT'S LIKE HE HAS ONE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
Stephen: FOR YOU, YOU--
FOR ME, I WAS LIKE NAH! I'M GOOD. I'M 40.
Stephen: YOU PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THE THINGS YOU DO. YOU DON'T GO OFF HALF-COCKED.
NO I LIKE TO KEEP IT SOMEWHAT CEREBRAL.
Stephen: I BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE THAT, BECAUSE EYE MEAN, ARE YOU A DEEP PERSON?
OH, HELL YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WELL, I THOUGHT THAT ABOUT YOU. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEEP.
IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU ASK ME THAT KIND OF QUESTION BECAUSE I'M SO DEEP-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I'M DEEP, TOO. THAT'S WHY I ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SOMEBODY'S DEEP.
OH! THAT'S DEEP. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AND, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE MAY KNOW, WHENEVER I HAVE A GUEST WHO IS AS DEEP AS YOU ARE AND AS DEEP AS I AM, I LIKE TO INVITE THEM TO CONTEMPLATE THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE WITH ME IN A SEGMENT WE CALL "BIG QUESTIONS WITH EVEN BIGGER STARS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.
YEAH.
Stephen: LOOK AT THAT SKY.
LOTS OF STARS AND STUFF.
Stephen: YEAH. I FEEL REALLY CLOSE TO YOU RIGHT NOW, WILL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HMMM.
YOU KNOW, STEPHEN?
Stephen: YEAH, WILL?
HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHT OF BY YOUR GREAT-GREAT GRANDCHILDREN?
Stephen: OH, I THINK I'D LIKE THEM TO THINK OF ME AS STILL BEING ALIVE. ( LAUGHTER )
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU KNOW?
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
Stephen: HEY, WILL?
YES, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WITH ALL THESE NEW MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK HUMANS WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE?
WELL, NOT LONG ENOUGH TO WATCH YOUR WHOLE NETFLIX CUE.
Stephen: PROBABLY NOT, PROBABLY NOT. ( LAUGHTER ).
STEPHEN?
Stephen: YEAH, WILL.
YOU EVER WONDER IF WE'RE ALL, LIKE, JUST INSIDE OF SOME DOG'S DREAM? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE IF WE WERE, THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE VACUUM CLEANERS.
Stephen: OH! AH. WELL, UNLESS IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
Stephen: TRUE, GOOD POINT ( BARKING (.
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU WANT ON YOUR GRAVESTONE?
Stephen: I THINK, WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
STEPHEN?
Stephen: WILL?
WHEN-- WHEN SOMEONE CALLS YOU BUT IT'S A WRONG NUMBER, DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER TALK TO THAT PERSON? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE I CALL THEM BACK A YEAR LATER FOR'S VENGE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: A SHOOTING STAR!
Stephen: OH!
Stephen: WISH ON IT. DON'T TELL ME WHAT IT IS OR IT WON'T COME TRUE?
I ALREADY DIDN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HEY, STEPHEN, IF YOU COULD TRADE PLACES WITH ANYONE ON EARTH, JUST ANYONE.
Stephen: ANYBODY?
ANYBODY, WHO WOULD IT BE?
Stephen: I'D HAVE TO SAY YOU, WILL.
OOH.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT YOU?
UH, I'D SAY YOU.
Stephen: OH, OH, MAN, THAT'S SO NICE.
YEAH, BUT ONLY AFTER YOU WERE ME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH, OKAY. YEAH.
I'D STILL BE WILL SMITH, BUT I'D BE LIKE, "HEY, I ADMIRE THAT GUY." ( LAUGHTER ) STEPHEN?
Stephen: WILL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES? EYES?
Stephen: THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING? ( LAUGHTER ) WILL, WILL, DO YOU-- DO YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION?
UM, NO. BUT I DID IN A PAST LIFE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WILL, ARE YOU AN INTROVERT OR AN EXTROVERT?
UM, THAT DEPEND ON HOW COLD THE WATER IS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU BELIEVE IN FREE WILL? ( LAUGHTER )
OH, NO, MAN. I'M REALLY EXPENSIVE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH.
DO YOU-- DO YOU BELIEVE IN A HIGHER POWER?
Stephen: OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY. AND THEY'RE TELLING ME WE HAVE TO GO TO COMMERCIAL RIGHT NOW.
OH!
Stephen: WILL SMITH, EVERYBODY. "SUICIDE SQUAD" OPENS WORLDWIDE THIS FRIDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU, WILL.

HI, GUYS. HELLO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HELLO! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I'M A HUGE FAN.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE IN A VERY SERIOUS FILM RIGHT NOW CALLED "INDIGNATION," BY THE VERY SERIOUS AUTHOR PHILLIP ROTH. PEOPLE KNOW YOU AS PERCY JACKSON, FROM THE PERCY JACKSON SERIES, SUPER FUN SERIES OF MOVIES. BUT ALSO PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER" AND "FURY." WHAT WAS IT LIKE DOING THE "FURY" MOVIE? IT LOOKED INCREDIBLY LOUD BECAUSE YOU WERE ALL GUYS IN A TANK.

Stephen: BRAD PITT.
BRAD PITT FOR ONE. YEAH, HE'S A HANDSOME DUDE.
Stephen: YOU'RE WORKED WITH BRAD PITT, MEL GIBSON.
I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME.
Stephen: DID THEY PASS YOU AROUND AND SAY, "HE'S A GOOD ONE?"
I GREW UP IN L.A., AND I WAS SUCCESSFUL AND GIVE IT A SHOT. AND KIDS GET SUCKED INTO THE MACHINE, HERE'S AN AUDITION, AND NOW I'M HERE. SOMEHOW I'M ON YOUR SHOW.
Stephen: YOU WORKED VERY HARD. ANY OF THESE OLDER ACTORS WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, DO ANY OF THEM ACT AS MENTORS TO YOU?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THEM HAVE. THEY'VE GIVEN ME ADVICE AND THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND OVER THE YEARS.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT BRAD PITT? HAS HE BEEN A MENTOR FOR YOU? BECAUSE THAT'S A GREAT PICKUP LINE.
YEAH "BRAD PITT IS MY MENTOR." GIVES ME ADVICE-- NO, NO, HE-- NO. YOU KNOW, PUNNY ENOUGH, WORKING WITH HIM WAS GREAT BUT WE REALLY WERE JUST IN OUR ROLE ROLES AND EMULATED OUR CHARACTERS' RELATIONSHIPS WHERE THERE WAS SOME CONFLICT WHEN WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER.
Stephen: CONFLICT WITH BRAD FIT?
YEAH, FOR SURE.
Stephen: LIKE, WHAT KIND OF CONFLICT?
YOU KNOW, I WAS-- SO MY CHARACTER IN THAT FILM WAS BASICALLY HE'S A NONCONFORMIST, AND I WAS TRYING TO BE, YOU KNOW, A NONCONFORMIST THROUGHOUT THE SHOOT. SO I'D KIND OF BE A LITTLE BIT OF A JERK WHILE WORKING WITH HIM. AND I'M NOT SURE FILEFT A GREAT IMPRESSION, YOU KNOW. BUT THAT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, FOR THE WORK AND, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE CONFLICT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT AFTER, YOU KNOW, FILMING WE BECAME FRIENDS. AND I LEARNED A LOT FROM HIM, AND HE'S A GREAT GUY. HE'S SOMEONE WHO IS JUST REALLY GENEROUS, GIVES A LOT, ASKS FOR LITTLE TO NOTHING IN RETURN AND JUST A GOOD DUDE.
Stephen: DOES HE EVER TALK ABOUT ME? DOES HE ASK ABOUT ME? DICOME UP AT ALL?
MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE.

Stephen: AND IS DESCRIBEED IN THE BOOK AS A NICE JEWISH BOY. IS HE A NICE JEWISH BOY?
YEAH. IT DEPENDS. HE'S A LITTLE BIT --
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES YOU A NICE JEWISH BOY.
HE'S A NICE JEWISH BOY BUT HE'S OPINIONATED. HE'S VERY OPINIONATED, HAS STRONG OPINIONS AND CONVICTIONS AND HE IS A LITTLE HARD TO GET ALONG WITH, BUT-- NO, HE'S NOT THAT NICE. HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S SMART. HE'S SMART AND HE CHALLENGES YOU.
Stephen: DOES HE GET IN CONFLICT WITH BRAD PITT EVER?
NOT IN THIS ONE, BUT WITH TRACY LETTS, WHO SAY WONDERFUL ACTOR IF IF YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW HIM, A WONDERFUL PLAYWRIGHT.
Stephen: A LOT OF PHILLIP ROTH NOVELS, PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO THEM BECAUSE THEY GOT THE SEXY TIME IN THERE. IS THERE SEX IN THIS MOVIE?
OH, THERE'S SOME SEXY TIME IN THIS FOR SURE. THERE ARE SOME REALLY SEXY MOMENTS. THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY IN HERE AND IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL HOLLYWOOD LOVE STORY. IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING OUT THERE IN THEATERS RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, THIS FILM IN PARTICULAR. BUT, YEAH, THERE IS SOME SEXY TIME AND A BEAUTIFUL ROMANCE IN THE FILM.
Stephen: I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP HERE.
