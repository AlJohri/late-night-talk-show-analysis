IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONTD WE WELCOME ASHTON KUTCHER. ROB CORD CORDDRY AND MUSICAL GUEST THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT IS STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) .
Stephen: RIGHT OVER THERE, EVERYBODY. THERE YOU GO. HOW ARE YOU?
STEPHEN!
Stephen: PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. WELL, DONALD TRUMP IS IN FRANCE RIGHT NOW AND I FEEL, JE NE SAIS QUOI, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I DON'T, CUZ I DON'T SPEAK FRENCH. AND I DON'T BLAME DONALD TRUMP FROM SKIPPING TOWN. THE MAN HAS HAD A REALLY ROUGH WEEK. HIS SON ADMITTED TO COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA. HIS HEALTH-CARE PLAN IS LOOKING DEAD IN THE WATER. AND HIS PRESS SECRETARY STILL HAS HIS HEAD STUCK IN THAT HONEY POT. (LAUGHTER) SO.
Jon: HONEY POT.
Stephen: TRUMP IS NOW IN PARIS AND IS HE GOING TO BE SO DISAPPOINTED ONCE HE LEARNS THATOUTOUT DOESN'T-- OU OU DOESN'T MEAN WHAT HE THINKS IT DOES. IT IS JUST AN ALLEGATION, JON. AND TODAY TRUMP MET WITH FRANCE'S ELEGANT FIRST LADY BRIGITTE MACRON AND OF COURSE HE TREATED HER LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN, BY OBJECTIFYING HER.
Stephen: BAD DONALD. NO! BAD. THIS IS NOT ONE OF YOUR EUROPEAN WIFE SHOPPING TRIPS. THIS IS BUSINESS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HE'S GOT TO LEARN. THE MAN HAS GOT TO LEARN HIS LIMITS. THEN TRUMP HELD A JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH NEWLY ELECTED FRENCH PRESIDENT AND SHOW HOTTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU, EMMANUEL MACRON. TRUMP INVOKED AMERICA'S LONG HISTORY WITH FRANCE.
FRANCE HELPED US SECURE OUR INDEPENDENCE. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET. FRANCE IS AMERICA'S FIRST AND OLDEST ALLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT.
Stephen: NOPE, JUST YOU. (LAUGHTER) WE KNOW. GAVE US THE STATUE OF LIBERTY TOO, REMEMBER THAT PART, STATUE OF LIBERTY? OF COURSE TRUMP GOT ASKED ABOUT THE BIGGEST STORY IN FRANCE. HIS SON'S COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA.
HE TOOK A MEETING WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER, NOT A GOVERNMENT LAWYER, BUT A RUSSIAN LAWYER. IT WAS A SHORT MEETING. IT WAS A MEETING THAT, WENT VERY, VERY QUICKLY, VERY FAST.
Stephen: WELCOME TO TRUMP'S AMERICA. WHERE MORALITY IS MEASURED BY SPEED. BECAUSE IT WAS OVER QUICKLY, IT WASN'T WRONG. IT'S LIKE A FIVE SECOND RULE FOR YOUR SOUL. HEY, I HAD SEX WITH YOUR SISTER, HON, BUT IT WAS OVER LIKE THAT. NOW-- (APPLAUSE) I'M SORRY, PARDON MONSIEUR PRESIDENTE, WERE YOU SPINNING.
TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, I GUESS ONE OF THEM LEFT ALMOST PLEADLY AND THE OTHER-- IMMEDIATELY AND THE OTHER ONE WAS NOT FOCUSED ON THE MEETING.
Stephen: THOSE OTHER GUYS DIDN'T HAVE THEIR HEAD NTION THE GAME BUT MY LITTLE DONE DID I'M NOT SURPRISED, EVEN AS A CHILD HE WAS A VERY ADVANCED COLLUDER, HE TOOK AP COLLUSION, VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT. BUT IN THE END, LOOKING AT THE STORY AS A WHOLE, THINKING ABOUT THE MEETING. HERE'S TRUMP'S BOTTOMLINE.
I DO THINK THIS. I THINK FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT, MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT MEETING.
Stephen: YES, MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT. TO THE FBI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT-- THAT'S NOT ME TALKING. THAT'S THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL, THAT IS THE HEAD OF THE FBI SAYING THAT. BUT BEFORE DONALD TRUMP LEFT THE COUNTRY HE GAVE MORE DETAILS ON THAT MEETING HE HAD WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN LAST WEEK, AT THE G20. HE TOLD REUTERS THAT HE PRESSED PUTIN ON THE ELECTION HACK. I SAID DID YOU DO IT AND HE SAID NO, I DID NOT, ABSOLUTELY NOT. THEN I ASKED HIM A SECOND TIME IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY. HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT. THEN, THEN, THEN I ASKED HIM A THIRD TIME AND HE SAID HE DID DO, BUT THEN I ASKED HIM A FOURTH TIME AND HE SAID NO AGAIN, SO IT'S PROBABLY FINE, TREMENDOUS GUY. I MEAN YOU GOT TO GIVE IT TO HIM, THAT'S THOROUGH. THAT IS AS THOROUGH. HE SAID HE ASKED HIM TWICE. THERE IS NO WAY PUTIN COULD HAVE LIED A SECOND TIME. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. AND REMEMBER, HE SPECIFICALLY SAID, THAT LITTLE QUOTE THERE HE SAID HE ASKED HIM TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. DID YOU HACK OUR ELECTIONS, NO. OKAY. AY, GUVNER, DID YOU ACK OUR LECTIONS. THANK YOU. THAT ACCENT RIGHT THERE? HOLD ON, NO, HOLD ON, NO. (APPLAUSE) I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND YOUR DESIRE TO PRAISE MY ACCENT. THEY CALL ME THE MERYL STREEP OF LATE NIGHT. TRUMP THEN EXPLAINED HIS GENIUS THEORY PROVING THAT PUTIN WASN'T INVOLVED. SOMEBODY DID SAY IF HE DID DO IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. WHICH IS A VERY INTERESTING POINT. YES. A VERY INTERESTING POINT. VERY STUPID BUT VERY INTERESTING. AND AS TRUMP ALSO EXPLAINED TO 700 CLUB FOUNDER AND CHRISTIAN SMEAGEL PAT ROBERTSON, RUSSIA COULDN'T HAVE WANTED HIM TO WIN THE ELECTION BECAUSE PUTIN WAS ACTUALLY PULLING FOR HILLARY.
IF HILL RAE HAD WON, OUR MILITARY WOULD BE DECIMATED. OUR ENERGY WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. THAT'S WHY PUTIN DOESN'T LIKE ABOUT ME. HE WOULD LIKE HILLARY WHERE SHE WANTS TO HAVE WINDMILLS.
Stephen: YES. SHE WOULD WANT TO HAVE WINDMILLS. TRUMP IS ALWAYS FIGHTING AGAINST WINDMILLS, THAT IS WHY THEY CALL HIM DONALD QUIXOTE. AND-- (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE TRUMP'S NOT THE ONLY ONE DEFENDING HIS SON. LAST NIGHT SENIOR WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR AND SATAN'S TROPHY WIFE KELLYANNE CONWAY APPEARED ON FOX NEWS AND USED A LITTLE VISUAL AID TO DRIVE HOME HER POINT.
I JUST WANT TO REVIEW IN CASE YOU RUN OUT OF TIME. THIS IS HOW I SEE ST SO FAR. THIS IS TO HELP ALL THE PEOPLE AT HOME. WHAT'S THE CONCLUSION, COLLUSION, NO. WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET. I SEE ILLUSION AND DELUSION, JUST SO WE ARE CLEARED, CONDITION CLEUTION, COLLUSION, NO, ILLUSION, DELUSION, YES, I JUST THOUGHT WE WHAT HAVE SOME FUN WITH WORDS.
Stephen: FUN, I WANT TO TRY. YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOT SOME HANDY VISUAL AIDS HERE. TRUMP, JR. TRIED TO ARTICULATED, BUT THAT TURNED OUT TO INCRIMINATE. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YEAH, SEE EASY TO REMEMBER, IT'S SOMETHING EVEN IDIOT WOULD ANTICIPATE, AND NOW HE'S GOING TO BE AN INMATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SOME FUN WITH WORDS. HAVES NO-- HAVE THOSE SENT TO THE SMITHSONIAN. LET'S SEE, WHAT ELSE. OH, THE GOP, TODAY THE GOP TOOK YET ANOTHER CRACK AT PASSING THEIR HEALTH-CARE BILL. THIS IS THEIR THIRD ATTEMPT, JUST A WORD OF ADVICE, FELLAS, IF YOU ARE HAVING THAT MUCH TROUBLE PASSING SOMETHING, YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR. EVERY VERSION SO FAR, UP UNTIL NOW, EVERY VERSION OF THIS GOP BILL HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY UNPOPULAR. POLLS SHOW THAT ONLY 12% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT IT. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, 12% IS THE ROTTEN TOMATO SCORE OF THE TALKING CAT MOVIE NINE LIVES. COINCIDENTALLY NINE LIVES IS ALSO WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO SURVIVE TRUMP CARE. THEY HAD TO-- .
THANK YOU.
HE CAN'T MAKE IT.
THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING RADICAL TO MAKE THE BILL MORE PALATABLE THIS TIME FOR PEOPLE TO THINK THE BILL LOOKED BETTER. SO THEY PUT SOMETHING IN KNOWN AS THE TED CRUZ AMENDMENT. NOTHING GETS PEOPLE MORE EXCITED LIKE THE FRAIDZ NOW WITH MORE TED CRUZ-- PHRASE NOW WITH MORE TED CRUZ. CRUZ'S AMENDMENT WOULD ALLOW INSURERS TO SELL CHEAPER PLANS WITH FEWER BENEFITS THAT WOULD LIKELY ATTRACT YOUNGER AND HEALTHIER AMERICANS, SO INSTEAD OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, INSURERS COULD CHARGE YOU A LITTLE BIT EACH MONTH FOR A SERVICE THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU REALLY WANT. LIKE NETFLIX, BUT YOU DIE. I GUESS, I GUESS THE WHITE HOUSE WAS EXPECTING A BAD SCORE FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE CUZ YESTERDAY THEY RELEASED AN ATTACK AD CLAIMING THE CBO MAKES ITS ESTIMATES INACCURATELY. BUT HERE'S THE THING, THE WHITE HOUSE ACTUALLY HAD TO PULL THAT AD BECAUSE THEY MISSPELLED THE WORD IN-N-AK RATTILY. OH-- IN-N-ACCURATELY. OH, OH, THAT-- (APPLAUSE) I GOT TO SAY, THAT IS IRONIC WITH A CAPITAL "Y." WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ASHTON KUTCHER IS HERE. I AM GOING TO TERRIFY ALL YOU PARENTS. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: JON BATISTE RIGHT THERE THE MAN. (APPLAUSE) JON, I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU, EVERYBODY OVER THERE AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKS ON THIS SHOW. BECAUSE TODAY THE LATE SHOW GOT NOMINATED FOR SIX EMMYS. (APPLAUSE) CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.
CONGRATULATIONS.
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU. BEST SHOW, BEST WRITING, BEST DIRECTING AND I'M SO PROUD OF EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HERE, EVERYBODY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF. SO TONIGHT SOMETHING SPECIAL, AT THE END OF THE SHOW, WE'RE GOING TO SCROLL ALL THEIR NAMES ON THE SCREEN. AND IT'S SIX NOMINATIONS THIS AREA BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THIS SHOW BUT IT'S ALSO FOR OUR ELECTION SPECIAL WHICH, I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THAT WELL BECAUSE WE'RE NOMINATED IN THE CATEGORY OF OUTSTANDING OPENING A BOTTLE OF BOURBON AND CRYING ON LIVE TELEVISION. BUT ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID. CONGRATULATIONS.
(APPLAUSE) CONGRATULATIONS. YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TEEN KIDS, FOLKS. AND WHEN YOU GOT TEENS THERE IS SO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I LIKE TO TAKE MY MIND OFF THOSE WORRIES AND INSTEAD WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE LOCAL NEWS SAYS I SHOULD WORRY ABOUT. THIS IS THE LATE SHOW'S TEEN SECRETS.  TEEN SECRETS. I YOU KNOW, IT IS NO SECRET THAT TEENS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET HIGH, UNLIKE US ADULTS. CHEERS TO US, BY THE WAY. HMMMM. HMMMM. WELL, THERE IS A NEW HIGH OUT THERE FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE.
A NEW WAY TO GET A BUZZ FROM SOMETHING THAT IS INEXPENSIVE, WIDELY AVAILABLE, PERFECTLY LEGAL AND TEENS ALREADY LOVE IT. CHOCOLATE. A NEW CHOCOLATE-BASED PRODUCT, COKEO LOCK COCO LOKO A POWDER THAT USERS CAN SNORT.
Stephen: FINALLY A CHOCOLATE YOU DON'T HAVE TO TASTE. THIS GIVES AN ENTIRELY NEW DEFINITION TO BROWN-NOSING. THIS SNORTABLE CHOCOLATE IS COCO LOKO AND COSTS $24.99 FOR TEN SERVINGS. NOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT REMEMBER THERE'S ALSO A CHOCOLATE ON THE MARKET THAT COSTS $100,000 AND THAT WON'T EVEN GET YOU HIGH. SO WHAT IS IN IT? I WILL LET THE C.E.O. OF COCO LOKO EXPLAIN.
IT IS BASICALLY CRAZY CHOCOLATE BECAUSE IT'S CHOCOLATE MIXED WITH OTHER THINGS THAT CREATES A CRAZY EFFECT.
Stephen: SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT SNORTABLE CHOCOLATE ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS GUY HAS HAD A BRUSH WITH NOSE CANDY. AND COCO LOKO IS MORE THAN JUST INHALLABLE CHOCOLATE, FOLKS. BECAUSE IT'S MIXED WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER CRAP.
THE PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY A BLEND, CACAO POWDER WITH OTHER INGREDIENTS OFTEN FOUND IN N DRINK, THE MAKERS CLAIM IT IS MAKE AN ELEVATED MOOD AND STATE OF EUPHORIA LIKE THE ECK STAS'.
Stephen: BUT MORE LIKE THE FEELING OF HEY, GUYS, I COULDN'T GET ECSTASY, YOU WANT TO SNORT SOME OVALTINE? COCO LOKO HAS EVEN GOTTEN THE ATTENTION OF SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER WHO SAID THIS SUSPECT PRODUCT HAS NO CLEAR HEALTH VALUE. I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE PARENT WHO THINKS IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO BE SNORTING OVER-THE-COUNTER STIM LANTS UP THEIR NOSES. WOW, WHAT A GLOOMY GUS. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY NEEDS A BUMP OF COCO LOKO. AND SKINNY JOHNA HILL HERE ISN'T CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HEALTH AFFECTS.
I DIDN'T CONSULT WITH ANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL.
Stephen: THERE YOU HAVE IT. HE DIDN'T CONSULT WITH ANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. PROBLEM IGNORED. THOUGH HE DID DO SOME RESEARCH TO MAKE SURE COCO LOKO WAS SAFE.
I BASICALLY JUST SAW WHAT EUROPE WAS DOING OUT HERE THERE WAS NO HEALTH ISSUES, IT'S BEEN OUT TWO, THREE YEARS, EVERYBODY SEEMS FINE, IT'S VERY POPULAR. THERE IS REALLY NO NECK TIFF PUBLICITY SO I FELL WE'RE GOOD TO GO.
Stephen: YEAH, WE'RE GOOD TO GO. WHY DON'T WE TEST ALL DRUGS THAT WAY. I MEAN NO ONE CURRENTLY ON COCAINE HAS ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT. I GOT TO SAY, THIS GUY AND HIS SNORTABLE CHOCOLATE HAD MADE ME REALIZE ALL THE WAYS THAT CANDY PUSHERS ARE ALREADY AFTER OUR KIDS. THIS SUGGEST ARER EP DIK IS BIGGER THAT BE JUST QUOKO LOCO, AND WE HAVE A CHOICE, DO WE CONFRONT IT NOW OR LATER. OF COURSE, SOME AIRHEADS MAY SAY THAT CANDY IS GOOD AND PLENTY IF PEOPLE USE IT BUT IGNORE THEIR SNICKERS BECAUSE THE SMARTIES KNOW WE'RE IN MOUNDS OF TROUBLE. IT SEEMS INNOCENT BUT EVENTUALLY YOU'LL BLOW EVERY PAYDAY, GO ON A CRIME [BLEEP] SPREE AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ON THE STREET TURNING TWIX. (APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WITH ASHTON KUTCHER. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR, A PRODUCER AND A TWITTER PIONEER WHO NOW STARS IN THE NETFLIX SERIES, THE RANCH. PLEASE WELCOME ASHTON KUTCHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. (APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE FIRED UP.
Stephen: HOW IS YOUR SUMMER GOING SO FAR.
IT'S GOING AMAZING.
Stephen: YEAH.
MY WIFE WAS WORKING ON A MOVIE IN ATLANTA.
Stephen: MILA K, NIS.
YEAH, THAT'S HER. SO I GOT TO SPEND THE LAST TWO MONTHS IN ATLANTA JUST RUNNING AFTER THE KIDS AND HANDLING OUT.
Stephen: THAT'S NIGHT NICE.
YEAH, IT WAS TBREAT.
Stephen: DID YOU ENJOY ANY OF THE REGIONAL FOOD THAT GEORGIA ALLOWS?
I GAINED LIKE TEN POUNDS, LIKE FOR REAL AM BETWEEN THAT AND-- IT'S FUNNY, WHEN YOU DON'T WORK ALL DAY YOU CAN DRINK BEER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND IT'S AWESOME.
Stephen: I LACK FORWARD TO IT.
AN I FOUND, AND IT'S RIGHT HERE, I'M KEEPING IT.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING HERE, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, YOU HAVE INVESTED IN UBER, SPOTIFY, AIRBNB, SKYPE, YOU LIKE TO SUPPORT NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE, HAVE COMMERCE IN NEW WAYS. BUT LIKE IF I HAD A NEW IDEA, WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD BE ASKING ME ABOUT MY PRODUCT? LIKE WHAT DO NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO YEAH, KUTCHER IS IN.
MY BIGGEST THING IS LIKE FOUNDERS FIRST. SO I WANT TO KNOW-- .
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT, FOUNDERS FIRST.
SO I BELIEVE THAT THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANY, CUZ I'M USUALLY INVESTING IN REALLY EARLY STAGE WHEN IT LIKE TWO GUYS, A DOG AND A POWER POINT PRESENTATION.
Stephen: LIKE AIRBNB YOU JUMPED IN EARLY ON THAT.
YEAH, I THINK THERE WERE LIKE 20 OR 30 EMPLOYEES WHEN I INVESTED. IT WAS LIKE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO OR SOMETHING. BUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE IDEA IS AUDACIOUS AND THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS LIKE A GIGANTIC TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET. I USUALLY LIKE IT WHEN AT FIRST IT DOESN'T LAND IN YOUR EAR RIGHT, LIKE IT ALMOST NEEDS TO SEEM NONSENSABLE. LIKE THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO SLEEP ON PEOPLE'S COUCHES, AND LIKE EVERYONE IS BEING TO BE COOL WITH THAT, IS LIKE,.
Stephen: IS THAT THE ONE THAT SURPRISED YOU THE POST BECAUSE ALL THESE THINGS, SO MANY OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU INVESTED IN HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IS THERE ONE THAT TOOK OFF THAT YOU ARE LIKE THAT KIND OF EVEN SURPRISES ME.
AIRBNB IS SHOCKING. TO ME UBER WAS SHOCKING, THE FACT THAT EVERYONE WOULD PAY A LITTLE MORE TO RIDE IN A BLACK CAR, LIKE DON'T WE JUST WANT TO GET THERE. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT TURNS INTO THIS JUGGER NAUGHT. BUT THERE IS EVEN STUFF LIKE, THERE IS A COMPANY CALLED ACORNS THAT WE JUST INVESTED.
Stephen: ACORNS.
AND THIS COMPANY IS IT'S BASICALLY LIKE A TIP JAR FOR YOUR SPENDING. SO WHEN YOU SPEND, YOU ROUND IT UP, YOU TIP IT AND YOU TIP IT INTO ACORNS AND IT INVESTS IT FOR YOU IN AN INTELLIGENT BALANCED PORTFOLIO.
Stephen: WAIT A SECONDED, SO I-- SO I, WHAT HAPPENS?
Stephen: I DIDN'T EVEN HERE, SO I'M SPENDING MONEY WITH MY PHONE.
IT ROUNDS UP WHATEVER YOUR EXPENSES ARE TO THE NEAREST DOLLAR.
Stephen: IS I GO BUY A COFFEE.
YEAH, SAY IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, 1.65. IT WILL TAKE THE OTHER 35 CENTS AND IMMEDIATELY PUTS IT INTO YOUR ACORNS ACCOUNT AND THEN IT BASICALLY LIKE STARTS TO DIVERSIFY AND BUILD UP A SAVINGS PORTFOLIO FOR YOU.
Stephen: WHAT IF I PITCH AN IDEA T IS YOU WILL CAD THE SYSTEM THAT I AM WORKING ON. IT'S COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY COMPANY CALLED FLURPEE AND IN   FLURPEE WHAT YOU DO, YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF SENSOR IN YOURED ABOUTEE THAT IS ALWAYS CHECKING ON YOUR HEALTH, LIKE WHAT YOUR TEMPERATURE IS, YOUR ENDOKRINE SYSTEM AND IF I GET SICK, IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO MY FRIENDS SAYING STEF SEN NOT FEELING WELL, HE HAS A FEVER, MAYBE HE IS FEELING A LITTLE FLURPEE AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE, IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE SICK I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOUP OR SOMETHING. AND THEN SUDDENLY, SOUP, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR IT. FLURPEE. (APPLAUSE) I'M IN, I'M IN, I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. IT SOUNDS ABSURD.
Stephen: IT'S RIDICULOUS.
BUT MAYBE THAT'S THE NEXT BEST THING, ARE YOU GO TO PROMOTE IT ON THE SHOW EVERY NIGHT, I'M DEFINITELY IN.
Stephen: OH YEAH, TOTALLY, TOTALLY.
I WILL FIND THE ENGINEER TO BUILD IT FOR YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, JUST MAKE THE PROBE COMFORTABLE, THAT'S ALL I ASK. ARE YOU INVESTING IN ANYTHING FUN NOW THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT? I HEAR YOU HAVE A COW THING GOING ON.
OH, YEAH, I INVESTED IN A COMPANY CALLED COWLER. IT IS BASICALLY A FIT BIT FOR COWS. SEE IN THAT IS HOW I KNEW IT WAS GOOD! I WAS-- .
Stephen: ARE COWS GETTING FLABBY? WHY DO THEY NEED.
SO I'M AT THIS INCUBATOR AND PITCHING A HUNDRED COMPANIES.
Stephen: AND AN INCUBATE CERTIFICATE WHAT.
WHERE YOUNG TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE GO TO BUILD THEIR COMPANY FROM THE GROUND UP. IT IS LIKE A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY, HELPS THEM BUILD IT AND A GUY PITCHES A FIT BIT FOR COWS AND EVERYONE LAUGHS. AND I'M LIKE THAT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT. BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT DAREY COW PRODUCTION, YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE COW IS PREGNANT IN ORDER TO HIT THE CYCLES IN ORDER TO GET THE MILK FROM THE COW, RIGHT?
Stephen: SURE.
AND THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS IS RIDICULOUSLY EXTENSION-- EXPENSIVE AND NOT BRILLIANTLY BUILT AND THESE GUYS ARE DOING IT AT A REASONABLE PRICE THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES DAIRY PRODUCTION YIELD.
Stephen: THAT IS FROM KNOWING HOW MANY STEPS THE COW TOOK THAT DAY.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THE COWS AREN'T JUST DOING THIS IN THE FIELD, JUST SHAKING THEIR PAWS BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY JUST DOES, I'M AT 10,000.
I'M GOING TO GET THEM TODAY. I'M GOING TO GET THEM TODAY.
IT TRACKS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COW, IT TRACKS THE LOCATION OF THE COW, SO YOU KNOW.
Stephen: WELL, THAT IS FLURPEE.
IT IS BASICALLY FLURPEE.
Stephen: I'M SUING THE DAMN COWS.
THEY STOLE YOUR IDEA.
Stephen: LAWYER UP, BESSIE.
THAT ONE IS A GOOD ONE. THERE IS ANOTHER COMPANY WE JUST TESTIFY INVESTED IN CALLED HOOKED, SWI REALLY COOL.
YEAH, HOOK! ED.
THERE IS USERS AND THEY ARE HEAR.
Stephen: HE IS A PIRATE OUT THERE.
I THINK IT'S LIKE THE NEW FORM OF STORYTELLING WHICH IS WE'RE SO USED TO READING TEXT MESSAGES.
Stephen: YAI YAI.
THAT WE ARE BUILDING A NARRATIVE EXEU TAITION IN OUR BRAINS THAT IS FROM READING TEXT MESSAGES. WHAT THIS DOES, IT JUST BASICALLY, IT IS STORYTELLING BUT THROUGH A TEXT MESSAGE FORE MAT. SO IT WILL START OUT, THE FIRST ONE WILL BE LIKE MOM, DON'T COME UPSTAIRS. AND THEN YOU CLICK IT AND THEN IT COMESES ALIKE WHAT?
Stephen: ALL WRITTEN BY 14 YEAR OLD BOYS.
IT'S AMAZING. AND IT'S LIKE A HORROR STORY WHERE YOU ARE ENTHRALLED BECAUSE ARE YOU SO USED TO THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE THAT YOU GET FROM READING TEXT MESSAGES.
Stephen: AND YOU ARE HOOKED ON THE STORY.
AND YOU'RE HOOKED.
Stephen: OH, WOW, I'M IN, I'M IN.
YOU WANT IN ON THAT ONE.
Stephen: I'M IN FOR $40.
AND THE COW ONE TOO.
Stephen: COW ONE.
COWLER AND HOOK.
Stephen: WHY SHOULD I BUY THE COW WHEN I CAN GET THE MILK FOR FREE, ASHTON KUTCHER. NOW WERE YOU A TWITTER PIONEER, YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON TO HIT A MILLION PEOPLE ON TWITTER.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK, OUR PRESIDENT HAS MADE A-- HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS.
NOTHING TO DO.
Stephen: I'M JUST ASKING, OUR PRESIDENT HAS MADE A BIT OF A CAREER LAST FAW YEARS ON TWITTER AND NOW HE IS THE MOST POWERFUL TWITTER USER IN THE WORLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WAY HE TWEETS. HAVE YOU GOT ANY CRITIQUE OF HIS USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY?
JUST AS A PIONEER, I'M JUST ASKING AS A PIONEER, NOT A POLITICAL CONSULTANTS.
OKAY, SO HERE IS WHAT I WILL SAY. WHEN TWITTER FIRST STARTED, WHEN I FIRST GOT ON TWITTER, YOU COULD ACTUALLY KIND OF SAY WHATEVER YOU THOUGHT. AND GET HIGH QUALITY FEEDBACK LOOPS REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY AND REFINE WHAT YOU THOUGHT AND THEN REPOST IT. BUT IT WAS BEFORE MEDIA WAS REALLY FOLLOWING WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING ON TWITTER. AND SO IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD PUT A FRAGILE IDEA OUT INTO THE WORLD, AND GET HIGH QUALITY FEEDBACK AND THEN AMEND IT AND THEN GO WITH WHATEVER YOU FELT. AND NOW IT'S A BROADCASTING SYSTEM. IT'S LIKE A GIANT BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND SO I THINK THAT HIS TWEETS WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN YOU COULD SHARE AN IDEA THAT WASN'T FULLY BAKED.
WELL, HOLD ON. AND I'M NOT-- I'M NOT SAYING THAT-- I'M HONESTLY NOT SAYING THAT LIKE WHOLLY JUDGEMENTALLY. BUT I KIND OF FEEL LIKE EMOTIONS CAN GET THE BEST OF YOU WHEN YOU HAVE THAT BIG OF A MEGA PHONE. AND SOMETIMES IT IS BETTER TO MUL IT OVER A BIT.
Stephen: DID YOU INVEST IN TWITTER?
NO.
Stephen: WHY NOT? YOU WERE THE PIONEER, WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT THE CASH IN.
I WAS NOT THE PIONEER, I WAS JUST THE USER.
Stephen: WERE YOU A PIONEERING USER, HOW ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE THING THAT MADE ME START INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY, COMPANIES.
BECAUSE I REALIZED THE VALUE THAT I COULD BRING BY ADOPTING IT AND PROMOTING IT. AND I REALIZED THAT WOW, THERE IS A LOT OF VALUE THAT I LEFT ON THE TABLE BY NOT HAVING EQUITY. AND THE FOUNDER JACK DORSE WHEN HE STARTED HIS NEXT COMPANY SQUARE BY ACTUALLY INVESTED IN THAT COMPANY.
Stephen: THAT'S THE THING, THE SWIPE THING.
YEAH. WHICH IS DOING REALLY WELL AS A COMPANY ON THE PUBLIC MARKET NOW. BUT I INVESTED IN THERE. SO I MADE GOOD ON-- HE HOOKED ME UP.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. TELL THEM ABOUT FLURPEE, TELL HIM ABOUT FLURPEE.
I WILL.
Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE THE SECOND SEASON, SECOND SEASON? WITH YOU BTS HE CALLED PART THREE.
YEAH.
Stephen: OF YOUR SERIES THE RANCH.
IT'S REALLY CONFUSING, LET'S JUST CALL IT PART THREA.
Stephen: BUT IT'S SEASON TWO.
SEASON TWO, PART THREE.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE THE SIXTH INSTALLMENT, WOULDN'T IT.
IT IS THE THIRD-- IT IS-- .
Stephen: SIMPLE MATH. OKAY. SO IT'S CALLED THE RANCH. IT IS A SITCOM ON NETFLIX, WHAT MADE IT RIGHT FOR NET IN FLICKS, IS THERE BAD WORDS? IS THERE SHALL.
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY RAUNCHY.
Stephen: THERE NEWEDDITY.
YEAH, THERE'S SOME, MOSTLY ME. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: IT'S A RANCH, I ASSUME THERE IS SOME AS ASSLESS CHAPS GOING ON.
JUST ME.
Stephen: JUST YOU.
YEAH, THE THING, I GREW UP ON LIKE 80 SITCOMS, ROSANNE AND LIKE, AND WAS LIKE FULLY, LIKE, IN WITH THESE FAMILIES THAT WERE LIKE MID WESTERN FAMILIES THAT FELT LIKE MY FAMILY.
Stephen: FROM IOWA.
I AM FROM IOWA, AND SO I-- AND I RELATED TO THAT FAMILY. LIKE I ACTUALLY, LIKE WAS ABLE TO SORT OF EXERCISE IDEAS THROUGH WATCHING THE SHOW. AND LAUGH WITH THIS FAMILY AND REALIZE THAT WE WEREN'T THE ONLY, YOU KNOW, POOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY TRYING TO STRUGGLE AND GET BY IN THE WORLD. AND THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE LIKE US. AND I LOOKED AROUND AT WHAT WAS ON TELEVISION AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS REPRESENTING THAT COMMUNITY. AND ESPECIALLY WITH, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY WITH CONSERVATIVE BELIEFS, ON A RANCH THAT'S BEING TORN APART BY GLOBALIZATION AND BIG INDUSTRY FARMS COMING AND TAKING THESE GUYS OUT. AND I THOUGHT WAIT, THOSE PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE. AND THEY'RE NOT ALLLY UNDERREPRESENTED. AND EVERY TIME YOU SEE CONSERVATIVE POINTS OF VIEW ON TELEVISION, PEOPLE ARE MAKING FUN OF IT. AND BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY CONNECT WITH THAT. AND THEY BELIEVE THAT. AND SO THE SHOW IS KIND OF LIKE A COUNTRY SONG. AND ITS-- .
Stephen: THE SHOW IS LIKE A COUNTRY SONG.
YEAH, IT'S LIKE A COUNTRY SONG, LIKE YOU LOSE YOUR WIFE AND YOUR DOG AND YOU GET DRUNK ON BEER. AND, AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF WHAT THE ETHIC OF THE SHOW IS. AND IT'S FUN BECAUSE NETFLIX LETS US GO FOR IT THEY LET US, LET IT ALL HANG OUT THERE.
Stephen: WELL, WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CLIP. SOMETHING HAVING TO DO WITH BREAKFAST.
YEAH, THIS IS BREAKFAST. I'M PRETENDING LIKE I'M MAKING MY GIRLFRIEND BREAKFAST TO SAY SORRY.
JUST COOKING A LITTLE BREAKFAST FOR MY FAVORITE GIRL.
YOU DON'T COOK.
OH, CAKES AND SAUSAGES, BEG TO DIFFER.
OH, ARE YOU DO THAT THING WHERE YOU RUN TO MCDONALD'S AND PRETEND TO COOK FOR ME? (LAUGHTER)
NO.
WHAT IF I CHECK THE GARBAGE.
NO, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NICE STEEKING YOU AGAIN, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW SHOW, THE RANCH PART THREE IS ON NETFLIX. ASHTON KUTCHER, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).

Stephen: DO YOU STILL IMPROVISE.
NO, NO, WELL, NOT-- LIKE I WILL DO SOME REUNION SHOWS BUT I'M RUSTY, YOU KNOW, LIKE MY MUSCLES, MY IMPROV MUSCLES ARE WEAK.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A SPORT.
IT REALLY IS, AND ALSO MY MUSCLE MUSCLES ARE-- SO ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS DOING THIS, OKAY. I WAS DOING THIS. AN IMPROV SCENE, A REUNION SHOW AND I WENT, STEPPED BACKWARDS AND FELT A POP IN MY CALF, BLEW OUT MY CALF MUSCLE AND IRONICALLY WE WERE DOING A SCENE ABOUT HOW OLD WE ARE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
NO.
Stephen: YOU TORE A MUSCLE WALKING BACKWARDS.
I TORE A MUSCLE STEPPING BACKWARDS, STEPPING, NOT EVEN WALKING, STEPPING BACKWARDS.
Stephen: YOU GOT TO STRETCH OUT BEFORE YOU USE THE BATHROOM. I DON'T-- I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, MAN.
AH, MAN, I THINK ABOUT STRETCHING A LOT. I DO.
Stephen: NOW ARE YOU DOING THE SHOW, WITH THE ROCK CALLED BALLERS, THIS SEASON HOW HARD DO YOU GUYS BALL?
WE WERE BALLING AS PER THE TITLE OF THE SHOW. SEASON TWO, FOR SURE LIKE DOUBLE BALLING. , RIGHT?
Stephen: I SEE A PATTERN HERE.

Stephen: YOU'RE OFF THE BALL CHART.
YOU'RE OFF THE BALL CHART.
Stephen: YOU BURIED THE BALL NEEDLE.
IF THERE IS A BALL CHART, I GOT TO SEE THAT. I'VE GOT-- I REALLY DESERVE IT.
Stephen: WELL, YOU MANAGED TO MAKE A LIFE IN THE ARTS, WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH YOUR-- YOU HAVE KIDS RIGHT.
SURE, TWO KIDS.
Stephen: WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH THEM HAVING A LIFE IN THE ARTS.
OH YEAH, THEY'RE VERY ARTISTIC. AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WANTS TO BE AND HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A TATTOO ARTIST. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU SAID THAT TO YOUR MOTHER WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP. LIKE SHE WOULD SMACK YOU ACROSS YOUR FACE.
Stephen: YES.
YEAH, SHE HAS WANTED TO BE A TATTOO ARTIST EVER SINCE OUR FRIEND LIKE WAS-- SHE FOUND OUT HE DID IT AND THAT IS A THING. AND SO WE WERE OVER AT HIS STUDIO RECENTLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND SHE WAS FASCINATED LOOKING AT ALL THE ARTISTS DOING THEIR TATTOOS. AND SCOTT SAID, YOU SHOULD TATTOO YOUR DAD. AND AT THAT MOMENT-- .
Stephen: HOW OLD IS SHE.
EIGHT YEARS OLD, SHE WAS SEVEN AT THE TIME. NO CONTROL OVER MY BRAIN TO MOUTH CHANNEL AT THAT POINT. I WENT YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, LET'S DO THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S LOVE, BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER.
I DO LOVE HER. I LOVE HER. AND I LOVE THE TATTOO THAT SHE ACTUALLY GAVE ME THAT AFTERNOON.
Stephen: SHE GAVE YOU.
SHE GAVE ME A-- .
