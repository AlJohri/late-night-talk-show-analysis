HEY, STEPHEN?
Stephen: YES, PAUL.
SPOTIFY CAN O DID THIS SORT OF POLL. IN AUSTRALIA, THE NUMBER ONE TUNE TO HAVE SEX TO IS THE "STAR WARS CANTINA BAND" SONG. THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

YOU KNOW WHAT SONG I'M TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT, THAT BOP-BOP-BOP- BOP-BA-BA-BA...
Stephen: BA-DA-BA. YEAH, I KNOW THE SONG YOU'RE MURDERING OVER THERE. AND THAT SONG IS THE MOST SEDUCTIVE SOUND EVER TO EMANATE FROM THE OUTER RIM.
STEPHEN, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE AUSTRALIAN.
Stephen: I'M NOT, PAUL, BUT LIFEBLOOD. YOU SEE, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH DOIKK NA'TS. HE'S A MEMBER OF THE CANTINA BAND.
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT GUY.
Stephen: KNOW HIM, PAUL? I LOVED HIM. THERE HE IS, HOLDING HIS DORENIAN BESHNIQUEL. AND LET'S JUST SAY, THAT WASN'T THE ONLY THING DOIKK KNEW HOW TO BLOW. WHEN I FIRST HEARD DOIKK PLAY AT THE MOS EISLEY CANTINA, HE MADE LOVE TO THAT INSTRUMENT, AND THEN HE MADE LOVE TO ME. IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I'LL NEVER FORGET, BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT SEX HE WAS OR HOW HE DID IT. UNDER THOSE CLOTHES IT'S KIND OF A-- KIND OF A TRAIN WRECK, I HAVE TO SAY. I JUST POKED AROUND AND HOPED FOR THE BEST.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL EVENING.
Stephen: IT WAS. SO YEAH, PAUL, I'M PRETTY AWARE THE CANTINA BAND SONG IS A GREAT SONG TO HAVE SEX TO.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM AGAIN?
Stephen: ONLY IN MY DREAMS, PAUL, ONLY IN MY DREAMS. AND ON WEEKENDS. HE'S GOT THE KIDS.

WELL, THE REVELATIONS ABOUT THE TRUMP TEAM'S CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA JUST KEEP ON COMING. YESTERDAY, WE LEARNED THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS MET WITH A RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND THEN WHAT'S THE WORD? LIED ABOUT IT TO CONGRESS. SO YESTERDAY SESSIONS MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:
I HAVE RECUSED MYSELF IN THE MATTERS THAT DEAL WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: SENATOR, YOU CAN'T RECUSE YOURSELF FROM ALL MATTERS THAT DEAL WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE PROSECUTOR, BUT YOU MIGHT BE A DEFENDANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUGE, BIG, BIG, JEFF SESSIONS FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) SENATOR, WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME YOU LIED TO SENATOR FRANKEN?
IN RETROSPECT I SHOULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN AND SAID, "BUT I DID MEET ONE RUSSIAN OFFICIAL ONE TIME. THAT WOULD BE THE AMBASSADOR. THANK YOU, ALL, TAKE CARE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: Y'ALL COME BACK NOW, HEAR, HEAR. SERIOUSLY, WE'RE GETTING A SUBPOENA. YOU ALL COME BACK NOW, OKAY? YOU CAN'T JUST END A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE ONE PIECE OF RELEVANT INFORMATION YOU HAVE. THAT WOULD BE LIKE DARTH VADER SAYING, "BY THE WAY, LUKE, I'M YOUR DAD. TAKE CARE, BYE! 2 I DON'T KNOW HAVE DARTH VADER IS SOUTHERN IN THIS ANALOGY. IT WOULD BE FUN IF HE WAS. AND THEN THE DAY GOT A LITTLE MORE NOT GOOD FOR THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, BECAUSE THEY ADMITTED THAT IN DECEMBER, TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW AND FRAT GUY WHO SEEMS NICE AT FIRST, JARED KUSHNER, JOINED MICHAEL FLYNN AT A MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR-- THIS GUY. WHO-- SURPRISE-- ALSO MET WITH TRUMP ADVISERS CARTER PAGE AND J.D. GORDON. DID EVERYONE TRUMP KNOWS HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR? HOLD ON. WAIT A SECOND. CAN WE-- JIM, DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF BANNON'S NANNY? THERE YOU GO. SHE CHECKS OUT. THAT'S FINE. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKING OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS... DISNEY. THEY'VE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF PROGRESSIVE VALUES, FROM THEIR POSITIVE DEPICTION OF A WOMAN WITH SEVEN HUSBANDS TO TOUTING THE BENEFITS OF HALLUCINOGENIC. DRUGS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW DISNEY HAS STRUCK ANOTHER BLOW FOR OPEN-MINDEDNESS.
THE NEW MOVIE "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" WILL FEATURE DISNEY'S FIRST OPENLY GAY CHARACTER. THE DIRECTOR REVEALED THAT GASTON'S SIDEKICK, LA FOU, PLAYED  BY ACTOR JOSH GAD, WILL EXPLORE HIS SEXUALITY IN A SMALL, BUT SIGNIFICANT SUBPLOT.
Stephen: NOW, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER LAFOU FROM "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST," HE'S THIS GUY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NO, NO! WAIT, WAIT! NO! JIMMY, THAT'S THE WRONG INCOMPETENT SIDEKICK WHO SUCKS UP TO THE BAD GUY. YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE. RIGHT THERE.

NOW, UNSURPRISINGLY, SOME PEOPLE ARE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE "SAME-SEX SURPRISE" IN THE FILM. ALTHOUGH, THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND IF THEY THINK TWO MEN KISSING RUINS THIS KID'S MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS HELD CAPTIVE UNTIL SHE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A GIANT ANGRY ANIMAL. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, THIS IS A QUESTION I DON'T GET TO ASK OFTEN ENOUGH:  ANYBODY HERE ENJOY MARIJUANA? ANYBODY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SOME PEOPLE DO. SOME PEOPLE DO. NOT EVERYBODY, SOME PEOPLE DO. EVERYBODY WHO JUST CLAPPED, BETTER HOPE THAT JEFF SESSIONS DOES REDESIGN, BECAUSE SINCE HE TOOK OVER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT HE HAS TAKEN A HARD LINE ON THE STICKYICKY. AND HE LAID OUT HIS OPPOSITION AT THE NATIONAL MEETING OF ATTORNEY GENERALS.
I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING TO BE A BETTER, HEALTHIER NATION IF WE HAVE MARIJUANA BEING SOLD AT EVERY CORNER GROCERY STORE.
Stephen: MAYBE SO, BUT THOSE GROCERY STORES WILL SELL A LOT MORE PRETZEL BITES AND. MARSHMALLOW FLUFF. IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS.  ( APPLAUSE ) THIS SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE TIME TO LAUNCH A NEW WAR ON WEED. FOR ONE THING, "PLANET EARTH 2" JUST CAME OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND CURRENTLY, 28 STATES HAVE LEGALIZED MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL OR MEDICINAL USE, AND SESSIONS' COMMENTS HAVE THROWN THE COUNTRY'S MARIJUANA. INDUSTRY INTO A PANIC.

Jon: I PLAY A LOT. IT WORKS OUT GLI HAVE TO CHANGE MY PHONE COMPANY. FOLKS, WE'RE OVER A MONTH IN TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. ARE YOU GUYS WORRIED ABOUT THIS? I'M WORRIED, TOO.

Stephen: CAN YOU EXPLAIN VEGEMITE TO ME? I TASTED IT-- I'VE TASTED IT IN NEW ZEALAND, AND IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME.

Stephen: IT WAS ONE OF THE SADDEST FACES I HAVE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. YOU WON TWO OSCARS. NOMINATE FORWARD SEVEN.
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WHY NOT? WHY NOT? THE REASON I ASK IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A HUGE HULLABALOO AT THE OSCARS THIS PART SUNDAY NIGHT.
OH, IT WASN'T THAT BAD!
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN BACKSTAGE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR EVERYONE UP THERE, ABSOLUTELY SO SHOCKING.
AWFUL. IT'S LIKE SORT OF BEING MARRIED TO THE WRONG PERSON. IT'S-- BUT, YOU KNOW, AT FIRST FOR ME WHAT WAS MOST UPSETTING IS-- IN AUSTRALIA, THERE'S A-- WE HAVE A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL SORT OF CULTURAL INDUSTRIES, BUT OFTEN SUCCESS IS NOT REWARD. BUT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY, THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT AMERICA IS SUCCESS IS REWARDED. AND BUTT NOW I THINK IN THE LAST-- SINCE THE INAUGURATION, THIS NOTION OF THE CULTURAL ELITE HAS REALLY KIND OF GOT GOING. SO ANYONE WHO HAS GOT A VOICE AND SUCCESS IN THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES IS SUDDENLY MARGINALIZED OR CONSIDERED, YOU KNOW, THEIR VOICE ISN'T SIGNIFICANT OR WORTH BEING PARENT OF THE, YOU KNOW, POPULAR PARLANCE. AND THEY KIND OF HANDED IT TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON SUNDAY NIGHT, THAT THEY'RE A BUNCH OF DUFFERS.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY LOOKED LIKE IDIOTS.
BUT THEY'RE NOT.
Stephen: AND HE GETS TO POINT AND GO, "HOLLYWOOD, SAD."
YSAD, WHICH IS SUCH A PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING THING TO SAY.
Stephen: YEAH.
HOLLYWOOD SAD.
Stephen: HOLLYWOOD SAD. MAKE ME HAPPY, NOT SAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT'S THE SECRET TO WINNING AN OSCAR? AS SOON AS THEY GIVE IT TO YOU, RUN OFF STAGE BEFORE THEY CAN GIVE IT TO "MOONLIGHT."

Stephen: IT'S NICE.
IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT? IT'S REALLY NICE.
Stephen: IT'S TWICE THE OSCARS.
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT NEXT YEAR.
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE ON BROADWAY DEBUT. I'M SO SURPRISED THIS IS YOUR BROADWAY DEBUT BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH THEATER IN AUSTRALIA.
MY HUSBAND AND I RAN THE SYDNEY THEATRE, THIS IS THE LAST PLAY HE PROGRAMMED.
Stephen: IT'S AT THE ETHEL BARRYMORE THEATRE IN NEW YORK.
THAT'S ME.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED "THE PRESENT." IT'S A CHEKHOV PLAY. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH "THE PRESENT."
IT'S BECAUSE CHEKHOV WROTE IT FOR AN ACTRESS WHO WAS REJECTED IT --
Stephen: WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WOMAN HE HAD A CRUTCH ON?
NO, AND HE PUT IT, AS RICHARD SAYS IN HIS SOCK DRAWER AND IT WAS NEVER FOUND. IT WAS A BROKEN FRAGMENT OF A WORK, AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE ABOUT CHEKHOV IS IT'S FUN GLE IT'S A COMEDY.
"CHERRY ORCHARD" HIS MOST WELL KNOWN PLAY SAY COMEDY IN FOUR ACTS AND IT'S ALWAYS PLAYED FOR THE MISERY. BOOTS PEOPLE IN A MIDLIFE CRISIS, AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE HILARIOUS AND ABSURD AND TRAGIC. LET'S FACE IT. YOU'RE NOT THERE YET.

ANDREW HAS UPDATED IT TO THE SORT OF 90 NECESSARY RUSSIA. SO WHEN PIEWTEN IS COMING TO POWER, WHICH SEEMS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THIS-- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT. AND WITH THE RISE OF THE OLIGARCHS. SO IT'S ALL ABOUT, AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN LIFE, WHAT'S YOUR MORAL COMPASS? WHAT DO YOU-- WHERE DOES KINDNESS AND HUMANITY SIT IN A REALLY BRUTAL WORLD.
Stephen: CATE BLANCHETT, WHAT IS YOUR MORAL COMPASS? WHERE DOES KINDNESS AND HUMANITY SIT NAY BRUTAL WORLD? THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK RIGHT NOW.
IT'S IN MY VAGINA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, OKAY. THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
Stephen: THAT TAKES-- THAT TAKES CARE OF MY NEXT TWO QUESTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR CHARACTER SAYS THAT IT'S EASIER TO DO (BLEEP) THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
NO, IT'S SO HARD TO DO WHAT YOU REALLY, REALLY DESPERATELY WANT IN LIFE. IT'S SO EASY TO DO (BLEEP) YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT EITHER WAY. AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?
Stephen: ARE THERE THINGS YOU'RE TEMPTED TO DO, "OH, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT WOULD BE FUN TO DO AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT"?
LIKE BUNGEE JUMPING OR SOMETHING INSANE LIKE THAT.
Stephen: IF YOU WEREN'T BEING AN ACTRESS, DO YOU HAVE SOME OTHER DREAM.
I STUDIED ARCHITECTURE FOR A WHILE AT UNIVERSITY AND THOUGHT I WOULD GO INTO GALLERY CURATION. SOMEONE SAID TO ME IN HIGH SCHOOL, "YOU SHOULD FIND WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND YOU SHOULD SORT OF FIND A WAY TO BRING THAT INTO A PROFESSION. EXPIVMENT THOUGHT WHAT AM I PASSIONATE ABOUT? I THOUGHT I HAVE A PASSIONATE HATRED FOR PLASTIC BAGS BUT I COULDN'T QUITE BRIDGE HOW I COULD MAKE A CAREER OUT OF THAT. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE, HANDICRAFTS --

IT'S BEEN QUITE CONFRONTING, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO THINK ABOUT CHICKENS AND THINKITHINKITHINKING ABOUT GARDE AND I THOUGHT, HOLD ON. THAT'S HOW MY GRANDMOTHER AND MOTHER STARTED.

THIS IS THE DRIVER'S SEAT. THIS IS THE PASSENGER'S SEAT. ME AND THE DATE ARE COMING ALONG. I WOULD, LIKE, OPEN UP THE DOOR TO GET IN, BUT SHE THOUGHT I WAS BEING CHIVALROUS. ( LAUGHTER ) SHE'S LIKE, "OH, THANK YOU." AND I'M LIKE, "OH, NO, NO, I HAVE A TERRIBLE CAR." AND SHE WOULD HAVE TO SEE ME, LIKE A TODDLER, LIKE... CRAWL ACROSS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S OKAY. "SO, DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME NOW?" ( LAUGHTER ) RARELY GET INTO THE CAR.
Stephen: EXACTLY. IT'S ANOTHER REASON TO GET MARRIED.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL, IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
Stephen: SEASON TWO OF "LOVE" PREMIERES NEXT FRIDAY ON NETFLIX. PAUL RUST, EVERYBODY! GOOD KID. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH COMEDIAN MO AMER.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST IS A DMEEDIAN WHO HAS SOLD OUT SHOWS IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES. TONIGHT, HE'S MAKING HIS NETWORK TELEVISION DEBUT. PLEASE WELCOME MO AMER! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THIS! LOOK AT THIS! NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS. MY NAME IS MO AMBER. MO IS ACTUALLY SHORT FOR MOHAMMED! SURPRISE! FADE'S THE DAY! IT'S OVER FOR YOU GUYS. PACK IT UP! GET THE DOOR! NO, I'M KIDDING. LET'S JUST SOAK THAT IN FOR A SECOND. IT'S A NEW TRUMP ERA, YOU KNOW. AND SPEAK OF, I RECENTLY TOOK A FLIGHT WITH ERIC TRUMP-- NOT ON PURPOSE. IT JUST HAPPENED. I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO BE IN THE PLANE. MIGHT HAVE SHOWED UP ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS. BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING, THE LADY WHO UPGRADE ME INTO THAT SEAT WAS CERTAINLY A CLINTON SUPPORTER, 100%. ( APPLAUSE ) 100%. SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, ERIC TRUMP IS ON MY FLIGHT? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME? OH, THERE'S AN EMPTY SEAT NEXT TO ERIC, IS THERE? LET ME ATTACK A LOOK AT THIS UPGRADE LIST SEE WHO'S WAITING TO BE UPGRADE. ON.
MOHAMMED MUSTAPHA AMA! UPGRADE NOW!" BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN GREETED WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM PRIOR TO BOARDING AN AIRCRAFT AS A MOHAMMED FLYING OUT OF NEW YORK. HAS NEVER HAPPENED. I WALK UP TRYING TO SCAN MY BORDER PASS. SHE'S LIKE, "GUESS WHO'S BEEN UPGRADE! BA-BA." I WAS LIKE, "WHAT IS THIS, A RAP BATTLE?" I WALK INTO THE PLANE, I SEE WHAT-- I WAS LIKE, IS THAT ERIC TRUMP? NO, IT CAN'T BE. I PUT UP MY BAG, TOOK A SECOND LOOK, AND SAW HIS NAME ON HIS SWEATER. AH, DEFINITELY WAS ERIC. I KNEW WHAT TO DO NEXT. I SAT NEXT TO HIM AND SAY SALAM, ERIC. HOW YOU DOING? HOW ARE YOU, MAN? LIKE, MY NAME IS MOHAMMED. I'M MUSLIM, AND I CAME HERE AS A REFUGEE! WE MADE IT, MAMA! YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT WAS FUN.  ( APPLAUSE ) I JUMPED RIGHT INTO IT. I WAS LIKE, "HEY, MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE HATE IS ABOUT. MOHAMMED IS THE MOST POPULAR NAME IN THE WORLD OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT'S FRUSTRATING ABOUT THAT FACT?  I WENT TO DISNEYLAND THREE WEEKS AGO, NOT ONE KEY CHAIN WITH MY NAME ON IT. NOT ONE PERSON HAS SHARED A COCA-COLA WITH ME IN AMERICA, NOT A SINGLE PERSON. I MUST CONFESS, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW POPULAR THE NAME WAS UNTIL I WATCHED THE EGYPTIAN SOCCER TEAM. THEY WERE SHOWING A PLAY-BY-PLAY REQUEST AND THE COMMENTATOR SAID MOHAMMED HAS THE BALL UPON. BALL TO MOHAMMED. MOHAMMED TO MOHAMMED. MOHAMMED TO MOHAMMED. MOHAMMED! MOHAMMED! MOHAMMED! THERE'S ONE GUY ON THE TEAM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I WAS ACTUALLY BORN IN KUWAIT. I LEFT KUWAIT AFTER THE FIRST GULF WAR, OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT "THE PREQUEL." I WENT TO A REAR NICE PRIVATE BRITISH-ENGLISH SCHOOL. HAD A HINT OF A BRITISH ACCENT. I WAS ADORABLE. HELLO, MOM, DID YOU PACK MY HUMMUS. I WALKED MY CHUBBY BUTT TO SCHOOL. AND THEN ENDED UP IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.  ( APPLAUSE ) I'M A PROUD TEXAN. MAN. WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE, THEY PUT ME IN E.S.L. CLASS. WHICH IS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASS AND I WAS THE ONLY GUY THAT SPOKE ENGLISH IN THIS CLASS! I WALK IN ALM THE KIDS ARE LOOKING AT ME LIKE OULA, AMIGO. I WAS LIKE, SORRY? WHAT LANGUAGE ARE YOU SPEAKING? ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS OTHER GUY ROLLS UP OUT OF NOWHERE, "YOU'RE WEIRD, DUDE! WHY DO YOU TALK LIKE THAT, EH!" AND THAT WAS MY TEACHER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LIKE, HE WAS-- IT WAS DIFFICULT. ( APPLAUSE ) I ENDED UP BECOMING FLUENT IN SPAIRN. BECAME FLUENT IN SPANISH BECAUSE OF AN ENGLISH CLASS. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE I'M BROWN AND I SPEAK SPANISH, SO IF ANYTHING BREAKS OUT I CAN CAMOUFLAGE AT ANY MOMENT IN TIME. IT'S GETTING ROUGH. START HUNTING ARABS AND MUSLIMS LIKE-- HEY, BOY! YOU ONE OF THEM ARABS, HUH? YOU ONE OF THOSE MUSLIMS?  ( APPLAUSE ) I'LL JUST GO TO MEXICO. I'LL JUST START SELLING FALAFEL TACOS IN MEXICO. THAT'S THE EXIT STRATEGY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT TOOK ME, LIKE, 20 YEARS TO GET MY CITIZENSHIP, 20 YEARS TO GET MY CITIZENSHIP. I BELIEVE THAT'S CALLED-- ( APPLAUSE ) I BELIEVE THAT'S CALLED EXTREME VETTING. IT ALREADY EXISTS. FOR MANY YEARS, I TRAVELED WITHOUT A PASSPORT. THEY GIVE REFUGEES A REFUGEE TRAVEL DOCUMENT. ON THE FRONT, IT LOOKS REAL OFFICIAL "DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY." MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A COME. HOWEVER, ON THE INSIDE, IN ALL CAPS IT SAYS, "THIS IS NOT A U.S. PASSPORT." CONFUSES IMMIGRATION OFFICERS GLOBALLY. MY FIRST TOUR OUT OF THE COUNTRY WAS TO GERMANY. I GET THERE AND THE GUY IS LIKE, WELCOME TO GERMANY. I CAN HAVE YOUR PASSPORT PLEASE?" I'M LIKE, "YEAH, SURE, HERE YOU GO." "LOOK VERY SPECIAL, YA. OH, NO! OH, NO! I SAID CAN I HAVE YOUR PASSPORT, PLEASE?" I SAID, "HEY, MAN, THAT IS MY PASSPORT." "THAT CANNOT BE YOUR PASSPORT. IT SHOWS HERE IT'S NOT A PASSPORT. IT SHOWS YOU WERE BORN IN KUWAIT. CAN I HAVE YOUR KUWAIT PASSPORT? "I SAID I DON'T HAVE ONE. IN KUWAIT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU WERE BORN THERE. MATTERS WHERE YOUR PARENTS COME FROM." WHERE DO YOUR PARENTS COME FROM? MY PARENTS ARE PALESTINIAN. GET QT GIVE ME YOUR PALESTINIAN PASSPORT. I DON'T HAVE A PALESTINIAN PASSPORT. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A PALESTINIAN PASSPORT. BECAUSE IT IS NOT A STATE. WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT A STATE? HAVE YOU NOT WATCHED THE NEWS FOR THE PAST 68 YEARS. AND BY THE WAY, I'M IN GERMANY. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT TO BEGIN WITH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU CAN SEE HIS SOLO SHOW ON TUESDAY AT THE COMEDY CELLAR HERE IN NEW YORK. MO AMER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! JOIN US NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE TALKING TO KRISTEN STEWART, JUDD APATOW, AND ANDERSON COOPER. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT!
