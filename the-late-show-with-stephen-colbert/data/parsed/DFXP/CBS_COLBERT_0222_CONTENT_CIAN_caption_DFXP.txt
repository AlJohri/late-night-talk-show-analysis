YES, YOUNG LADY RIGHT THERE.
DID YOU SEE THAT GUY AT THE RYDER CUP HECKLE TEAM EUROPE?
STEPHEN: OH YEAH, AN AMERICAN GOLF FAN, DAVID JOHNSON, HECKLED TEAM EUROPE AS THEY WERE PRACTICING A DIFFICULT PUTT, SO THEY CHALLENGED HIM TO DO THE PUTT. THEY EVEN BET $100 THAT HE COULDN'T MAKE IT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF IT. ( CHEERING )
I GOT THAT. ( CHEERING ) ( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S AMAZING. WHAT A SHOT.
START THE SHOW!
Stephen: WE WILL IN A SECOND.
START THE SHOW!
STEPHEN: SIR, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME AND I THINK I KNOW HOW TO... START THE SHOW.
THEN GET TO IT, ALREADY!
STEPHEN: HEY, IT'S THE GUY WHO MADE THE PUTT, DAVID JOHNSON. LOOK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! DAVID! FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T JUST START A SHOW, YOU HAVE TO BEGIN WITH TOPICAL, POLITICAL HUMOR.
I COULD DO IT. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: OH, REALLY? JOKES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP ARE A LOT HARDER THAN MAKING A PUTT.
I CAN DO BOTH.
STEPHEN: OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU COME UP AND SHOW ME? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY.
Stephen: DAVID JOHNSON, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S MAKE THIS MORE INTERESTING. MY FRIEND MR. LINCOLN SAYS GOOD LUCK. DAVID JOHNSON, EVERYBODY. DRUMROLL, PLEASE. ( DRUM ROLL ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, MINDY KALING! GARY OWEN! MUSICAL GUEST SUM  41. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, EVERYBODY! WHAT'S UP? CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS. DAVID JOHNSON, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I'D LIKE TO START TONIGHT BY WISHING MY JEWISH VIEWERS A HAPPY NEW YEAR, BECAUSE TODAY IS ROSH HASHANAH. TRADITIONALLY, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY WELCOMES THE NEW YEAR BY BLOWING THE SHOFAR. OR RAM'S HORN, RIGHT HERE. JON LAMPLEY, CAN I GET A "G"? ( BLOWS SHOFAR ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S JAZZ, BABY. EVER SMELL A DEAD RAM? GIVE THAT A LITTLE WHIFF RIGHT THERE.
Jon: YO I'LL PASS THE NEXT TIME.
Stephen: OH, MY GOODNESS, HAVEN'T THE JEWISH PEOPLE SUFFERED ENOUGH? OH, MY GOODNESS. THAT'S ABOUT AS DEAD AS A RAM CAN GET RIGHT THERE. ON THE JEWISH CALENDAR, THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR 5,777. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS -- IT'S TIME FOR MY NEW SEXY RABBIS CALENDAR. WHOA! WELL, YEAH! ( APPLAUSE ) ALL I CAN SAY IS SHANA TOVAH. I WOULDN'T MIND LETTING HIM DIP MY APPLES IN HONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, OH -- I'M SO GLAD "BEEFCAKE" IS KOSHER! OH, OH, HERE EIS, HOLDING A LOAF OF HALA. OH, THAT'S TOO SPICEY. OH, THERE WE GO. OH, THAT'S A LITTLE TOO SPICEY, TOO. OH, THERE WE GO. SHOFAR, SHO, GOOD. MOVE OVER, ELIJAH, I'M SAVING A SEAT FOR HIM. OF COURSE, THIS ROSH HASHANAH IS A SOMBER ONE FOR MANY BECAUSE THEY ARE MOURNING THE PASSING OF FORMER ISRAELI PRESIDENT SHIMON PERES. AND THIS WEEKEND, WORLD LEADERS WENT TO THE FUNERAL, INCLUDING FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND FUTURE FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO GO. ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT CAN I SAY... ( APPLAUSE )
WHAT CAN I SAY, THE JEWS LOVE ME. THEY JUST LOVE ME. IT IS HARD TO GET BILL CLINTON TO LEAVE. JUST ASK THE GUYS WHO TRIED TO IMPEACH HIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WOW! AND THIS IS A REAL NATIONAL SECURITY BREACH BECAUSE, NOW, OUR ENEMIES KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE DOESN'T HAVE A HORN. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, THIS IS BIG NEWS. OVER THE WEEKEND, THREE PAGES OF DONALD TRUMP'S 1995 TAX RETURN WERE LEAKED, REVEALING THAT HE "DECLARED A $916 MILLION LOSS" FROM "HIS THREE ATLANTIC CITY CASINOS." THAT'S RIGHT. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) DONALD TRUMP LOST MONEY ON CASINOS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, "THE HOUSE ALWAYS LOSES." BUT HERE'S THE THING, AS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, HE WAS ABLE TO USE THAT LOSS TO WIPE OUT MORE THAN $50 MILLION A YEAR IN TAXABLE INCOME OVER 18 YEARS. WELL, WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS, DON'T PAY TAXES. NOW, THE IDEA THAT TRUMP HASN'T PAID TAXES IN NEARLY 20 YEARS IS BOUND TO BE UNPOPULAR WITH -- WHAT'S THE WORD -- PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ACCORDING TO THE FORMER RUDY GIULIANI, TRUMP NOT PAYING TAXES -- ( APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT WRONG, HE USED TO BE RUDY GIULIANI. BUT TRUMP NOT PAYING TAXES JUST PROVES HOW SMART HE IS.
THE REALITY IS, THIS IS PART OF OUR TAX CODE. THE MAN'S A GENIUS.
STEPHEN: YES, ONLY A GENIUS CAN LOSE $1 BILLION RUNNING A CASINO. ( APPLAUSE ) HOW LOOSE WERE HIS SLOTS? TELL YOU WHAT, I LIKE YOU, I'M GOING TO COMP EVERYONE'S ROOM FOREVER. ( LAUGHTER ) AND GIULIANI POINTED OUT THAT TRUMP'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO AVOIDS PAYING TAXES.
YOU THINK IT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE TO AVOID, TO BASICALLY BEING ABLE TO AVOID PAYING FEDERAL TAXES?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE POOR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LOOPHOLES AND PAY NO TAXES. THOSE ARE LOOPHOLES, ALSO, AND THEY PAY NO TAXES.
STEPHEN: YEAH, THOSE CRAFTY POOR PEOPLE WITH THEIR LOOPHOLES. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) AND DON'T FORGET THE CUNNING HOMELESS WHO HAVE FOUND A WAY AROUND PROPERTY TAX. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OH... ( LAUGHTER ) SO, GIULIANI THINKS TRUMP IS A GENIUS, AND DONALD TRUMP AGREES TWEET-BRAGGING: "I KNOW OUR COMPLEX TAX LAWS BETTER THAN ANYONE WHO HAS EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIX THEM." YES, HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIX OUR TAX CODE. JUST LIKE HANNIBAL LECTER IS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD CATCH BUFFALO BILL. ( AS HANNIBAL ) "I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU FIX THE TAX CODE, CLARISSE, BUT FIRST HAND OVER HILLARY'S LIVER. I'M GOING TO EAT THEM WITH SOME FAVA BEANS AND A NICE CHIANTI." ( APPLAUSE ) NO, NO. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT'S NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP DOES HIS OWN TAXES. HE'S NOT THERE DOING THE NUMBERS. SHOULDN'T WE REALLY BE VOTING FOR HIS ACCOUNTANT? JACK MITNICK. MITNICK. SOMETHING ABOUT THE "MITT" THAT SOUNDS SO PRESIDENTIAL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP WASN'T DONE MAKING NEWS. ON SATURDAY, HE TURNED A RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA INTO A FREE-FORM POETRY SLAM.
OUR COUNTRY IS BECOMING A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY. PEOPLE WALK TO THE OFFICE, THEY WALK TO GET A LOAF OF BREAD, THEY GET SHOT. CNN -- CLINTON NEWS NETWORK -- WHICH NOBODY IS WATCHING ANYWAYS, SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? SHE COULD BE CRAZY. SHE COULD ACTUALLY BE CRAZY. THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THEY USED TO. IS THAT RIGHT?
STEPHEN: AND THEY SURE AS HELL DON'T MAKE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES LIKE THEY USED TO, RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TINY, TINY HANDS. TINY HANDS. TINY HANDS. ( LAUGHTER ) AT THE SAME RALLY, TRUMP URGED HIS SUPPORTERS TO GO OUT ON ELECTION DAY AND PERFORM THEIR CIVIC DUTY.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO OUT AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOUR POLLING BOOTHS BECAUSE I HEAR TOO MANY STORIES ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA, CERTAIN AREAS. I HEAR TOO MANY BAD STORIES, AND WE CAN'T LOSE AN ELECTION BECAUSE OF YOU-KNOW-WHAT-I'M TALKING ABOUT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH. NO. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU LEFT OUT ALL THE NOUNS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE DOESN'T SAY EVERYTHING. BUT BEING A DEMAGOGUE IS LIKE JAZZ -- IT'S THE RACISM YOU DON'T SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: THANK YOU. ( PIANO RIFF ) ACCUSATIONS HAVE ALSO SURFACED THIS WEEKEND THAT TRUMP SEXUALLY HARASSED WOMEN WHO WORKED ON "THE APPRENTICE." ACCORDING TO CO-WORKERS, TRUMP OPENLY DISCUSSED WHICH FEMALE CONTESTANTS HE WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH, SPECULATING WHICH OF THEM WOULD BE "A TIGER IN BED." OF COURSE, IT'S TRUMP WHO'S THE REAL TIGER IN BED. HE'S ORANGE, HAS A LOT OF HAIR ( LAUGHTER ) AND EVERY DAY HE REFUSES TO COME ON THIS SHOW PROVES HE'S A HUGE PUSSY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT! SUM  41 IS HERE! AND WHEN WE RETURN, I'M TALKING TO MINDY KALING! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANKS FOR JOINING US AGAIN. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR, AN EMMY-NOMINATED WRITER AND PRODUCER, AND THE STAR OF "THE MINDY PROJECT."
I'M A SINGLE MOTHER BARRELING TOWARDS 40. I SHOULD PICK ONE OF THE RICH, HANDSOME DOCTORS WHO WOULD HAVE ME.

THANK YOU!
Stephen: SEASON 5 IS AVAILABLE STARTING TOMORROW ON HULU. AM I PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY?
YOU MADE IT MORE ETHNIC THAN IT IS.
Stephen: HULU! RIGHT, GOOD!
Stephen: I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE. VERY FEW PEOPLE DO 100 EPISODES OF ANYTHING.
I GOT VERY EXCITED BECAUSE I WAS ON "THE OFFICE" FOR 100 EPISODES AND IT WAS A GREAT SHOW. THEN I WAS LOOKING AT WHO ELSE HAS DONE 100 SHOWS AND IT WAS LIKE BOB NEWHART AND BETTY WHITE. AND I WAS, LIKE, I'M OLD AS HELL. I SHOULDN'T HAVE EPISODES ABOUT 100 SHOWS. I JUST GOT HERE!
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T, IF YOU DID, I NEED YOUR MOISTURIZING REGIME. YOU HAVE THE BOOK "WHY NOT ME?" OUT NOW AND THE 100th EPISODE OF YOUR SHOW. WHEN DO YOU HAVE TIME TO DO ANYTHING?
DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET ME ERRANDS DONE.
Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU NOT DONE?
SMALL THINGS LIKE I NEVER GET TO GO TO THE STORE. I HAVE BEEN DYING TO GET A MOP FOR MONTHS.
Stephen: THOSE ARE OBTAINABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN NEW YORK CITY YOU CAN GET A MOP. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE'S A DWAYNE REED ON THE CORNER. GO NOW AND GET YOU A MOP.
IS THAT A GOOD USE OF TIME?
Stephen: COME ON! LET'S GO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE WE GO! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY! COME ON DOWN HERE!

Stephen: THAT IS QUITE A TROT YOU'VE GOT GOING ON THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: HI, EVERYBODY, WAVE TO THE NICE PEOPLE! I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE ON VACATION YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY GETTING RECOGNIZED BY FANS.
MAKES ME FEEL IT'S WORTH IT.
Stephen: IF NO ONE RECOGNIZES US IN THE DWAYNE REED, WILL THAT BE DISAPPOINTING?
I'LL KILL MYSELF.
Stephen: SO NEXT SEASON IS SEASON FIVE -- HEY! IT'S MINDY KALING!

WONDER LASH.

OKAY. HOLD ON. I HAVE NO REAL LASHES OF MY OWN.
Stephen: AND BIEWDY PADS. THAT'S GOOD. HAIR COLOR? I THINK I WOULD LOOK LIKE A DASHING RED.

I'VE ONLY SEEN THAT, LIKE, IN A PLAY WHERE A GUY'S MOPPING. I THINK IT'S GOOD.
Stephen: A ROPE MOP OR SPONGE?
ROPE, IT'S MORE THEATRICAL. WHO'S PAYING FOR THIS?
Stephen: WE'RE ON TIME. TWO MINUTES. WHO'S PAYING FOR THIS?
YEAH.

Stephen: REALLY? YEAH, I THINK A PINK SHIRT IS SOMETHING MEN SOMETIMES DON'T WANT TO TRY TO DO, BUT IT CAN ADD A CURVIAN FLAVOR TO YOUR SHOW.

THE BROTHERS AND I ARE, LIKE, WE DON'T KNOW THIS SONG.
Stephen: YOU WERE IN THE NAVY.
I WAS FOR SIX YEARS.
Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU TO THAT SERVICE?
WELL, I GREW UP IN A TRAILER PARK, AND THE RECRUITER CAME TO MY TRAILER.
Stephen: TO THE TRAILER? TO THE TRAILER. FIRST YOU GOT TO GO SEE THEM, THEN THEY COME TO THE TRAILER.
Stephen: OH, I THOUGHT THEY WERE TROLLING TRAILERS. ( LAUGHTER )
YOU LIKE BEING MOBILE? WE GOT SHIPS! YOU KNOW? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO THE ULTIMATE MOBILE HOME.
YOU'RE MOVING, BABY! HE COMES AND SAYS, I CAN HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE NEXT WEEK, JUST SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE. I THOUGHT, THAT SOUNDS GOOD BECAUSE I HADN'T TAKEN THE SAT OR THE ACT, SO I THOUGHT, I CAN GET OUT OF HERE.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU. 17.
Stephen: I DIDN'T OWE YOU COULD GO IN THAT SOON.
YOUR PARENTS HAVE TO SIGN A WAIVER. MY MOM'S, LIKE, THAT'S COOL! ( LAUGHTER ) BOOT CAMP, YOUR FIRST DAY IS THE WORST. THEY THROW A GARBAGE CAN DOWN, THEY'RE CURSING EVERYBODY OUT. MY FIRST DAY IS GREAT BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH A TRAILER WITH EIGHT PEOPLE LIVING IN IT, THE FIRST TIME I SLEPT IN A BED IN 15 YEARS. ALL THE GUYS ARE CRYING. AND I'M GOING, THIS IS SPACIOUS! WHAT'S THE THREAD COUNT ON THESE SHEETS? I LIKE IT! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN YOU GO TO BREAKFAST AND IT'S LIKE THEY ASK YOU WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M, LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE COOKING FOR US?! THIS IS GREAT!
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF SHIP WERE YOU ON?
I WAS NEVER ON A SHIP.
Stephen: ARE YOU SURE YOU WERE IN THE NAVY?
I WAS. I WAS IN A PRESIDENTIAL HONOR GUARD FOR TWO YEARS.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S WHERE WE SPUN THE RIFLES, DID THE FUNERALS AND THE PARADES AT WHITE HOUSE. BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN BOOK CAMP THEY SAID EVERYONE OVER 6-FOOT TALL AND A 34-INCH WASTE, THEY HAVE A TRAIN A PLATOON AND YOU TRAIN FOR EIGHT WEEKS AND START DOING THE PARADE.
Stephen: WHAT YEARS? WHEN CLINTON CAME IN. I DID THE INAUGURATION FOR BILL CLINTON IN JANUARY '93.
Stephen: DID HE EVER SAY HI OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
NO. FUNNY STORY ABOUT BILL CLINTON -- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I BET A LIEUTENANT OF PEOPLE CAN START A SENTENCE LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
SO THIS IS HYSTERICAL BECAUSE DURING THE INAUGURATION PARADE, YOU WALK BY, IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THERE'S AL GORE AND BILL CLINTON AND HILLARY, HIS WIFE. AS WE WALK BY YOU DO EYES LEFT AND YOU GET TO STAY PRESIDENT, AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING, SO WE WERE GOING TO THROW A RIFLE UP, TAKE A STEP FORWARD AND CATCH IT. AND I THOUGHT, WE'LL BLOW HIM AWAY, RIGHT? NO. THEY HAD US MARCHING RIGHT BEHIND THE FLORIDA A&M BAND, RIGHT? SO THESE -- THIS IS, LIKE, H.B.C.U. AND THE GIRLS WERE TOOTSIE ROLLING AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF. SO WHEN WE WALKED BY, BILL WASN'T PAYING NO ATTENTION TO US. HE WAS STILL LOOKING AT THEM. I SAWED, HE MISSED US! THEY WERE LIKE, THOUGHT YOU KNEW!
Stephen: YOU WERE NAMED FUNNIEST SERVICEMAN IN AMERICA. SO YOU STARTED YOUR COMEDY WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SERVICE.
I WAS STILL IN THE NAVY WHEN I STARTED.
Stephen: HOW DOES ONE GET NAMED FUNNIEST SERVICEMAN IN AMERICA?
I MADE IT UP. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO YOU CONSIDER THAT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL CAREER OR DID YOU HAVE A FIRST NIGHT OUT IN A COMEDY CLUB KIND OF SITUATION IS THIS.
FIRST NIGHT WAS THE COMEDY STORE IN LAJOYA, CALIFORNIA. I THINK I WAS 20 YEARS OLD. I WASN'T OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK AND I HAD JUST GOTTEN TO SAN DIEGO. I WENT ON STAGE, TEN PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE, ABOUT 1:00 IN THE MORNING ON A SUNDAY, ABOUT 20 COMICS IN THE BACK AND THE THE COMICS ARE HECKLING ME. FIRST TIME ON THE STAGE, FIVE MINUTES, I CAN'T GO RIGHT OR LEFT, I CAN'T GET THROUGH A JOKE. I HAD A BEER IN MY HAND. I SAID, HEY, GUYS IN THE BACK, KEEP HECKLING! I HAVE BEEN DRINKING ALL NIGHT AND I'M 20! WHY DON'T I CALL THE COPS AND SHUT IT DOWN? WHEN I SAID THAT, THE LIGHTS WENT OFF, TWO GUYS PICKED ME UP AND THREW ME OUT OF THE COMEDY STORE. SO I THOUGHT, I CAN'T COME BACK HERE, BUT I CAN TALK SMACK. SO THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER.
