HILLARY CLINTON ON DEFENSE. THE DECISION TO USE A PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER IS UNDER HEAVY FIRE FROM ALL SIDES RIGHT NOW.  ( CHEERS )
LOCK HER UP! LOCKER UP!
CBS NEWS HAS CONFIRMED THAT AT LEAST FIVE CURRENT AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS HAVE USED PRIVATE EMAIL FOR GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES! WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT HEALTH CAREIDIZE ANOTHER DEATH. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES: SOFIA VERGARA. DAVID BOREANAZ. AND KEN BURNS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. LOOK, I'VE GOT SOME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'VE ACTUALLY GOT SOME GOOD NEWS. THE G.O.P. PLAN TO REPEAL OBAMACARE IS OFFICIALLY DEAD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOT NOTHING, NO PULSE. NO. THEY PULLED THE PLUG. THAT IS SOMETHING I'VE SAID THREE TIMES NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THE REPUBLICANS BROUGHT A NEW ONE UP-- WHEN DID THEY BRING THIS UP, A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. THEY KNEW THEY COULD ONLY AFFORD TO LOSE TWO VOTES. AND RAND PAUL AND JOHN McCAIN WERE ALREADY NOs. THEN LAST NIGHT, MAINE SENATOR AND WOMAN WITH BLAZER MADE FROM SKINNED COOKIE MONSTER, SUSAN COLLINS SAID SHE WASN'T FALLING FOR IT. ONE REASON WAS THE C.B.O. SCORE, WHICH TECHNICALLY HASN'T COME OUT, BUT THEY DID RELEASE AN ESTIMATE YESTERDAY SHOWING THAT "THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD BE REDUCED BY MILLIONS." YEAH, NOTHING SPECIFIC, JUST MILLIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) AT THIS POINT, THE FOLKS AT THE C.B.O. MUST BE SO TIRED OF ANALYZING HEALTHCARE BILLS, THEY'RE JUST FREE-BALLING IT. "WHAT, A NEW BILL? YEAH, LET ME RUN THE NUMBERS. YEAH, YEAH, EVERYBODY DIES." ( LAUGHTER ) SO THAT'S IT. IT'S OVER! AND "THE G.O.P. IS ALREADY EYEING THE NEXT CHANCE TO REVIVE THE OBAMACARE REPEAL." WHAT! WHAT! ALREADY? GRAHAM-CASSIDY ISN'T EVEN DEAD YET! THAT'S LIKE BRINGING A DATE TO SEE YOUR WIFE IN THE HOSPITAL ( LAUGHTER ) "LOOK, HONEY, YOU'RE GONNA PULL THROUGH. ABSOLUTELY. I BELIEVE IN YOU. BUT JUST IN CASE, THIS IS STACI. SHE SPELLS IT WITH AN 'I,' THAT'S KINDA FUN. YOU GUYS WOULD LIKE EACH OTHER." STACI, WAIT OUTSIDE. DON'T GO TOO FAR. OF COURSE, WE MAY NOT NEED HEALTH CARE PRETTY SOON, BECAUSE ONE OF OUR OLD ENEMIES IS COMING FOR US:  IRAN. AND TRUMP SOUNDED THE ALARM OVER THE WEEKEND, TWEETING, "IRAN JUST TEST-FIRED A BALLISTIC MISSILE CAPABLE OF REACHING ISRAEL. THEY ARE ALSO WORKING WITH NORTH KOREA. NOT MUCH OF AN AGREEMENT WE HAVE!" NOW, OBVIOUSLY, WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT IRAN'S MISSILE TEST, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT WAS A FAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) SO TRUMP FELL FOR... WHAT'S THE WORD?
FAKE NEWS!
Stephen: YOU AND HE AGREE. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. IRANIAN STATE TELEVISION RELEASED THIS FOOTAGE OF A MISSILE TEST, WHICH WAS REPORTED ON BY WESTERN MEDIA, BUT THE VIDEOS WERE ACTUALLY SEVEN MONTHS OLD. OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE! YOU HAVE THE C.I.A., YOU NUMBNUT. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, BUT OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS POPPING OFF ABOUT BALLISTIC MISSILES BECAUSE HE SAW IT ON THE TV. IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE'RE SEEING TWEETS LIKE, "JUST SAW REPORT ON VIOLENT TALKING APES ATTACKING HUMANS AND TAKING OVER THE FOREST. OBAMA WAS SOFT ON MONKEY THREAT. I WILL NOT BE!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, AND-- APES NOW CAUSING MASSIVE CAR WRECK ON THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. YUGE DISASTER. THANK GOD FOR TALKING LIZARD OFFERING CAR INSURANCE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO GOOD, LITTLE AUSTRALIAN LIZARD. SPEAKING OF IRAN, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A NEW TRAVEL BAN! THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS WHAT, HIS THIRD ATTEMPT? SO, IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE HIS MARRIAGES, THIS ONE MAY STICK. BIG MELANIA FANS HERE. THIS NEW BAN HAS BEEN CAREFULLY REWRITTEN AS "THE RESULT OF MONTHS OF DELIBERATION THAT INCLUDED THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND OTHER AGENCIES." AS OPPOSED TO THE FIRST BAN, WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF STEVE BANNON RUNNING THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE IN A TOWEL WITH AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF NIGHT TRAIN YELLING, "THE MUSLIMS ARE COMING! THE MUSLIMS ARE COMING!" ( LAUGHTER ) UH-HUH. HERE'S-- ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Jon: "NIGHT TRAIN."
Stephen: THAT'S "NIGHT TRAIN." HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. IN ADDITION TO THE COUNTRIES NAMED IN THE FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER, THE REVISED TRAVEL BAN WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PEOPLE FROM CHAD, NORTH KOREA, VENEZUELA, AND THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK. I'M PRETTY SURE. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUR EYE ON GOLDEN STATE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS. BUT THOSE CHANGES ARE KEY, BECAUSE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAID THE ADDITION OF NORTH KOREA AND VENEZUELA DEMONSTRATED IT WAS NOT A MUSLIM BAN. ADDING NEW COUNTRIES DOESN'T MAKE IT LESS BAD. YOU CAN'T JUST CLAIM, "HEY, IT'S NOT A HATE CRIME BECAUSE I ALSO THREW A BRICK INTO THE BUILDING NEXT TO THE MOSQUE." WHAT, DO I HATE DRY CLEANERS NOW? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. SIR, YOU CAN'T JUST PAD THIS OUT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND EXPECT US NOT TO NOTICE IT'S A MUSLIM BAN. THAT'S LIKE WHEN YOU THROW A BUNCH OF CLIF BARS IN YOUR BASKET WHEN YOU'RE BUYING DIRTY MAGAZINES. WE KNOW WHAT YOU NEED THAT ENERGY FOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) AND, YOU KNOW, WITH ALL OF THIS HAPPENING, PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT FOOTBALL. IN FACT, AT A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY, TRUMP WAS ASKED IF HE'S BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE N.F.L.
WELL, I WASN'T PREOCCUPIED WITH THE N.F.L. TO ME, THE N.F.L. SITUATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT SITUATION. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE, ABOUT WAS I PREOCCUPIED? NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME ON MY HANDS. ALL I DO IS WORK.
Stephen: WAIT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH!
Stephen: WAIT, WHEN IS IT? DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS, OR ARE YOU ALWAYS WORKING? BECAUSE I CAN'T DECIDE WHICH ONE SCARES ME MORE. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, LAST NIGHT, IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTROVERSY, THE DALLAS COWBOYS KNEELED BEFORE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEN STOOD UP ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WITH ARMS LINKED DURING THE SONG. NOW, TRUMP WAS CLEARLY WATCHING, BECAUSE HE TWEETED "THE BOOING AT THE N.F.L. FOOTBALL GAME LAST NIGHT, WHEN THE ENTIRE DALLAS TEAM DROPPED TO ITS KNEES, WAS LOUDEST I HAVE EVER HEARD. GREAT ANGER." REALLY? THAT'S THE LOUDEST BOOING YOU EVER HEARD? ( LAUGHTER ) LISTEN TO THIS. DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. ( AUDIENCE BOOS ) THANK YOU! OKAY, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU! I THINK I HAVE MY NEW RING TONE.
Jon: WHOA NELLY.
Stephen: AND TRUMP POINTED OUT JUST HOW MUCH THESE PROTESTS ARE HURTING THE N.F.L.:  3 "RATINGS FOR N.F.L. FOOTBALL ARE WAY DOWN, EXCEPT BEFORE GAME STARTS WHEN PEOPLE TUNE IN TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT OUR COUNTRY WILL BE DISRESPECTED!" YES, ACCORDING TO DONALD TRUMP, FANS ARE TUNING OUT RIGHT WHEN THE GAME STARTS-- WHICH IS THE WAY JETS FANS HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP MAY BE RIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT SOME BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY READY TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS NEW TREND.
SUNDAY MEANS THREE THINGS:  BEER, HOT WINGS AND THE VERY BEGINNING OF A FOOTBALL GAME AND AT D.T. 45'S BAR AND GRILL YOU WON'T MISS A SECOND OF THE ACTION BECAUSE WE HAVE EVERY N.F.L. GAME ON 24 SCREENS WHICH WE TURN OFF IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE NATIONAL ANTHEM SO YOU CAN EAT IN PATRIOTIC SILENCE. AND THE D.T. 45'S THERE'S NO SITTING ALLOWED. NOT A SINGLE CHAIR IN THE PLACE. DON'T LIKE IT? THEN YOU'RE IN ISIS. D.T. 45'S BAR AND GRILL. OH, SAY CAN YOU EAT.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SOFIA VERGARA IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR. IT'S HAPPENING! STICK AROUND. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. THAT'S RIGHT. I COULD HEAR YOU DO THAT SONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN, MAN. I COULD HEAR THAT SONG AGAIN. FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"" ALREADY IN PROGRESS. FOLKS, IF YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS, YOU KNOW PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY HURRICANE MARIA. POWER IS OUT ON MOST OF THE ISLAND, AND THERE ARE SHORTAGES OF FOOD, CLEAN WATER, AND MEDICINE. THE 3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS NEED OUR HELP, AND YOU CAN DO YOUR PART. PLEASE GO TO colbertlateshow.com FOR INFORMATION ON WHERE YOU CAN DONATE. NOW, MANY PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE SLOW FEDERAL RESPONSE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPARENT TOTAL LACK OF INTEREST. ONE CNN COMMENTATOR POINTED OUT THAT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY, TRUMP SENT OUT ABOUT 20 TWEETS ABOUT PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND ZERO ABOUT PUERTO RICO. OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE. NOT ONLY IS TWEETING THE LEAST YOU CAN DO. IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU ACTUALLY DO! ( APPLAUSE ) THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT HELP HAS BEEN LOW TO ARRIVE TO PUERTO RICO, AND TODAY, TRUMP EXPLAIPPED WHY.
IT'S VERY TOUGH, BECAUSE IT'S AN ISLAND. THIS IS AN ISLAND SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OCEAN. AND IT'S A BIG OCEAN. IT'S A VERY BIG OCEAN.
Stephen: "AND EXTREMELY WET. I'M THE ONLY ONE TALKING ABOUT THE WETNESS. I' ALSO, DID YOU KNOW IT'S SO SALTY THAT YOU CAN'T DRINK IT? I JUST FOUND OUT. MAKE A FANTASTICET MARGARITA. UNBELIEVABLE. PLUS, PLUS, YOU KNOW, BRING THE STUFF THERE. WE WANT TO SWIM IT THERE, BUT THERE ARE SHARKS. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE JETS. THEY'RE FIGHTING AND DANCING TAIMENTS." ANYWAY, THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT-- IT'S A VERY, VERY BIG OCEAN. AND IT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER. NO ONE KNOWS WHY. SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON THAT, FOR SOME REASON.  ( APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, BACK ON THE MAINLAND, TODAY IS ELECTION DAY IN ALABAMA. ALL EYES ARE ON THE G.O.P. PRIMARY TO REPLACE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND CONFEDERATE HOUSE ELF, JEFF SESSIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) HE BELIEVES IN STATE'S RIGHTS, HARRY POTTER! ( APPLAUSE ) THE RACE-- THE RACE PITS CURRENT ALABAMA SENATOR AND KID WHO GOT TO NAME HIMSELF AT AGE 10, LUTHER STRANGE, AGAINST FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT AND AUCTIONEER WHO I REALLY HOPE IS SELLING CATTLE, ROY MOOSH. THEY'RE VERY INTERESTING CANDIDATES. LUTHER STRANGE IS THE TALLEST MAN EVER IN THE U.S. SENATE, AT 6'9". HE'S PICTURED HERE NEXT TO HIS CONSCIENCE, JIMINY CRICKET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MEANWHILE-- SAME SPECIES. SAME SPECIES! MEANWHILE, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ROY MOORE FROM THE TIME HE WAS KICKED OFF THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT. OR THE OTHER TIME HE WAS KICKED OFF THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT. SEE, HE WAS ELECTED IN 2000, AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. YOU SEE, HE WAS ELECTED IN 2000, AND HIS FIRST ACTION WAS TO INSTALL A TWO-TON MONUMENT OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. NOW, THAT SOUNDS EXCESSIVE, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BIBLICALLY ACCURATE, AS SHOWN BY THIS PAINTING OF MOSES. ( LAUGHTER ) THE MONUMENT WAS REMOVED IN 2003, AND SO WAS MOORE, A LITTLE LATER. BUT HE WAS RE-ELECTED IN 2012, AND THEN REMOVED AGAIN IN 2016 FOR "ORDERING THE STATE'S PROBATE JUDGES TO REFUSE APPLICATIONS FOR MARRIAGE LICENSES BY SAME-SEX COUPLES." IT'S PART OF MOORE'S LONG HISTORY OF HOMOPHOBIA. HE ONCE WROTE IN A CUSTODY DECISION, "HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR IS A GROUND FOR DIVORCE, AN ACT OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT PUNISHABLE AS A CRIME IN ALABAMA, A CRIME AGAINST NATURE, AN INHERENT EVIL, AND AN ACT SO HEINOUS THAT IT DEFIES ONE'S ABILITY TO DESCRIBE IT." IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IF IT ALL GOES AS PLANS, YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED? I LIKE IT." NOW, MOORE'S OPPONENT, LUTHER STRANGE, HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY THE PRESIDENT. ON FRIDAY, TRUMP WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ALABAMA TO TELL PEOPLE HE'S GOT BIG LUTHER'S BACK, NO MATTER WHAT. KIND OF.
WE HAVE TO BE LOYAL IN LIFE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED LOYALTY WITH THESE FOLK. AND I MIGHT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. AND I'LL BE HONEST. I MIGHT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. BY THE WAY, BOTH GOOD MEN. BOTH GOOD MEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT-- AND I TOLD LUTHER I HAVE TO SAY THIS-- IF HIS OPPONENT WINS, I'M GOING TO BE HERE CAMPAIGNING LIKE HELL FOR HIM.
Stephen: THAT'S A WEIRD TIME TO BE HEDGE YOUR BET. "WITH THIS RING, I THEE... HOLD UP. I'LL BE HONEST. I MIGHT HAVE MADE A MISTAKE. WHAT'S THAT BRIDESMAID'S NAME?" STACY WITH AN "I"? GREAT, I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. BUT WHILE STRANGE HAS THE PRESIDENT, MOORE HAS STRONG BACKERS OF HIS OWN, INCLUDING BREITBART CHIEF AND HELMETLESS VADER, STEVE BANNON. THAT'S RIGHT, TRUMP AND BANNNON ARE GOING UP AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND LAST NIGHT, BANNON SPOKE TO A CROWD IN FAIR HOPE, ALABAMA, AND REMINDED THEM THAT NOTHING IS FAIR, AND THERE IS NO HOPE.
MITCH McCONNELL AND THIS PERMANENT POLITICAL CLASS IS THE MOST CORRUPT AND INCOMPETENT GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY TOOK OUT 30-SECOND TV SPOTS. AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU'RE A PACK OF MORONS. THEY THINK YOU'RE NOTHING BUT RUBES.
Stephen: "YEAH, THOSE ELITES THINK YOU'RE A BUNCH OF RUBES! NOW, WHO AMONG YOU FINE FOLKS IS WISE ENOUGH TO STEP UP AND BUY THIS TONIC THAT MAKES MEXICANS DISAPPEAR?" ( LAUGHTER ) COME ON, JOSE. LET'S RUB SOME OF IT ON YOU." AND BANNON EXPLAINED THAT THERE'S NO CONFLICT WITH THE PRESIDENT HERE.
A VOTE FOR JUDGE ROY MOORE IS A VOTE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP. WE DID NOT COME HERE TO DEFY DONALD TRUMP. WE CAME HERE TO PRAISE AND HONOR HIM.
Stephen: SO, EVEN THOUGH TRUMP FLEW ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE TO SAY HE WANTS YOU TO VOTE FOR LUTHER STRANGE, STEVE BANNON WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT HE KNOWS WHAT TRUMP WANTS YOU TO WANT. YOU KNOW WHAT? TALKING ABOUT TWISTING YOURSELF INTO A PRETZEL. I THINK THE MOOCH WAS RIGHT ABOUT HIM. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: BOY! WOW!
Stephen: THEN ROY MOORE TOOK THE STAGE AND PROVED THAT HE MIGHT BE THE TRUMPIEST CANDIDATE OF THEM ALL.
IT'S BEEN VERY HARD FOR MY WIFE AND MYSELF TO WEATHER TWO, NEARLY THREE MONTHS OF NEGATIVE ADS THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER WITH MONEY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE IT, ADS THAT WERE COMPLETELY FALSE, THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT!
Stephen: WHOOOOO! KILL ME FIRST, ROY! I LOVE YOU! ( LAUGHTER ) BY THE WAY, NICE GUN. DID IT COME WITH YOUR COSTUME? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SOFIA VERGARA. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW AND LOVE MY FIRST GUEST AS GLORIA ON "MODERN FAMILY." PLEASE WELCOME SOFIA VERGARA! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HELLO. RIGHT THIS WAY. PLEASE, YES. YOU CAN SIT.

Stephen: I THINK WE HAVE THE BEST AUDIENCE.
GREAT MUSIC!
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE. AND WE HAVE THE BEST GUESTS, TOO.
AND THE BEST GUEST-- NO GR YES, ABSOLUTELY.  ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE ON THE SHOW. WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME, FINALLY.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR COMING. NO! NO! WE INVITED HER A WHILE AGO.
WHEN.
Stephen: YOU WEREN'T AVAILABLE TO US, I'M GOING TO SAY.
WELL, I WORK ON "MODERN FAMILY." ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU'RE VERY BUSY. IT'S IN LOS ANGELES. WE'RE HERE.
I'M FILMING RIGHT NOW, BUT I BECAME BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU INVITED ME FOR THE FIRST TIME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BUT WE'VE BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM BEFORE.
YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE WE BOTH DID THE "HAND IN HAND" BENEFIT FOR THE VICTIMS OF IRMA AND HARVEY.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU, I UNDERSTAND, HAD GREAT SEATS.
I HAD GREAT SEATS.
Stephen: WHO WERE YOU SITTING BETWEEN?
I WAS-- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, DID YOU SEE IT ON TV, BECAUSE I DID, LIKE, A PHOTOBOMB WHEN YOU WERE TALKING. ( LAUGHTER ) ME AND JULIA ROBERTS. IT WAS HER IDEA.
Stephen: DO WE STILL HAVE THIS? DO WE HAVE--
IT WAS HER IDEA. IT WASN'T ME.
Stephen: DO WE HAVE IT? I THINK THEY HAVE THIS. SHOW THE FOOTAGE. YOU PHOTOBOMBING ME.
Stephen:  WE JUST GOT SOME AMAZING NEWS. OUR FRIENDS AT APPLE HAVE GENEROUSLY DONATED $5 MILLION TONIGHT. $5 MILLION!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE THINKING. IT WAS-- ( APPLAUSE ) IT WAS SUCH A NATURAL REACTION. IT WAS, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. WE SAW EACH-- WE SAW OURSELVES, LIKE, WITH THE TV-- WITH THE CAMERA IN FRONT. AND IT WAS NATURAL. AND WE WERE BOTH LIKE, "ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS?
Stephen: NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND SAY, "HI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING AND DONATING.
BUT IT WAS KIND OF, LIKE, NICE, YOU KNOW, TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE AND TO THANK THEM. I REALLY LIKED IT.
Stephen: IT WAS LOVELY. LOVELY PEOPLE CALLED IN. AND WAS EVERYBODY HAPPY TO GET YOU ON THE OTHER END?
YEAH, THEY WERE VERY HAPPY. NOBODY SAID LIKE, "PUT ON SO-AND-SO!" NO.
Stephen: I GOT THAT. THEY'RE LIKE, "HOW CLOSE ARE YOU TO CLOONEY? YOU CAN HOLD HIS HAND WHILE YOU TALK TO ME?
IT WAS MORE ABOUT OPRAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE-- I WAS SITTING NEXT TO HER. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "ARE YOU SITTING NEXT TO OPRAH?" AND I WAS LIKE, "YES."
Stephen: YOU WERE NOT JUST SITTING NEXT TO HER. WE HAVE A PHOTO HERE-- YOU POSTED-- YOU TRIED TO HUFF OPRAH. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE?
I WAS SMELLING HER-- I WAS SMELLING HER HAIR.
Stephen: I BET IT SMELLS LIKE MAGIC.
IT WAS DELICIOUS. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DOES. BUT I LOVE HER, AND SHE WAS SO NICE. IT WAS SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE TO BE THERE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYBODY WAS HELPING. EVERYBODY WANTED TO HELP. YOU FELT IT. WE WERE INTO IT.
Stephen: IT WAS FANTASTIC.
YES. IT WAS AMAZING, I WOULD DO IT AGAIN ANY TIME.
Stephen: SO WOULD I. SOMEBODY SHOULD DO IT FOR PUERTO RICO?
YES, OF COURSE, I WOULD DO IT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO! WE HAVE TO DO IT! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE-- I GOT A LOT OF PHOTOS HERE. I GOT A LOT OF PHOTOS HERE. OF COURSE YOU PLAY GLORIA ON "MODERN FAMILY." BUT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN FAMILY. YOU'RE MARRIED TO THE HUNK RIGHT HERE, JOE MANGANIELLO.
YES. INVESTIGATORS HUSBAND.
Stephen: VERY GOOD, HUNKY HUSBAND. IS HE-- IS HE-- IS THAT JUST AN IMAGE? IS HE HUNK NEREAL LIFE?
HE'S SPECTACULAR BUT HE'S, YOU KNOW-- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WOW, WOW.
IT'S LIKE WAKING UP-- IT'S LIKE WAKING UP EVERY MOR MORNING THE EIFFEL TOWER. YOU DON'T GET TIRED OF THAT VIEW NO MATTER WHAT. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY, THIS STUPID TOWER ALWAYS IN THE WAY OF EVERYTHING!" NO.
Stephen: THEY SAY IF YOU HAVE THE EIFFEL TOWER MORE THAN FOUR HOURS, YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR DOCTOR.
I'VE HEARD THAT, TOO, YEAH. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S FANTASTIC. HE'S-- WE GET ALONG. WE DON'T FIGHT. AND HE DOES HIS THING, I COMY THING. HE WORKS. I WORK IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: I HEARD YOU ACCUSE HIM OF BEING A NERD. IN WHAT WAY IS-- HOLD ON.
HE IS.
Stephen: IN WHAT WAY IS THAT A NERD?
HE'S-- HE'S-- INSIDE OF HIM, HE WAS JUST PUT IN THE WRONG BODY. I TELL HIM, "YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THE WRONG BODY."
Stephen: POOR HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) ARE BECAUSE I'M IN THE-- I'M A NERD TRAPPED IN THE RIGHT BODY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'LL TELL YOU, THAT'S NOT WORKING OUT TOO GOOD, EITHER. SO HOW IS HE A NERTD, THOUGH?
LIKE, EVEN WHEN I MET HIM, I ALMOST DIDN'T GO OUT WITH HIM BECAUSE HE WAS TOO HANDSOME AND HE'S A NERD. ALL HE DOES IS READ, PLAY "DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS."
Stephen: NO WAY!
YES, THAT'S HIS THING.
Stephen: NO WAY!
I PROMISE YOU. I THINK THE NEXT THING THAT GIVES HIM MORE PLEASURE THAN ME IS "DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS."
Stephen: I PLAYED "DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS, QUERY YEARS. I PLAYED IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, ALL OF US LOOKED LIKE THIS GUY. ALL OF US. EVERYBODY IN THE "DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS" CLUB.
I HAVE TO COME TO MY HOUSE IF YOU'RE IN L.A. THEY DO, I THINK MARATHONS. THEY PLAY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS AND I LAY OUT CHEESE CHEESES AND THI DRINKS AND COFFEE AND I DON'T GO DOWN THERE EVER AGAIN AFTERWARD S.
Stephen:  YOU'RE THE NICEST MOM EVER. ( LAUGHTER ) BY THE WAY, YEAH-- YEAH.
BUT I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF GUY-- AND THERE ARE GIRLS THAT PLAY THAT, TOO.
Stephen: YEAH.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GAME. BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING THAT MAYBE I'M NOT QUALIFIED FOR. IT'S VERY MYSTERIOUS.
Stephen: YOU'RE TOTALLY QUALIFIED.
IT'S VERY MYSTERIOUS.
Stephen: YOU'RE TOTALLY QUALIFIED. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANYTHING OTHER THAN LONELINESS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TELL ME ABOUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE-- YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A BUSINESS--
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT.
Stephen: THEY GAVE IT TO ME. THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT HAS A CHARITABLE ENDEAVOR. TELL ME WHAT EBBY IS?
WELL, EBBY IS THIS. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU MY UNDERWEAR. WAIT. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU --
Stephen: I HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU MY UNDERWEAR.
Stephen: WOW! THAT'S A NEAT TRICK! WOW! I'VE SEEN BRAUS BEING TAKEN OFF BEFORE, BUT THAT IS--
HOLD IT. IT'S CLEAN. IT'S CLEAN.
Stephen: YOU TAKE THE OTHER SIDE THERE.
IT'S CLEAN. EBBY MEANS "EMPOWERED BY YOU." IT'S A COMPANY THAT I JUST LAUNCHED WHERE RENARKS TA BLARKS ANOTHER COLOMBIAN WOMAN-- YOU CAN TAKE IT. HERE, GIVE ME. LIKE THIS.
Stephen: OH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ GLI WOULD-- I REALLY WANT TO GO BACK-- I REALLY WANT TO GO BACK AND SHOW THIS MOMENT TO MY HIGH SCHOOL "DUDGEONS AND DRAGONS" SELF. "IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT BUDDY. IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK UP ON THE." YOU NOWNDED THIS COMPANY WITH THE WOMAN FROM COLOMBIA.
I WASN'T INTERESTED AT ALL IN SELLING UNDERWEAR AND I MET THIS GIRL CALLED RENATA BLACK, AND SHE CAME TO ME WITH AN IDEA ON THE PHONE. I GET A LOT OF PEOPLE TELLING ME, "WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US HERE. INVEST IN THIS, BE A SPOKESPERSON." AND ALWAYS I HAVE-- I HAVE TO FIRST SEE WHAT THE PRODUCT IS. I SAID TO HER, "OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME YOUR UNDERWEAR." AND SHE DID. SHE SHOWED ME HER UNDERWEAR. SHE SENT IT TO ME AND I LOVED IT. I LOVED IT. IT WAS LIKE-- I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE-- I MEAN, WHAT IS THERE TO INVENT ABOUT AN UNDERWEAR? AND YOU NEVER FEEL A BETTER UNDERWEAR THAN THAT ONE. IT DOESN'T BULGE. IT DOESN'T, LIKE, BEND. IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
Stephen: THERE'S ANOTHER ONE HERE. FANTASTIC. OBVIOUSLY, TEAL, LOVELY. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED PANTS. ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT'S NOT THE MORE IMPORTANT THING. THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS WE WANTED THE IDEA-- WE WANTED A BUSINESS FOR US THAT WE WERE GOING TO HELP WOMEN GET THEIR OWN BUSINESS. SO 10% OF THE NET PRICE, WE'RE GIVING THEM THE-- THE MONEY TO WOMEN TO FINANCE THEIR BUSINESSES.
Stephen: SO THESE ARE MICROLOANS TO PEOPLE LIKE--
FIRST WE'RE GOING TO COLOMBIA, AND WE'RE GIVING ALL THESE LOANS TO WOMEN TO EMPOWER THEM, TO TELL THEM YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN MONEY, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT-- HELP YOUR KIDS. BECAUSE WOMEN DON'T SPEND THEIR MONEY ON, LIKE, ALCOHOL OR GAMBLING. WE SPEND IT ON OUR KIDS OR OUR FAMILY.
Stephen: YOUR FAMILY.
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE THEM THAT LITTLE PUSH. AND IT'S AMAZING. AND WE THOUGHT THE NEXT ROUND OF MONEY WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO THE WOMEN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THIS WHOLE MONTH HERE. SO NOW COLOMBIA AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BE THE WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: WELL, "UNITED HE STAND." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE COMPANY IS CALLED EBBY. THE WOMAN IS SOFIA VERGARA. "MODERN FAMILY" BEGINS TOMORROW NIGHT ON ABC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH DAVID BOREANAZ. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) HEY! I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK SOMETIMES. THANKS, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST HAS STARRED IN EVERYTHING FROM "BUFFY" TO "BONES," AND NOW THE NEW CBS SHOW "SEAL TEAM."
WHEN I LEFT YOU AT THE TUNNEL'S ENTRANCE I TOLD YOU TO WATCH OUR SIX.
I FIGURED I NEEDED TO CLEAR THE TUNNEL SECTION.
WE WERE SENT 500 MILES TO BRING HIM IN ALIVE.

Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME DAVID BOREANAZ. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I LIKE THAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEBODY COME ON AND THREATEN THE AUDIENCE WITH A FIST.
IT'S NICE, RIGHT? THAT'S HOW WE TRAVEL AS SEALs, THEY COME IN LIKE THIS, GUNS UP HIGH. IT'S FAKE. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THEIR HANDS. THEY COME IN LIKE THIS. WHEN WE'RE REHEARSE AGO YEAH, THEY'RE LIKE CATS. WHEN WE'RE REHEARSING A SCENE, THEY USUALLY COME IN LIKE THIS, AND WE DON'T HAVE OUR WEAPONS ON US, AND WE'RE DOING THIS, THIS, THIS, COMING AROUND. THAT'S THE WHOLE THING. SO WHEN W WE'RE NOT SHOOTING, WH WE'RE AT BARS WITH THE SEALs, WE CLEAR A ROOM AFTER A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA. IT'S QUITE EXCITING.
Stephen:  WOW.
I HAD TO DO A STUNT IN THE PILOT WHERE I HAD TO JUMP OFF THE BOW, AND I TOLD MY STUNT DOUBLE I WANTED TO DO THE STUNT-- HE'S AN ACTUAL SEAL. AND HE SAID, "NO, YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK YOUR NECK IF YOU DO THIS." I SAID, "OKAY, I'LL LEAF IT TO YOU." HE DOES THE STUNT, DOESN'T BREAK HIS NECK. I JUMP, IN NO FLOICATION ON MY GEAR, AND I HAVE ALL THIS GEAR ON THAT WEIGHS ABOUT 20 POUNDS AND I'M STARTING TO SINK AND GETTING SUCKED LOOK A PYTHON. AND I'M LIKE, "GUYS." I'M GRABBING FOR THE BAG, AND THE GUY WHO IS ABOUT TO GET SHOT, AND THE SEALs ABOUT TO PICK ME UP, AND I'M GOING, I CAN'T TREAD WATER ANYMORE. I'M OUT. GET ME OUT OF THE WATER NOW." AND THE SEAL BOAT JUST GOES RIGHT BY ME. ( LAUGHTER ) I PROCEED TO SAY, "HELP! OOIK, LIKE, LITERALLY GOING TO DIE IN LOUISIANA. I'M GOING, "HELP!" I'M CHOKING ON RUSTY WATER. THE SEAL BOAT COMES BACK, THEY THROW ME IN, I BUST MY NOSE UP, BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE. LONG STORY SHORT. WE PROCEED TO SHOOT THE SHOW. THE TWO ACTORS, PLAYING H.A. AND NEIL. THEY SAID, DAVID IS REALLY A GOOD ACTOR. HE'S REALLY STRUGGLING OUT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT? I WAS LIKE -- I SAID, WAIT A SECOND, I DON'T THINK A SEAL WOULD BE SAYING, "HELP!" SO THAT WAS --
Stephen: YOU'D GIVE A LOT AWAY.
I WOULD GIVE A LOT AWAY ON THAT. THAT WAS MY ONGOING HIT EVERY DAY ON THE SET.
Stephen: YOU HAVE ACTUAL FORMER NAVY SEALOS THE SHOW?
YEAH, IT'S AMAZING. IT IS SO HUMBLE TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING THAT IS SO-- YOU KNOW, WHAT THESE GUYS DO IS VERY HUMBLING. AND WE HAVE CONSULTANTS IN THE WRITER'S ROOM, AND THE GUYS THAT STAY WITH US NAARE ACTUALLY ON THE SHOW. AND IT'S-- WHEN YOU HEAR THEIR STORIES, YOU-- IT JUST TAKES YOU A WHILE TO TAKE A STEP BACK. AND YOU GO, "YOU DID WHAT? HOW DID YOU DO THAT? YOU'RE PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY." AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT THEY DO WHEN WE'RE ASLEEP AT 4:00 A.M. OR 3:00 A.M. OR WHENEVER YOU GO TO BED. AND IT'S-- IT'S HUMBLING. IT REALLY IS. AND THESE GUYS-- I JUST APPLAUD WHAT THEY DO.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER SAY TO THEM LIKE, YOU KNOW, YEAH, BUT ON SEASON 9 OF 'BONES', WE SHOT, LIKE A 12-HOUR DAY?"
NO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ANOTHER SO YOU HAVE BEEN A STAPLE OF TV SINCE 1997.
YUP.
Stephen: YOU JUST-- IS IT MARCH YOU FINISHED SEASON 12 OF "BONES." WHY JUMP STRAIGHT INTO THE NEXT THING. YOU HAVE EARNED A LITTLE TIME TO GO RAPPEL OR SLEEP OR WHATEVER. ARE YOU A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT?
I WAS HOME FOR A WHILE, AND THEN MY WIFE TOLD ME TO GO BACK TO WORK. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I SAID, "YES, DEAR, QTDZ AND I WENT BACK TO WORK. I THINK IT WAS A SMART THING TO DO, BECAUSE I LOOKED AT THE GARAGE AT LEAST 80 TIMES A DAY, AND I STILL HAVEN'T CLEANED THAT.
Stephen: I HEARD THIS THING THAT YOU ARE-- YOU ARE-- WERE-- A DEAD HEAD.
STILL AM.
Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AT AGE NINE RIGHT THERE?
WAIT, THAT'S MORE HOOTIE AND THE BLOW FISH, I THINK.
Stephen: IT IS.
I MUST SAY THE FANNY PACK WAS VERY POPULAR. THAT'S LIKE CIRCA --
Stephen: YOU DO HAVE A FANNY PACK ON.
I DO.
Stephen: HOW BIG OF A DEAD HEAD ARE WE TALKING HERE?
PRETTY BIG. I SAW SOME EAST COAST SHOWS, AND I WENT TO ONE WEST COAST SHOW, BUT THAT WAS ALL JERRY GARCIA BANDS. MY SERVICE BIG AND POPULAR. SHE USED TO TRAVEL AND SELL ALL THE TIE-DYES.
Stephen: DID YOU DROP ACID AND TRIP?
DO I HAVE TO BE HONEST ON CBS.
Stephen: YOU DO. YOU'RE UNDER OATH. YOU'RE UNDER OATH WHEN YOU'RE ON THIS SHOW. DID YOU EVER FREAK OUT AND THINK YOU WERE A BEE AND TRY TO FORCE YOURSELF THROUGH A KEYHOLE?
I WILL SAY THAT I MET THE KEEBLER ELVES, AND I GOT THE FUDGE STRIPE INGREDIENTS. GLI DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I DON'T CARE, BECAUSE I KIND OF LIKE YOUR HONESTY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL --

Stephen: THERE YOU GO, KEN. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NOW, I HAVE SEEN THE FIRST TWO EPISODES OF THIS SO FAR. I'M ABOUT THREE HOURS IN. AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL DOCUMENTS I'VE EVER SEEN. OF COURSE, I GREW UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE VIETNAM WAR, BECAUSE I REMEMBER THE END OF IT. BUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT WAR, BEFORE THE UNITED STATES WAS EVEN INVOLVED, BEFORE 1959, WHAT WE WERE STEPPING INTO AS A COUNTRY, I WAS COMPLETELY UNAWARE, HOWEVER COMPLICATED I THOUGHT IT WAS, I WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL FOR WHAT A TANGLE IT WAS. WERE YOU-- WHAT SURPRISED BUWHAT YOU LEARNED ABOUT THIS STORY?
EVERYTHING. EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY WORKING ON THIS FOR 10 YEARS SURPRISED US. I THOUGHT I KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I LIVED THROUGH IT. I LIVED ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS AGAINST THE WAR. I HAD A HIGH DRAFT NUMBER. IT WAS AN AMAZING PERIOD AND I WENT IN THINKING, AH, FINALLY, A SUBJECT I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT. AND LYNN NOVICK AND I STARTED WORKING ON THIS AND WE REALIZED HOW LITTLE WE KNEW. THE FIRST EPISODE IS CALLED "DEJA VU" BECAUSE OF THE HUNDREDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE FRENCH THAT WE COULD HAVE TAKEN AS WARNING SIGNALS-- BRIDGE OUT THREE MILES, BRIDGE OUT THREE MILES, WAIT, AND A CARTOON IN THE MIDDLE AND, "WAIT, HOW DID WE GET HERE?" AND THAT WAS VIETNAM AT THE BEGINNING YOU.
Stephen:  SAID A MOMENT AGO YOU HAD A HIGH DRAFT NUMBER.
YES.
Stephen: FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO DON'T KNOW WHO MAY NOT EVEN BE REGISTERED FOR SELECTIVE SERVICE EVEN THOUGH IT STILL CONTINUES TO THIS DAY, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT TO HAVE A HIGH DRAFT NUMBER? >>ALLY ON IN THE VIETNAM WAR THERE WERE DEFERMENTS YOU COULD GET FOR BEING A STUDENT, FOR BEING MARRIED. PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS FAIR. IT FELL UNFAIRLY ON TO EXPWHRAKS MINORITIES AND POOR PEOPLE AND IT WAS ADJUSTED AND WE HAD A LOTTERY SYSTEM BASED ON YOUR BIRTHDAY. THEY PICKED YOUR BIRTHDAY DAY OUT, AND IT WAS NUMBER ONE. AND THE HIRING NUMBER YOU HAD, THE LESCHANCE YOU HAD OF BEING DRAFTED AND PUT INTO THE SERVICE.
Stephen:  THE YOUNG MEN KNEW WHEN THEIR NUMBER WAS COMING UP BECAUSE IT WOULD PROCEED THROUGH THE CALENDAR.
AND YOU HAD A SENSE OF HOW MANY THEY WERE GOING TO PICK THAT YEAR. WHAT HAPPENED, IS THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT, WHICH HAD BEEN A MORAL MOVEMENT, OPPOSED TO THE WAR FOR ETHICAL REASONS, BECAME A SELF-MOTIVATED MOVEMENT-- I DON'T WANT TO BE DRAFTED AND I DON'T WANT MY FRIENDS DRAFTED.
Stephen: THERE WERE BROTHERS ON THE STREET WHO I GREW UP ON, AND THEY WERE COLLEGE ROOMMAT ROOMMATES AND TH NUMBERS WERE COMING UP AND ONE WAS READY TO GO TO WAR AND ONE WAS READY TO GO TO CANADA. THEY LOVED EACH OTHER, BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
THIS DIVIDE US. THIS IS A PERIOD WHERE THERE WERE MASS DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THERE WAS A WHITE HOUSE IN DISARRAY, OBSESSED WITH LEAKS. THERE WAS A PRESIDENT ACCUSING THE MEDIA OF LYING, OF MAKING UP STORIES ABOUT HIM. THERE WAS HUGE DOCUMENT DROPS OF STOLEN CLASSIFIED MATERIALS. THERE WAS ACCUSATIONS THAT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN REACHED OUT DURING THE TIME OF WAR TO A FOREIGN POWER TO INFLUENCE THAT ELECTION. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS WAS ALL TRUE WHEN WE BEGAN WORK 10 YEARS AGO, AND WE FINISHED BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUSES. MARK TWAIN SAID, "HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT RHYMES." WE FINISHED OUR WORK, WE LIFTED UP AND WE WENT, "WHOA. THIS REALLY RHYMES."
Stephen: HOW DO YOU TELL THE STORY OF THE EXPERIENCE, THE DEVELOPMENT, THE PROSECUTION OF A WAR WHEN, BY ITS NATURE-- AS ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY SAID, THE FOG OF WAR-- IT'S HARD TO KNOW. IT'S ALMOST UNKNOWABLE BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPLEX AND SO MANY OF THE FIGURES END UP DYING IN THAT WAR.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WE TELL THE STORY OF THIS WAR FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. WHEN AMERICANS TALK ABOUT VIETNAM, THEY NORMALLY JUST TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES. BUT WE INTERVIEWED-- LYNN NOVICK, MY CODIRECTOR-- INTERVIEWED NORTH VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS, VIET CONG GUERILLAS, IN ADDITION TO MORE THAN 50 AMERICANS WE HAVE FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE, FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE WAR, TO UNBELIEVABLY BRAVE MARINES, AND ARMY GUYS CHARGING UP HILLS, TO GOLD STAR BHORGZ DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL THEIR INCREDIBLE STORIES. SO THAT WE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT IN WAR, MORE THAN ONE TRUTH COULD HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME, THAT WE COULD CREATE A SPAIRKS UNLIKE TODAY WE ARE SO DIVIDED, EVERYTHING IS SO TOXIC, THAT WE WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT EVEN AT A TERRIBLE TIME, WE COULD ACTUALLY DESCRIBE THIS STORY BY TELLING IT FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND REPRESENTING THAT. AND WE WENT OUT AND FOUND UNDERWRITERS FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHO JOINED A NONPROFIT CALLED THE BETTER ANGEL SOCIETY-- THIS IS PBS, THRIVING PBS. AND ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. WE GOT AN ENLIGHTENED CORPORATE UNDERWRITER, BANK OF AMERICA WHO SAID, "LOOK, BRING IT ON. ALL THE CONTROVERSY, BRING IT ON. WE'RE BETTER CONNECTED IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS." THEY HELPED SPONSOR SOME MUSIC THAT WE DID WITH JON AND LEON AND GARY CLARK JR., WHERE THEY DID A COVER OF "OHIO" BY CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH. WE HAVE BEATLES. WE HAVE ROLLING STONES, AND WE HAVE TRENT REZNOR AND NINE INCH NAILS.
Stephen: IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. KEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING TELL THIS STORY THAT AMERICANS TOOK TOO LONG TO TELL EACH OTHER AND THAT I THINK OUR POLITICS AND OUR SENSE OF SELF IS GOING TO BE LIVING WITH FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
IT'S REALLY TRUE. AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THAT SORT OF END OF A COMMENT. WE SAY, "THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE." AND REALLY IS JUST THE END OF IT. BUT IF YOU COULD THINK ABOUT IT, IF WE COULD TURN TO OUR VETERANS, FROM VIETNAM, PARTICULARLY, "WELCOME HOME. WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?" AND HAVE A KIND OF CIVIL DISCOURSE, WE CAN, PERHAPS, HELP PUT SOME OF THE GHOSTES OF VIETNAM AWAY, AND WE COULD ALSO HELP CURE THE TOXICITY OF THIS MOMENT. ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS ).
Stephen: "THE VIETNAM WAR" IS AIRING NOW ON PBS. KEN BURNS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. LATE SHOW." PLEASE TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE NICK KROLL, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, AND TIM AND ERIC. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, CHANNING TATUM, ADAM SCOTT, AND DIEGO LUNA. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
