Stephen: HELLO, OR AS THEY SAY IN RUSSIA, HALLO. I'M HERE IN MAGNIFICENT RED SQUARE. BEHIND ME YOU SEE LINEN'S TOMB WHERE IS FOUNDER OF THIS GREAT NATION LIES IN STAKE. YOU'RE ASKED NOT TO SPEAK AND NO SELFIES. GOT A GOOD ONE, THOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) BEHIND THE WALL IS THE KREMLIN. THINK OF IT AS RUSSIA'S WHITE HOUSE -- OR AMERICA'S WHITE HOUSE.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! "RUSSIA WEEK"! TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JASON BATEMAN AND MUSICAL GUEST MUSE, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," AND STEPHEN EXPLORS THE RITZ CARLTON PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( RUSSIAN MUSIC PLAYING )
Stephen: WHOO! THANK YOU, JON! WHAT'S UP, JON? GOOD TO SEE YA. HOW ARE YA? ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN )
Stephen: PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE TOO KIND. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD THE NEWS, BUT, AFTER NINE YEARS IN PRISON, O.J. SIMPSON WAS GRANTED PAROLE. THAT'S RIGHT, THE JUICE IS LOOSE! ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Jon: WOW... WOW...
Stephen: I THINK THEY'RE CHANTING JUICE! O.J. GOT AWAY. ORENTHAL IS SOARING, Y'ALL. FINALLY, HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND THE REAL KILLER. FIRST STEP: BUY A MIRROR.
Jon: WHOA!
Stephen: OKAY? SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT O.J., HE NEVER MET WITH SERGEI KISLYAK. ( LAUGHTER ) UNLIKE HIS BUDDY, HERE. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) COME ON, NOW! DON'T BE TOO HARSH. THAT WAS 1993, WHEN IT WAS A COIN TOSS WHICH ONE OF THOSE GUYS WOULD END UP PRESIDENT AND WHICH WOULD END UP IN JAIL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAYBE BOTH! MIGHT GET A TWO FER! SPEAKING OF WHICH, IT'S ALSO THE SIXTH MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF TRUMP'S INAUGURATION. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU GIVE FOR SIX MONTHS. I KNOW I'M TAKING XANAX. ( LAUGHTER ) I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S JUST SIX MONTHS. IT SEEMS TO HAVE LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS, DOESN'T IT? IT'S CRAZY. ONE OF OUR STAFFERS HAD A BABY BORN ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND HERE'S THAT SAME BABY TODAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ETTES ALL THE STRESS. IT'S THE CORTISOL.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: HE'LL BE FINE. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, TO CELEBRATE LASTING SIX MONTHS, YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO THE "FAILING NEW YORK TIMES." ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST, TRUMP TALKED ABOUT SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT SUPPORTING HIS HEALTHCARE BILL. "I THINK WE HAVE SIX PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY SORT OF OKAY. THEY ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE. WE DON'T HAVE BAD PEOPLE. I KNOW THE BAD PEOPLE. BELIEVE ME, DO I KNOW BAD PEOPLE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH -- OH, SIR --
Jon: HEY, HEY...
Stephen: I BELIEVE YOU. TRUMP BRAGGED ABOUT ALL HE'S ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR. "I'VE GIVEN THE FARMERS BACK THEIR FARMS. I'VE GIVEN THE BUILDERS BACK THEIR LAND, TO BUILD HOUSES AND TO BUILD OTHER THINGS." ( LAUGHTER ) THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS BUILDINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, THE BIG THINGS WITH YOUR NAME ON THEM. BUT IT WASN'T JUST DOMESTIC BRAGGING. OH, NO. TRUMP LOVES HIMSELF OVERSEAS, TOO. "I HAVE HAD THE BEST REVIEWS ON FOREIGN LAND. SO I GO TO POLAND AND MAKE A SPEECH. ENEMIES OF MINE IN THE MEDIA, ENEMIES OF MINE ARE SAYING IT WAS THE GREATEST SPEECH EVER MADE ON FOREIGN SOIL BY A PRESIDENT." ARE YOU SURE THEY DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A FOREIGN SPEECH BY A PRESIDENT GREATLY SOILING HIMSELF? ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BECAUSE I SAW THAT SPEECH. I SAW THE SPEECH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRUMP WAS ESPECIALLY PROUD OF HIS BASTILLE DAY VISIT WITH FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON. "WE HAD DINNER AT THE EIFFEL TOWER, AND THE BOTTOM OF THE EIFFEL TOWER LOOKED LIKE THEY COULD HAVE NEVER HAD A BIGGER CELEBRATION EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE EIFFEL TOWER. I MEAN, THERE WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, 'CAUSE THEY HEARD WE WERE HAVING DINNER." "ALSO, JUST FOR MY VISIT, THEY BUILT THIS ARC DE TRIUMPH, TO CELEBRATE HOW I WON IN WISCONSIN." "SO HUGE." ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YES.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S TIME WE ALL APPLAUDED HIS WIN IN WISCONSIN. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ONE TAKEAWAY FROM TRUMP'S FRENCH ADVENTURE WAS HIS FAMOUS, ENDLESS MANO-A-MANO HANDSHAKE WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT. FORGET ABOUT A COLD WAR WITH RUSSIA-- I THINK WE MAY BE HAVING A THUMB WAR WITH FRANCE. ( LAUGHTER ) DURING THE INTERVIEW, TRUMP TALKED ABOUT MACRON, SAYING, "HE'S A GREAT GUY. SMART. STRONG. LOVES HOLDING MY HAND... PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HE LOVES HOLDING MY HAND. AND THAT'S GOOD, AS FAR AS THAT GOES. I MEAN, REALLY. HE'S A VERY GOOD PERSON. AND A TOUGH GUY, BUT, LOOK, HE HAS TO BE. I THINK HE IS GOING TO BE A TERRIFIC PRESIDENT OF FRANCE. BUT HE DOES LOVE HOLDING MY HAND." ( LAUGHTER ) "AND THAT'S TOTALLY WEIRD, BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE THAT HAND HAS BEEN." ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH! OH! OH, HEY, HEY, HEY...
Stephen: AND TRUMP FINALLY EXPLAINED WHY, AT THE G20 DINNER, HE LEFT HIS SEAT AND WENT OVER TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. "SO, I WAS SEATED NEXT TO THE WIFE OF PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE OF JAPAN... AND SHE'S A TERRIFIC WOMAN BUT DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. LIKE, NOT 'HELLO'." OKAY, I CAN SEE WHY HE WOULD WANT TO GET UP AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE, BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE MRS. ABE HAS GIVEN AT LEAST ONE SPEECH IN ENGLISH. SIR, I THINK SHE WAS FAKING IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) "HELLO, MRS. ABE." "KONECHE WA, NO HABLA INGLES, SENOR TRUMP." ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS -- WE NOW HAVE VIDEO OF TRUMP AFTER HIS CONVERSATION WITH PUTIN, BACK AT HIS ORIGINAL  SEAT BUT STILL GESTURING AT PUTIN. "YOU'RE GREAT. LOOKING AT YA. HERE'S MY HAND. DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S BEEN. YOU, TOO. HOW ABOUT THIS, YOU, ME, COLLUDE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS THING WHERE HE MOVES IT BACK AND FORTH, I WANT TO POINT OUT I MADE THAT EXACT SAME GESTURE EARLIER THIS WEEK ON THE SHOW AND I GOT BLURRED! ( LAUGHTER ) WAS I BEING TOO PRESIDENTIAL? I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP MADE AN INTERESTING CLAIM. "WHEN NIXON CAME ALONG-- ( INAUDIBLE ) --WAS PRETTY BRUTAL, AND OUT OF COURTESY, THE F.B.I. STARTED REPORTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OFFICIAL, THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CONGRESS. THERE WAS NOTHING-- ANYTHING. BUT THE F.B.I. PERSON REALLY REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS INTERESTING. YOU KNOW, WHICH IS INTERESTING. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT NEW F.B.I. DIRECTOR." OH, SO THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO YOU WITH NOBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM. NO ONE WILL KNOW! SO IT'S LIKE THE POLICE BUT SECRET. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT SEE THESE POLICE. THEY WOULD BE NOT-SEE POLICE. I THINK YOU WOULD CALL THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO-SEE OR NOT-SEE, NON-SEE, NONE-SEE? NOT-SEE IS GOOD. THEN, TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE FIRING OF F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. "WHY WOULD SOMEBODY SAY, 'HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO FIRE ME,' BAH BAH BAH? WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST SAY, 'HEY, I'VE RETIRED'?" YES, WHY DIDN'T COMEY JUST SAY HE RETIRED? JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT HE WAS IN L.A. AT AN F.B.I. EVENT AND FOUND OUT LIVE FROM A TV IN THE ROOM THAT HE WAS FIRED. "SIR, THEY'RE SAYING YOU GOT FIRED ON TV." "WHAT? NO, I WASN'T. I RETIRED!" ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, MY WORK IS TONE HERE. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T HE JUST SAY I RETIRED? THAT WAS TRUMP'S FAMOUS CATCH PHRASE FOR "THE APPRENTICE," WASN'T IT? YOU'VE RETIRED. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, ROBERT MUELLER, TRUMP SAID HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN APPOINTED, AND TRUMP WARNED THAT MUELLER SHOULD STAY OUT OF INVESTIGATING HIS FINANCES. THAT'S NOT A RED FLAG AT ALL. ( LAUGHTER ) "SURE, THE POLICE ARE WELCOME TO SEARCH ANYWHERE IN MY HOUSE, AS LONG AS THEY DON'T DIG UP THE PATIO. THERE'S NOTHING DOWN THERE. OR THE SHED. AND FORGET THE CRAWLSPACE-- IT'S WAY TOO CROWDED IN THERE." ( LAUGHTER ) TURNS OUT THE PRESIDENT'S WARNING DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL BECAUSE, TODAY, IT CAME OUT THAT MUELLER HAS EXPANDED HIS PROBE INTO TRUMP'S PERSONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. TRUMP, COULD YOU PLEASE WARN MUELLER NOT TO SUBPOENA YOUR TAXES? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TRUMP SAVES HIS REAL IRE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS, AND THIS ONE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE AUDIO ON.
REPORTER: SESSIONS GETS THE JOB. RIGHT AFTER HE GETS THE JOB, HE RECUSES HIMSELF. WAS THAT A MISTAKE?
WELL, SESSIONS SHOULD HAVE NEVER RECUSED HIMSELF. AND IF HE WAS GOING TO RECUSE HIMSELF, HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME BEFORE HE TOOK THE JOB, AND I WOULD HAVE PICKED SOMEBODY ELSE.
STEPHEN: THIS IS CRAZY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR JEFF SESSIONS TO RECUSE HIMSELF BECAUSE THE THING HE RECUSED HIMSELF FROM HADN'T HAPPENED YET. ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERING ) THE ONLY WAY IT COULD WORK IS IF JEFF SESSIONS GOES BACK IN TIME, TAKES HIS OWN MOTHER TO THE PROM, AND TEACHES CHUCK BERRY'S COUSIN ABOUT ROCK AND ROLL! ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY? 88 MILES AN HOUR. AND TRUMP WAS JUST AS UNHAPPY WITH JEFF SESSIONS'S DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, ROD ROSENSTEIN. "YEAH, WHAT JEFF SESSIONS DID WAS HE RECUSED HIMSELF RIGHT AFTER, RIGHT AFTER HE BECAME ATTORNEY GENERAL. THEN I SAID, "WHO'S YOUR DEPUTY?" SO HIS DEPUTY HE HARDLY KNEW, AND THAT'S ROSENSTEIN, ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHO IS FROM BALTIMORE. THERE ARE VERY FEW REPUBLICANS IN BALTIMORE, IF ANY. SO, HE'S FROM BALTIMORE." ALL RIGHT? YOU GET THE MESSAGE? ARE YOU GETTING THE MESSAGE? DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T TRUST BALTIMORE. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HIS REVIEW OF "THE WIRE." "ONE STAR. VERY FEW REPUBLICANS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) AND AGAIN, KEEP IN MIND, WE'RE ONLY HALF A YEAR IN AND TRUMP ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE. AND HE'S GOING TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION. ( AUDIENCE BOOING ) NO, YOU HAVE TO GET READY FOR THIS. HE'S RUNNING FOR REERECTION AND WE AT "THE LATE SHOW" ARE READY TO PROJECT WHAT THAT BABY WILL LOOK LIKE IN ANOTHER SIX MONTHS. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JASON BATEMAN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I TAKE YOU INSIDE TRUMP'S PRESIDENTIAL SUITE IN MOSCOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STICK AROUND! ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK. GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE! GIVE IT UP! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, MY GOSH! JON, MY FRIEND, IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING WEEK.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: WE'RE HAVING AN AMAZING WEEK, THE "RUSSIA WEEK" HERE. THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE NIGHT TO HAVE THE ENTIRE RUSSIA WEEK BECAUSE THIS NIGHT IS WHY I WENT. THE PIECE WE'RE SHOWING TONIGHT IS THE REASON WE WENT. I WAS SAYING TO CHRIS, MY PRODUCER, AND HE SAID, YOU WANT TO BE GOING TO RUSSIA? I SAID NOBODY'S GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT, I'M A DUMMY. THE BIG PART OF THE INTERVIEW THEY DID WITH TRUMP FOCUSED ON THE DOSSIER. BACK IN JANUARY, TEN DAYS BEFORE TRUMP WAS INAUGURATED, A DOCUMENT WAS LEAKED CONTAINING ALLEGATIONS THAT TRUMP HAS DEEP FINANCIAL TIES TO RUSSIA, THAT HIS CAMPAIGN WAS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD A COMPROMISING VIDEO OF DONALD TRUMP WATCHING PROSTITUTES URINATE ON A BED IN THE MOSCOW RITZ CARLTON PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. IT WAS A BOMBSHELL, AND WHEN FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY INFORMED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT IT, TRUMP WASN'T HAPPY. HE TOLD THE "TIMES," "WHEN HE BROUGHT IT TO ME, I SAID THIS IS REALLY MADE-UP JUNK. I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT, MAN, THIS IS SUCH A PHONY DEAL." AND REMEMBER, AS THE FOUNDER OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY, HE'S AN EXPERT ON PHONY DEALS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) TRUMP CLAIMED HE CAN PROVE IT'S BOGUS BECAUSE "I HAVE WITNESSES. YOU KNOW, I WENT THERE  WITH PHIL RUFFIN." NOW, I THOUGHT PHIL RUFFIN WAS THE ARCH NEMESIS OF MCGRUFF THE CRIME DOG. "I'LL GET YOU, RUFFIN!" ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT TURNS OUT, HE'S A CASINO OWNER FRIEND OF TRUMP'S. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS UPSTANDING CHARACTER WITNESS THEY CALL PHIL RUFFIN-- OH, THEY TOTALLY DID IT. YEAH. YEAH, THEY DID IT. NOW, THE WILDEST ACCUSATIONS IN THAT DOSSIER HAVE NEVER BEEN CONFIRMED. BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW, NOBODY HAS TRIED. HERE'S THE REASON WHY. THE MEDIA SAID IT'S TOO SALACIOUS FOR US TO LOOK INTO. BUT IT'S THE ONLY PART WE CARE ABOUT OR TALK ABOUT, THE PEE PEE TAPE! PEE PEE TAPE! PEE PEE TAPE! PEE PEE TAPE! THERE WAS ONE MAN BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO TO MOSCOW AND CHECK IT OUT. HE HAS TWO THUMBS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JIM?
STEPHEN: MOSCOW. THE HEART OF MOTHER RUSSIA. THE SOURCE OF THE GREATEST POLITICAL TURMOIL TO AFFLICT THE HIGHEST ECHELONS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN A GENERATION. I WENT TO THE RUSSIAN BEAR'S DEN MYSELF TO ASK THE QUESTION THAT OTHERS WERE AFRAID TO -- DO YOU HAVE THE PEE PEE TAPE? DO YOU HAVE THE PEE PEE TAPE? I'LL ALSO TAKE THE PEE-PEE TAPE, I WOULD LIKE THE THE PEE PEE TAPE? THE PEE PEE TAPE? THE PEE PEE TAPE? FOR SOME REASON, ASKING RANDOM PEOPLE FOR THE PEE PEE TAPE WASN'T WORKING. SO I MET WITH RUSSIAN SURVEILLANCE EXPERT ANDREI SOLDATOV. A JOURNALIST CRITICAL OF THE KREMLIN'S SURVEILLANCE TACTICS, ANDREI HAS BEEN INTERROGATED BY THE F.S.B. FOUR TIMES! I MET HIM AT AN UNDISCLOSED MOSCOW HOTEL. HELLO, ANDREI.
HELLO, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: JUST IN CASE WE'R -- I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS BUT DO YOU THINK THE RUSSIANS HAVE CMOPROMOT ON DONALD TRUMP?
I DON'T KNOW. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE PEEPEE TAPE?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?
THERE WAS SOMETHING EMBARRASSING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BUT NO DETAILS.
Stephen: NO DETAILS? WELL, SOME DETAILS.
Stephen: LIKE WHAT? LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT SHOWER
STEPHEN: YES. A TYPE OF SHOWER. A TYPE OF SHOWER. IS-- DID THE SHOWER HAVE A PARTICULAR COLOR?
YEAH, I THINK SO.
STEPHEN: COULD YOU NAME THE COLOR? WHAT COLOR WAS THE SHOWER?
SOMETHING ABOUT GOLD, OR YELLOW.
STEPHEN: YEP, GOLD. AND-- WHO MIGHT HAVE PROVIDED THAT? WAS IT FROM A FAUCET? OR WAS IT-- WHO MIGHT HAVE PROVIDED THE SHOWER?
SOME GIRLS, MAYBE?
STEPHEN: SOME GIRLS? JUST, LIKE, SOME FRIENDS? LIKE, SOME P-- JUST STOPPED BY FOR FUN?
WELL, I DO NOT HAVE THESE KIND OF DETAILS.
STEPHEN: YOU DON'T HAVE THESE DE-- DETAILS. OKAY. WELL, IN THE UNITED STATES, IT WAS REPORTED THAT WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS STAYING AT THE RITZ-CARLTON, HE STAYED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE, WHICH I BELIEVE IS ROOM 1101, AND THAT HE HIRED TWO PROSTITUTES TO PEE IN THE BED BECAUSE THIS ROOM HAD ALSO BEEN OCCUPIED BY BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA, AND IT WAS A FORM OF INSULT TO THEM TO HAVE THESE WOMEN COME DO THAT ON THE BED. DID YOU GUYS HEAR THOSE DETAILS OVER HERE?
YES.
Stephen: THE IDEA IS THAT THERE WERE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE THE BUILDING IS WIRED AND THAT THE F.S.B. HAS THIS BECAUSE THEY AUTOMATICALLY HAVE CAMERAS IN THE ROOM AND THEY CAUGHT THIS HAPPENING.
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.
STEPHEN: DOES MAKE SENSE?
OKAY.
STEPHEN: NO ONE FROM AMERICA HAS GONE TO-- TO SEE WHAT THAT ROOM IS LIKE OR TO TRY TO VERIFY THAT STORY IN ANY WAY. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO DO TO-- TO GET ACCESS TO THAT ROOM?
MAYBE TO CHECK INTO THE HOTEL?
STEPHEN: THAT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED. BUT WE DID IT. IT'S TRUE, ROOM 1101. THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE OF THE RITZ CARLTON. WE RENTED IT. HERE'S THE KEY. LET'S GO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE GLAMEROUS RITZ CARLTON PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. CHAMPAGNE DREAMS AND PEE PEE WISHES. TEN GLORIOUS ROOMS, FILLED WITH GRAND PIANOS AND CLOSETS SO BIG YOU COULD HIDE A CORPSE. IT HAS ALL THE MODERN AMENITIES. BUT OF COURSE, THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON TO RENT THIS SUITE. HELLO. JOIN ME, WON'T YOU? IN THE BEDROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE OF THE RITZ CARLTON IN MOSCOW. THE ROOM WE HAVE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT, AND YET NO ONE HAS COME TO CHECK IT OUT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. WHEN YOU ARE IN THIS ROOM, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT-- YOU ARE SOAKED IN HISTORY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WASHES OVER YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE IT'S IN THE PAST-- URINE IN HISTORY. ( LAUGHTER ) URINE IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING? I AM SAYING THAT THE PEE PEE TAPE SUPPOSEDLY TOOK PLACE ON THAT BED, IS WHAT I AM SAYING. THE DOSSIER ALLEGES THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS IN THIS ROOM. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE SAT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS BENCH DOWN HERE, THOUGH I DOUBT IT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU'D CALL THE SPLASH ZONE. YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO WEAR A PONCHO. COULD HAVE BEEN ON THE COUCH, OVER THERE. BUT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE? JOIN US, WHEN MY INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM CONTINUES.
STEPHEN: PEE PEE TAPE. PEE PEE TAPE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE IMAGINED SOMETHING FOR SO LONG, THAT WHEN YOU FINALLY SEE IT, IT DOESN'T MATCH WHAT YOU PICTURED? THAT'S NOT THIS FEELING AT ALL! ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. HOLY COW. THAT'S THE KREMLIN, RIGHT THERE! THEY WOULDN'T EVEN NEED CAMERAS IN THIS ROOM-- PUTIN COULD WATCH WITH BINOCULARS. WITH MY INITIAL SURVEY COMPLETE, ANDREI REJOINED THE INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE IS KNOWN TO BE UNDER SURVEILLANCE, WE SWEPT THE ROOM FOR CAMERAS AND LISTENING DEVICES. THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE, EVEN THE POTTERY. IS THERE ANY WAY OF KNOWING IF THERE'S LISTENING DEVICES IN HERE?
WELL, FOR THAT YOU NEED SPECIAL EQUIPMENT.
Stephen: OR YOU COULD BREAK IT OPEN?
THAT'S ALSO AN OPTION.
Stephen: YEAH. OBVIOUSLY.
Stephen: YEAH, THERE'S KNOT IN THERE. ( PHONE RINGING )
Stephen: HELLO? (INAUDIBLE).
Stephen: THERE IS AN EMERGENCY BUTTON IN MY ROOM?
(INAUDIBLE).
Stephen: NO, EVERYTHING IS GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR CHECKING. YEAH, THEY'RE ON TO US. YEAH. THA THAT WAS ANDREI'S CUE TO LEAVE. BUT I WASN'T DONE. SO, WHO KNOWS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM? SCIENCE DOES, AND TONIGHT, SCIENCE IS ON YOUR SIDE. HIT THE LIGHTS. ( CHEERING ) LET'S INVESTIGATE. I WANT TO THANK ACTION NEWS TEAM CHANNEL 53 FOR LENDING ME THEIR BLACK LIGHT. OKAY, I'M GOING IN. THIS PILLOW LOOKS CLEAN. THAT CHECKS OUT, NO EVIDENCE THERE. OH, I GOT SOMETHING. "FAKE NEWS, NEVER HAPPENED, SAD. SADDER STILL, I'D COME 5,000 MILES TO FIND THE PEE PEE TAPE, AND WAS LEAVING WITH NO PROOF THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS EVER HERE. WORST OF ALL, THIS ROOM WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE SO THIS IS WHERE I'M STAYING TONIGHT. GUYS, YOU CAN GO. WOULD YOU MIND KILLING THE LIGHTS ON YOUR WAY OUT? AHHH! ( SNORING ) DO YOU MIND?
SORRY, STEPHEN, MY BAD. NIGHT NIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, RITZ CARLTON, AND SORRY ABOUT THIS. JOIN ME TOMORROW FOR THE EXCITING CONCLUSION OF RUSSIA WEEK. BECAUSE UNLIKE THE RUSSIA SCANDALS, THIS WEEK WILL EVENTUALLY BE OVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JASON BATEMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT FROM COMEDIES LIKE "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT," "HORRIBLE BOSSES," AND "JUNO." HE NOW STARS IN THE NETFLIX DRAMA, "OZARK."
WHERE IS MY MONEY? AS WE TOLD YOU, WE CAN'T COVER THAT AMOUNT WITHIN 24
THERE IS TWO FEDERAL AGENTS HERE, WHICH MEANS YOU WOULDN'T TAKE THE CHANCE THAT THERE WAS A KIDNAPPING AND NOT HAVE MY MONEY. SO IF YOU DON'T PRODUCE IT IMMEDIATELY, I'M GOING TO WALK INTO THAT LOBBY AND I'M GOING TO TELL THESE PEOPLE I CAN'T GET MY MONEY OUT AND WE'LL SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GO VIRAL AND YOU GET AN OLD FASHIONED RUN ON MY BANK. AND IF I WANT TO PUT ALL MY MONEY IN A HOT TUB, GET NAKED AND PLAY SCROOGE M.L.K. DUCK, THAT IS 100% MY BUSINESS. NOW WHERE'S MY MONEY?
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JASON BATEMAN! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THEY STAND FOR EVERY FIRST GUEST, DON'T THEY?
Stephen: NO, THEY DO NOT. EVERY OTHER. ON THURSDAYS THEY. ON FRIDAYS, THEY NEVER DO. ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HI, NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: HERE'S THE DEAL, I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW --
I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.
Stephen: AM I TALKING TO FUNNY JASON BATEMAN OR TO DRAMA JASON BATEMAN? OKAY? BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A TURN GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GARBAGE IS.
Stephen: WHAT THE GARBAGE IS? I HEAR IT'S A GREAT SERIESY YOU'RE A DRAMATIC ACTOR.
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S GREAT, SOME PEOPLE NOT SO GREAT. I TAKE WHAT I GET, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST READ A REVIEW THE GUY SAYS I PLAY THE CHARACTER WITH THE BLANDNESS OF AN AIRPORT DESK CLERK.
Stephen: THOSE GUYS TERRIFY ME.
THEN ANOTHER REVIEW, BEST WORK HE'S EVER DONE. SO YOU GO OUT THERE, YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN DO, EVERYBODY, RIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE OUT THERE, WE'RE ALL DANCING AS FAST AS WE CAN TO PROVIDE FOR THE FAMILY.
Stephen: AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC REVIEW BEING WRITTEN OF THEIR WORK.
I ACTUALLY LIKE READING REVIEWS.
Stephen: DO YOU, REALLY? WE'RE MAKING THESE THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE AN OPINION. WE CAN'T BAT A THOUSAND.
Stephen: HAVE YOU HAD GREAT REVIEWS?
ONE CAME IN RIGHT BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE AND I WAS, LIKE, OH, NO! AND MY PUBLICIST IS, LIKE, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T READ THAT BEFORE YOU GO OUT. I SAID, NO, I'M GOING TO READ IT! EDUCATIONAL. YOU LEARN.
Stephen: WELL, I JUST WROTE WHAT I FELT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE THAT SON OF A PITCH --
Stephen: LOOK AT THIS, TALK ABOUT YOUNG GUN RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT YOU RIGHT THERE.
WE WERE HAPPY.
Stephen: THIS IS 20 YEARS AGO? HOW MANY YEARS AGO, 20?
AT LEAST. IT'S ONE I COULD -- IT'S WHEN I COULD AFFORD THE GOOD PIECE. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT PIECE ON MY HEAD.
Stephen: THAT'S THE HOGAN FAMILY. THAT'S AS SHORT AS THEY COULD CUT IT. YOUR HAIR FOUGHT BACK.
YEAH, IT SURE DID. NO, THAT WAS -- THIS IS WHEN I WAS MAKING SMILES. NOW WE'VE GOT THE DRAMA OUT THERE AND -- NO, THE DRAMA WAS REALLY FUN TO DO. IT WAS THIS "OZARK," WHICH IS FAN T. I HOPE YOU LIKE IT. IT'S JUST THIS MOODY, DANGEROUS THING THAT I REALLY ENJOYED DIRECTING. I DIRECTED A COUPLE OF FILMS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND WE WERE LOOKING TO DIRECT SOMETHING THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE MORE CHALLENGING AND ALL THAT STUFF.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT THIS PHOTO OUT. AT AGE 18, YOU DIRECTED SOME OF THE EPISODES OF "THE HOGAN FAMILY." WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE 18 YEARS OLD AND TELLING PEOPLE TWICE OR THREE TIMES YOUR AGE, YOU KNOW, I NEED MORE IN THIS TAKE? DO THEY TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY?
NO. NO, NO. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S A LOT OF QUALIFIERS. THERE'S A LOT OF APOLOGIZING BEFORE YOU START SPEAKING. YOU KNOW. I'M SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU WITH THIS PROBABLY TERRIBLE NOTE, BUT HERE'S AN IDEA. NOT THIS, DON'T DO THIS, BUT SOMETHING IN THIS WORLD OF -- OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, DON'T DO IT. I GOTTA GO. YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, BUT IT WAS FUN. I MEAN, THAT WAS SIMPLE AND COMFORTABLE BECAUSE WE HAD ALL BEEN TOGETHER FOR SO LONG AND THEY FINALLY LET ME DO THAT, AND THEY WERE VERY NICE TO ME. I GOT THE BUG. THE HOOK GOT SET EARLY.
Stephen: HOLD ON. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. BACK WITH NOR JASON BATEMAN. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WE'RE BACK WITH JASON BATEMAN. JASON, I GOT A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU. THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID -- YOU SAID, IN AN INTERVIEW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- I DON'T FOLLOW YOUR CAREER.
WHO'S READY TO COME UP HERE AND DEFEND ME?
Stephen: YOU SAID YOU WERE CONSIDERING BECOMING A TALK SHOW HOST IN NEW YORK 20 YEARS FROM NOW! IS THIS A RETIREMENT PLAN TO YOU? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU THINK THIS IS SO EASY?
NO, MAN.
Stephen: THAT 20 YEARS FROM NOW, OH, I JUST WANT TO CHECK OUT. I'LL BE A TALK SHOW HOST. THAT LOOKS LIKE A DREAM!
MY KIDS LOVE THEIR SCHOOLS. WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THEIR SCHOOLS, THEY CAN COME INTO NEW YORK.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WALTZ IN, IN 20 YEARS, AND SOMEONE WILL MAKE ROOM FOR YOU?
THIS IS HARD, STEPHEN. YOU'RE IN HERE EARLY AT NOON OR SOMETHING, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BANGING OUT TWO SHOWS IN TWO HOURS, YOU'RE DOING TWO MONOLOGUES IN P THE SAME TIE! HE DOESN'T CHANGE HIS TIE!
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. TRY IT! GO AHEAD! COME ON, MR. SMART GUY! COME ON, INTRODUCE ME. INTRODUCE ME. INTRODUCE ME. GIVE ME A GOOD SONG. GIVE ME A GOOD SONG.

AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE HIM, PLEASE GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO -- TELL ME IT ONE MORE TIME -- SCOTT -- SCOTT -- STEPHEN! STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
THIS IS EMBARRASSING. WE'RE OUT OF TIME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: GREAT TO BE HERE, MAN. HUGE FAN. WHAT YOU'RE DOING, IT'S IMPORTANT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU, MAN. YOU'RE SO GREAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. THAT LOOKS LIKE THE HARDEST JOB IN AMERICA.
IT'S NOT EASY. IT'S NOT EASY.
Stephen: INCREDIBLE. I LOVE YOU AND I'M SO OBSESSED WITH YOU, YOU'RE SO GREAT.
AND NOT MUTUAL ADMIRATION, BUT WE SAW THAT CLIP OF YOUR NEW DRAMATIC SHOW.
Stephen: THANK YOU. BOY, BABE  Y, LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'RE NOT AS BLAND ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NO. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH LAURA LENNY?
Stephen: AMAZING. AMAZING LAURA LENNY, AN INCREDIBLE ACTRESS. ( APPLAUSE ) BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS AGAINST THE NUDE SCENES. SHE INSISTED. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, SHE INSISTED.
SHE'S VERY PROUD.
Stephen: YEAH, OF ME. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I WAS NUDE. SHE WAS FULLY CLOTHES.
OH, SHE WASN'T NUDE?
Stephen: NO. SHE SAID, LET ME AT THAT THING. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. SHE SAID YOUR AS IS SO HIGH AND FIRM I COULD BOUNCE OFF A QUARTER AND GET BACK TWO DIMES AND A NICKEL. SHE SAID THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
YOU WERE A SKATER FOR A LITTLE A WHILE.
Stephen: I WORKED IN THE ICE CAPADES. WHEN I STARRED MY CAREER IN THE ICE CAPADES IT WAS CALLED FROZEN PEACHES, I WAS A GEORGIA-BASED ICE CAPADES GROUP AND WE REENACTED THE CIVIL WAR ON ICE. TRIPLE SOW COW, DOUBLE AXLE, THE WHOLE THING.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE FOR HI JINX STORIES ON THIS.
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. I MISS DAVE.
