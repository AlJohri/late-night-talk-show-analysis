Announcer: SEPTEMBER 23, 2017. THE STAKES WERE HIGH FOR NUMBER 45, LOSER OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE ObamaCare REPEALS. THINGS WERE GETTING DESPERATE FOR THE WASHINGTON PIGSKIN. HE WAS ALREADY A LEGEND WHO CHANGED THE GAME FOREVER WITH HIS HISTORIC DEFENSIVENESS AND POWERFUL OFFENSIVE LIES. THAT NIGHT HE WAS BACK IN BEAST MODE.
GET THAT SON OF A PITCH OFF THE FIELD RIGHT NOW. OUT. HE'S FIRED. HE'S FIRED!
HE VANQUISHED HIS OLDEST RIVAL, COMMON DECENCY, THEN RAN UP THE SCORE HURLING TWEET AFTER TWEET, AND THE MOST PASSIONATE FANS IN TRUMP NATION WENT WILD.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, TRUMP TACKLES THE N.F.L. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES STERLING K. BROWN AND CHANCE THE RAPPER, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. HOUSE OF YOUR WEEKEND? WAS IT OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S MINE:  OKAY, I WATCHED THE NEWS AND THEN, TO CHEER UP, I WATCHED KEN BURNS' "VIETNAM."
Jon: WOW.
Stephen: SLIGHTLY LESS DIVISIVE TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE N.F.L. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME RACIAL TENSION? ( CHEERING ) FOR THE LAST YEAR, SOME PLAYERS HAVE BEEN KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM TO PROTEST INSTITUTIONAL RACISM. IT STARTED WITH THEN-49'ERS QUARTERBACK COLIN KAEPERNICK. IT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL PROTEST. AFTER ALL, THE SINGING OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS A SACRED TIME WHEN RED-BLOODED AMERICANS STAND UP, AND RUN TO THE BATHROOM BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE LINE IS SHORTEST. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. MAYBE GET SOME PRETZEL KNOTS OR SOMETHING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WELL, ON FRIDAY, TRUMP ADDRESSED THE FOOTBALL CONTROVERSY.
WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO SEE ONE OF THESE N.F.L. OWNERS, WHEN SOMEBODY DISRESPECTS OUR FLAG, TO SAY GET THAT SON OF A BITCH OFF THE FIELD RIGHT NOW, OUT, HE'S FIRED? FIRED!
STEPHEN: WOW. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) "SON OF A BITCH." THAT WAS UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. THERE SHOULD BE A FLAG ON THAT PLAY. I'M GOING TO SAY A CONFEDERATE FLAG. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THE BLOWBACK WAS IMMEDIATE. COLIN KAEPERNICK'S MOM, WHO, AFTER SEEING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CALL HER CHILD A SON OF A BITCH, TWEETED, "GUESS THAT MAKES ME ONE PROUD BITCH." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW! YEAH! YEAH! MOMS! MOMS! COLIN'S MOM IS THE COOLEST MOM IN SPORTS! AFTER THAT, SHE TOOK THE WHOLE TEAM TO DAIRY QUEEN AND MADE IT RAIN ORANGE SLICES! WHOO! ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) PLUS, 28 NFL TEAMS RELEASED STATEMENTS SUPPORTING THE PLAYERS, AND YESTERDAY THE PROTESTS WENT FROM FEWER THAN 10 PLAYERS, TOTAL, TO IN EXCESS OF 250. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) 250. GREAT NEWS FOR ANYONE IN A FANTASY RACIAL JUSTICE LEAGUE. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF DEMONSTRATIONS: PLAYERS STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH THEIR TEAMMATES, SITTING, KNEELING AND LOCKING ARMS WITH OLD-TIMEY CARNIVAL BARKERS. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP ACTUALLY APPROVED OF THAT LAST ONE, TWEETING, "GREAT SOLIDARITY FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. STANDING WITH LOCKED ARMS IS GOOD, KNEELING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. BAD RATINGS!" ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST OF ALL, LOCKING ARMS DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE ON YOUR SITE AND, SECOND, RATINGS AREN'T THE ONLY END KARAT OF IMPORTANCE. I HEAR NOBODY TUNED IN FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, THEIR AD CAMPAIGN WAS ONE GUY ON A HORSE.
Jon: YOU.
Stephen: NOT GOOD MARKETING.
Jon: TERRIBLE MARKETING.
Stephen: AND TODAY, DONALD TRUMP WAS STILL TWEETING. "THE ISSUE OF KNEELING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE. WRONG. KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH RACE. JUST LIKE YOUR PRESIDENCY. LIFE LIFE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY! MAE!
Stephen: THOSE PLAYERS ARE PROTESTING RACIAL INJUST. THEY'RE NOT PROTESTING THE AMERICAN FLAG. SAYING THAT KNEELING IS A PROTEST AGAINST THE FLAG IS LIKE SAYING GANDHI'S HUNGER STRIKES WERE A PROTEST AGAINST MIDDAY SNACKS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU DO REALIZE THAT CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WEREN'T SITTING IN AT THE LUNCH COUNTERS FOR BETTER GRILLED CHEESE. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP CONTINUED: "IT IS ABOUT RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY, FLAG AND NATIONAL ANTHEM. N.F.L. MUST RESPECT THIS!" YES, THERE ARE RULES WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLAG. THERE ARE ACTUALLY WRITTEN RULES. FOR INSTANCE, DON'T USE IT TO SELL MERCHANDISE, LIKE THIS TRUMP PENCE T-SHIRT, ONLY $35. ALSO, DON'T HUG IT. THAT'S JUST WEIRD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: AND IT DIDN'T LOOK CONSENSUAL, FRANKLY. ASK. YOU'VE GOT TO ASK THE FLAG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) NEVER STOPPED 'EM IN THE PAST. YESTERDAY MORNING, THE SUNDAY'S SHOWS WERE BLITZED BY TRUMP'S DEFENDERS LIKE TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN.
IT'S NOT ABOUT RACE, IT'S NOT ABOUT FREE SPEECH. THEY CAN DO FREE SPEECH ON THEIR OWN TIME. ( STEPHEN MIMICKING )
Stephen: I ACTUALLY FIND IT UPSETTING HOW EASY IT IS FOR ME TO DO AN IMPRESSION OF HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NOT GOOD. GOT TO MOISTURIZE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU CAN DO FREE SPEECH ON YOUR OWN TIME, OKAY?
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: THE CONSTITUTION'S NOT AN ALL-THE-TIME THING! YOU'VE GOT TO READ THE FINE PRINT ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS. "SOME RESTRICTIONS MAY APPLY." "AVAILABLE ONLY AT PARTICIPATING LONG JOHN SILVER'S." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) TRUMP ALSO COMPLAINED THAT THE FOOTBALL ISN'T VIOLENT ENOUGH.
TODAY, IF YOU HIT TOO HARD, IF THEY HIT TOO HARD, 15 YARDS, THROW HIM OUT OF THE GAME. THEY HAVE THAT LAST WEEK. I WATCHED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND TWO GUYS JUST REALLY BEAUTIFUL TACKLE. BOOM. 15 YARDS. THEY ARE RUINING THE GAME! RIGHT? THEY'RE ARE RUINING THE GAME.
STEPHEN: THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BRAIN DAMAGE. LOOK HOW FAR I GOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH!
Stephen: HELLO, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: HE TRUMPED ON.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THE N.F.L. RATINGS ARE DOWN, MASSIVELY. MASSIVELY. THE N.F.L. RATINGS ARE DOWN MASSIVELY. NOW, THE NUMBER ONE REASON HAPPENS TO BE THAT THEY LIKE WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON-- YOU KNOW, WITH YOURS TRULY.
Stephen: DID YOU CATCH THAT? HE'S SAYING THAT FOOTBALL RATINGS ARE DOWN BECAUSE FANS WOULD RATHER WATCH  DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THAT'S LIKE AN INVERTED TOM BRADY, TRUMP IS TRYING TO INFLATE HIS OWN BALLS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH, HO-HO! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE SPORT TRUMP STILL LOVES -- "SO PROUD OF NASCAR AND ITS SUPPORTERS AND FANS. THEY WON'T PUT UP WITH DISRESPECTING OUR COUNTRY OR OUR FLAG. THEY SAID IT LOUD AND CLEAR! WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO IS SOME NASCAR OWNERS THREATENED TO FIRE ANY DRIVERS WHO KNEEL DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. I DON'T KNOW WHY NASCAR IS RESPONDING DIFFERENTLY THAN THE N.F.L. MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE AFRICAN AMERICAN DRIVER IN NASCAR. AND I'M SURPRISED HE CAN GET AROUND THE TRACK WITHOUT BEING PULLED OVER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH, MY GOODNESS! WOW! HE'S TRYING TO GET AROUND! WHOO! PULL OVER, SON. I'M SO SORRY.
Stephen: REASONS AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE. SIR, DO YOU KNOW HOW FAST YOU WERE GOING? ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO, WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR TAIL LIGHTS? THEY'RE JUST DECALS FOR MONSTER ENERGY. PLEASE GET OUT OF THE CAR. I KNOW THE DOOR IS WELDED SHUT. PLEASE GET OUT OF THE CAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT, TRUMP'S WAR WITH THE N.F.L. THIS WEEKEND WASN'T HIS ONLY FIGHT WITH BLACK ATHLETES. A WHILE BACK, TRUMP INVITED THE N.B.A. CHAMPIONS GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT WARRIORS SUPERSTAR STEPHEN CURRY WAS HEDGING ON THE INVITATION.
I DON'T WANT TO GO. THAT'S REALLY IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: OF COURSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO. HE'S ALREADY BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE EVEN GOT TO DO COOL SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS, AND THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS A VOLCANO DENIER. WHEN HE HEARD THIS, TRUMP IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED. "GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE IS CONSIDERED A GREAT HONOR FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM. STEPHEN CURRY IS HESITATING, THEREFORE INVITATION IS WITHDRAWN!" "YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO PROM WITH ME? WELL, GUESS WHAT? PROM IS CANCELED BECAUSE IT'S STUPID, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO BEGIN WITH, AND I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING." ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY? HUH-UH. NO, HUH-UH. LOOK. ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT, IN THIS INSTANCE, TRUMP IS MESSING WITH FORCES HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. LEBRON JAMES, WHO TWEETED, "U BUM @STEPHENCURRY30 ALREADY SAID HE AIN'T GOING! SO THEREFORE AIN'T NO INVITE. GOING TO WHITE HOUSE WAS A GREAT HONOR UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP! " OHHHHHHH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OH!
Stephen: OH!
Jon: OH, OH, OH!
Stephen: OH, NO! OH, NO! OH! OH, NO! OH! GOODNESS! I THINK WE HAVE A VISUAL APPROXIMATION OF THAT TWEET. YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT MAYBE THE SICKEST BURN CAME FROM CHICAGO BULLS CENTER ROBIN LOPEZ. "IT'S OK @WARRIORS, IN A FEW MONTHS @REALDONALDTRUMP PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE EITHER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: WOW!
Jon: WHOO!
Stephen: IT'S OFFICIAL. DONALD TRUMP IS NOW GOING TO GET FEWER VISITS FROM BASKETBALL PLAYERS THAN  KIM JONG UN. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. CHANCE THE RAPPER IS GOING TO PERFORM A BRAND NEW, NEVER-BEFORE-HEARD OR RELEASED-SONG FOR US. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, LITTLE ROCKET MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. JON BATISTE AND BAN "STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, SPEAK OF THE BAND, CHANCE THE RAPPER IS GOING TO BE HERE AND HE'S GOING TO DO A NEVER-BEFORE RELEASED NEVER-HEARD ORIGINAL SONG WITH DANIEL CAESAR OUT HERE, AND I HAVE A FEELING THIS AUDIENCE IS REALLY GOING TO LOVE IT.
YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANT TO GIVE OUR AUDIENCE AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS A FRIENDLY AND PATRIOTIC REMINDER THAT EVERYONE IN PUERTO RICO IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO NEEDS OUR HELP JUST AS MUCH AS THE PEOPLE IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: 100% OF THAT ISLAND IS WITHOUT POWER RIGHT NOW. HOSPITALS ARE CLOSE TO COLLAPSING. THEY SAY IT COULD TAKE 30 YEARS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE. COULD TAKE SIX MONTHS TO GET THE POWER BACK ON. SO GO TO COLBERTLATESHOW.COM FOR INFORMATION ON WHERE YOU CAN DONATE. IN LIGHTER NEWS -- WE MAY BE HEADED TO THERMONUCLEAR WAR. IN FACT, TODAY THEIR FOREIGN MINISTER CLAIMED THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES DECLARED WAR AND THAT NORTH KOREA MIGHT START SHOOTING DOWN OUR PLANES. HERE'S HOW WE GOT HERE. ON NOVEMBER 8TH, DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED. TWITTER, TWITTER, TWITTER, FOX AND FRIENDS. SEE, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN EXCHANGING INSULTS WITH NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR AND MAN WHO, I ASSUME, HAD HIS BARBER EXECUTED, KIM JONG UN. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, HE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON, KIM JONG UN. FIRST, TRUMP CALLED KIM "ROCKET MAN," SO THE NORTH KOREAN CALLED OUR PRESIDENT A "DOTARD." HERE'S THE THING -- SENIOR AIDES TO PRESIDENT TRUMP REPEATEDLY WARNED HIM NOT TO DELIVER A PERSONAL ATTACK ON NORTH KOREA'S LEADER. YOU FOOLS! YOU KNOW IF YOU TELL HIM TO DO SOMETHING, HE'S GOING TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL TODDLER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THAT'S WHY THE NUCLEAR BUTTON HAS A CHILD SAFETY CAP. ( LAUGHTER ) AIDES WARNED TRUMP THAT THE C.I.A.'S PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF KIM SAYS HE "HAS A MASSIVE EGO AND REACTS HARSHLY AND SOMETIMES LETHALLY TO INSULTS AND PERCEIVED SLIGHTS." APPARENTLY, THE C.I.A. KNOWS WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE ON SATURDAY NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN MINISTER TOLD THE U.N. THAT TRUMP HAD MADE AN "IRREVERSIBLE MISTAKE, OF MAKING OUR ROCKETS VISITING THE ENTIRE U.S. MAINLAND INEVITABLE." OKAY, KINDA SCARY BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, "INEVITABLE" DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ASK HILLARY CLINTON. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) WHAT? YOU THINK I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) SO, FACED WITH THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR MISSILES AIMED AT THE U.S. MAINLAND BY A MADMAN, DONALD TRUMP TOOK IMMEDIATE STEPS TO DEESCALATE. JUST KIDDING, HE TWEETED: "JUST HEARD FOREIGN MINISTER OF NORTH KOREA SPEAK AT U.N. IF HE ECHOES THOUGHTS OF LITTLE ROCKET MAN, THEY WON'T BE AROUND MUCH LONGER!" FOLKS, THAT IS A SERIOUS INSULT. "LITTLE ROCKET MAN" IS WHAT TRUMP CALLS HISPEEPENIS. WE HAVE A BIG NIGHT AHEAD OF US, "LITTLE ROCKET MAN"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: BACK WITH STERLING BROWN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST JUST WON AN EMMY FOR HIS ROLE IN "THIS IS US" AND HE NOW STARS IN THE FILM "MARSHALL". PLEASE WELCOME STERLING K. BROWN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WHAT?
Stephen: HEY! YOU'RE KILLING IT TONIGHT.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! YOU'RE KILLING IT ALL OVER THE PLACE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
Stephen: BEFORE WE GET INTO ANYTHING ELSE, I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I ADMIRED YOUR PORTRAYAL OF CHRISTOPHER DARDEN IN THE O.J. STORY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT WAS INCREDIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. IT WAS A GREAT TIME.
Stephen: I SAW YOU ON "THIS IS US," I SAID, THAT'S THE SAME GUY.
THE HAIR HELPS, THE LACK OF, AND THE BIG UGLY BEARD.
Stephen: WHAT AN AMAZING BURSTING ON THE SCENE YOU'VE HAD IN YOUR 40s. ARE YOU HAPPY TO HAVE GOTTEN FAMOUS LATER ON IN YOUR CAREER?
I THINK SO. IF YOU GET IT YOUNG, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THE APPRECIATION FOR THE MOMENT THAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
Stephen: "THIS IS US" RETURNS TOMORROW.
THAT'S CORRECT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY. "MARSHALL" IS OPENING OCTOBER 13.
OCTOBER 13.
Stephen: AND YOU JUST WON THE EMMY THIS PAST SUNDAY BEATING KEVIN SPACEY AND ANTHONY HOPKINS. ARE YOU STILL FLOAT AGO LITTLE BIT?
A LITTLE BIT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPANY, WE HAD SEVEN PEOPLE IN OUR CATEGORY, WHICH IS THE MOST OUT OF ANY OF THE ACTING CATEGORIES. TO BE THE KNIGHT, PRETTY COOL. SIR ANTHONY, HANNIBAL LECTOR AND SIR KYESLY WERE IN THE HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ) I NEVER ENVISIONED THIS MOMENT WOULD EVER HAPPEN AND NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING IT JUST FEELS SO SWEET, MAN, IT REALLY DOES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS YOU GAVE A BEAUTIFUL ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BUT DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINISH ALL OF IT BECAUSE YOU GOT PLAYED OFF.
I DID.
Stephen: AND THEN THEY CUT YOUR LIGHT AND YOUR MIC.
THEY DID.
Stephen: AND YOU GOT A CHANCE TO FINISH BACKSTAGE.
I GOT TO FINISH BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: AND PRINTED THE ENTIRE THING.
SURE.
Stephen: I WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M BACKSTAGE WATCHING AND I'M, LIKE, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY HIM OFF, THEY'RE GOING TO LET HIM FINISH THE SPEECH, THEN I SAID THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY HIM OFF, THEN I WENT, WAIT! I'M THE HOST! I'VE GOT TO STOP THIS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WIDE SHOT, THERE'S A LITTLE WHITE GUY COMING ON TO THE STAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT WHEN THEY CUT OFF YOUR MIC AND YOU WALKED AWAY. I'M SORRY FOR NOT GETTING OUT THEIR FASTER BECAUSE --
LISTEN, NOT EVERYONE CAN BE INDUSTRIALMAN WHITE MEN WHO HAVE WON OSCARS IN THE PAST. ( LAUGHTER ) NOT THAT I'M BLAMING HER. IT'S NOT HER FAULT. YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO COMMERCIAL BREAK. I GOT A CHANCE TO MAKE THE SPEECH LONGER BECAUSE I GOT TO FINISH IT BACKSTAGE. IT WAS PERFECT.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL DESERVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: NOW, YOU GOT AN ADORABLE FAMILY RIGHT HERE. TELL ME WHO'S IN THIS PICTURE RIGHT HERE.
THAT IS MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND MY TWO SONS ANDREW AND AMARI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU AND YOUR WIFE, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE BEEN SWEETHEARTS SINCE COLLEGE.
WE HAVE, OFF AND ON. MET FRESHMAN YEAR IN COLLEGE. DATED IN COLLEGE, BROKE UP. DATED IN GRAD SCHOOL, WE BROKE UP. THEN WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE 2004.
Stephen: WOW, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S GREAT. ( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOUR KIDS OR YOUR WIFE, ARE THEY IMPRESSED WITH THE FAME OR ARE THEY, LIKE, WHY AREN'T YOU HOME?
MORE THE LATTER THAN THE FORMER. MY WIFE UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON. MY 6-YEAR-OLD JUST WANTS ME TO BE THERE WITH HIM. HE LIKES TO DO THE BOOTY DANCE WHERE HE DAYSCALLY JUST GETS UP AND SHAKES HIS BOOTY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'LL START MOVING IT AROUND, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE BOOTY DANCE GETS OLD. I NEED FRESH MATERIAL ON A NIGHTLY BASIS. I SAY, ANDREW, LET'S PLAY IT OUT. MY NAME IS STERLING BROWN, I WON AN EMMY, AND I WON ANOTHER TWHUN YEAR AND THAT'S COOL. THIS IS WHAT HE DOES.
Stephen: WOW. GOOD FOR HIM.
AND IT'S FUNNY.
Stephen: YEAH. THEY PLAY THAT CUTE CARD, AS LONG AS IT WORKS, I DON'T GET MAD.
Stephen: THE NEW SEASON "THIS IS US" STARTS TOMORROW.
YES.
Stephen: SHOULD I GO TO COSTCO AND BUY THE KLEENEX IN BULL INCOME.
YOU WILL GET A BIG CLUE AS TO HOW JACK DIED. SO WE FIND THAT OUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE EPISODE, SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING, YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING, AND IT WILL GET FILLED IN THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE SEASON.
Stephen: FALLS INTO AN AUTOMATIC SAUSAGE MACHINE.
BOOM, LIKE FARGO WITH THE WOOD CHIPPER. IT'S REALLY GNARLY.
Stephen: I SAW THAT. YEAH.
Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW. "MARSHALL" IS THE STORY OF THURGOOD MARSHALL.
YES.
Stephen: TAKING AN EARLY CASE EVEN BEFORE BROWN V BOARD OF EDUCATION.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY IS THIS AN IMPORTANT CASE IN THIS GREAT MAN'S LIFE? WHY DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
IT WAS A CASE I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. HE GOES TO BRIDGEPORT CONNECTICUT TO DEFEND A MAN NAMED JOSEPH I PLAY WHO IS I TEMPTED OF THE RAPE AND HOMICIDE OF A WHITE WOMAN BY THE NAME OF ELEANOR STRUBING. YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GUILTY BUT THE HISTORY OF RACE IN THIS COUNTRY IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT. WE HAD EIGHT YEARS OF THINKING WE WERE POST-RACIAL AND NOW UNDER A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND GOING, HMM, MAYBE NOT SO MUCH. MAYBE IT STILL EXISTS AND WE NEED TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR PAST, YOU'RE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT. I HOPE THIS WAKES PEOPLE UP TO WHAT'S GOING ON NOW. LET'S NOT GO BACK TO 1941. IT'S 2017. WE SHOULD BE BETTER.
Stephen: CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S IN THIS CLIP RIGHT HERE? I THINK YOU'RE IN JAIL. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CLIP?
I'M IN JAIL AND JOSEPH IS IN JAIL, AND THURGOOD MARSHALL COMES TO VISIT HIM, LOOKING TO SEE IF HE WANTS COUNSEL BECAUSE THE NAACP IS LOOKING TO DEFEND PEOPLE WHO THEY THINK ARE FALSELY CONFUSED. THIS IS THE CONVERSATION THEY HAVE.
Stephen: JIM. YOU A LAWYER? I AM. THIS IS SAM FREEDMAN, HE'S A LAWYER, TOO.
YOU CAN GO. GOT NO MONEY FOR LAWYERS.
ANYBODY ASK YOU FOR MONEY? DID YOU RAPE THAT WOMAN, JOSEPH?
NO. WHY DOES SHE SAY YOU DID? I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'S SAYING THAT.
SHE SAYS YOU RAPED HER AND TRIED TO KILL HER.
SHE'S LYING. I'M TELLING YOU THIS UP FRONT. THE NAACP ARE NOT LIKE MOST LAWYERS. WE ONLY REPRESENT INNOCENT PEOPLE. PEOPLE ACCUSED BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. THAT'S OUR MISSION. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SO I NEED TO KNOW THIS -- LOOK AT ME NOW -- DID YOU DO WHAT THEY SAID YOU DID?
I NEVER TOUCHED THAT WOMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. "MARSHALL" OPENS OCTOBER 13TH. STERLING K. BROWN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CHANCE THE RAPPER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A BRILLIANT AND TALENTED THREE-TIME GRAMMY WINNER WHO I AM PROUD TO CALL A COLLABORATOR AND FRIEND. PLEASE WELCOME CHANCE THE RAPPER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT, YOU DID A RAP IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR EMMY OPENING NUMBER.
YES.
Stephen: THAT WAS FUN TO WORK ON.
THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING ME. I LIKED IT. IT WAS VERY ORGANIC, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: IT WAS. WE HAD WRITTEN SOME BARS FOR YOU. YOU SHOWED UP AND YOU WENT, OKAY, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO INTERJECT SOME MEANING INTO THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN WE PUT IN STUFF THAT MEANT SOMETHING TO YOU.
YEAH, BROKE IT DOWN PIECE TO PIECE.
Stephen: AT ONE POINT YOU SAID, WHAT DO WHITE PEOPLE CARE ABOUT? ( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE I HAD GOTTEN MY FILL. I LISTED THE THINGS BLACK PEOPLE CARED ABOUT, LET'S HAVE SOME INCLUSION. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE JUST ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT, ACCESS FOR EVERYBODY.
Stephen: EXACTLY. PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE STARTED SOMETHING THAT WANT YOU TO RUN FOR MAYOR OF CHICAGO. DOES POLITICS APPEAL TO YOU?
NOT AT ALL. I LIKE TO MAKE A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO. I DO NOT LIKE POLITICS. I THINK GOVERNMENT, IN A CERTAIN WAY, IS NECESSARY AND IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE A FLUID THING THAT'S CHANGING. POLITICS IS ALWAYS FAST AND IT'S ABOUT POPULARITY AND STRATEGY IN A LOT OF WAYS, WHICH I CAN ADMIRE, BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW -- IT DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME CHANGE THAT, YOU KNOW, LEGISLATION MAKES. SO I TRY NOT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN POLITICS OR ANY, YOU KNOW, ENTERTAINING THINGS, YOU KNOW. I TRY AND, LIKE, KEEP MY EYES FOCUSED ON THE THINGS THAT REALLY AFFECT US SYSTEMICALLY WHICH IS WHERE THE LAW IS. SO TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, I HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S GOING ON POLITICALLY, BUT I TRY NOT TO LET IT PHASE ME BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF, YOU KNOW -- IT'S IN THE AIR ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS FEEL THE SAME WAY, ALL RIGHT!
Stephen: POLITICS IS -- IT'S STICK YMPLETS YEAH.
Stephen: IT CAN GET ON YOU. IT CAN GET ON YOU.
Stephen: IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE IT GETS ON YOU THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE GASOLINE TO GET THE TAR OFF. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU DO BELIEVE IN MAKING CHANGE AND CONTRIBUTING TO OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CREATED A FUND THAT JUST DONATED -- YOU RAISED AND HAVE DONATED $2.12 MILLION TO CHICAGO -- $2.2 MILLION TO CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU CREATED AND WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THIS DONATION?
OKAY, SO SOCIAL WORKS IS THE NONPROFIT I WORK WITH IN CHICAGO, AND WE WORK ON CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND EDUCATION, YOUTH EDUCATION. SO, YEAH, ONE OF OUR INITIATIVES THIS YEAR WAS SUPPORT CPS, AND BASICALLY DUE TO BUDGET IMPASSES AND -- WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT POLITICS, GOING BACK AND FORTH, PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT KEEPING THEIR JOBS AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THEIR CONSTITUENTS BEING HAPPY. THOSE PEOPLE CREATED A BUDGET IMPASSE WHERE ILLINOIS COULDN'T AGREE ON A STATE BUDGET. SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY STOP FUNDING THE IMPORTANT, LIKE, CITY, YOU KNOW, FUNDED AND STATE FUNDED OPERATIONS. ONE OF THEM BEING SCHOOLS. SO OUR SCHOOLS WENT THREE YEARS UNDERFUNDED BEFORE MY NOT-PROFIT AND A LOT OF BRAVE PEOPLE IN CHICAGO AND ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES STEPPED IN AND PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON IT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID, LIKE YOU SAID, WAS RAISE A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR A FUND CALLED THE NEW CHANCE FUND WHICH FUNDS ARTS AND LITERATURE PROGRAMS AND ALL THINGS EDUCATION-WISE FOR DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. I'M SORRY. I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT EXPLAINING IT. THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION.
Stephen: THAT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR.
THE OVERALL POINT IS THAT NATIONALLY, NOT JUST IN CHICAGO, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT WE FUND SCHOOLS AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S EQUITY AND EQUALITY IN OUR KIDS' EDUCATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR FAITH AND THE CHURCH GROWING UP?
DEFINITELY.
Stephen: YOU SAID THAT SINGING IS PRAYING TWICE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO PRAY, AND WHEN YOU WORSHIP IN SONG, THERE'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW, THIS -- YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT WITH MUCH MORE FERVOR, OR AT LEAST I AM. I THINK I THOUGHT I SOUNDED POETIC WHEN I SAID IT. NOW WHEN YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IT, IT'S, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: TO ME THE WORDS HAVE THEIR OWN MEANING BUT THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR HEART COMES THROUGH IN THE SOUND IN THE WAY THE WORDS CAN'T CAPTURE, THE SAME WAY THE PARABLES OF CHRIST TELL A STORY THAT CANNOT BE TOLD IN ANY OTHER WAY, THE SOUND OF THE SONG SPEAKS IN WORDS THAT WE CAN'T REACH. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT TO ME.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE FRIENDS. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU STILL GO TO CHURCH?
I STILL GO TO CHURCH.
Stephen: IS YOUR GRORPTER STILL WITH US?
YES, MY GRANDMOTHER IS STILL WITH US. SHE CALLS ME A LOT AND I ALWAYS TRY TO PICK UP AND HAVE A FUN CONVERSATION. BUT, YEAH, WE STILL GO TO CHURCH.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE HYMN YOU SING WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH THAT YOU WANT THE WANT THE TO TRANSFORM AND PUT A BEAT TO?
YEAH, MY FAVORITE HYMN IS NEWS THE DAY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE. ♪ THIS IS THE DAY ♪
Stephen: THE LORD HAS MADE. THIS IS THE DAY THAT THE LORD HAS MADE.
Stephen: YEAH. ♪ THIS IS THE DAY ♪ ♪ THIS IS THE DAY ♪ ♪ THAT THE LORD HAS MADE ♪ ♪ I WILL REJOICE, REJOICE ♪ ♪ AND BE GLAD IN IT ♪ THAT'S MY ARRANGEMENT OF IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE DOING A NEW SONG FOR US TONIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: A SONG NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD BEFORE OTHER THAN YOU AND YOUR BAND AND YOUR COLLABORATOR DANIEL CAESAR.
YES.
Stephen: AND WHAT'S THE SONG? WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
SO, BASICALLY, YOU KNOW THIS, I FEEL LIKE WE CAN JUST SAY THIS ON TV, SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO COME AND PERFORM AND I WAS GOING TO DO GROWN-ASS KID, AND THEN I CALLED YOU ON SATURDAY AND SAID I CAN'TO DO GROWN-ASS KID ANYMORE FOR REASONS I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT. BASICALLY, WE HAD TO COME UP WITH A SONG IN A MATTER OF DAYS AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FRESH. I HAVE BEEN IN THE STUDIO A LOT LATELY, I HAVE BEEN COOKING UP SOME YAMMERS LIKE THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE HONESTLY GREAT. I PREMIERED ANGELS. I DID THAT HERE. I THOUGHT, WHY NOT DO A NEW SONG GROWR GUYS HERE TONIGHT.
Stephen: YOU WROTE THIS -- TWO DAYS AGO.
Stephen: WE'RE HONORED. LOVE YOU, THANK YOU AGAIN, MAN.
