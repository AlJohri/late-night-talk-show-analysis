MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WE JUST MADE CONTACT WITH AN ALIEN.
I SEE. IS THIS ALIEN A LADY?
UH, IT'S HARD TO TELL, SIR. IT'S AN ALIEN. I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE GENITALS ARE OR HOW IT REPRODUCES.
YOU KNOW, AS I STATED BEFORE, I WON'T BE ALONE WITH A WOMAN WITHOUT MY WIFE PRESENT, SO LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT.
I KNOW, SIR, BUT THIS COULD CHANGE THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY.
OKAY. DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S WEARING A SKIRT OR FANCY SHOES?
UH, IT'S HARD TO TELL, MR. VICE PRESIDENT.
WOULD IT RATHER WATCH FOOTBALL OR "GILMORE GIRLS?"
CAN'T REALLY TELL.
THIS ALIEN, IF IT WAS GOING TO A PARTY, WOULD IT TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET READY?"
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES RICHARD GERE. MARIA BAMFORD. AND MUSICAL GUEST "PERFUME GENIUS." FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S GOING ON?
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW."
Audience: I LOVE YOU, STEPHEN!
Stephen: I LOVE YOU, TOO. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY NICE. HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY, EVERYBODY. FIRST OF ALL, HAPPY FRIDAY. THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD FEELING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS TRADITIONAL, THE WHITE HOUSE THREW A PARTY THIS YEAR HOSTED BY VICE PRESIDENT AND MAN WHO THINKS TOOTHPASTE IS TOO SPICY, MIKE PENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE THING, HERE'S THE THING-- THEY ACTUALLY THREW THE PARTY YESTERDAY. WHICH ISN'T CINCO DE MAYO. IT'S ACTUALLY "CUATRO" DE MAYO. SO FOR ONCE, MIKE PENCE WAS A DAY AHEAD INSTEAD OF ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WHILE THE PARTY IS USUALLY A BIG DEAL, THIS YEAR'S FIESTA HAD A REDUCED GUEST LIST. WHICH MAKES SENSE. TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT TRYING TO REDUCE OUR COUNTRY'S MEXICAN GUEST LIST. ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO, THE EVENT WASN'T ACTUALLY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY HELD IT IN THE NEARBY EISENHOWER BUILDING'S INDIAN TREATY ROOM. FREE PARTY PLANNING ADVICE: IF YOU'RE CELEBRATING ANOTHER CULTURE, MAYBE DON'T REMIND THEM WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAST ETHNIC GROUP WE THREW A PARTY FOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon: OH. IT'S HISTORY. IT'S HISTORY.
Stephen: AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN 16 YEARS THAT THE CINCO DE MAYO PARTY WASN'T HOSTED BY THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. THOUGH HE DID SEND ALONG A CAKE: "HASTA LA VISTA, BAD HOMBRES!" AS I'M SURE YOU HEARD YESTERDAY, THE HOUSE PASSED TRUMPCARE BY A MARGIN OF ONE VOTE, AND FOR ONCE, THE PEOPLE WITH MORE VOTES WON. THE REPUBLICANS CELEBRATED ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT WITH A BIG PARTY, BIG PARTY, WHERE, APPARENTLY, CASES UPON CASES OF BEER WERE ROLLED INTO CAPITAL. BUT TODAY, THE PARTY'S OVER. AND REPUBLICANS ARE DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT OF WHAT THEY DID. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE.
THEY THOUGHT THEY PASSED THE HEALTH CARE BILL.
WOOO! ROAD TRIP!
BUT THEY'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT, REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE ISN'T SO EASY. KEVIN McCARTHY.
OH, MY GOD!
PAUL RYAN. AND DONALD TRUMP. IN "THE HEALTHCARE HANGOVER." HOPEFULLY, NOT COMING THIS SUMMER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen, OF COURSE, THAT-- YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. , OF COURSE, WE KID. WE KID. THAT FOOTAGE IS FROM "THE HANGOVER," WHICH IS ALSO ABOUT A GROUP OF WHITE MEN WHO HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO CARE FOR BABIES. NOW, EVEN THOUGH THE POLLS AREN'T OUT YET, EVERYONE IS SAYING THAT THIS BILL IS LIKELY TO BE UNPOPULAR. COINCIDENTALLY, LIKELY TO BE UNPOPULAR WAS ALSO WHAT SEAN SPICER WAS VOTED IN HIGH SCHOOL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I GET, I TOTALLY GET WHY PEOPLE ARE UPSET. HERE'S THE DEAL-- THE NEW BILL "ALLOWS INSURERS TO CHARGE OLDER CUSTOMERS FIVE TIMES AS MUCH AS YOUNGER ONES." AND IT REPEALS THE EMPLOYER MANDATE WHICH "REQUIRES LARGER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE INSURANCE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES." BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. NO, NO, NO, DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT BROKEN ARM. YOU CAN FIX IT WITH A CAST MADE OUT OF STOLEN PENS FROM THE SUPPLY CLOSET. THE PLAN ALWAYS ALLOWS STATES TO OPT OUT OF COVERING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, WHICH ALSO ALLOWS VOTERS TO OPT OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN 2018 BECAUSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE TODAY THE NONPARTISAN COOK POLITICAL REPORT MOVED 20 HOUSE SEATS IN THE DEMS' FAVOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. MAN, I FEEL-- I FEEL-- I FEEL SORRY FOR THE REPUBLICANS. THEY MIGHT BE OUT OF A JOB SOON. THEN THEY'LL NEVER GET HEALTH CARE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW THE REPUBLICANS RISKED THEIR CAREERS FOR A BILL THAT I'M SURE THEY FULLY UNDERSTOOD.
DID YOU ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND READ THE ENTIRE BILL PLUS ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS?
I WILL FULLY ADMIT, WOLF, I DID NOT, BUT I CAN ALSO ASSURE YOU, MY STAFF DID.
HAVE YOU READ THE WHOLE BILL?
OH, GOSH. LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY-- PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE HAVE READ ALL THE PARTS OF THE BILL.
Stephen: OH, GOSH, GEE WIL CERS. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE WHO READ PARTS OF THE BILL. SUSAN HANDLED THE NOUNS. ALAN TOOK THE VERBS, DEVON MANAGED ALL THE PREPOSITIONS. BARBARA SAYS THE BILL IS GREAT BUT THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE ADJECTIVES. UH-HUH. SO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE ALSO SAID IT WAS SLIPPERY AND FURRY AND HASTY. OF COURSE, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT POPULAR, IT WAS A BIG VICTORY FOR THE PRESIDENT. AND AFTER IT PASSED, PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT TO NEW YORK TO MEET THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER AND PRAISE CRECIALG REPUBLICANS.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE VERY UNITED. YOU SEE THAT TODAY. THE REPUBLICANS CAME TOGETHER ALL OF A SUDDEN, TWO DAYS AGO, AND IT WAS LIKE MAGIC.
Stephen: MAGIC, BY THE WAY-- NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE'S BEST OPTION FOR MEDICAL CARE. "I WILL NOW PULL YOUR APPENDIX OUT OF THIS HAT." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, QUICK REMINDER FOR EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO DOESN'T REMEMBER-- AUSTRALIA HAS UNIVERSAL, GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE. SO IT CREATED A BIT OF A STIR WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS:
IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC HERE. RIGHT NOW, OBAMACARE IS FAILING. WE HAVE A FAILING HEALTH CARE-- I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS TO OUR AGREEMENT GENTLEMAN AND MY FRIEND FROM AUSTRALIA BECAUSE YOU HAVE BETTER HEALTH CARE THAN WE DO.
Stephen: "I LOVE IT. IT'S TREMENDOUS. THEY'VE GOT CO KOALA NURSES. INSTEAD OF AN AMBULANCE, YOU HOP INTO A KANGAROO'S POUCH, OFF TO THE HOSPITAL. HOPPITYY-HOPPITIY. CHOPPITYY-CHOPPITY ( APPLAUSE ) TOILETS GO THE OTHER WAY. IT'S MAGICAL. ( LAUGHTER ) "AFTER THE SURGERY, BLOOMIN' 'ONION. IT'S FANTASTIC." THAT'S NOT A SCALPEL, THIS IS A SCALPEL. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WAS WATCH, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AND EVERY MEMBER OF STEELY DAN COMBINED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BERNIE SANDERS. AND SENATOR SANDERS HAD THIS RESPONSE.
YOU HAVE BETTER HEALTH CARE THAN WE DO.
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD--
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, CHRIS. ALL RIGHT, THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST SAID IT. THAT'S GREAT.
Stephen: WOW. I HAVEN'T SEEN BERNIE SANDERS LAUGH THAT HARD SINCE HIS DAYS ON "THE MUPPET" SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE MISS YOU, WALDORF. OF COURSE, TRUMP'S HEARD THE CRITICISMS, AND HE DEFENDED THE PLAN ON TWITTER BY SAYING IT'S NOT REALLY THE PLAN. "BIG WIN IN THE HOUSE. VERY EXCITING. BUT WHEN EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER WITH THE INCLUSION OF PHASE 2, WE WILL HAVE TRULY GREAT HEALTH CARE." OH, GREAT, PHASE 2. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS PHASE 2? THERE'S NOTHING OMINOUS ABOUT SAYING TO A PATIENT, "WE'VE REVIEWED YOUR MEDICAL PROFILE, MR. JONES. AND YOU'RE READY FOR PHASE 2. PLEASE PUT ON THE HEALING MASK AND STEP INTO THE HEALTH BOOTH. NOW, GOOD, YES, I'LL JUST PUSH THIS RED BUTTON TO INITIATE... PHASE 3!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOST IN THE SHUFFLE OF THE TRUMPCARE VOTE YESTERDAY WAS A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT BY DONALD HIMSELF.
I AM PROUD TO MAKE A MAJOR AND HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT THIS MORNING, AND TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT MY FIRST FOREIGN TRIP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
TO SAUDI ARABIA, AND THEN ROME.
Stephen: IT'S TRULY A HISTORIC TRIP SINCE NONE OF THOSE PLACES IS MAR-A-LAGO. AND BY MAKING SAUDI ARABIA AND ISRAEL HIS FIRST STOPS, TRUMP IS CLEARLY FOCUSING ON CONFLICTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, SOMETHING HE DISCUSSED WITH PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY PRESIDENT, MAHMOUD ABBAS.
IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO HAVE PRESIDENT ABBAS WITH US. WE'LL BE HAVING LUNCH TOGETHER. WE WILL BE DISCUSSING DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS, AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS MAYBE NOT AS DIFFICULT AS PEOPLE THOUGHT OVER THE YEARS. >
Stephen: YEAH, MIDDLE EAST PEACE, NOT THAT DIFFICULT. I'M SURE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF IDEAS. HAVE THEY TRIED BUILDING A WALL? THEY HAVE, OKAY, I'M OUT OF IDEAS. IT'S HOPELESS. NOT THAT HARD. NOT THAT HARD. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. RICHARD GERE IS HERE. WHEN WE RETURN, WE WILL RUN OFF AND JOIN THE CIRCUS. STICK AROUND. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON! THAT WAS LOVELY. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. LISTEN, FOLKS, FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, PLEASE JOIN US NEXT TUESDAY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN AMAZING SHOW. IN THE SAME SHOW WE'RE HAVING ALL MY OLD BUDDIES FROM THE OLD HAUNT. JON STEWART, JOHN OLIVER, SAMANTHA BEE, AND ROB CORDDRY, ALL TOGETHER. IT'S GOING TO BE EXTRAORDINARY. YOU KNOW, JON, WE HAD THE GORILLAZS ON LAST WEEK.
Jon: YOU'RE TIGHT.
Stephen: LISTEN, I GOT PRETTY EXCITED. THEY WERE SHOOTING A LITTLE DOCUMENTARY HERE ABOUT THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE SHOW. THEY DID EXTRA SONGS THAT WE DIDN'T BROADCAST THAT NIGHT. YOU CAN GET THOSE ON OUR WEBSITE: colbertlateshow.com. AND I'M WITH THE BAND DOING "FEEL GOOD INC. IT'S A FUN JOB. NOW, ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS THEATER IS UNDERNEATH THE STAGE THERE ARE THINGS CALLED "ELEPHANT COLUMNS." WHEN RINGLING WOULD COME TO TOWN,  ED SULLIVAN USED TO HAVE ELEPHANTS, AND THEY NEEDED EXTRA SUPPORT. NOW, THE THING IS, RINGLING DOESN'T HAVE ELEPHANTS ANYMORE, AND SOON WE WON'T HAVE RINGLING, BECAUSE ON MAY 21 OF THIS YEAR, IT'S OFFICIALLY SHUTTING DOWN AFTER 146 YEARS, WHICH MAKES IT THE SECOND LONGEST-RUNNING SHOW IN HISTORY, RIGHT AFTER "JERSEY BOYS." THEY PLAYED AT LINKOP'S SECOND INAUGURAL. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BEFORE THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS, THERE WAS SOMETHING I WANTED FROM THEM. JIM?
AFTER 146 YEARS OF ENTERTAINMENT, RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM&BAILEY CIRCUS IS FOLDING UP THEIR TENTS. THAT MEANS THE LATEST SHOW ON EARTH TAGLINE IS UP FOR GRABS, AND I HAVE TO HAVE IT. SO I WENT TO THE CIRCUS TO MEANTIME THE PERFORMERS TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT MAKES THEM SO GREAT. ♪ ♪ ♪

Stephen: AND EVENTUALLY, I ASSUME, THE SLIDE IS HOOKED RIGHT UP TO THE LION'S MOUTH.
NO, WE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
Stephen: NO? NO?
NO.
Stephen: I WANT THE TITLE OF "GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH" FOR "THE LATE SHOW"." I NEED TO GET ADVICE FROM YOU ON HOW TO MAKE THE SHOW AS GREAT AS POSSIBLE.
FIRST OFF, YOU NEED DOGS.
Stephen: BYE! I KNOW WHEN I'M NOT WANTED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU TRAIN A DOG AND A PIG DIFFERENTLY?
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. THEY ALL WORK FOR REWARD-BASED TREATS.
Stephen: AS DO I. AS DO I. IF I NEED A PIG AROUND THE OFFICE--
YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM?
Stephen: WELL, I WANT TO BE THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.
HE COULD BE YOUR PERSONAL SERVICE ANIMAL.
I COULD GET ONE OF THOSE VESTS?
YES, AND TAKE HIM ON THE AIRPLANE.
Stephen: AND THEY HAVE TO LET ME BRING HIM INTO STARBUCKS.
I AM THE LION TIGER TRAINER.
Stephen: HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO BE HANDSOME WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH LIONS AND TIGERS.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S PART OF THE JOB CRITERIA BUT THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT.
Stephen: YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME MAN.
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH TO TRAIN VELOC RAPTORS.
CHEST OUT. READY? THERE YOU GO. PERFECT. STAND TALL! THAT DIDN'T QUITE CUT IT, BUT WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT.
Stephen: THIS IS NICE BUT THEN... I WANT THE TITLE OF "GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH." WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE?

PROMISE.
Stephen: OPEN THE BALL! LET ME OUT OF THE BALL! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WAS THIS A UNICYCLE TEAM THAT LEARNED HOW TO PLAY BASKETBALL OR A BASKETBALL TEAM THAT LEARNED HOW TO UNICYCLE?
WELL, ACTUALLY IT WAS A WAY OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR US. IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD THERE WAS A GUY NAMED JERRY KING WHO ACTUALLY TAUGHT HIS SON HOW TO RIDE A UNICYCLE. AND EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE BRONX LEARNED HOW TO RIDE IT. IT WAS JUST THE WAY-- IT HELPED US GET OUT OF NEW YORK.
Stephen: THAT'S A CLASSIC STORY.
YES.
Stephen: PEOPLE LOOK AT THE UNICYCLE AND SAY, "THAT'S MY TICKET OUT OF HERE."
YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: WERE THERE OTHER AMERICANS IN THE SHOW?
NO, I WAS THE ONLY ONE, AND I HAD BEEN DOING IT-- WHY ARE YOU TAKING ME BACK THIS FAR? I WAS THE-- I WAS DOING-- IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID IN NEW YORK. AND I STARTED OUT AS AN UNDERSTUDY, AND I WAS COVERING FIVE GUYS. AND, YOU KNOW, EVERY NIGHT ONE OF THE GUYS DIDN'T SHOW UP OR THERE WAS A PROBLEM OR SOMETHING. AND I WAS DOING ALL THE PARTS. AND THEN WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DO IT IN LONDON, THEY ASKED FIWOULD COME AND LEAD. AND PLAY DANNY, AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY. IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
Stephen: WHAT WAS LONDON LIKE FOR YOU? HOW OLD WERE YOU AT THAT POINT?
22.
Stephen: 22-YEAR-OLD GUY IN LONDON UHAVE A JOB. WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH YOUR TIME?
I-- ( LAUGHTER ) I'M THINKING WHAT CAN I ACTUALLY TELL HERE? THE 22-YEAR-OLD GUY. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO REMEMBER, THOUGH, WE WERE DOING PREVIEWS IN CHERCHESTER BEFORE WE CAME TO THE WEST END, AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD ANY MONEY, FRANKLY. I HAD SOME PER DIEM MONEY, AND THE TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE FACTORY IS IN CHICHESTER AND I WENT IN WITH MY PER DIEM MONEY, PUT IT DOWN, AND DROVE OUT WITH A TRIUMPH 650.
Audience: YEAH!
RIGHT THERE! WHAT DID YOU HAVE? WHAT DID YOU HAVE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TRIUMPH PEOPLE. TRIUMPH.
Stephen: THAT LEATHER JACKET, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A HOT LOOK TOO LONG AROUND LONDON. DO YOU HAVE STILL HAVE THE BIKE?
NO, I TOTALED THE BIKE, TOTALLEDLY THE BIKE.
Stephen: TOTALED THE BIKE? ARE YOU OKAY?
ON THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY. YOU KNOW WHERE-- IT WAS ALL STONE THEN. IT WAS --
Stephen: IT WAS ALL COBBLE STONE AND SLATE AND THERE WAS NO WORKING LIGHTS AT THAT POINT.
THIS WAS BEFORE ELECTRICITY, YEAH. AND IT WAS RAINING AND I SLIPPED. I MEAN, YOU'RE A BIKE GUY, RIGHT?
Audience: YEAH!
THEY DO A LITTLE DRINKING HERE, ALSO.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME IF I'M A BIKE GUY? I'M RIGHT HERE. I'M A BIKE GUY.
YOU'RE NOT A BIKE GUY! THAT'S A BIKE GUY, COME ON!
Stephen: I HAD A MINIBIKE WHEN I WAS A CHILD, A 1.5 HORSEPOWER MINIBIKE AS A CHILD. I WAS EVEL KNEIVEL.

BECAUSE I DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH, THAT'S WHY.
Stephen: I'LL SWEETEN THE POT ON THE BACK END. I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE IN THE DISTRIBUTION. WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING OF A RICHARD GERESPP ISANCEGOING ON. YOU HAVE TWO MOVIES, "NORMAN," AND "THE DINNER." THIS WEEKEND.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I'LL GO SEE IT. I'M GOING TO GO SEE IT.
IT'S COMING OUT THIS WEEKEND.
Stephen: YOU PLAY THE FATHERAVE TEENAGED SON, AND STEVE COOGIN HE PLAYS YOUR BROTHER.
YES.
Stephen: HAVE TWO TEENAGED SONS AND I WANT TO SET UP THIS CLIP. WHAT YOU CAN TELL US? HOW MUCH YOU CAN GIVE AWAY HERE?
WELL, THIS IS, IT'S CALLED "THE DINNER." AND THE CENTRAL THEME OF THE MOVIE IS THESE TWO COUPLES ARE MEETING TO HAVE A DINNER. AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY. AND THEY'RE KIND OF RED HERRINGS ARE PUT OUT ABOUT WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS DINNER. BUT IN FACT, OUR TEENAGED SONSZ HAVE DONE SOMETHING HORRIFIC, AND WE'RE GOG HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. SO I HAVE KIND OF-- I'M A CONGRESSMAN, AND I HAVE DECIDED THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS TONIGHT. SO THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF IT.

NOT TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO TALK TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK THIS IS ALL SITTING AT A DINNER TABLE.
Stephen: IT'S NOT ALL SITTING AT A DINNER TABLE?
THERE ARE FLASHBACKS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS GOING ON. BUT IT KIND OF FOLLOWS A MEAL, SITTING DOWN, THE HORS D'OEUVRES COME, THE APPETITERS COME, DIFFERENT COURSES, AND WITHIN IT THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL MOVEMENT OF THE NARRATIVE.
Stephen: WILL I BE HUNGRY BY THE TIME THE MOVIE IS OVER.
YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY HUNGRY.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. "NORMAN" IS OUT IN THEATERS, AND "THE DINNER" OPENS TODAY. RICHARD GERE, EVERYBODY! EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU'VE SEEN MY NEXT GUEST ON "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT" "LOUIE" AND HER OWN SHOW "LADY DYNAMITE." PLEASE WELCOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIAN favorite comedian Favorite comedian S, MARIA BAMFORD.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. AS I WAS SAYING TO THE PEOPLE HERE, YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIANS. NO MATTER WHAT MOOD I'M IN I CAN LISTEN TO ANY ONE OF YOUR ALBUMS.
THAT'S VERY KIND.
Stephen: I JUST LOVE-- I LOVE-- I LOVE HOW CONFESSIONAL YOUR WORK IS.
I SAY TOO MUCH.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FOR SOME. NOT FOR ME. BRING IT ON.
THAT'S RIGHT WHY NOT? WHY NOT TALK ABOUT IT?
Stephen: YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR PARENTS A LOT. HOW ARE YOUR MOM AND DAD?
THEY'RE VERY GOOD. I READ IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THAT YOU CAN ASK 36 QUESTIONS TO GET SOMEBODY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU. AND I THOUGHT, "WHY NOT ASK MY PARENTS SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS?" SOMETIMES THEY'RE ON THE FENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I ASKED MY FATHER, I SAID-- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS, "WHAT PERSON LIVING OR DEAD WOULD YOU WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH?" AND HE SAID ( CLEARING CLOSE ) WHAT? SHE WAS A VERY SIXY LADY FROM HISTORY. "WHO DID YOU SAY?" "DAD, I SAID YOU." I ASKED MY MOM WHO SHE WOULD WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH. AND SHE SAID JOHN F. KENNEDY. AND SHE LOVES YOU, STEPHEN. OH, STEPHEN. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. MY MOM WANTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE.
HE'S LIKE STRAWBERRY JAM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOE RED, LUMPY?
NO, DELICIOUS!
Stephen: YOU'RE MARRIED ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE. YOU WERE FAIRLY NEW TO MARRIAGE.
YEAH!
Stephen: GOT ONE. DO YOU ENJOY IT? I LOVE BEING MARRIED. I'M 24 YEARS MARRIED NOW. AND IT'S-- SAME LADY. ( LAUGHTER ) ARE YOU-- ARE YOU DIGGING IT?
IN A ROW. YES. I-- IT'S DELIGHTFUL. IT IS-- I DIDN'T KNOW-- I GENERALLY AM NOT VERY GOOD AT RELATIONSHIPS. I HAVE A HARD TIME. I JUST NEEDED TO FIND A WAY TO SHOW PEOPLE HOW MUCH I LOVE THEM, DESPITE ALL MY WORDS AND ACTION. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MY HUSBAND GOT TOGETHER --
Stephen: HIS NAME IS.
SCOTT CASSIDY. AND HE'S A PAINTER. HELLO, BOO-BOO. ONE THING I LEARNED ABOUT LOVE IS SOMETHING-- THEY TELL YOU-- I DIDN'T REALIZE-- SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY YOU MIGHT BE IRRITATED BY THEM. AND I READ IN SOME OF MY SELF-HELP LITERATURE THAT WHAT YOU DO IS YOU EMBRACE IT, EMBRACE THAT WHICH DISGUSTS YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MY HUSBAND DOES A REPETITIVE SINGING THING. WHERE HE CHANGES EVERY SONG TO THE WORDS "TURKEY LEG, CHICKEN LEG." ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ANY SONG?
ANY SONG. ♪ TURK ON THE CHICK LEG TURK, TURK, CHICK.  ♪ TURK, TIRK CHICK LEG ♪ TURK, TURK, CHICK LEG ♪
Stephen: "SMOKE ON THE WATER,."
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T COST YOU ANYTHING.
Stephen: WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT SO HOW DO YOU EMBRACE THAT?
THEN I I JUST START DOING THE SAME THING. AND NOW I DO IT SO MUCH MORE THAN HE DOES, HE HAS TO SAY, "STOP. COME ON." SO-- AND IT STARTED TO-- I REALLY ENJOY DOING IT. IT IS FUN TO --
Stephen: YOU'RE CHALLENGING HIM NOW? HE HAS TO EMBRACE YOUR EMBRACE OF HIM?
I HOPE-- I THINK IT DOES-- LIKE SEEING WHY SOMEONE ENJOYS SOMETHING AND SAY, "WHAT IF I--" I COULD ENJOY IT RATHER THAN BE AFRAID OF IT.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING INTO THE SECOND SEASON OF "LADY DYNAMITE" RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE WERE TALKING WITH RICHARD GEAR EARLIER THAT HE WAS DANNY ZUCCO. DO YOU REMEMBER AN EARLY JOB IN SHOW BUSINESS JIEFS A "STAR TREK" CHARACTER IN A TOURING SHOW WHERE WE MOSTLY DID MALL OPENINGS IN THE SOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I SAID THINGS LIKE,"GREETINGS. I'M FROM THE PLANET BAJOR." "GET THE "F" AWAY FROM ME." ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT A NEW NETFLIX SPECIAL CALLED "OLD BABY."
YES.
Stephen: WHERE DID THE TITLE COME FROM?
I WAS MISTAKENLY ASKED TO SPEAK TO SOME HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. NONE OF US KNEW WHY I WAS THERE. IT WAS VERY CONFUSING.
Stephen:  LIKE, "PLEASE COME IN AND SPEAK TO THEM? IS IT.
YES. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT THAT THEY MIGHT BE THINKING IS, "OH, SHE'S LIKE-- SHE'S OLD, BUT THEN SHE'S, LIKE, GOT A BABY VOICE. HE'S LIKE AN OLD BABY, AND SHE'S ALL SHAKY. HOW COULD SHE EVEN HAVE A JOB?" ( LAUGHTER ) FAIR POINT.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
FAIR POINT. NO, IT WAS A VERY-- VERY ODD. IT WAS FOR CAREER DAY. I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE-- IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ONE OF MY HEAD SHOTS FROM 1999 AND TOSS THOSE OUT AS YOU LEAVE THE ROOM. I HOPE THAT-- NO, I FELT BAD ABOUT TRYING TO TEACH THE KIDS-- KIDS ARE SO SMART THEMSELVES. THEY-- THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT, RIGHT? LOUVRE LAUGH.
Stephen: WELL, I'VE NEVER DONE A COMEDY SPECIAL. LIKE, HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU PREPARE FOR IT? OB, YOU GO TO CLUBS, BUT BEFORE YOU EVEN GO TO THE CLUBS, WHERE DO YOU TEST OUT YOUR MATERIAL? WHAT ARE YOUR GUINEA PIGS?
WELL, I REHEARSE IT, OF COURSE, TO ALL MY LOVED ONES, UNTIL THEY GROW TIRED OF IT. AND THEN I BEGIN PAYING THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN-- THEN I STARTED TO TWITTER JUST OUT TO PEOPLE, "HEY, IF YOU'RE FREE FROM 4:00 P.M. TO 5:00 P.M., AND YOU CAN GO TO THIS COFFEE SHOP--" I WOULDN'T SAY THE COFFEE SHOP. I WOULD CONTACT THEM LATER ON TWITTER. AND I'LL PERFORM MY HOUR FOR YOU AND JUST FOR YOU.
