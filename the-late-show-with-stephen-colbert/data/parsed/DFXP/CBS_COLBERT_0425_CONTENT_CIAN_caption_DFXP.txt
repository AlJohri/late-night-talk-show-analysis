Announcer: AND NOW "THE LATE SHOW" EXCLUSIVE. STEPHEN COLBERT'S INTERVIEW OF SEAN HANNITY'S INTERVIEW OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME TWICE IN ONE WEEK. VERY GENEROUS OF YOUR TIME.
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE ON YOUR SHOW.
IT MUST BE. BEFORE WE START, IS IT OKAY IF I MANIPULATE THIS FOOTAGE TO MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT? YOU RECENTLY CHALLENGED SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON TO AN I.Q.-OFF. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR I.Q. IS?
I THINK IT'S HIGHER THAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.
CAN YOU GIVE ME A NUMBER? 8. THAT'S HIGHER THAN I UNDERSTAND. ( LAUGHTER ) SWITCH GEARS. HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS IN THE NEWS, TROUBLING ACCUSATIONS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT SITUATION?
IT WAS VERY SAD WHEN I SAW THIS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER ENGAGED IN ANY FORMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
25 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, 5 YEARS AGO.
Stephen: ANY OTHER TIME? TOMORROW. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WAS THERE ANY PERIOD WHERE YOU TREATED WOMEN RESPECTFULLY?
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR YEARS.
Stephen: NOW, SIR, YOU WON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. WHICH STATES DO YOU THINK CLINCHED THE ELECTION FOR YOU?
I COULD NAME MANY STATES. I COULD PROBABLY NAME THREE-QUARTERS OF THEM.
Stephen: CAN YOU NAME A STATE NOW?
RUSSIA.
Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT'S A "GOT CHA" QUESTION. LET'S MOVE ON. WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES. BEFORE WE GO, I WOULD LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING. CAN WE SPEAK HONESTLY ABILITY OUR FEELINGS TOWARD EACH OTHER?
YOU HAVE BEEN SO GREATERS AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU AND, YOU KNOW I'M A RATINGS PERSON. YOU NOTICE. HAS ANYONE SEEN HIS RATINGS? WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO YOUR COMPETITION IS INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. NUMBER ONE AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU. LET ME RETURN THE COMPLIMENT BY SAYING I THINK YOU'RE A BLOATED NARCISSIST WHOSE PRESIDENCY IS A KNIFE IN THE MORAL HEART OF AMERICA, A WOUND OPEN OUR NATIONAL SOUL THAT WILL TAKE GENERATIONS TO HEAL IF EVER.
A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY.
Stephen: EXACTLY. MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU.
ANNOUNCER: IT'S THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT -- TRUMP'S HEALTH CARE HEALTH SCARE. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES: BILL MURRAY. CLAIRE FOY. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY BILL MURRAY WITH JAN VOGLER AND FRIENDS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: THANKS, FOLKS! OH, THANK YOU ONE AND ALL! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT OF BUSY TOWN. THIS MORNING, HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO GET RID OF SOME KEY PROVISIONS OF OBAMACARE. FOR INSTANCE, THE CARE PART. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP MADE A BIG SHOW OF IT -- IT WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, GATHERED THE MEDIA, BRAGGED , GOT CABINET IN, BRAGGED ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WAS GOING TO BE. THEN CAME THE BIG MOMENT, THE SIGNING.
WE WILL HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE IN OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I'M ONLY SIGNING IT BECAUSE IT COSTS NOTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: HE FORGOT TO SIGN THE ORDER! ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S TROUBLING. THAT IS TROUBLING. AT THE SIGNING, HE FORGOT TO DO THE SIGNING. BUT, ON THE PLUS SIDE, LET'S HOPE HE FORGETS THE LAUNCH CODES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'VE ALREADY LAUNCHED THEM, SIR. THE MISSILES ARE GONE. GO TO SLEEP. ( PIANO RIFF ) AND LAST NIGHT, TRUMP HELD A RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA PROMOTING HIS NEW TAX PLAN IN FRONT OF A GROUP OF TRUCKERS. NOW, TAX REFORM CAN BE COMPLICATED, SO TRUMP SUMMED IT UP IN TWO SIMPLE WORDS.
THIS HUGE TAX CUT... TWO WORDS -- ( APPLAUSE ) TWO WORDS, HUGE AND ROCKET. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? ROCKET. YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, FOLKS.
STEPHEN: NO! ( LAUGHTER ) NO, WE DON'T. YOU JUST PUT TWO RANDOM WORDS TOGETHER. "TWO WORDS TO DESCRIBE MY PLAN FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE, WALLET AND BANANA. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BANANA. AM I RIGHT? YES, I AM. WHY? BECAUSE WALLET." I STILL DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT HE MEANS BUT HE ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN... SORT OF.
TO SUMMARIZE, OUR PLAN GOES FROM EIGHT TAX BRACKETS DOWN TO FOUR. CUTS THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM MUCH MORE AND EQUAL TO 35% TAX AND BRINGS IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 20% AND CUTS TAX RATES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 80 YEARS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: YES, HE'S TAKING OUR TAX PLAN BACK MORE THAN 80 YEARS, TO THE 1930S. THE ERA THAT WILL FOREVER BE KNOWN AS THE GREAT HAPPINESS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) JUST LOOK AT THIS DUSTBOWL MOTHER'S RADIANT SMILE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE PRESIDENT CAME DOWN HARD ON THE TAX THAT TRUCKERS HATE THE MOST, THE ONE THAT ONLY APPLIES TO DYING MILLIONAIRES.
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THOUSANDS OF FAMILY BUSINESSES BY ENDING THE CRUSHING, HORRIBLE AND UNFAIR ESTATE TAX SOMETIMES KNOWN AS THE DEATH TAX. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A TAX THAT HAS DESTROYED SO MANY BUSINESSES AND KEPT THOSE BUSINESSES OUT OF YOUR FAMILY, YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. IT'S VERY SAD.
STEPHEN: NOW, THE ESTATE TAX APPLIES ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS WORTH MORE THAN $5.5 MILLION OR COUPLES WORTH $11 MILLION. AND ACCORDING TO ONE TAX EXPERT, OUT OF ABOUT 186,000 TRUCKING COMPANIES, REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX WOULD HELP AROUND 30 OF THEM. SO WHO ARE THESE ELITE TRUCKERS WHO ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT A TAX ON MILLIONAIRES' ESTATES? WE HAVE ONE OF THEM JOINING US NOW, LIVE VIA SATELLITE FROM HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. PLEASE WELCOME EARL DANFORTH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HELLO, STEPHEN. ENCHANTE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, MR. DANFORTH, YOU ARE A TRUCKER, TRUE?
YES, I DRIVE A MACK 18-WHEELER, THE POLO PONY OF THE OPEN ROAD. TALLY HO! ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: AND YOU WERE AT THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH LAST NIGHT?
BUT OF COURSE. IT'S THE EVENT OF THE SEASON. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PRESIDENT'S CALL TO END THE ESTATE TAX?
I HAVE TWO WORDS: "BRA" AND "VO." ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN -- FINALLY, WE HAVE A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT AVERAGE TRUCKERS CARE ABOUT, PASSING OUR MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR ESTATES ON TO OUR PRIVILEGED OFFSPRING.
STEPHEN: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS AN ISSUE FOR TRUCKERS.
OH, YES, STEPHEN. I AM VERY PROTECTIVE OF MY ESTATE. I HAVE SO MUCH OBJET D'ART. TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, ON MY MUD FLAPS. RATHER THAN A CRUDE SILHOUETTE OF A NAKED RECLINING NUDE LADY, IT'S ONE OF MODIGLIANI'S RECLINING NUDES. VERY BOLD. AND OF COURSE, FROM TIFFANY'S, I HAVE THESE DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED TRUCK NUTZ. ( LAUGHTER ) LOOK AT THEM. AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL?
Stephen: THEY'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH. DO YOU REALIZE, IF I DIED RIGHT NOW, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD GET ONE OF MY NUTZ. ( LAUGHTER ) AND OF COURSE, MY MING VASE.
STEPHEN: I'M SURE YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THAT.
OH, NO. I PEE IN THIS AND THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: SO TRUCKERS ACTUALLY SUPPORT MAKING THE RICHEST AMERICANS EVEN RICHER?
YES, THE POOR MUST PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AS IT SAYS ON MY FAMILY CREST "GAS, GRASS OR ASS. NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE."
STEPHEN: EARL DANFORTH, EVERYBODY!
SEE YOU AT THE CAPE!
STEPHEN: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BILL MURRAY IS HERE! CLAIRE FOY IS HERE! SO, STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE! WHOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, MY GOODNESS! JON -- ( AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN )
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE EXCITED. I'M EXCITED, TOO. AFTER NEXT COMMERCIAL BREAK WE HAVE THE LEGENDARY BILL MURRAY, WELL KNOWN IN THIS THEATER. THAT DOOR IS CALLED THE BILL MURRAY DOOR. HE LEAVES THROUGH THAT DOOR OVER THERE. INCREDIBLE HONOR TO HAVE HIM HERE. BUT FIRST, THIS WEEK, THERE HAVE BEEN UNEXPECTED TIFF BETWEEN TWO OF DONALD TRUMP'S WIVES I'VE NA  AND MELANIA. NOTHING FROM MARLA MAPLES YET. THEY'RE BOTH CLAIMING TO BE THE TRUE FIRST LADY. OBVIOUSLY, MELANIA TRUMP!
WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) T-SHIRT!

Stephen: HI, BILL. HI, STEVE. ( PANTING )
Stephen: YOU SEEM A LITTLE WINDED, BILL.
WELL, I'M BREATHING FUNNY BECAUSE I -- I GOT SOMETHING STUCK IN MY LIP. I -- I WAS SHOWING YOUR GIRL BACKSTAGE HOW SWEDISH PEOPLE DIP TOBACCO.
Stephen: YOU WERE SHOWING A WOMAN WHO WORKS FOR ME HOW SWEDISH PEOPLE DIP TOBACCO?
YEAH.
Stephen: I THINK I HAVE TO REPORT YOU TO H.R. NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TILL THE NEXT ACT, BILL. THANK YOU FOR BEING OUT HERE.
OH, YEAH, THE ACTS.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. WE BREAK THE SHOW UP INTO DIFFERENT LITTLE SEGMENTS HERE.
OH, OKAY.

IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE MALAYSIA. IT'S NICE.
Stephen: OH, YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'VE CLEANED IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S KIND OF A McMANSION NOW, IT'S REALLY NICE.
Stephen: WE THREW A LOT OF CASH AT IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS GAME FIVE OF THE DIVISION SERIES.
BIT OF A PROBLEM.
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S 2 AND 2 NOW WITH THE CUBS. ARE YOU FEELING A LITTLE NERVOUS?
WELL THERE'S A SORT OF FEELING WHERE YOU FEEL NERVOUS. BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE TRUE BASEBALL FANS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU WANT IT TO GO THE DISTANCE.
Stephen: SURE. YOU GET THE BEST TEAMS PLAYING AND YOU WANT IT TO GO THE FINAL GAME TO HAVE THE SERIES. YOU GET THE MOST DRAMA, TEAMS GET THE MOST MONEY AND PEOPLE HAVE THE MOST FUN.
Stephen: WANT TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF? WANT A COCKTAIL?
YEAH, A LITTLE SOMETHING WOULDN'T HURT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE ICE? YOU WANT ICE?
IT'S MY WAY OF HYDRATING.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT CUBAN RUM THERE, BILL?
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD WE'VE GOT RELATIONS BACK WITH THE CUBAN RUM.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE IS A LITTLE HAVANA CLUB MAESTRO SELECT RIGHT THERE. NOT A SPONSOR, I'M JUST A FAN.
FULL DISCLOSURE, JUST A DRINKER.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. THAT WOULD BE NICE.
Stephen: CHEERS TO THE CUBS.
CHEERS TO THE CUBS.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: THAT'S LOVELY, ISN'T IT?
SMOOTH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, HERE'S THE THING. THIS IS GOING TO BE BROADCAST, OF COURSE, AT 1:10 TONIGHT. THE GAME, WE'LL PROBABLY KNOW WHO WON AT THAT POINT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW. DO YOU WANT TO -- WHY DON'T WE RECORD TWO DIFFERENT REACTIONS?
WHY DON'T WE DRINK THIS ONE IN CASE THE CUBS WIN?
Stephen: OKAY. CUBS WIN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THIS ONE WILL BE IN CASE -- IN CASE THE CUBS DON'T WIN. ( CLINK ) ( AUDIENCE REACTING )
THIS ONE WE CAN SIP BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO LAST ALL WINTER.
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. GOOD FOR YOU. BUT THE FIRST ONE TASTED GOOD.
Stephen: IT IS GOOD, YEAH. IT'S DELICIOUS, ISN'T IT?
AND THEY SAY IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
Stephen: THE RUM? IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
Stephen: THE MORE YOU DRINK, THE MORE THEY SAY IT. ( LAUGHTER ) THE VOICES IN YOUR HEAD.
WHO WANTS A T-SHIRT?! ( CHEERING )
Stephen: HERE'S ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE OUT THERE MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE TWO OF US IS YOU AND SRI SOMETHING IN COMMON. I'M FROM CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA AND YOU LIVE IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH GUYS I GREW UP WITH LIKE JOHN WALTERS AND GATOR PHILLIPS. GOOD GUYS, RIGHT?
VERY GOOD GUYS. THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT FRIENDS.
Stephen: WE SHOULD GO FISHIN' SOME TIME.
WE CAN GO CRABBING.
Stephen: PUT SOME CHICKEN NECKS ON STRING.
GET IN SOME PLUFF MUD.
Stephen: WANT TO TELL THEM WHAT THAT IS?
FILL THEM UP WITH THIS STUFF AND THROW THEM IN THE PLUFF MUD.
Stephen: I LIVED IN "CHICAGO" FOR MANY YEARS. YOU GREW UP IN WIL WILAMET.
THEY USED TO CALL US CAKE EATERS. WHY DON'T YOU GO EAT SOME CAKE?
Stephen: THAT'S A REALLY SOFT INSULT.
IT WAS LIKE, WHY DON'T YOU GO EAT SOME CAKE?
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO EAT?
BEANS, I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOT FROM BOSTON. HASH.
Stephen: A FRIEND DROVE ME BY THE CHILDHOOD HOUSE YOU GREW UP IN. NOT A HUGE HOUSE.
NOT BY ANY STANDARD.
Stephen: NINE KIDS PACKED IN THAT HOUSE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU FALL IN THE NINE?
IT PEAKED WITH ME AND WENT STRAIGHT DOWNHILL.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE FIVE. YEAH.
Stephen: I'M THE BABY OF ELEVEN.
AWWW, SPOILED ROTTEN.
Stephen: EXACTLY RIGHT, THE PRINCE. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW FAST CAN YOU SAY THEM, DO YOU WANT TO RACE?
YEAH, SURE.
Stephen: TOP TO BOTTOM? TOP TO BOTTOM.
Stephen: TOP TO BOTTOM. ONE, TWO, THREE GO, OKAY. ONE, TWO, THREE GO. ( SAYING NAMES OF SIBLINGS FAST ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CHEERS. DOUBLE OR NOTHING?
Stephen: IRISH CATHOLIC ALTER BOY.
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU WERE RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE CHURCH, RIGHT?
I WAS RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE CONVENT. THE CHURCH WAS ANOTHER BLOCK AND A HALF BUT THERE WAS A CONVENT ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A SISTER WHO IS A NUN?
I DO.
Stephen: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE FOR A CATHOLIC FAMILY TO HAVE A NUN IN THERE. IT'S MUCH MORE CATHOLIC THAN MY FAMILY IS.
IT FREES THE REST OF US UP TO LIVE A LIFE OF SIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SHE'S THE CARBON ROD THAT ABSORBS THE RADIATION OF YOUR SIN?
I'M COVERED! I'M COVERED! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT BEING A PRIEST?
WELL, THE PRIEST USED TO COME INTO THE CLASSROOM AND SAY, HOW MANY OF YOU WANT TO BE PRIESTS? AND EVERYONE WOULD RAISE THEIR HAND.
Stephen: REALLY? ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: DID YOU MEAN IT? FOR A SECOND. FOR THAT SECOND, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH. I'M STILL THINKING ABIT, TO BE HONEST.
Stephen: YOU GREAT WOULD IT BE IF YOU WALKED INTO A CHURCH AND THERE'S FATHER BILL?! ( LAUGHTER )
I COULD GIVE BETTER COUNSELING, I THINK. I KNOW HOW IT GETS. LAST CALL, I KNOW HOW IT GETS, BABY, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. PLEASE DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
WHY WOULD I GO ANYWHERE? I GOT T-SHIRTS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH OUR FRIEND BILL MURRAY AND HIS MUSICAL PARTNER. WE ARE JOINED NOW BY BILL MURRAY'S MUSICAL PARTNER GERMAN CELLIST JAN VOGLER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: BEFORE WE BEGIN, WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?
SURE.
Stephen: A LITTLE RUM? URE.
Stephen: A LITTLE SLICE OF ORANGE IN THERE. JAN, TELL ME HOW YOU AND BILL MURRAY -- SURE, LET ME JUST GET JAN GOING HERE.
JUST A WHISPER. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH, OKAY, SO HOW DID IT COME ABOUT, JAN, THAT YOU AND BILL MURRAY HAVE NOW CREATED AN ALBUM CALLED BILL MURRAY AND JAN VOGLER AND FRIENDS "NEW WORLDS" WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE CLASSICAL ALBUM TOP OF THE CHARTS RIGHT NOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
WE MET IN AN AIRPORT IN BERLIN IN MY HOMETOWN. I WAS FLYING FROM NEW YORK, CAME TO A TOUR AND BILL AND I WORKED TOGETHER. WE MET AT THE AIRPORT AND BILL WAS WORRIED I WAS CARRYING THIS BIG BOX WITH MY CELLO. HE WAS WORRIED I WOULDN'T HAVE SPACE ON THE AIRPLANE. HE WAS SITTING ON A WINDOW SEAT AND I WAS SITTING ACROSS THE AISLE. WE BECAME FRIENDS ON THE PLANE. AFTER ABOUT TWO YEARS WE SUDDENLY HAD THIS IDEA OF COLLABORATION DURING THE A WONDERFUL EVENT IN NEW YORK CALLED THE POETRY WALK ACROSS THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE. YOU MEET AT THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, HEAR WALT WHITMAN POETRY AND YOU WALK TOGETHER. I HEARD BILL RECITE AGO POEM I THOUGHT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND TOUCHING AND THEN I JUST HAD SOME INSPIRATION.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE POEM, BILL?
I DID A HANDFUL BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR WALT WHITMAN A SONG FOR THE OPEN ROAD THAT STRUCK JAN AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. IT'S A NICE EVENT AND THE POET'S HOUSE PUTS IT ON. BUT -- ( CLEARING THROAT ) ( LAUGHTER ) -- BUT IT'S BEEN FUN. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN MAKING THIS MUSIC. WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN DOING IT. THE POETRY PART OF IT IS PART OF THE SHOW THAT WE DO, IT'S PART OF THE RECORD, TOO, AND JAN SAID, HOW ABOUT IF WE DO SOME STUFF? AND HIS FATHER MADE HIS READ AMERICAN LITERATURE AS A CHILD. HE CAME BACK INTO HIS HOUSE AND HE HAS A STACK OF BOOKS EARNEST HEMINGWAY, TRUMAN CAPOTE AND MARK TWAIN AND A HANDFUL MORE. HE'S, LIKE, WHAT IF WE DID SOME OF THESE? OKAY, WELL, GOOD. HE'S GOT A GREAT MIND, JAN AND HE'S A RIDICULOUS CELLIST. YOU WILL HEAR HIM IN A MOMENT.
Stephen: ARE YOU SINGING ON THIS ALBUM OR RECITING POETRY ON THIS ALBUM?
DOING BOTH. AND I'M READING. READING, WRITING AND ARITHMETIC. I READ AND WRITE SONGS AND POEMS AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING LIVE SHOWS.
Stephen: DID YOU RECORD THIS IN BERLIN OR THE UNITED STATES?
ON 37th STREET.
Stephen: YOU PERFORM STARTING MONDAY NIGHT?
WE'VE DONE HALF A DOZEN SHOWS IN GERMANY.
Stephen: AT CARNEGIE HALL, THOUGH. WHEN DO YOU GUYS OPEN AT CARNEGIE HALL?
WELL, ON MONDAY ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: ON MONDAY, OKAY. DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT JAN VOGLER BEFORE YOU MET HIM ON THAT PLANE?
NO, AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS EITHER?
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO BILL MURRAY WAS?
HE HAD AN AURA, AND I KNEW HE WAS A FAMOUS PERSON. YOU'RE TIGHT IN THE AIRPLANE, SOMETIMES IN YOUR BUBBLE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HAVE YOU GONE TO SEE CADDY SHACK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES, AND I'VE SEEN -- ON THE FLIGHT WAS SO MUCH FUN BECAUSE I ASKED BILL, I SAID, ARE THERE ANY OF YOUR MOVIES ON THE PROGRAM? AND HE WAS QUICK. HE WAS, LIKE, YES ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHAT WAS ON THE PROGRAM?
STRIPES.
Stephen: STRIPES. I WASHED IT.
Stephen: I GOT MY AS KICKED IN WISCONSIN ONCE. YEAH.
WE WERE SITTING TO EACH OTHER, I WAS WATCHING THE FILM AND HE WAS READING. ( LAUGHTER )
IT WAS FUNNY. IT WAS FUNNY.
Stephen: THAT'S FIRST CLASS. THAT'S FIRST CLASS. YOUR CELLO, BILL MURRAY AND JAN VOGLER, FIRST CLASS. WAS ANYBODY NOTICING THE THREE OF YOU? BECAUSE YOU'RE QUITE IMPOSING WITH YOUR CELLO IN THE SEAT NEXT TO YOU AND BILL MURRAY. DID YOU GET ANY ATTENTION FROM PEOPLE ON THE PLANE?
I GOT A NICE EMAIL THE OTHER DAY FROM A MAN IN FRONT OF US WHO HEARD OUR CONVERSATIONS AND HE'S FLYING FROM GERMANY TO CARNEGIE HALL TO HEAR THE CONCERT ON MONDAY. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CHEERS. CHEERS, BILL. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ALBUM CALLED "NEW WORLDS." THEY ARE EXPLORING NEW WORLDS. THEY WILL BE AT CARNEGIE HALL MONDAY. THEY'RE PERFORMING WITH US LATER TONIGHT.
WOULD YOU WELCOME THIS GUY TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHOOT A T-SHIRT OFF THE STAGE? ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOLD ON. WE'RE DOING THIS AGAIN. HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US! BILL MURRAY AND JAN VOGLER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CLAIRE FOY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT WON A GOLDEN GLOBE FOR HER PORTRAYAL OF QUEEN ELIZABETH IN "THE CROWN." SHE NOW STARS IN "BREATHE." PLEASE WELCOME CLAIRE FOY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
Stephen: NOW, WE HAD YOU ON A YEAR AGO, I THINK.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW ABSOLUTELY DESPERATELY A FAN I WAS OF YOURS BECAUSE I HADN'T SEEN "THE CROWN" YET WHEN I HAD YOU ON LAST TIME. YOU ARE SO BRILLIANT IN THAT PERFORMANCE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH. WOULD YOU LIKE A COCKTAIL?
YEAH.
Stephen: HERE WE GO. I HAD A PRE-RUM BECAUSE I WAS A BIT JEALOUS OF BILL MURRAY.
Stephen: EVERYONE'S JEALOUS OF BILL MURRAY FOR ALL THEIR INDIVIDUAL WAYS. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GOLDEN GLOBE. I SAW YOU OUT THERE AT THE EMMYS.
CHEERS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T WIN, YOU SHOULD HAVE WON, BUT YOU DIDN'T WIN OUT THERE.
I HAD RUM IN MY MOUTH SO I COULDN'T ANSWER THAT ONE, BUT YEAH.
Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE GOLDEN GLOBES. COMPARE THEM TO TELL MYS.
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE GOLDEN GLOBE'S?
Stephen: NO, THESE TALK SHOWS, THERE IS NO CATEGORY FOR THEM THERE.
THERE SHOULD BE.
Stephen: I AGREE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HEAR THE GOLDEN GLOBE'S ARE MORE FUN. ARE THEY MORE FUN THAN THE EMMYS?
THERE'S ALCOHOL THERE, YEAH. AND YOU DON'T SIT IN A LINE AND STARE AT THE STAGE AND WAIT FOR YOUR CATEGORY AND WAIT TO LOSE. YOU CAN MILL AROUND AND GO TO THE TOILET, WHICH IS NOVEL.
Stephen: YOU BETTER NOT LEAVE THE EMMYS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE CATEGORY WILL COME UP WHEN YOU LEAVE.
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE WATER AT THE EMMYS.
Stephen: NO! YEAH. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) I DON'T EVEN THINK OPRAH HAD WATER AT THE EMMYS. SO PRETTY BAD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: "THE CROWN" IS COMING BACK IN DECEMBER.
YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M VERY EXCITED. DO YOU GET ALONG WITH THE CORGIS? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO WORK WITH THE CORGIS AND THEY COULD UPSTAGE YOU BECAUSE DOGS ARE ADORABLE NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT AS ADORABLE AS A CORGI, BUT THERE'S MULTIPLE CORGIS.
THERE'S LOADS OF CORGIS AND THEY'RE ALL VERY DIFFERENT IN CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT AND THEY ARE THE STARS OF THE SHOW AND THEY LOVE CHEESE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: CORGIS LOVE CHEESE?
MAYBE THEY DON'T LOVE IT. MAYBE THEY HAVE BEEN BULLIED INTO LIKING IT. IF YOU WANT TO GET A CORGI TO COME NEAR YOU HAVE A BIT OF CHEDDAR CHEESE IN YOUR HAND AND THEY THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.
Stephen: I ASSUME THEY ALL HAVE PANCREATITIS OR SOMETHING.
YEAH. THEY LOOK WELL. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS AS THE QUEEN. DO YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO BE A PILLAR OF MORAL RECOLLECT 'TUDE EVERYWHERE YOU GO OR ELSE YOU'RE GOING TO DISAPPOINT PEOPLE?
I DO DISAPPOINT PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T DISAPPOINTED ME.
NOT YET.
Stephen: I SAW YOU SEVERAL TIMES. I SAW YOU AT THE MET GALA.
YOU MET ME AFTER THAT.
Stephen: I SAW "THE CROWN" AFTER THAT. I SAID THAT'S CLAIRE FOY!
THE HIDEOUS LINEUP WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN.
Stephen: WE HAD ANDREW GARFIELD ON HERE THE OTHER NIGHT, IT'S CALLED "BREATHE." YOU PLAY DIANA CAVENDISH. THIS MAN AND HIS WIFE DIANA CAVENDISH LIKELY WERE SORT OF PIONEERS IN TRYING TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PARALYZED, PARAPLEGICS TO LIVE LIVES OUT IN THE WORLD. THIS IS THE FIRST MAN WHO EVER LEFT A HOSPITAL AFTER BEING ON A RESPIRATOR.
I THINK WE FORGET PREVIOUSLY THAT PEOPLE IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE AND IF PEOPLE WERE SEVERELY DISABLED THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE WOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY COULD TAKE CARE OF. ROBIN WENT THROUGH A SEVERE DEPRESSION WHEN HE WAS PARALYZED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE THE ONLY WAY I CAN KEEP LIVING IS IF I GET OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL. SO HE WAS THE GUINEA PIG. HE WAS THE TEST FOR EVERYTHING AND THEY INVENTED THE FIRST EVER WHEELCHAIR THAT MEANT PEOPLE ON A RESPIRATOR CAN LIVE A FULL AND HAPPY LIFE.
Stephen: WHAT YEARS ARE WE TALKING HERE?
1950-SOMETHING.
Stephen: SO IT OVERLAPS WHEN YOU'RE PORTRAYING THE QUEEN IN "THE CROWN."
YES.
Stephen: YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED TWO PARTS IN THIS ONE.
I COULD HAVE DONE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS CLIP WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE?
WHERE HE PRETTY MUCH SAYS, HIS ULTIMATUM, IF I'M GOING TO LIVE MY LIFE WITH YOU AND MY CHILD, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK ME OUT.
Stephen: JIM. YOU'D RATHER JUST PACK IT IN, I KNOW.
THE BLOODY MACHINE. KEEPS ON BREATHING FOR ME.
THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STICK AROUND FOR A WHILE, DOESN'T IT?
SORRY TO SAY. I'M NOT SORRY. I WANT JONATHAN TO KNOW YOU, AND MAYBE -- MAYBE I CAN MAKE LIFE A LITTLE BETTER FOR YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FILM.
Stephen: AND WHAT YOU CAN'T TELL NECESSARILY FROM THAT CLIP IS THAT IT'S QUITE LIGHT-HEARTED ACTUALLY.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S A HEAVY CLIP. IT'S NOT A SAD STORY. IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL AND HOPEFUL STORY.
IT IS. THE MOST INCREDIBLE, WITTY PEOPLE WHO REALLY DEALT WITH A TERRIBLE SITUATION WITH THE HUMOR AND LOVE AND BRILLIANCE AND IT IS GREAT.
Stephen: PEOPLE BACK THEN WERE MUCH BETTER THAN WE ARE NOW.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: CHEERS. KEEP THIS FLOWING. "BREATHE" IS IN THEATERS TOMORROW. CLAIRE FOY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY BILL MURRAY AND JAN VOGLER. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
