AND NOW "THE LATE SHOW"" SOWDLY PRESENTS SAMUEL BECKETTS NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN MASTERPIECE, "WAITING FOR GODOT'S OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT."
NOTHING TO BE DONE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU THINK A REPLACEMENT WILL COME?
HE SAID IT WOULD COME.
Stephen: PERHAPS IT WILL COME TODAY.
OR TOMORROW.
Stephen: OR THE DAY AFTER THAT.
IF WE WAIT, IT WILL COME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHY HASN'T IT COME ALREADY?
HE SAID IT WAS MORE COMPLICATED THAN ANYONE THOUGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HE SAID HE'D LIKE TO DATE HIS DAUGHTER.
HE SAID, "GRAB THEM BY THE PUSSY."
Stephen: HE SAID THAT WAS JUST LOCKER ROOM TALK. OH! OH! OH, MY PREEXISTING CONDITION! DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE COVERED?
WE WILL KNOW WHEN THE REPLACEMENT COMES!
Stephen: WHEN WILL IT COME?
PERHAPS TODAY.
Stephen: OR TOMORROW. DEE DEE?
YES, GODOT?
Stephen: SHALL WE GO TO CANADA?
YES, LET'S GO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO ARE WE GOING TO GO, OR WHAT?
OH, YEAH, RIGHT. SORRY. NUMBER ONE, TWO TO BEAM UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES PATRICK STEWART. CHRIS COLFER. AND ROY WOOD, JR. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: WHAT'S UP? HEY, CHRIS! WHAT'S UP, MATT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) â™ª
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. BIG, REALLY BIG NIGHT, BIG NIGHT LAST NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP, OR, OR WHOEVER KNAV GAVE THAT SPEECH ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE A DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP WAS GIVING HIS FIRST ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, AND IT'S GETTY PRETTY GOOD REVIEWS, PRETTY GOOD REVIEWS. "THE WASHINGTON POST" CALLED IT "SURPRISINGLY PRESIDENTIAL." ( LAUGHTER ) ALWAYS COMFORTING WHEN THE PRESIDENT SURPRISES YOU BY SEEMING PLAUSIBLE. AND GETTING RAVES FOR BEING SURPRISINGLY PRESIDENTIAL IS NOTHING NEW. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS 1863 REVIEW OF THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. "I LIKE THAT FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO THING. PLUS, HE DIDN'T STOP ONCE TO MOCK THE DISABLED." HE'S KNOWN FOR THAT. ABE IS KNOWN FOR THAT.
Jon: HE WAS KNOWN FOR THAT, HUH? WOW? UNCHARACTERISTICALLY OPTIMISTIC, LAST NIGHT, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PRAISING HIS SHIFT IN TONE. YES, HE WENT FROM "UNHINGED NARCISSIST" TO "HINGED NARCISSIST." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) A LITTLE RIGHT THERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING: TRUMP MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS TONE BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE CONTENT UPON WHAT HE SAID. ONE SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL EVEN TOLD A REPORTER THAT THE SPEECH WAS JUST "NATIONALISM WITH AN INDOOR VOICE." YE, INDOOR VOICE. IT'S THE KIND YOU USE IN THE LIBRARY WHILE CHECKING OUT BOOKS TO BURN. YOU KNOW WHO ALSO SAID TROUBLING THINGS IN A CALM VOICE? HANNIBAL LECTER.
WE'RE MAKING A LIST OF IMGRANTS, ROUNDING UP THE BAD ONES. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, CLARICE!
Stephen: SMART. THE GUY'S SMART. THE GUY'S SMART. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) THE POINT IS, JUST BECAUSE YOU ACT PRESIDENTIAL DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE. WHEN I PUT MY HEAD THROUGH THAT CUTOUT AT CONEY ISLAND, IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M ACTUALLY RIDING A DOLPHIN. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, HERE'S A MOMENT THAT, DESPITE TRUMP USING HIS INDOOR VOICE, HAS UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I HAVE ORDERED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO CREATE AN OFFICE TO SERVE AMERICAN VICTIMS. THE OFFICE IS CALLED VOICE: VICTIMS OF IMMIGRATION CRIME ENGAGEMENT.
Audience: OH!
Stephen: YES, YES, YES, I HATE BAD ACRONYMS, TOO. VICTIMS OF IMMIGRATION CRIME ENGAGEMENT? YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. THAT MEANS THEY HAD VICTIMS OF IMMIGRATION CRIME, AND COULD NOT THINK OF A GOOD "E" WORD. LET'S SPIT BALL THIS ONE. "VICTIMS OF IMMIGRATION CRIME... ENCHILADA?" ANYBODY? MAKE THEM. THEY'RE DLIRKS COME ON! WELL, HOWEVER THEY DID IT, THE ACRONYM, THE PROGRAM THERE IS CALLED VOICE, WHICH, AFTER THEY ROUND UP THE IMMIGRANTS, I THINK MEANS GWEN STEFANI AND BLAKE SHELTON VOTE ON WHO GETS TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT ON CBS. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE SHOW. NOW, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN FACT IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY HAVE A LOWER CRIME RATE THAN NATIVE-BORN POPULATION. COME ON, IMMIGRANTS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE HERE, YOU'VE GOT TO ASSIMILATE. THAT MEANS, LEARN ENGLISH, THEN KNOCK OVER A LIQUOR STORE. OF COURSE, THE ADMINISTRATION POINTS OUT THAT SOME IMMIGRANTS COMMIT TERRIBLE CRIMES, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALL OF THEM ARE CRIMINAL. I'D SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CHERRY-PICKING, BUT EVERYONE KNOWS AMERICANS DON'T PICK THEIR OWN FRUIT. I DON'T KNOW WHO DOES IT. IT'S MAGIC. IT JUST SHOWS UP IN THE STORES SOMEHOW. AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S BIZARRELY NORMAL-SOUNDING SPEECH LAST NIGHT, THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING A MOMENT TO BASK IN THE AFTERGLOW. AND THAT'S WHY HE'S DELAYING SIGNING THE NEW MUSLIM TRAVEL BAN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. AS ONE OFFICIAL PUT IT, "WE WANT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER TO HAVE ITS OWN MOMENT." OH, I GET IT. THINGS ARE GOOD NOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BAD STUFF LATER. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR FOLKS SAY, "ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST ENJOY OUR TIME AT DISNEY WORLD, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT GETTING A DIVORCE LATER." "I WANT TO BE GOOFY." I KEEP THE SHELF OF ALL MY PROPS OVER THERE. WASN'T THE WHOLE URGENCY-- THIS IS WHAT I DON'T GET, BUT WASN'T THE WHOLE URGENCY OF THE FIRST TRAVEL BAN THAT IF WE DELAYED IT EVEN FOR ONE SECOND, THE TERRORISTS WOULD CUT OUR BRAKE CABLES? THIS IS WHAT HE SAID BACK THEN.
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE SAID TO ME, "OH, YOU CAN'T GIVE A NOTICE, BECAUSE IF YOU GAVE A NOTICE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY TOUGH ONE MONTH FROM NOW OR ONE WEEK FROM NOW"-- I SUGGESTED A MONTH, AND I SAID, "WHAT ABOUT A WEEK?" THEY SAID, "NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WILL POUR IN BEFORE THE TOUGHNESS." ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: "POUR IN BEFORE THE TOUGH ?NS? IS HE ENFORCING IMMIGRATION LAW OR FOLDING EGG WHITES INTO A SOUFFLE? OF THE POUR IT IN. POUR IT IN. KEEP IT GOING. STIFF PEAKS. STIFF PEAKS. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) BUT COME ON, IF YOU REALLY THINK THAT AMERICA IS FACING URGENT THREAT AT OUR BORDERS THAT GROWS GRAVER EVERY PASSING MINUTE, YOU CAN'T JUST HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON. WHAT DO YOU THINK, THE SPEECH WAS SO GOOD LAST NIGHT, THAT ISIS WILL BE SPENDING THE NEXT 24 HOURS GIVING YOU A STANDING OVATION? "I MEAN, HE LOOKED SO PRESIDENTIAL. YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT IT! THE GLOBAL CALIPHATE CAN WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW. LET HIM HAVE HIS MOMENT, PLEASE! YES, YES! HALFWAY THROUGH THE REENACTMENT, MY ISIS PEOPLE BECAME ITALIAN FOR SOME REASON. I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT HAPPENED, YOU KNOW? THAT'S A SPICY CALIPHATE. ( LAUGHTER ) HONESTLY, I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THE TRAVEL BAFNS A GOOD IDEA. AND IF FLATTERING NEWS STORIES WILL DELAY HIM FROM ENACTING IT, I'M HAPPY TO DO MY PART. SO FOR MORE POSITIVE COVERAGE OF TRUMP'S ADDRESS LAST NIGHT, WE GO TO "THE LATE SHOW'S" IN-HOUSE NEWS NETWORK, "REAL NEWS TONIGHT."
WELCOME TO "REAL NEWS TONIGHT. OF. I'M JILL NEWSLADY. HOUR TOP STORY, THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. FOR MORE WE GO TO JIM ANCHORTON. JIM.
THAT'S RIGHT, JILL. TRUMP DID ALL OF HIS SPEECHING PERFECTLY, MAKING ALL LEGAL CITIZENS SMILE BIGLEY. THE PRESIDENT IS FEELING HAPPY GOODNESS AND THE BEST WAY TO CELEBRATE IS NOT ENACT ANY NEW POLICIES.
YES, HE FEELS WARM AND SAFE AND THE AIR SMELLS LIKE COOKIES AND EVERYTHING WILL STAY THAT WAY, AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE 2020 ELECTIONS BECAUSE TRUMP GAVE A GOOD, SMART SPEECH.
GOOD AND SMART. TRUMP IS GOOD.
AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, JIM.
SO SMART.
THAT'S IT FOR "REAL NEWS TONIGHT." I'M JIM ANCHORMAN.
AND I WISH I WAS MEMELANIA.
Stephen: DON'T WE ALL? DON'T WE ALL? I WOULD LIKE TO BE MELANIA. , OF COURSE, NOW THAT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT, PEOPLE ARE SAYING ANYONE CAN BE PRESIDENT, AND IT DOES SEEM THAT WAY. I MEAN, THE DEMOCRATIC REBUTTAL WAS GIVEN EITHER BY A FORMER GOVERNOR OR A CULT LEADER ASKING US TO PUT ON SNEAKERS AND CATCH A COMET TO HEAVEN. IT WAS HARD TO TELL. OR MAYBE ANYONE, OR PERHAPS A SPECIAL SOMEONE COULD BE PRESIDENT.
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT, GIVEN THE POPULARITY YOU HAVE, WE HAVEN'T BROKEN THE GLASS CEILING YET FOR WOMEN, THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND ACTUALLY BE ELECTED?
I NEVER CONSIDERED THE QUESTION, EVEN A POSSIBILITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I JUST THOUGHT, OH... OH?
RIGHT, BECAUSE, IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. I THOUGHT, "OH, GEE, I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH, I DON'T-- AND NOW I'M THINKING, OH." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'RE THINKING "O"? I'M THINKING "O." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M THINK AGO NOT ONLY THAT, I'M THINKINGIME" THINKING 'O' IS A PRETTY GREAT SLOGAN FOR 2020." SPEAKING OF PRESIDENT "O," DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER BARACK OBAMA. REMEMBER THAT GUY.
Jon: GREAT SHOT.
Stephen: YEAH. NICE GUY, ABOUT YAYS HAD HIGH, GRAYISH HAIR, WE TRUSTED HIM WITH THE LAUNCH CODES. HE'S OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE OKAY, BECAUSE HE AND MICHELLE JUST SIGNED A $60 MILLION BOOK DEAL, WHICH EXPLAINS HOW HE COULD AFFORD RICHARD BRANSON AS HIS KITE-SURFING INSTRUCTOR. AT $60 MILLION, IT'S THE MOST VALUABLE PRESIDENTIAL MEMOIR EVER. PREVIOUSLY, BILL CLINTON GOT A $15 MILLION ADVANCE FOR HIS POST-WHITE HOUSE MEMOIR, AND GEORGE W. BUSH'S ONLY GOT $7 MILLION. MEANWHILE, TICKETS ARE $9 A POP TO SEE HILLARY'S OFF-BROADWAY PRODUCTION OF "INTO THE WOODS." THAT'S ALL I KNOW. I KNOW NOTHING ELSE. "INTO THE WOODS." NOW, THE SUBJECTS OF THE OBAMAS' BOOKS HAVEN'T BEEN ANNOUNCED YET, BUT IT'S RUMORED THAT BARACK'S BOOK WILL BE "A MEMOIR OF HIS PRESIDENCY." WHILE "MICHELLE WILL WRITE A BOOK DESIGNED TO INSPIRE YOUNG PEOPLE BASED ON HER LIFE STORY." IT WILL BE RELEASED IN HARDBACK, THEN PAPERBACK, AND THEN BY MELANIA. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. SIR PATRICK STEWART IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL LOOK BACK AT THIS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, RIGHT OVER THERE. THAT MAN, RIGHT THERE. THAT MAN, RIGHT THERE!
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LISTEN, LISTEN. JON, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, I'M ENJOYING A LITTLE COFFEE RIGHT HERE.
Jon: OH, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE MY COFFEE?
Jon: HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
Stephen: I LIKE MY COFFEE LIKE I LIKE MY HISTORY MONTHS, BLACK. THERE IT IS. WELL, BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS OFFICIALLY OVER. IT JUST FLEW BY AS IF WE GAVE BLACK PEOPLE THE SHORTEST MONTH OF THE YEAR. BUT WITH JEFF SESSIONS AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I HAVE A FEELING WE'LL BE MAKING MORE BLACK HISTORY EVERY DAY. JON, MY FRIEND, HOW WAS YOUR BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
Jon: IT WAS GOOD, WE DID A LIVE SHOW TO CAP IT OFF.
Stephen: WE CAPPED IT.
Jon: CAPPED OFF THE SHOW, THE BEST MONTH OF THE YEAR.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. I LOVE HEARING FROM YOU JON, AND I LOVE KEEPING A DIALOGUE OPEN WITH YOU. IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DO.
Jon: YES, YES. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S PERSPECTIVE IF WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD AS A NATION FULL OF LOVE. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A SHORT P.S.A. ABOUT THAT SUBJECT.
Jon: YES, I DO. ROLL IT! HEY, WHITE PEOPLE!
EVERY FALL, MY WHITE NEIGHBOR INVITES ME TO GO "APPLE PICKING" WITH HIM AND HIS FAMILY. THAT'S WHERE YOU GO TO SOMEONE'S FARM AND PAY THEM TO STAND IN THE SUN AND PICK CROPS OFF A TREE. LISTEN, I AIN'T FALLIN' FOR THAT TRICK AGAIN. THE CLOSEST THING I'LL GET TO PICKING UP ANYTHING IS MY CHECK.
HEY, WHITE PEOPLE. JUST BECAUSE YOU WATCHED "SLUM DOG MILLIONAIRE" DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GET A HENNA TATTOO.
YOU KNOW WHAT PISSED ME OFF? WE DON'T LOOK ALIKE. YOU SAY DENZEL, OR-- OR MAYBE, LIKE, FABIO. NO, WAIT, FABIO'S WHITE. WHAT'S THE OTHER BLACK GUY THEY SAY LOOK GOOD? THE GUY FROM THE MOVIE? HE GOT THE EYEBROWS, THE NOSE?
IT'S NOT OKAY TOO DO MOTOWN AT KARAOKE. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE IT. NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR IT. YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT, #CONFUSED. #PICK ANOTHER SONG.
HEY, WHITE PEOPLE, WHEN YOU SAY "URBAN," WE ALL KNOW YOU MEAN BLACK PEOPLE SO JUST SAY BLACK PEOPLE. AND IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY MEET MORE URBAN PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ).
HEY, WHITE PEOPLE! IF YOU FEEL LEFT OUT DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH, JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU PLAYED A PRETTY GIANT ROLE IN BLACK HISTORY, TOO.
WHAT IS HIS NAME? WILLIS! FROM "DIFFERENT STROKES." THAT'S WHO I WAS TALKING ABOUT. TRUE STORY.
Jon: HEY, WHITE PEOPLE. IT'S NOT OKAY TO AIR YOUR BLACK HISTORY MONTH P.S.A. A DAY AFTER BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS OVER. EITHER AIR IT ON TIME OR GIVE BLACK HEME AN EXTRA MONTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SIR PATRICK STEWART.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE FINEST ACTORS IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW HIM AS THE BELOVED. PROFESSOR X, A ROLE HE IS PLAYING FOR THE FINAL TIME IN "LOGAN."
WHERE YOU ALL HEADED?
OREGON--
SOUTH DAKOTA--
UM, WELL, OREGON AND THEN SOUTH DAKOTA.
VACATION.
YES. LONG OVERDUE.
I WOULD LOVE TO TRAVEL SOME DAY.
AND I BET YOU WILL.
I CAN DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.
OKAY, LET'S NOT GO THAT FAR.
I MEAN, I'LL DO IT.
CAREFUL, YOU'RE SPEAKING TO A MAN WHO RAN A SCHOOL FOR A LOT OF YEARS, RIGHT, CHARLES?
WELL, YES. IT WAS-- IT WAS A KIND OF SPECIAL NEEDS SCHOOL.
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION.
HE WAS THERE, TOO.
OH, YEAH, NO. I GOT KICKED OUT A FEW TIMES.
I WISH I COULD SAY YOU WERE A GOOD PUPIL, BUT THE WORDS WOULD CHOKE ME. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME, SIR PATRICK STEWART! â™ª THIS IS HOW WE DO IT THIS IS HOW WE DO IT â™ª THIS IS HOW WE DO IT THIS IS HOW WE DO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU, AND YOU, TOO.  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: THEY'RE VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU, CLEARLY.  ( CHEERS ) GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
AND YOU, STEPHEN, ALWAYS GOOD.
Stephen: I DON'T-- LET'S GET TO THE BIG NEWS BECAUSE I HOPE I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY HERE-- STOP ME IF I AM-- BUT PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING THE EMOJI MOVIE. THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE-- THIS IS TRUE. WE'RE NOT MAKING THIS UP. THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE BASED ON THE EMOJIS, AND YOU HAVE BEEN CAST AS THE POOP EMOJI. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DO I HAVE THAT, SIR PATRICK, DO I HAVE THAT CORRECT?
YES, YOU DO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THEY CAN'T IT'S QUEEN-- THE QUEEN CAN'T COME TAKE THE KNIGHTHOOD AWAY, CAN SHE? IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY WITH THIS?
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO RUN IT BY HER WHEN I GO BACK TO LONDON. JUST SO --
Stephen: STOP BY BUCKINGHAM?
SO TO SPEAK. AND I THINK SHE WILL APPROVE BECAUSE SHE WILL KNOW THAT FOR ME, POOP HAS BEEN-- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: GUY'S TALKING ABOUT HIS ART.
FOR ME-- THANK YOU, THANK YOU, STEPHEN! YOU HEAR WHAT THE MAN SAID.
Stephen: YES.
FOR ME, POOP HAS BEEN A LIFELONG WORK IN PROGRESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH. ARE YOU METHOD? IS THIS METHOD?
OH, TOTALLY INTERNAL, UNTIL IT'S EXTERNAL, OF COURSE,.
Stephen: YES, OF COURSE,.
BUT YOU SEE, WHEN I WAS AN INFANT, OF COURSE, IT WAS MORE SPONTANEOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT IN MY TEENS, IT TOOK A KIND OF COMEDIC SPURT, YOU KNOW. I WAS-- ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS LOW FARCE, RATHER THAN HIGH COMEDY. BUT AS I MATURED, SO DID MY OUTPUT. LAUGH.
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT "LOGAN" FOR A SECOND. IT COMES OUT THIS WEEKEND. I-- BECAUSE I'M SPECIAL, I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT. I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT. YOU HAVE SEEN IT?
I'VE SEEN IT TWICE.
Stephen: IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. AND IT IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER, YOU MIGHT SAY SORT OF COMIC BOOK ROMP THAN THEY'VE EVER MADE, BUT IN SOME WAYS IT'S SO MUCH MORE LIKE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO READ ONE OF THESE SORT OF ADVENTURE, SUPER-HERO COMIC BOOKS. IT'S GRITTY, IT'S DARK. PROFESSOR X. DROPS THE F-BOMB EVERY SO OFTEN. WAS THAT NICE TO LET FLY WITH HIM BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMAN? HAVE CHANGED, FOLKS. THIS IS NOT THE MAN THAT GROOVE GROWN TO LOVE AND FEEL SECURE WITH ALL THESE YEARS." NO, HE IS OLD, 90-- 90-PLUS. WHICH I KNOW WOULD BE A STRETCH FOR YOU TO IMAGINE ME AS A 90-PLUS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THE MAKEUP ARTISTS WERE AMAZING IN THIS ONE.
THE MAKEUP, THEY WERE SENSATIONAL. THEY DESERVE OSCAR NOMINATIONS FOR THEIR WORK ON ME. LIKE ALL THE "X-MEN" MOVIES, IT IS ABOUT SOMETHING. AND PRIMARY, ALTHOUGH, YES, THEY ARE SUPERHERO PEOPLE, BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT FAMILY. THERE'S THE FAMILY THAT YOU SAW IN THAT CLIP JUST NOW. BUT, ALSO, THERE'S ANOTHER FAMILY. THERE'S A GRANDFATHER. THERE'S A SON WHO MIGHT BE LOGAN. AND THERE'S A DAUGHTER, A GRANDDAUGHTER, TOO, WHO IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG WOMAN, I THINK THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CHILD PERFORMER I HAVE EVER MET. HER NAME IS DAPHNE KEEN.
Stephen: SHE'S THE STORY IS SURPRISING HOW MOVING IT IS BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER ""X-"MEN" MOVIES UP TO NOW YOU GOT TO KNOW AND HAVE AFFECTION FOR THESE CHARACTERS BUT NOW YOU SEE THEM BROUGHT LOW. IT'S IN 2029. SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED. YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW. IT'S NOT EXPLAINED THAT MUCH, ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS IN GOOD SCIENCE FICTION. YOU DON'T KNOW YET FUTURE IS THIS WAY. I ASSUME TRUMP WAS ELECTED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YES. THE THING IS WHAT IS PERTINENT ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS WRITTEN THREE-- THE IDEAS-- FOUR YEARS AGO. AND THIS IS REALLY A CASE OF LIFE CATCHING UP WITH ART.
Stephen: IT REALLY IS. LIKE YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THIS THING WAS WRITTEN BEFORE DONALD TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT.
I KNOW.
Stephen: WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH, THE MEXICAN BORDER, FLEEING TO CANADA, THE-- WHICH I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY BY SAYING THAT-- BUT THEY'RE ALL THINGS I THOUGHT HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN THIS COULD BE SO--
WE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.
Stephen: TOPICALLY ASSOCIATED.
BUT THE THREE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS-- THE GOOD NEWS IN OUR STORY-- THEY HAVE ONE SUPER OBJECTIVE, AND THAT IS TO GET TO A BORDER-- IT HAPPENS TO BE THE CANADIAN BORDER-- AND GET ACROSS. WHY? TO SAFETY. AND ALL OF THE WORLD, THERE ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING BECAUSE THEIR LIVES ARE AT RISK AND IN DANGER. AND IT IS NEVER BEEN SO BOOD, AND THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THIS SCRIPT WAS DEVELOPED.
Stephen: WELL, EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. AND IT'S A WESTERN IN ITS OWN WAY. AND I-- I HAVEN'T CRIED AT A SUPERHERO MOVIE BEFORE. HOW ABOUT THAT, I HAVEN'T CRIED AT A SUPERHERO MOVIE BEFORE, BUT THIS ONE REALLY GOT ME. THIS ONE REALLY GOT ME.
IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: IT'S OKAY?
IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: IT'S OKAY.  ( APPLAUSE ) UPON. THAT'S BEEN MY-- THAT WAS MY SUPERPOWER-- NOT CRYING. ( LAUGHTER ).
UNTIL NOW.
Stephen: YES.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, YOU-- WE HAVE THIS LITTLE VIDEO HERE. THIS WAS-- YOU POSTED THIS ONLINE OR A FRIEND OF YOURS POSTEPOSTEPOSTED THIS ONLINE, PE WIFE POSTED THIS. THIS IS YOU IN FRONT OF A HARDWARE STORY WINDOW. THIS IS ALSO VERY MOVING. JIM CWE SHOW? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I KNOW THE FEELING. I KNOW THE FEELING.
YOU, TOO.
Stephen: I KNOW THE FEELING. SO WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE-- WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE GIFT. WE GOT YOU-- WE GOT YOU A SOCKET WRENCH SET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. RIGHT THERE. AND I WILL-- I WILL HOLD THIS. AND AS-- AND AS WE-- AS WE GO UP ON THE, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE JUST SORT OF SOCKET WRENCH DOWN. SOCKET WRENCH THAT DOWN. MAYBE TAKE THAT OFF-- ACTUALLY, I'LL DO THIS. I'LL HOLD THIS YOU, DO DO-- YOU DO THAT SIDE.
I GOT IT!
Stephen: READY? I'LL HOLD THIS. "LOGAN" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. SIR PATRICK STEWART, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CHRIS COLFER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS A GOLDEN GLOBE-WINNING ACTOR BEST KNOWN FOR HIS WORK ON "GLEE" AND CAPTAIN OF THE "STARSHIP ENTERPRISE." PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS COLFER. â™ª â™ª â™ª ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU AS C TIME? THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL. WHY AREN'T YOU SINGING ALL THE TIME?
OH, THANK YOU! I GUESS I DIDN'T REALLY THINK I HAD A GOOD VOICE BECAUSE I THINK ON THE SHOW, LIKE MY CHARACTERS ALWAYS MADE FUN OF THE SINGING AND HAD TO COMPETE WITH REALLY POWERFUL FEMALE PERFORMERS. SO I GUESS I GOT A LITTLE SUBCONSCIOUS AND I THOUGHT I'M NOT THAT GREAT OF A SINGER IS THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A JOKE MADE ABOUT IT.
Stephen: YOUR VOICE IS LIKE A SILVER BELL.
THANK YOU! I'LL TAKE IT, THANK YOU.
Stephen: OKAY.
I'VE GOTTEN A LOT WORSE.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND-- IS IT LIKE A MUSCLE? I LIKE TO SING BUT I'M NOT A SINGER? IS IT A MUSCLE LIKE YOU LOSE IT IF YOU DON'T DO IT FOR A WHILE?
NOT REALLY, BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS SINGING IN THE SHOWER TO MY GOLDEN RESTREEFARY DISMAY.
Stephen: IS THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER IN THE SHOWER WITH YOU?
NO, NO-- WELL, SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES I GET-- YEAH, SOMETIMES I MISS HIM JUST TOO MUCH.
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE HESITANT TO TAKE WANT PART ORIGINALLY ON "GLEE." WHY WERE YOU HESITANT TO DO THAT?
IT'S SO CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT, LIKE, 2008, IS WHEN I GOT CAST AND I HAD JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND WHAT A DIFFERENT WORLD IT WAS --
Stephen: YOU HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL?
YES, I GRADUATED IN JUNE, AND I JOINED THE SHOW IN SEPTEMBER.
Stephen: THAT'S CRAZY. A SHOW ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL KIDS THAT HAD PEOPLE HIGH SCHOOL AGE. THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED.
I KNOW, RIGHT. THE REST OF THEM WERE, LIKE, 30. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW. SO IT WAS-- YOU KNOW, MY TALENT WAS VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE. SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE PLAYING AN OPENLY GAY CHARACTER WAS A LITTLE-- A LITTLE TERRIFYING FOR ME.
Stephen: WOW.
AND, ALSO, I WAS IN COLLEGE AT THE TIME SO I HAD TO DROP OUT AFTER MY FIRST TWO WEEKS.
Stephen: OH, WOW, OH, WOW. BUT IT WORKED OUT.
IT WORKED OUT.
Stephen: OVER-RATED.
I THINK I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE ALSO AN AUTHOR. YOU CAN A NEW BOOK CALLED "STRANGER THAN FANFICTION." AND HAVE YOU WRITTEN FAIR LONG TIME?
I'VE BEEN WRITING SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID, BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHAT WRITING REALLY WAS.
Stephen: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH --
Stephen: I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT'S HARD. IT'S ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
I'M SORRY, BEFORE I KNEW WHAT GOOD WRITING WAS.
Stephen: OKAY. HOW DID YOU GET STARTED? WHO DID YOU WRITE FOR?
MY ACTION FIGURES, ACTUALLY. I HAD A FEW OF PATRICK STEWART.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: AS JEAN LUKE PICCARD.
I USED TO MAKE UP STORIES FOR MY ACTION FIGURES AND AT THE END WRITE A LIST OF CHARACTERS "PROFESSOR X.AS OLD MAN." SORRY, PATRICK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WELL, NOW, I UNDERSTAND YOUR GRSMS YOUR FIRST EDITOR.
SHE WAS.
Stephen: IS THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE WOULD, LIKE, GO EASY OW? IT'S A BIT OF A COP-OUT. EDITORS HAVE TO BE TOUGH.
SHE-- THIS IS MY 11th BOOK, AND MY GRANDMOTHER STILL-- THE THE TOUGHEST EDITOR I EVER HAD TO WORK WITH IN MY LIFE.
Stephen: YOU WOULD WRITE STARS A CHILD AND SAY, "GRANDMA, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?"
YEAH, AND THEY WERE SHORT, NO MORE THAN TWO PAGES LONG, AND I BROUGHT THEM TO GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE AND SHE LIKED THEM, SHE KEPT IT DISMAIK IF SHE DIDN'T SHE'S CRUMB PEL IT UP AND THROW IT AWAY.
Stephen: IN FRONT OF YOU?
IN FRONT OF ME. SHE'D SAID, "YOU CAN DO BETTER."
Stephen: IS THAT WHY THIS IS AVAILABLE IN HARDCOVER, SO SHE CAN'T CRUMPLE.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT OTHER BOOKS HAVE YOU WRITTEN?
I HAVE ONE CALLED "THE LAND OF STORIES." IT'S LIKE CATNIP WITH KIDS. AND ANOTHER NOVEL "STRUCK BY LIGHTNING," WHICH IS ALSO A MOVIE. AND I HAVE-- I'M AT THE AGE I HAVE TO HAVE, LIKE, A LIST BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER.
Stephen: THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE. I'M AN ADULT, AND I'M YOUNGER THAN SOME ADULTS. TELL ME ABOUT "STRANGER THAN FANFICTION." FANFICTION-- THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT ALREADY EXIST OUT IN TV OR MOVIES BURNGHT THEY WRITE THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF THEM.
YES.
AND WAITED ENEMY THE RELEASE OF THIS BOOK TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THIS, BUT I WAS ACTUALLY AN AVID FANFICTION WRITER WHEN I WAS A KID.
Stephen: WHO DID YOU WRITE?
I WROTE A SCREENPLAY FOR "ZINA WARRIOR PRINCESS" MOVIE. I WROTE-- I ADAPTED "WICKED" THE MUSICAL, INTO A SCREENPLAY. AND I WROTE "CANDYLAND, THE MUSICAL."
Stephen: THE CHILDREN'S BOARD GAME CANDYLAND?"
CHILDREN'S BOARD GAME.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS?
OH, THIS IS REALLY DARK. OKAY, OKAY, SO I-- I WAS, LIKE, 12, SO FORGIVE ME. BUT I LOOKED UP SOMEWHERE THAT-- ON WIKIPEDIA OR? >>, THAT CANDYLAND HAD BEEN INVENTED FOR KIDS WITH POLO. SO I MADE A MUSICAL ABOUT QIDZ POLO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I HESITATE TO ASK WHAT THE DANCE NUMBERS WERE LIKE. ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT POLO WAS AT THE TIME. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE, A COUGH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT POLO WAS, AND YOU WERE NOT AWARE THAT WRITING EXISTED?
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WRITE FANFICTION ABOUT YOU?
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: HAVE YOU READ IT?
I NEVER GO LOOKING FOR IT. IT ALWAYS FINDS ITS WAY TO ME. BUT WHAT I REALLY-- I SAY-- IT'S ALWAYS VERY-- IT'S LIKE "50 SHADES OF COLFER" SOMETIMES. I'M REALLY VERY TOUCHED THAT EVERYONE DESCRIBES ME WITH ABS.
Stephen: I HAVE NEVER HAD THE HONOR.
IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: CHRIS, LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
Stephen: BOOK NUMBER 11, "STRANGER THAN FANFICTION," IS AVAILABLE NOW. CHRIS COLFER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROY WOOD, JR. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. SUCH LOVELY PEOPLE. SO GENEROUS. MY NEXT GUEST IS A COMEDIAN, AN ACTOR, "DAILY SHOW" CORRESPONDENT AND CAPTAIN OF THE "STARSHIP ENTERPRISE." PLEASE WELCOME ROY WOOD, JR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) â™ª â™ª â™ª
YEAH! STEPHEN COLBERT.
Stephen: HOL HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU DOING SIR?
Stephen: HAPPY BLACK HISTORY MONTH ONE DAY LATE. I APOLOGIZE. I SHOULD HAVE HAD CALLS.
I APPRECIATE IT. IT'S AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH.
Stephen: IS IT? I DIDN'T KNOW IT OFFICIALLY CHANGED.
SOME WHITE DUDE TOLD US WHAT WE SHOULD DAHL IT NOW.
Stephen: GOOD, GOOD. SPEAKING OF WHITE DUDES, DID YOU SEE DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH LAST NIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU-- WHAT DID YOU--
HE WAS UP THERE. YOU KNOW, HE WAS TALKING. IT WAS ENGLISH. HE SPOKE ENGLISH.
Stephen: HE WAS, YEAH.
I'M VERY CONCERNED, BECAUSE, AS A MINORITY, AS A BLACK PERSON, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS OTHER MINORITIES, UP UNTIL THIS POINT, IT MAKES ME NERVOUS BECAUSE I KNOW WE NEXT, YOU KNOW. BLACK PEOPLE AT SOME POINT, WE ARE ON THE LIST. AND YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND WOMEN AND SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE MUSLIM BAN AND THE TRANS COMMUNITY. IT'S LIKE WALKING INTO THE HOUSE AND SEEING YOUR SIBLING GETTING A WHOOPING AND YOU KNOW YOU NEXT. IT'S NERVE-RACKING.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO, GO BACK UP ON THE THE DOOR?
YEAH. YOU WALK IN THE HOUSE AND YOU SEE THE MUSLIMS LAYING OVER TRUMP'S LAP. BLACK PEOPLE COME HERE! NO! GO UPSTAIRS AND GET MY STOP AND FRISK. NO, OBAMA SAID WE DIDN'T HAVE TO STOP AND FRISK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.
Stephen: YEAH.
AND IT JUST-- IT MAKES ME SCARED BECAUSE BLACK HISTORY MONTH, ALL YOU SAW WAS TRUMP TAKING PICTURES WITH ALL OF THESE AFFLUENT BLACK PEOPLE, AND YOU HAVE TO BE LEERY OF SOMEONE WHO SAYS THAT HE WANTS TO GIVE YOUR GROUP RIGHTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DENYING RIGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. SOONER OR LATER, THAT SNAKE IS GOING TO BITE YOU, TOO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, HE SAYS-- DONALD TRUMP SAYS-- HE SAYS HE HAS A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. HE SAID-- I WANT TO GET THIS CORRECTLY-- HE SAID, "THE BLACKS LOVE ME." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. THAT'S NOT ME.
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO FACT CHECK HIM ON THAT ONE?
HE SHOULD ASK MORE BLACKS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ANOTHER NOW, LISTEN, WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. YOU'RE A "DAILY SHOW" CORRESPONDENT. I WAS PROUDLY A "DAILY SHOW" "DA MANY YEARS.
PAVED THE WAY.
Stephen: I WAS IN THERE AT THE BEGINNING. YOU GO ON THE ROAD AND DO THESE FIELD PIECES OUT THERE. HOW IS YOUR SOUL DOING? BECAUSE YOU GO OUT THERE, AND YOU TALK TO THE LOVELY PEOPLE OUT THERE, WHO PERHAPS HAVE DIFFERENT WORLD VIEWS THAN YOU DO.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: AND YOU HAVE TO COME BACK WITH THE COMEDY AND EDIT IT AND PEOPLE GET MAD AT YOU.
PEOPLE GET VERY MAD AND VERY FAST-- I HAVE NOT BEEN SUED PERSONALLY.
Stephen: YOU JUST WAIT.
THEY WANT TO SUE ME, I TELL THEM I'M ON "THE LAT "THE LATE S STEPHEN COLBERTMENT. THAT'S WHAT I TELL THEM.
I GOT SQUARED ONE TIME IN NORTH CAROLINA. THEY HAVE A LAW IN PLACE-- BUSINESSES CAN DENY SERVICES TO PEOPLE JUST ON THE SUSPICION THAT YOU'RE GAY.
Stephen: WHAT?
"I THINK YOU LOOK GAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, I'M NOT SERVING YOU." GLI HEARD ABOUT LAWS LIKE, "I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING CAKE," OR "I'M NOT TAKING PHOTOS."
CORRECT. NOSBAKE A GAY WEDDING CAKE. WE SET UP A BARBECUE TRUCK AND CALLED THEM GAY TO THEIR FACE.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE TRUCK?
BONE BROTHERS BARBECUE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BROTHERS AND BONE.
Stephen: WAS IT GOOD?
OH, YEAH THAT'S WHY THAT I WAS MAD.
Stephen: PEOPLE WOULD COME UP--
PEOPLE WERE SHAKE THE TRUCK.
Stephen: AND YOU WOULD SAY-- "YOU CAN'T HAVE BARBECUE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE GAY?"
DO YOU KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS FOR ME TO OUT YOURSELF AND YOU DIDN'T YOU YOU WERE GAY AND I OUTED YOU.
Stephen: IT'S NOT AS BAD AS DENYING ME BARBECUE.
THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE I DEFINITELY WAS SCARED FOR MY LIFE. BUT WE GOT THE TRUTH OUT THERE AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE SHOW. SO WE KEEP GETTING ON THE PLANE AND DOING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS. HOW HARD IT IS.
IT'S SCARY.
Stephen: YES. NOW, YOU GOT A NEW SPECIAL CALLED "FATHER FIGURE." YOU HAVE A NEW SON I JUST MET. WHAT'S HIS NAME?
HENRY.
Stephen: HENRY, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. URAND YOUR LOVELY WIFE. WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO MAKE THIS-- YOU SAY THIS WAS AINOGE YOUR SON.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY MAKE A SPECIAL OUT OF IT? WHY NOT JUST TALK TO HIM WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT GIDON'T EVEN I'M GOING TO BE ALIVE THAT LONG, MAN, SO I FIGURE I GIVE HIM SOMETHING HE CAN PULL UP ON ITUNES IN A COUPLE OF YEARS --
Stephen: WILL HE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT ON iTUNES?
POSSIBLY, HE MIGHT. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO A CHILD, STEX AND OH, BY NICE AND DON'T MURDER. LIKE, THAT'SACY" ME STREET" TEACHES YOU THAT. BUT WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE MAY HATE YOU FOR THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN AND NOT LETTING THAT PERMEATE YOUR SELF-CONSCIOUS AND AFFECT YOUR SELF-ESTEEM, THAT'S PROBABLY DADDY TALK. SO I DECIDED TO MAKE A SPECIAL AND MADE SURE I TALKED ABOUT RACE AND TALK ABOUT RACE RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY SO SOONER OR LATER, EVEN I'M NOT HERE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION HIM, HE CAN UNDERSTAND THE IDEOLOGIES AND HOW HE SHOULDN'T LET THOSE THINGS AFFECT HIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: ANY SCHOOLS? ANY SCHOOLS YOU'RE GIVING HIM, LIKE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO INSTILL ON MY SON IS ALWAYS LEAVE THE STORE WITH A BACK, PERIOD.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT DEPENDS HOW MUCH I BUY?
IT DON'T MATTER HOW MUCH I BUY, I LEAVE WAY BAG. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE WITH A BAG. AS A BLACK MAN IN THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW I PAID FOR THIS STUFF SO I NEED A BAG. NOT ONLY I DO NEED A BARK I NEED THAT RECEIPT AND I WANT PEOPLE TO STAIP TOLL THE OUTSIDE. I WAS AT BEST BUY, STAPLE THE RECEIPT TO THE OUTSIDE LIKE CHINESE CARRYOUT. I'M NOT LEAVING THE STORE, NO MATTER WHAT I BUY, I'M LEAVING WITH A BAG. YOU DON'T WANT QUESTIONS FROM THE SECURITY GUARD PUP DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SECURITY EXWRD HAS BEEN THROUGH. HE MIGHT SNAP.
WHAT YOU GOT IN THAT BAG? I GOT THE RECEIPT. SNOW NOE! HE'S GOING FOR A GUN!
Stephen: STAY SAFE.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
