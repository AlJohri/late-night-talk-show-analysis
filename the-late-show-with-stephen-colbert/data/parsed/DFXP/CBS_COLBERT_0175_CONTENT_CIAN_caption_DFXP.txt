Stephen: HI, WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, BEFORE WE START THE SHOW TONIGHT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A MESSAGE, REALLY FROM MY HEART. FOR ALL THE YEARS THAT I HAVE LIVED IN THIS CLI, I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT SO DIVIDED. AND AT A TIME OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY, AND GRIEF,-- EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE. I'M TRYING TO GIVE A MESSAGE FROM MY HEART. EXCUSE ME. I'M TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE COMPLEX STATE OF AFFAIRS IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW.
WELL THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE YOUR THEATER A POKE STOP.
Stephen: LOOK, THERE HAS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF HUMAN DIGNITY LEFT THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER WITH A LEVEL OF RESPECT THAT-- WE WOULD WANT TO BE TREATED WITH. ALL RIGHT, I AM GOING TO CATCH Y'ALL, I'M GOING TO CATCH Y'ALL!
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES BENJAMIN BRATT, ROB CORDDRY, AND THE MEUTION KAL PERFORMANCE BY THE SHELTERS. FEATURES JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  Captioning sponsored by CBS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THANK YOU. WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. AND ARE YOU GUYS IN A GOOD MOOD? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WOW! THAT WAS ALMOST AGGRESSIVELY GOOD MOOD. I AM TOO, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I FOLLOW THE NEWS ALL THE TIME. WHAT I REALLY LOVE IS A GOOD CELEBRITY FEUD. RIGHT NOW MY FAVORITE ONE IS BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THE NOTORIOUS RBG. AND IT ALL STARTED EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN GINSBURG SLAMMED HIM SAYING, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE COUNTRY WOULD BE WITH DONALD TRUMP AS OUR PRESIDENT. I DON'T WANT TO EVEN CON TELL PLATE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: AND, AND, AND SHE SAID HE'S A FAKEER. HE HAS NO CONSISTENCY ABOUT HIM. HE SAYS WHATEVER COMES INTO HIS HEAD AT THE MOMENT. DAMN, GIRL. THAT IS COLD. THAT IS COLD. BUT JUSTICE GINSBURG, FOR THE RECORD, HE'S NOT PULLING THAT STUFF OUT OF HIS HEAD. (LAUGHTER) NOW-- ALL RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THAT IS SPECIFIC AS CBS WILL ALLOW ME TO BE RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) NOW DONALD TRUMP FIRED BACK CALLING HER COMMENTS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE AND A DISGRACE TO THE COURT. ADDING SHE'S A SIX AT BEST. HERE'S THE THING-- THAT'S HIM, NOT ME, THAT'S HIM, HE SAID THAT, LET'S SAY. HERE'S THE THING, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS, I AGREE WITH DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: THAT DID NOT TASTE GOOD. HERE'S THE DEAL. IS THAT HOWEVER SHE FEELS, SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO INFLUENCE OUR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS UNTIL THERE IS A RECOUNT IN FLORIDA. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: OH, I HAVE SOME SHOCKING NEWS TO REPORT. SOMETHING HAPPENED AT A BASEBALL GAME. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER. I KNOW. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE DEAL. EVERY YEAR AT THE ALL-STAR GAME IN ADDITION TO THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER THEY ALSO SING O CANADA SO THE TORONTO BLUE JAYS DON'T GET THEIR FEELINGS HURT. AND THIS YEAR IT WAS SUNG BY A CANADIAN GROUP CALLED "THE TENORS" AND YOU KNOW, LOOK.
WE'RE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS, ALL LIVES MATTER TO THE GREAT.
Stephen: YES, ONE OF THE TENORS CHANGED THE CANADIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM TO INCLUDE THE PHRASE "ALL LIVES MATTER" AND IT REALLY UPSET THE FOUR PEOPLE IN THE GAME WHO NEW THE-- KNEW THE LYRICS TO O CANADA. NOW THE REST OF THE TENORS WERE AGHAST AT THIS BEHAVIOR TWEETING THE TENORS ARE DEEPLY SORRY FOR THE DISRESPECTFUL AND MISGUIDED LACK OF JUDGEMENT BY ONE MEMBER OF THE GROUP. NOW IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO SAY THEY'RE SORRY BECAUSE CANADIAN TWITTER AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTS WHATEVER YOU TYPE INTO AN APOLOGY. (LAUGHTER) THEY ALSO KICKED THE GUY OUT OF THE GROUP FOR ACTING AS A QUOTE "LONE WOLF." YOU FOOLS. YOU HAD A LONE WOLF IN YOUR GRASP AND YOU LET HIM GO. NOW WE'VE LOST TRACK OF THEM. HE'S IN THE WIND. HE'S A GHOST IN THE DARKNESS, BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A ROGUE CANADIAN TENOR ON THE LOOSE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HE COULD BE ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW, HARMONIZING HIS POLITICAL AGENDA INTO BELOVED CANADIAN SONGS. YNS YITS BEEN ONE WEEK SINCE ALL LIVES MATTER. AND THAT IS THE ONLY CANADIAN SONG I KNOW. OH, THERE IS ALSO DISTURBING NEWS JUST BREAKING FROM 200 MILLION YEARS AGO. SO IF YOU HAVE GOT A YOUNG TRICERATOPS AT HOME, YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST GET HIM OUT OF THE ROOM. BECAUSE NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT INSTEAD OF ROARING, DINOSAURS MADE SOUNDS CLOSER TO THE COO OF A PIGEON OR THE MUMMABLE OF AN OSTRICH. YEAH. FIRST OF ALL, I WAS NOT AWARE THAT OSTRICHES MUMMABLE. I'M AN OSTRICH, YEAH. I'M AN OSTRICH, YEAH-- YEAH, I'M FLIGHTLESS, I'M FLIGHTLESS BIRD WHAT'S THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T CARE. (LAUGHTER) I GOT TO SAY, THE STORY UPSETS ME. CUZ EVERY NEW DISCOVERY ABOUT DINOSAURS JUST MAKES THEM LAMER. IF DINOSAURS SOUNDED LIKE BIRDS IT'S REALLY GOING TO CHANGE JURASSIC PARK.
AFLAC, AFLAC!
Stephen: I STILL WOULD WATCH IT THOUGH. SPIELBERG IS A GENIUS. AFLAC. SPEAKING OF THINGS ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS NEXT WEEK. (LAUGHTER) AND RIGHT NOW--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THAT'S FINE. THAT'S A GOOD CLEAN-- A GOOD CLEAN FAMILY JOKE. AND RIGHT NOW THE REPUBLICANS ARE DRAFTING THE OFFICIAL GOP PLATFORM. THIS IS THE SET OF CORE CONSERVATIVE VALUES THAT TRUMP WILL IGNORE IN FAVOR OF WHATEVER TUMBLES OUT OF THE OLD TALKY-HOLE. HERE IS THE THING THERE ARE SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS IN THE DRAFT RIGHT NOW. FOR INSTANCE, THIS IS TRUE, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED THAT COAL IS AN ABUNDANT CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCE. WELL, OF COURSE, OF COURSE. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE ALL THOSE PHOTOS OF FRESH FACED COAL MINEERS OUT THERE. IT IS REALLY TOO BAD SO MANY OF THEM COME DOWN WITH CLEAN LUNG. AND THE PLATFORM STATES, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STILL FEELS THAT A NATURAL MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN IS THE MOST LIKELY TO RESULT IN OFFSPRING WHO DO NOT BECOME DRUG ADDICTED OR OTHERWISE DAMAGED. COME ON, I KNOW THERE ARE NO STUDIES BACKING THIS UP, BUT IT DOES MAKE SENSE. THINK ABOUT IT, A KID HAS TWO DADS, HE HAS TWO HEROES. BUT WITHOUT A MOM, HE DOESN'T HAVE A HEROINE SO HE TURNS TO HEROIN. THAT JUST-- THAT IS LOGIC. BUT THE HEADLINE-- THE HEADLINE-GRABBER IN THE PLATFORM OF ALL THE GRABBERS IS THE GOP STANCE THAT PORNOGRAPHY HAS BECOME A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS DESTROYING THE LIVES OF MILLIONS. PORN IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS? BUT THOSE VIDEOS ARE LOADED WITH NURSES. (LAUGHTER) AND THEY'RE VERY STERN. YOU WILL TAKE YOUR MEDICINE. I AM SURPRISED REPUBLICANS AREN'T EMBRACING PORN. IT'S PROFREE TRADE. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS PAYING FOR PIZZA BY BARTERING THEIR SAUSAGE. AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET IS DOING. AND MOST OF ALL THE GOP AND BORN BOTH HAVE THE SAME CORE MESSAGE. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. (APPLAUSE) NOW JOBS FOR EVERYONE. SAY I HAD TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS GETTING REALLY EXCITING. FEAR IS A TYPE OF EXCITE, RIGHT? AND I AM PERSONALLY VERY EXCITED BECAUSE NEXT WEEK EVERY NIGHT AFTER THE CONVENTION, THE LATE SHOW WILL BE LIVE. AND I HOPE YOU WILL BE ALSO. NOW THE BUZZ IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN BOTH CAMPS IS THAT BOTH HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP ARE APPARENTLY ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THEIR RUNNING MATE. CLINTON'S CHOICE WILL LIKELY COME NEXT WEEK. BUT THIS FRIDAY TRUMP IS HOSTING A MAJOR EVENT TO ANNOUNCE HIS PICK AHEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND. IT WILL BE LIKE LEBRON JAMES' DECISION, ONLY THIS TIME ALL OF CLEVELAND WILL TRY TO FLEE TO SOUTH BEACH. SO LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK. AT THIS YEAR'S TOP PROSPECTS WITH THE LATE SHOW VICE PRESIDENTIAL DRAFT PREVIEW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HI, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. WELCOME THE 2016 VEEP DRAFT PREVIEW WHERE WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHO COULD BE NUMBER ONE AT COMING IN SECOND. JOINING ME AS ALWAYS WITH ANALYSIS, A MAN I'M PROUD TO CALL MY FRIEND, STEVE COLBERT, THANK YOU, STEPHEN, IT'S AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO APPEAR ALONGSIDE A BROADCAST LEGEND.
Stephen: THANK YOU, STEVE, FOR ME IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A YOUNGER, MORE TALENTED MIRROR. THIS YEAR WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT YOUNG PROSPECTS, SOME JUST DECADES OUT OF COLLEGE. LET'S START WITH THE LEADING CONTENDERS TO JOIN TEAM TRUMP. ANALYSTS EXPECT THE PICK TO GO TO NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH OR INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: I'M SORRY, I FELL ASLEEP WHEN MIKE PENCE'S FACE APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. STEVE, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?
GREAT FIELD, WHO KNOWS, IF TRUMP PICKS RUNNING MATES THE WAY HE PICKS ACTUAL MATES HE COULD GO WITH ALL THREE. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: NOW LET'S DIVE RIGHT INTO THE NUMBERS. STARTING WITH THE BIG MAN CHRIS CHRISTIE WEIGHING IN AT LET'S JUST SAY LESS THAN IT USED TO BE, HE'S WORKING ON IT. HE IS A BRASH, POWER PLAYER NOT AFRAID TO THROW SOME ELBOWS AND AS HE HAS SHOWN WITH THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE, THE MAN REALLY KNOWS HOW TO SHUT DOWN THE LANE. PLUS YOU KNOW HE WON'T GO FREE AGENT BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE A HOSTAGE SITUATION. OVER TO YOU, STEVE.
Stephen: THANKS, STEPHEN. IF DONALD LEADS OFFER THE DRAFT WITH CHRISTIE, TEAM CLINTON MIGHT HAVE A HEAVY HITTER LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN, A FAN FAVORITE. SHE KNOWS HOW TO FIRE UP A CROWD, A FAN FAVORITE WHO IS KNOWN FOR HER STRONG SPLAI ON THE LEFT WING. ANALYSTS SAY HER DRAFT ODDS ARE LOW BUT I COULDN'T COUNT HER OUT. SHE AND CLINTON ALREADY HAVE MATCHING UNIFORMS. MEANWHILE, TEAM TRUMP HAS SHOWN GREAT INTEREST IN FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH, AKA THE HUMAN SNOWMAN. GINGRICH PLAYED CENTER IN THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS OF THE 1990ST AND IS LOOKING FOR A REREMATCH MATCH, GINGRICH IS KNOWN FOR PILING UP BIG NUMBERS OF HIS OWN, OF WIFES IN THIS CASE. HE BRINGS THREE OF HIS OWN, MEANING TOGETHER HE AND TRUMP COULD PUT UP A DOUBLE TRIPLE. THAT'S RIGHT, STEVE. PLUS TRUMP IS WILLING TO TAKE WILD SHOTS NO ONE ELSE WOULD TAKE. LIKE GINGRICH'S PROMISE THAT HE WOULD HAVE A MOON KOL KNEE BY 2020, A LITTLING PROS PECK BECAUSE IF TRUMP WINS, THAT'S WHERE MANY AMERICANS WILL WANT TO LIVE. HA, HA, HA, HO, HO, HO. AND BOOM GOES THE DEMOCRACY. BACK TO YOU, STEVE, FOR MORE ON TEAM HILLARY.
Stephen: WELL, THE EXCITEMENT BUILDS AS SECRETARY CLINTON COULD PICK VIRGINIA SENATOR TIM KAINE.
I'M SORRY, SEEING KAINE PICTURE MADE ME GO A LITTLE MIKE PENCE ON YOU. LET'S LOOK AT KAINE PREDRAFT STATEMENT.
I AM BORING.
Stephen: BOOM, THE MAN NAILED IT. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S GRACE UNDER PRESSURE RIGHT THERE. THAT STATEMENT REMINDED ME OF VICE PRESIDENT ALLBEN BARKLEY'S FAMOUS DECLARATION, WHO AM I AGAIN? NOW STEPHEN, WHO ELSE IS ON DRAFT DONALD'S LIST?
Stephen: WELL, COACH TRUMP HAS TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK AT INDIANA GOVERNOR AND DEHYDRATED NEWT GINGRICH MIKE PENCE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I DON'T WANT TO GO TO CLEVELAND, MOM. I DON'T WANT.
WHAT? HOW LONG WAS I OUT. NOW JUST LISTEN TRUMP'S EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS PROSPECT.
HE WILL BE CALLING UP MIKE PENCE, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE A GOVERNOR, A VICE PRESIDENT, WHO THE HELL KNOWS.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. WHO THE HELL KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT MIKE PENCE. I BELIEVE HE IS THE BEFORE PICTURE ON THE BOX OF JUST FOR MEN. GREAT ANALYSIS, STEPHEN. BUT DON'T FORGET REPORTS ARE TRUMP'S LOOKING FOR AN ATTACK DOG AS HIS RUNNING MATE. AND AS UNPLE DICTABLE AS THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN, HE MIGHT MEAN AN ACTUAL ATTACK DOG. IT WILL BE THE FIRST SINCE THE CANDIDACY OF VICE PRESIDENT HOOCH. WELL, THAT DOES IT FOR THE PREVIEW OF THE 2016 VICE PRESIDENTIAL DRAFT, JUST THINK, ONE OF THESE POWERFUL FIGURES COULD SOON BE CUTTING A REASONON AT YOUR MUNICIPAL WASTE TREATMENT PLANT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BENJAMIN BRATT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT WAS EXECUTIVE REY CURTIS ON LAW & ORDER, AND IS NOW PLAYING A CHARACTER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAW IN "THE INFILTRATOR."
WHO AM I TO STAND IN THE WAY OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO INDULGE IN SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR. SALU D.
THANK YOU.
THE POLITICIANS THINK IT'S A DRUG WAR, SHOOT THEM UP DIRTY HARRY, BUT I SAY IT IS A BUSINESS LIKE ANY OTHER. PROFITS UP, PEOPLE COME, PROFITS DOWN, THEY LEAVE. BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IN MY BUSINESS NOTHING GOOD EVER COMES IN THE ABSENCE OF TRUST. WITHOUT IT THERE IS NO LOYALTY.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME BENJAMIN BRATT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS.
I SAW WHAT HE DID, STEPHEN. I SAW WHAT JEFF DANIELS DID, STEPHEN SCZ YES, ALL THE PEOPLE THAT KISSED ME ON THE MOUTH WHEN WE CAME OUT.
I THOUGHT WE WOULD START A NEW TRADITION.
Stephen: DID WE COME CLOSE JUST THEN.
I BACKED OFF AT THE LAST MINUTE.
Stephen: NOT ON MY ACCOUNT, PLEASE. THAT LOOK YOU HAD, IN THAT-- IN THAT MOVIE? IN THE MOVIE WITH THE BEARD.
PARTLY INSPIRED BY YOU, I HAVE TO ADMIT.
Stephen: ME?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU WERE BETWEEN JOBS.
Stephen: BETWEEN THE SHOWS I HAD THE LOOK I CALLED THE HOMELESS SEA CAPTAIN.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A HOMELESS SEA CAPTAIN.
DON'T I?
Stephen: YOU STILL LOOK VERY-- VERY TOUGH, YOU LOOK DISTINGUISHED AND DANGEROUS TOO.
WERE YOU SHOCKED WHEN YOUR BEARD CAME IN, WHEN YOU LET IT GO THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY ALMOST ALL WHITE.
Stephen: YEAH.
I WAS TOO LIKE WHAT HAPPENED.
Stephen: I DONE DIE MY HAIR, THIS IS MY HAIR COLOR BUT FROM THE EYES DOWN, I'M WHITE EVERYWHERE, MY MAN. I'M LIKE-- YEAH. I AM-- UP HERE, ME, DOWN THERE, ANDERSON COOPER, EF RADIO-- EVERYWHERE ELSE, THE SILVER FOX.
WE HAVE SORT OF A HAIR OREO COOKIE HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE THIS IS REAL BLACK, I'M WHITE FROM HERE DOWN TO HERE AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THIS.
Stephen: I'M TALKING ABOUT MY LEGS.
Stephen: OF COURSE YOU ARE. OF COURSE YOU ARE. IT'S A FAMILY SHOW, PLEASE. WHICH HAD BRYAN CRANSTON ON THE OTHER NIGHT TO TALK ABOUT "THE INFILTRATOR."
HE'S [BLEEP], ISN'T HE?
Stephen: WHAT A CREEP, WHAT A CREEP AND NO TALENT, RIGHT.
TRUE. I FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY.
Stephen: REALLY. HE'S JUST COASTING AT THIS POINT. THIS MOVIE LOOKS FANTASTIC. AND ALSO A LITTLE SCARY. BECAUSE THIS IS A REAL STORY. YOU PLAY, LET'S SEE IF I GET THIS RIGHT, ROBERTO ELCAINO.
PERFECT.
Stephen: AND YOU ARE PABLO ESCOBAR'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.
ONE OF HIS TOP LIEUTENANTS. THIS FILM IS ACTUALLY BASED ON A REAL SERIES OF EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN THE EARLY 19 '80S, THE HEYDAY OF THE COCAINE COWBOY. AND IT CENTERS ON A FEDERAL AGENT PLAYED BY BRYAN WHO IN REAL LIFE WENT UNDER DEEP COVER FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS. AND INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE DRUGS, HE DECIDED TO FOLLOW THE MONEY. HE COZIED UP TO MEMBERS OF THE MEDIEN CAR TELL AND CROOKED BANKERS OF THE BANK OF CREDIT AND COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL.
Stephen: THAT IS NOT AN EASY THING, COZZEING UP TO THE CARTELL DOES NOT VAY GREAT RETIREMENT PLAN.
NO, THERE IS NOT A BIG SAFETY NET. ULTIMATELY WHAT IT BECOMES IS THE ULTIMATE ACTING JOB. AND THE REAL MAN, ROBERT MAZUR WHO BRYAN PLAYS IN MY MIND IS A KIND OF HERO AND ALMOST CRAZY IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF COURAGE HE HAS.
Stephen: HE WAS HERE.
WAS HE.
Stephen: HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE THEATER THE NIGHT THAT BRYAN WAS HERE, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS BECAUSE HE STILL CAN'T REVEAL WHO HE IS. BRYAN SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STUDIO AND I GOT OUT OF HERE AS FAST AS I COULD.
AFTER YOU SEE THIS FILM OR READ HIS BOOK, YOU WOULD BE THE SAME WAY, I MEAN-- .
Stephen: CAN I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SCENE THERE, IN THE SCENE, DOES SOMETHING WORKS GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY, DOES SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN WITH THAT KNIFE BECAUSE THAT CAMERA LINGERS ON THAT KNIFE FOR A LONG TIME. THAT ONION REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE BRYAN CRANSTON'S HEAD AFTER A WHILE.
THE THREAT IS DEFINITELY IMPLIED. BUT MY PROBLEM WITH THE SCENE IS NOT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SCENE, IT'S WHEN I SHOWED UP ON THE SET TO MAKE THAT SCENE, IT SAY HEAVY SCENE WITH BRYAN CRANSTON AND REALLY REVEALING IN TERMS OF WHAT MY CHARACTER'S MOTIVATIONS ARE. BUT ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT, STEPHEN, IS LIKE THIS IS NOT QUALITY CUTLERY. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO-- SLICE AND DICE THIS ONION LIKE I KNOW HOW I REALLY CAN DO. I HEARD YOU ARE A BIT OF A-- .
Stephen: I LIKE TO COOK, IT WAS A BAD KNIFE?
IT WAS A TERRIBLE KNIFE.
Stephen: IT LOOKED LICK IT WAS HAVING TROUBLE GOING INTO A POTATOE.
IT WAS AS SHARP AS A BALANCEPINE HAMMER.
Stephen: ARE YOU A COOK, DO YOU ENJOY.
I DO,.
Stephen: CAN YOU DO WITH THE FUNNING IRES CURLED UNDER.
I KNOW HOW TO SLICE AND DICE AN ONION. DO YOU CUT IT FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS BEFORE YOU COME DOWN AND GET THE LITTLE DICE.
Stephen: EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS, FOUR, THAT IS FOR AMATEURS AM I HAVE NEVER BEEN A GOOD COOK BUT I ENJOY IT, IT IS LIKE A THERAPY IT IS A PILE OF ONE THING AND AN HOUR LATER IT IS A PILE OF ANOTHER THING. AND PEOPLE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IT TASTES GOOD.
I HEARD THAT YOU HAVE QUITE A MEAN BOLOGNAISE.
Stephen: I DO, I DO, I STOLE IT FROM THIS LITTLE LOCATION CALLED "THE NEW YORK TIMES."
WERE YOU SLOW COOK EVERYTHING.
Stephen: YEAH.
I SAW THAT TOO. HI A RECIPE OF MY OWN, OF THE SAME DISH BEFORE THAT, BUT I READ THAT ARTICLE AND IT IN FACT ENHANCED MY OLD RECIPE.
Stephen: DO YOU LOOK COOKING SHOWS AND STUFF LIKE THAT? THAT IS ONE OF MY GREATEST RELAXATIONS IS WATCHING CHOPPED.
YOU LOVE CHOPPED.
Stephen: I LOVE CHOPPED.
THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE REALITY SHOWS. NEXT TIME I COME BACK WE WILL DO A VERSION OF CHOPPED.
Stephen: THAT IS FANTASTIC AM WE HAVE ONE HERE CALLED SMOOSHED.
DO YOU REALLY?
Stephen: WE DO, YOU ONLY HAVE ONE MINUTE AND IT IS ONLY WHAT IS IN THE BREAK ROOM FRIDGE. LIKE MARSHMALLOWS AND PEANUT BUTTER FLUFF.
TO YOUR POINT, I ENJOY COOKING FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS A LEISURE ACTIVITY. ALWAYS INVOLVING FAMILY. I COME FROM A LATIN FAMILY, OF COURSE, THAT IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE FOR US. BUT IT IS ACTUALLY KIND OF FUN. IT'S A BIT LIKE WATCHING A CAR CRASH WHEN YOU WATCH PEOPLE ON CHOPPED, THEY GET THIS MYSTERY BAS KELT, LIKE WHAT IS SQUIDJERKY ANYWAY, WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH SQUID JERKY AND COTTON CANDY AS AN APPETIZER, AS AN EXAMPLE.
Stephen: I WOULD MAKE LIKE A SORT OF SWEET AND SOUR BRITEL AND BREAK IT UP OVER CORN MEAL (LAUGHTER)
YOU COULD.
Stephen: IF CORN MEAL IS ONE THE INGREDIENTS.
IT'S REALLY GOOD, GUYS.
Stephen: DO YOU ENJOY PLAYING A BAD GUY? BECAUSE HE IS A BAD GUY, RIGHT? IS HE A LAWYER FOR.
I THINK HE WOULD BE LOOSELY DESCRIBED AS THE BAD GUY. WHAT IS SO COMPELLING.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOSELY, IS HE ONE OF THE HEADS OF A MURDEROUS DRUG CARTELL, WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF BAD.
WELL, THERE IS THAT, THAT'S TRUE. BUT ALL KIDDING A SIDE, WHAT I FOUND COMPELLING FROM AN ACTOR'S POINT OF VIEW WAS TO FINALLY-- THIS IS NOT UNFAMILY TERRITORY, I HAVE PLAYED CARTELL MEMBERS BEFORE. BUT WHAT THE FILMMAKER BRAD FURMAN WAS KEENLY INTERESTED IN DOING WAS SHOWING THAT ALTHOUGH THIS GUY BY HIS OWN DEFINITION IS MERELY CONDUCTING BUSINESS, WE KNOW IT IS A KIND OF SOCIOPATHY THERE ARE DRUGS AND DEAD BODY NSES HIS WAKE WHEREVER HE GOES.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, THAT IS A DOWNER.
HE DOES OPERATE BY A KIND OF MORAL CONDUCT THAT IS ON SOME LEVEL A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE PROTAGONIST OF THE FILM. IN FACT, IT IS THE KIND OF SET OF QUALITIES THAT BONDS THE TWO TOGETHER AND CREATES A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP.
Stephen: DO THEY BECOME REAL FRIENDS.
THEY BECOME REAL FRIENDS. SO BY THE END OF THE FILM, WHAT WE HAVE REALLY DISCOVERED IS THAT AUDIENCE MEMBERS ARE DEEPLY CONFLICTED WHEN HE, IN FACT, IS TAKEN DOWN. AND THAT'S NOT GIVING THE ENDING AWAY, BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF THE TITANIC, THE SHIP DOES SINK. THIS ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN.
Stephen: GREAT, GREAT, BUT JACK'S OKAY, RIGHT.
JACK'S OKAY.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: BENJAMIN BRATT. HE IS A BAD GUY IN "THE INFILTRATOR" IN THEATERS TODAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WITH OUR FRIEND ROB CORDDRY.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU MAY KNOW MY NEXT GUEST FROM LITTLE PROJECTS LIKE THE DAILY SHOW, HOT TUB TIME MACHINE AN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. HE NOW STAFERS IN "BALLERS," PLEASE WELCOME THE GREAT ROB CORDDRY.
THIS IS EXCITING, IT IS SO LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. THIS IS SO GREAT.
THIS IS YOUR THING, THIS IS YOUR SHOW.
Stephen: YEAH.
THE WHOLE THING. I GET IT, I GET IT, I KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS, I KNOW YOUR FIRST QUESTION. I KNOW, LET ME JUST-- I GOT IT FROM HERE. YEAH, YEAH, HE IS GREAT TO WORK WITH. A GREAT GUY IN PERSON AND HE REALLY COMES OFF.
Stephen: THAT IS IT, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THE ROCK.
YOU CAN JUST CROSS IT OFF. HE COMES OFF AS, IN PERSON HE COMES OFF AS JUST VERY BIG AND A LARGE PERSON. HE COMES OFF AS HUGE.
Stephen: YEAH. HE'S 6, 5 AND 260 POUNDS.
THANK YOU, HE LOOKS BIGGER THAN THAT. YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU'RE NOT A SMALL GUY BUT HAVE I SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER AND YOU LOOK LIKE A TODDLER NEXT TO HIM.
I WOULD RATHER NOT STAND NEXT TO HIM.
Stephen: THE CLIP WE HAVE OF YOU.
YEAH.
Stephen: NEXT TO THE ROCK.
YEAH, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY, I DON'T WANT-- SHOULD I GIVE IT-- I HIT I HIM-- .
Stephen: DON'T GIVE IT AWAY.
OH, I JUST DID.
Stephen: SEE IF ANYONE CARES, OKAY?
HEY JOE. I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.
I'M SORRY, GIVING YOU LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL WASN'T ENOUGH.
I NEED YOU TO CLOCK ME.
GET THE WHREEP [BLEEP] OUT OF HERE.
NO, IT'S MY PREGAME RITUAL. IT HELPS KILL THE BUTTERFLIES.
NOW YOU ARE NERVOUS.
IT JUST GETS THE COMPETITIVE JUICES-- I ASSUME YOU WANTED OPEN HAND, I MEAN I CAN BALL IT UP FOR YOU, IF YOU WANT, SANDWICH STYLE.
QUITE ENOUGH, NO SANDWICH.
ALL RIGHT.
I DOT HIM GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WAS THAT ENJOYABLE? DID YOU REALLY-- ARE YOU REALLY HITTING HIM THERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK. IT COMES OFF LIKE I AM.
Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE YOU REALLY HIT HIM.
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A PROFESSIONAL WES ELLER. IS HE SO USED TO TAKING FAKE PUNCHES AND HITS. THE STUNTMAN BEFORE THE SCENE WAS LIKE-- .
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY HIT HIM.
I DIDN'T. THE STUNTMAN BEFORE THE SCENE, HE WASN'T ON SET YET AND HE WAS JUST LIKE SMACK HIM. IS HE A WRESTLER, HE'S BIG, YOU CAN HIT HIM, HIT HIM AS HARD AS YOU CAN. IT WILL BE FINE. SO.
Stephen: THE STUNTMAN TOLD YOU TO HIT THE ROCK.
YEAH, YEAH. AND THEN HE GOT ON SET AND I TOLD HIM. AND HE WAS LIKE DON'T HIT ME! WHAT ARE YOU-- WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY? WHO TOLD YOU THAT? SO NO, I DIDN'T HIT HIM. IT'S FAKE. WE DIDN'T EVEN PRACTICE IT THOUGH CUZ HE'S SO GOOD, JUST TAKE A SWING AND I WILL MOVE MY HEAD.
HE MOVED HIS HEAD AND WE MOVED ON, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU PLAY A MONEY MANAGER IN SPORTS ON THIS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
YOU KNEE, I COULD USE A REALLY GOOD MONEY MANAGER, I THINK. I BUY A LOT OF STUPID STUFF.
Stephen: UH-HUH. DID YOU DO AMAZON PRIME YESTERDAY.
WHAT?
Stephen: YESTERDAY WAS PRIME DAY.
DWET OUT OF HERE.
Stephen: YOU MISSED IT, YOU MISSED PRIME DAY.
DAMMITY. I ALWAYS MISS PRIME DAY.
Stephen: YEAH.
IT'S LIKE DOESN'T HAPPEN-- IT'S LIKE HANUKKAH, IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THE SAME DAY EVERY YEAR. YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE-- IT IS LIKE A JEWISH HOLIDAY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD PROBABLY MOVE ON.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOUR SHOW.
YOU ARE THE GUEST THOUGH.
YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE.
Stephen: DID THIS CHANGE, YOU'RE A SPORTS FAN.
I'M A FOOTBALL FAN, MI A SPORTS FAN.
Stephen: THAT'S A SPORT.
TECHNICALLY I GUESS YOU ARE RIGHT.
Stephen: IT IS A SPORT.
I WILL GIVE THIS ONE TO YOU.
Stephen: THAT IS ONE MORE SPORT THAN I FOLLOW.
IT IS A SPORT. I FOLLOW FOOTBALL.
Stephen: DID THIS CHANGE HOW YOU LOOK AT SPORTS DOING A SHOW ALL ABOUT THE BUSINESS END OF SPORTS.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OH MY GOD. WELL SO YOU KNOW YOU READ NEWSPAPERS AND YOU SEE, YOU KNOW, YOU SEE A HEADLINE OR JUST A LITTLE BITE IN AN ARTICLE THAT SAYS LIKE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE STALLED. AND BASICALLY BEFORE THE SHOW, I HAD WELL, THAT IS GOING TO SCREW MY FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM. BUT NOW I'M LIKE, YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THE DRAMA THAT GOES IN TO THAT-- THOSE, YOU KNOW, FEW WORDS. THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS, THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE STALLED MEANS LIKE PEOPLE ARE CRYING, GUYS ARE CHEATING ON THEIR WIVES. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STRIP CLUBS. IT'S A DRAMA. EVERY DAY DRAMA.
Stephen: WOW. I SHOULD WATCH SPORTS.
YEAH, APPARENTLY THERE IS A LOT OF NEWEDDITY IN SPORTS.
Stephen: IS THERE REALLY?
IF YOU, YEAH, NEWEDDITY LIKE-- AS AUTHENTIC AS I THINK IT IS, THEN YEAH, REALLY NUDE.
Stephen: DO YOU GET NUDE, ARE YOU NAKED EVER IN THE SHOW.
NO, BUT I WILL GET NUDE.
Stephen.
I HEARD YOU SAY IT WAS A FAMILY SHOW EARLIER.
Stephen: WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT WHEN WE CUT TO COMMERCIAL.
WHAT I GOT UNDER THIS AIN'T FAMILY. IT'S NOT FAMILY RELATED. YOU KNOW, WE WORK TOGETHER FOR MANY YEAR.
Stephen: AT THE DAILY SHOW WITH THAT JON STEWART GUY.
YEAH, DID NOT CARE FOR HIM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: NO.
I'M SO GLAD-- .
Stephen: I DON'T GET IT, THAT GUY.
I'M SO GLAD HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. JUST WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES HIM SO-- I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT WE WERE SHALL-- YOU AND I WERE A LOT SMARTER.
Stephen: WE WERE THE ROCK OF THAT SHOW, REALLY.
WE MADE THAT SHOW.
Stephen: DO YOU MISS ANYTHING ABOUT THE DAILY SHOW BACK IN THE OLD DAYS, DO YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITE MEMORIES. BECAUSE WE WERE OUT THERE BEFORE ANYBODY KNEW WHAT THE DAILY SHOW WAS. WE WERE ABLE TO GO AND SAY WE ARE FROM THE DAILY SHOW, OH, COME ON IN HERE. THAT WAS BEFORE THEY WOULD SLAM THE DOOR IN OUR FACE.
EXACTLY. I MISS THE PEOPLE. I MISS THE EXPERIENCE, I MISS YOU, YOU KNOW, I MIST ED HELMS, STEVE CARELL, I MISS LIKE-- YOU GAVE ME SOME GREAT ADVICE WHEN I WAS THERE.
Stephen: DID I?
YOU DID. YOU GAVE ME SOME VERY GOOD ADVICE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF THEM, LOOK AT THIS KNOT ON STEPHEN'S TIE. AND NOW LOOK AT THE KNOT ON MY TIE. YOU SEE THAT? THOSE PERFECT DIMP ELS RIGHT THERE? I WAS TIEING MY TIE ONE DAY AND I WENT INTO STEPHEN'S OFFICE AND I GO HOW COME YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PERFECT DIMP EL. AND HE GOES WHEN YOU ARE TIEING YOUR TIE, YOU GOT TO THINK TV. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THE REST IS HISTORY.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND HELPING US THINK TV TONIGHT. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IF THAT'S ALL I EVER TAUGHT YOU, THENS THAT.
NO, YOU TAUGHT ME A LOT.
Stephen: NO, NO, THAT'S REALLY.
YOU SAND BAGGED JON STEWART DURING HIS FINAL SHOW AND SAID WITH A VERY WONDERFUL SPEECH, AND I WON'T, CUZ I KNOW YOU GOT TO GO TO COMMERCIAL, BUT YOU ARE ONE OF MY MENTORS AS WELL. YOU REALLY HELPED ME GET MY LEGS ON THAT SHOW. AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU FOR IT, THANK YOU.
Stephen: I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU FOR--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SEASON TWO "BALLERS" PREMIERS JULY 17th ON HBO. ROB CORDDRY, HE HIT THE ROCK.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, BEING A CELEBRITY, BEING A CELEBRITY IS A REALLY SWEET DEAL. BUT EVEN WE CELEBRITIES HAVE SOME PET PEEVES, SOME THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, BOTHER US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BEING CELEBRITIES. FOR INSTANCE, I AM GLAD YOU ARE A FAN, BUT PLEASE DON'T TRY TO SHAKE MY HAND IF YOU ARE STANDING IN THE NEXTU RINAL, OR ASK TO TAKE A SELFIE WITH ME IF I AM GOING UP FOR COME UN ONIN CHURCH, WE'LL GET IT OUTSIDE. I'M NOT ALONE. IN FACT I ASKED A FEW CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE SHOW TO SHARE A FEW OF THEIR PET PEEVES AND HERE IS WHAT THEY SAID.
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE DISPLAY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. BUT IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT TO ACT, I'M NOT SURE THAT IS.
I DON'T MIND IT WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME FOR MY AUTOGRAPH. BUT I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME FOR MICHAEL FASTBENDER'S AUTOGRAPH, I AM NOT TIME, I'M MICHAEL HIGELSTON, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SOMEBODY HITS ME IN THE FACE WITH A PIPE AND TAKES MY WALLET. IT FEELS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE ALLOW AGAINST THAT KIND OF THING.
JUST BECAUSE I'M A CELEBRITY, DOESN'T GIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO JUST COME UP TO ME AND ASK ME TO GET OUT OF THEIR GARAGE.
I HATE WHEN ALIENS ABDUCT ME JUST SO THEY CAN POINT OUT THE PARTS OF THE X FILES THAT WEREN'T REALISTIC.
YOU KNOW, IT BUGS ME THAT JUST BECAUSE I PLAYED A MURDERER IN THE GREEN MILE PEOPLE ASSUME I'M NOT A MURDERER IN REAL LIFE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW.
GOD, I REALLY HATE WHEN PEOPLE TALK DURING MOVIES. UNLESS I'M IN THE MOVIE AND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE, I LOVE CHLOE. OH, IT'S SUPERANNOYING WHEN I TRY TO GET MY MONEY BACK FOR SOMETHING AND THE STORE WON'T TAKE IT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE RECEIPT OR THE ITEM THAT I BOUGHT. IT'S LIKE-- ITS REALLY NITPICKY.
I HATE IT WHEN I ASK MICHAEL FASTBENDER FOR HIS AUTOGRAPH AND HE SAYS OH, I'M NOT MICHAEL FASTBENDER OOM'S SOMEONE ELSE. AND I'M LIKE I KNOW YOU ARE MICHAEL FASTBENDER SO GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH.
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE ASK ABOUT MY SEX LIFE. MY WIFE AND I PLEFER TO-- PREFER TO JUST SLOW IT TO THEM. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I THINK I REALLY LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT, OH, ONE OTHER PET PEEF, I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I'M FORCED TO WATCH NICK OFFERMAN HAVE SEX. IT'S JUST TOO BEAUTIFUL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY THE SHELTERS.
