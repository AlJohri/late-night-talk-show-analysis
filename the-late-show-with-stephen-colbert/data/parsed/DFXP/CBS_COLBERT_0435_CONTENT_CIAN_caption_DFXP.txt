THE C.I.A. RELEASING NEARLY HALF A MILLION MORE DOCUMENTS PROVIDING AN INSIDE LOOK INTO SLAIN TERROR LEADER OSAMA BIN LADEN'S LIFE. BIN LADEN HAD KIDS FILMS LIKE CARS AND CHICKEN LITTLE AND WATCHED VIRAL YOUTUBE CLIP CHARLEY BIT MY FINGER AND SEVERAL CROCHETING TUTORIALS.
THE COZY IS A LOVELY WAY TO WARM UP THE CAVE YOU ARE HIDING IN. AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE MOSTLY USED THE MOSS STITCH HERE, THE WORKHORSE OF THE ROCHE STITCHES. TO CONNECT THE FRONT PANEL WITH THE REAR, USE A SLIP STITCH, THEN BACKLOOP, SLIP STITCH, BACKLOOP, SLIP STITCH AND SO ON. THE FRONT LOOP V STITCH MIGHT SEEM APPROPRIATE HERE, BUT THE FRONT LOOP V STITCH IS A ZIONIST DECEPTION. USE THE STAGGERED SPIKE STITCH ON THE FRINGE. TO COMPLETE YOUR COZY, SNIP THE EXCESS RED YARN. WAIT. WAIT. THE BLUE YARN -- I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THE RED YARN. OR IS IT THE BLUE YARN? YEAH, I'LL JUST GO WITH THE RED.
ANNOUNCER: IT'S THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT -- BEYONCE AND THE INTERNET. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES: WHOOPI GOLDBERG. KATHRYN HAHN. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM COURTNEY BARNETT AND KURT VILE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOO! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WONDERFUL CROWD HERE AND WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) YOU KNOW, TRUMP AND HIS REPUBLICAN BUDDIES ARE STILL TRYING TO DO ANYTHING. SO FAR, NOTHING. THE LATEST CHOP AT THE T-BALL IS TAX REFORM. TODAY, THEY ANNOUNCED A $1.5 TRILLION OVERHAUL OF THE TAX CODE, WITH MAJOR TAX CUTS TO CORPORATIONS AND THE RICH. THIS IS THE BIGGEST STORY! OR IT WOULD BE, IF WE HADN'T JUST HEARD THAT BEYONCE WILL BE STARRING IN THE NEW "LION KING!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOO! OH, LA, LA, OH, AYE! I TRUST I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY. THIS IS THE MEETING OF DISNEY AND BEYONCE-- THE WORLD'S MOST BELOVED BRAND, AND DISNEY. THIS MOVIE WILL ALSO FEATURE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BEYONCE. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THE ROLE OF SIMBA WILL BE PLAYED BY DONALD GLOVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOPEFULLY DONALD GLOVER WILL BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MAJESTY OF AFRICAN PRIDE EMBODIED IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION BY JONATHAN TAYLOR THOMAS. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, IT'S A HIGH BAR.
Jon: YEAH. DID A GOOD JOB.
Stephen: ENOUGH OF THAT. BACK TO TAX REFORM. THE NEW REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN WILL ESTABLISH THREE TAX BRACKETS, AT 12%, 25%, AND-- WHO AM I KIDDING? JON OLIVER IS PLAYING ZAZU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IZAZU! THIS I♪ THIS IS THE MORNING REPO ♪ I GIVE YOU THE LONG REPORT ♪ ♪ MORNING REPORT!♪ ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: YEAH, YEAH...
Stephen: I HAD LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE '90s. OLIVER IS PERFECT TO PLAY ZAZU, HE ALREADY LOOKS LIKE A BRITISH PA RITE! ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? RIGHT, TAXES. TAXES. DONALD TRUMP IS CONFIDENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOVE THEIR NEW PLAN AND WHY? BECAUSE IT SAVES PAPER.
MOST AMERICANS WILL BE ABLE TO FILE TAXES ON A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, KEVIN? YOU STILL THERE? OR IS IT GOING TO BE A PAPER AND A HALF, EY? HEY, WOW! GREAT JOB!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH! I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE GIVEN A PROP.
IT' ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: I THINK HE JUST SEXUALLY HARASSED A POSTCARD. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, UH-HUH. UH-HUH. UH-HUH. YOU LIKE THAT, BABY? YOU LIKE THAT, BABY? YOU WANT TO SEE MY DEDUCTIONS, HUH? I LIKE MY TAXES LIKE I LIKE MY WOMEN, E-Z. ( APPLAUSE ) HIM, NOT ME. HIM, NOT ME. PASSING ANYTHING WILL GET THE NEWS OFF THE GROWING RUSSIA SCANDAL. REMEMBER FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT? REMEMBER THAT GUY? WELL, WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT MANAFORT CURRENTLY HAS THREE U.S. PASSPORTS, AND HE USED A PHONE AND EMAIL ACCOUNT REGISTERED UNDER A FAKE NAME. "HELLO? PAUL MANAFORT? NO, MY NAME IS GOOD GUY MCINNOCENTFELLA. I'M BAD AT THIS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED WHAT THAT FAKE NAME IS, BUT APPARENTLY MANAFORT'S INTERNET PASSWORD WAS "BOND007." ( LAUGHTER ) HIS CATCHPHRASE: "BOND... CAN SOMEONE PLEASE POST BOND? I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S QUALITY. QUALITY. ( PIANO RIFF ) DOESN'T REALLY STRIKE ME AS A 007. HE LOOKS MORE LIKE A BOND VILLAIN. PAUL MANAFORT, IN "FROM RUSSIA WITH CASH." HIS CHARACTER'S NAME? PUTIN GALORE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: PUTIN. ACCORDING TO MUELLER'S INDICTMENT, MANAFORT "USED HIDDEN OFFSHORE CASH TO BUY PROPERTY, INCLUDING A CONDOMINIUM IN NEW YORK'S SOHO NEIGHBORHOOD." SOHO? EVERYBODY KNOWS ALL THE COOL MONEY LAUNDERING HAS MOVED OUT TO BROOKLYN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT GETS EVEN SHADIER BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT, MANAFORT COMMITTED FRAUD BY CLAIMING HIS DAUGHTER LIVED AT THE APARTMENT WHILE HE WAS ACTUALLY "CHARGING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A WEEK ON AIRBNB." HE'S A POLITICAL FIXER FOR BILLIONAIRE STRONGMEN, BUT HE STILL NEEDS TO MAKE A BUCK ON THE SIDE? ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S LIKE FINDING OUT O.J. IS DRIVING HIS BRONCO FOR UBER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: DON'T GET IN THAT ONE! YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THERE! YOU MIGHT NOT GET HOME ON TIME! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: APPARENTLY THE WHITE HOUSE IS SPOOKED BY MUELLER'S INDICTMENTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME, "THE PROSPECT OF IMPEACHMENT IS BEING  CONSIDERED AS A REALISTIC OUTCOME AND NOT JUST A LIBERAL FEVER DREAM." COME ON, THAT'S NOT A LIBERAL FEVER DREAM. A LIBERAL FEVER DREAM IS LISTENING TO NPR WHILE HAVING A THREE-WAY WITH AN ENDANGERED RHINO AND BERNIE SANDERS ON A PILE OF QUINOA WHILE MCSWEENEY'S PUBLISHES YOUR LIST OF TEN REASONS WHOLE FOODS IS LIKE A JONATHAN FRANZEN NOVEL. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S A FEVER DREAM! ( LAUGHTER ) LONG SENTENCE IS WHAT THAT WAS. A VERY LONG SENTENCE. THINGS ARE GETTING SO BAD THAT FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER AND WHAT YOUR DOCTOR HAS YOU LOOK AT IF YOUR ERECTION LASTS LONGER THAN FOUR HOURS, STEVE BANNON, -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS URGING THE PRESIDENT TO DEFUND MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION. OH, COME ON! MUELLER DOESN'T NEED YOUR MONEY. TRUMP'S SO UNPOPULAR, MUELLER COULD FUND THIS INVESTIGATION WITH AN OPEN GUITAR CASE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ HANG DOWN YOUR HEAD STEVE BANNON ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE PRESIDENT HASN'T TAKEN BANNON'S ADVICE. INSTEAD, HE'S LISTENING TO FRIENDS LIKE NEWSMAX EXEC, CHRISTOPHER RUDDY, WHO SAID. OF BANNON, "I LIKE STEVE, BUT HIS ADVICE IS NOT ALWAYS THE MOST HELPFUL. WHATEVER STEVE SAYS, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE." SO... BE A BLACK SUPREMACIST?
Jon: OH, MY. OH. ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: BUT TRUMP'S NOT WORRIED. HE'S NOT SWEATING THIS ONE. THAT'S WHY, YESTERDAY, HE CALLED A "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER TO PROJECT AN AIR OF CALM OVER THE CHARGES. "HELLO, FAILING 'NEW YORK TIMES,' I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT AT ALL WORRIED  ABOUT THE THING THAT I CALLED YOU UP TO TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CALLED ME TO TALK ABOUT IT." ADDING -- AND THIS IS TRUE -- "I'M NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, AS YOU KNOW ." YEAH, THEY'RE JUST ROUNDING UP ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND ASKING THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU. MAYBE ROBERT MUELLER'S PLANNING YOU A SURPRISE PARTY. THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT AND A NEW PAIR OF BRACELETS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS, TRUMP SAID, "I JUST GOT FANTASTIC POLL NUMBERS." REALLY? MR. PRESIDENT, I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR GOLF, BUT IN THIS GAME, THE LOW NUMBER DOESN'T WIN. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, "59% OF AMERICANS SAID THIS IS THE LOWEST POINT IN U.S. HISTORY THEY CAN REMEMBER." OF COURSE, THAT COULD BE FOR MANY REASONS. DONALD TRUMP... ( LAUGHTER ) KEEP IN MIND, THIS SURVEY INCLUDED PEOPLE WHO LIVED THROUGH "WORLD WAR II, THE VIETNAM WAR, THE CUBAN  MISSILE CRISIS, AND THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST  ATTACKS." AND EACH GROUP ALL SAID, "NOW IS THE WORST TIME." TO BE FAIR, EVERYONE THEY SURVEYED HAD JUST WATCHED THE -- I KNOW PEOPLE ARE BUMMED OUT BUT I WANT TO GIVE OUR NATION HOPE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MANY WAYS THIS IS THE BEST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. WHAT WAYS? GLAD YOU ASKED. AMERICA IS BETTER NOW THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BEFORE. CONSIDER THIS: THERE ARE MORE "FAST AND FURIOUS" MOVIES THAN AT ANY POINT IN HISTORY. ROCK, TYRESE, PATCH THINGS UP. WE HAVE MORE OREO FLAVORS THAN ANYONE EVER WANTED. AND IF YOU TRAVELED BACK IN TIME AND SHOWED ULYSSES S. GRANT YOUR SMART PHONE, HE WOULD BE AMAZED... AT HOW MUCH PORN YOU HAVE ON THERE. ALSO, THANKS TO THAT TECHNOLOGY, YOU CAN BE ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET AND IMMEDIATELY LOOK UP WHAT THE "E" STANDS FOR IN CHUCK E. CHEESE. BY THE WAY, IT STANDS FOR "ENTERTAINMENT." HIS FULL NAME IS "CHARLES ENTERTAINMENT CHEESE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT IS INSANE. SO CHIN UP, AMERICA. THINGS ARE GOING TO BE OKAY, AND I AM GOING TO KEEP SAYING THAT UNTIL I BELIEVE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WHOOPI GOLDBERG IS HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, THERE'S A COUNTRY THAT'S FALLING APART AND FOR A CHANGE, IT'S NOT US. STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, FOLKS! ( JON SINGING ) HAPPY THURSDAY, JOHN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ONE MORE DAY. ONE MORE DAY AND THEN OFF TO THE WEEKEND. FOLKS, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. FOLKS, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THERE'S THIS CRISIS IN SPAIN. WELL, HERE'S THE DEAL: LAST FRIDAY, "THE CATALAN PARLIAMENT DECLARED INDEPENDENCE FROM SPAIN." THEY ARE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT. BUT WILL MOVE INTO SPAIN'S BASEMENT, AND STILL ASK TO BORROW THE CAR. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, SINCE THEN, THE FUTBOL HAS REALLY HIT THE FAN. SPAIN HAS JAILED EIGHT OF THE TOP MEMBERS OF THE CATALAN GOVERNMENT, ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT FOR ITS LEADER, WHO IS IN EXILE IN BELGIUM, MEANWHILE THE PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN DECLARED "I HAVE DECIDED TO CALL FREE, CLEAN AND LEGAL ELECTIONS TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY." BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS "DEMOCRACY" LIKE JAILING EVERYONE THE PEOPLE ELECTED. WHAT DO THEY WANT IN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND SPAIN SO AGAINST IT AND WHAT IS CATALONIA? ISN'T THAT THE MAID IN "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD?" WE ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IN THE EXCITING DEBUT AND CONCLUSION OF MY ONE-PART SERIES: "SPAIN'T MISBEHAVING." ♪ IT WAS EITHER THAT OR "OH, NO YOU MADRIDN'T." ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH WE EVIDENTLY SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH. ( LAUGHTER ) CATALANS FEEL UNIQUE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE, CULTURE, AND LAWS THAT ARE UNLIKE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. KIND OF LIKE FLORIDA, BUT WITHOUT THE SHIRTLESS GUYS GOING THROUGH THE DRIVE-THROUGH WHILE ON FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) CATALANS EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN DISTINCT CUISINE, WITH DISHES LIKE COCA DE MULLADOR. EVIDENTLY, CATALANS INVENTED BAGEL BITES. ( LAUGHTER ) THE CATALANS ALSO PRONOUNCE IT "BAR-SELONA," WHILE THE REST OF SPAIN KEEPS SAYING "BAR-THELONA" AND FRANKLY, THE CATALANS ARE "THICK" OF IT. CATALONIA WAS INDEPENDENT. PART OF THE KINGDOM OF ARAGON, BUT IN THE 15TH CENTURY, KING FERDINAND OF ARAGON MARRIED QUEEN ISABELLA OF SPAIN AND UNITED THEIR KINGDOMS. THEY WERE SO EXCITED, THEY SENT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS TO SHOW NATIVE AMERICANS HOW FUN IT IS TO BE PART OF SPAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) HIS HOUSEWARMING GIFT: SMALLPOX. AND EVER SINCE THEN, BEING UNDER SPANISH RULE HAS CHAFED THE CATALANS LIKE SPANGLY PANTS ON A SWEATY MATADOR. ( LAUGHTER ) THOSE ARE QUITE TIGHT. THIS MAT ADORE COMES PRE-GORED, EVIDENTLY. ( LAUGHTER ) IN THE 1930S, SPANISH DICTATOR FRANCISCO FRANCO TRIED TO DESTROY CATALAN SEPARATISM, KILLING THOUSANDS AND EXILING THOUSANDS MORE. HE SUPPRESSED MUSIC AND EVEN DANCING. FOR MORE DETAILS, JUST WATCH "FOOTLOOSE" WITH THE SPANISH SUBTITLES ON. ( LAUGHTER ) NOWADAYS, CATALONIA IS AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE THAT RESENTS PROPPING UP THE REST OF SPAIN. IT ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY A FIFTH OF SPAIN'S ECONOMY, PRODUCING 25% OF ITS EXPORTS. SO CATALANS FEEL OVER-TAXED AND UNDERREPRESENTED BY A COUNTRY THAT STILL HAS AN ACTUAL KING FELIPE VI. THAT'S RIGHT, THE SIXTH. SO NOT ONLY IS SPAIN OVER-TAXING THEM, THEY'RE HOGGING ALL THE FELIPES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW HERE WE ARE. SPAIN IS NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN. VOWING TO "IMPOSE DIRECT RULE," WITH ONE ANALYST SAYING, "THE STATE MAY BE WILLING TO GO TO WAR TO PRESERVE IT." LISTEN, CATALONIA, AMERICA HAS NO DESIRE TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR, IF YOU DON'T COUNT IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, SYRIA, AND KARDASHIA. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE AMERICANS DO KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT DITCHING A MONARCHY THAT'S TAXING YOU UNFAIRLY TO START A NEW COUNTRY. TRUST US, IT'S GOING TO TAKE COURAGE, DETERMINATION, AND A LOT OF STUPID WIGS. ( LAUGHTER ) THE REST IS REALLY COMPLEX. YOU'LL NEED A NEW CONSTITUTION, YOUR OWN BANKING SYSTEM, A TAX POLICY-- YOU KNOW WHAT, SCREW IT. HERE'S TWO TICKETS (BLEEP). ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S LIKES THE TAX POLICY. HERE'S TICKETS TO "HAMILTON." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S REALLY GOOD! AT FIRST, YOU'RE LIKE "REALLY? HIP HOP? CAN THEY SUSTAIN THIS?" AND THEY TOTALLY CAN! THEN YOU'RE LIKE, "BUT DO I CARE ABOUT ALEXANDER HAMILTON?" THEN YOU TOTALLY DO! JUST HANG IN THERE. BEST I COULD GET WAS FOR MARCH, 2019. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY, GRAMMY, OSCAR AND TONY WINNER WHO ALSO HOSTS "THE VIEW," PLEASE WELCOME WHOOPI GOLDBERG! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HI! HELLO.
Stephen: I'M UP HERE SO I CAN GET A BETTER VIEW OF YOUR SWEATER.
THIS IS BABY BLACK SANTA.
Stephen: BABY BLACK SANTA. WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT. WE'LL BEGIN BY SAYING MERRY ALMOST CHRISTMAS.
ISH. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THANKSGIVING FIRST, BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE CHILLY SOON AND WHAT'S A GREAT WAY TO GET INTO HOLIDAY SPIRIT THAN PUTTING ON YOUR HOLIDAY SWEATER? I DESIGNED THEM SO YOU COULD START WEARING THEM IN NOVEMBER.
Stephen: I THINK IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS, ALL THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: DO YOU SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS OR HAPPY HOLIDAYS? OUR PRESIDENT PROMISED THIS YEAR WE'LL START SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. HE'S PRESIDENT AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO IT, FOLKS.
THE DEAL IS, NOT EVERYBODY CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE HOLIDAY SEASONS, SO SOMETIMES IF YOU SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS, YOU DON'T SAY, I'M SORRY, ARE YOU JEWISH, CATHOLIC, CELEBRATING RAMADAN, HAPPY HOLIDAYS COVERS WHATEVER YOU'RE CELEBRATING, EVEN IF YOU MADE IT UP YOURSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY IS A MERRY CHRISTMAS PERSON, THEN YOU SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS. BUT THIS IDEA EVERYBODY HAS TO ADHERE TO ONE THING, THAT'S NOT AMERICA. AMERICA IS MANY THINGS AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MANY GREETINGS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, I COULD BE WRONG.
Stephen: YOU TALK ABOUT POLITICS OVER AT "THE VIEW."
ALL MORNING.
Stephen: YOU TALK ABOUT WHATEVER'S GOING ON IN THE NEWS.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, MAYBE, THE GREAT ORANGE WHALE HAS SWALLOWED THE NEWS CYCLE. DO YOU GET TIRED OF DO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS GUY AGAIN?
YEAH! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET THAT FEELING, WHOOPI GOLDBERG?
I LOOK AWAY.
Stephen: YOU LOOK AWAY FROM THE NEWS OR THE DISCUSSION?
I LOOK AWAY FROM THE DISCUSSION, I LOOK AWAY FROM THE NEWS BECAUSE, LOOK, HERE'S THE TRUTH, YOU CAN PITCH AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO.
Stephen: MM-HMM. UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO CHANGE THINGS WHICH SURROUND THIS MAN, BE IT A GREAT REPUBLICAN OR A GREAT DEMOCRAT WHO'S DECIDED TO DO PEOPLE INSTEAD OF PARTY, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO CELEBRATE AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN PLACE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING STUFF FOR THE PEOPLE. ALL THE OTHER FOLKS, LIKE IF YOU'RE A SENATOR OR CONGRESS -- IF YOUR SENATOR OR CONGRESSPERSON VOTED FOR THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES SHOULD HAVE GUNS, MAYBE YOU WANT TO RE-THINK IF THAT'S THE PERSON YOU WANT REPRESENTING YOU, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
Stephen: WHOOPI, ARE YOU COMING TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
ACTUALLY, I'M A GUN OWNER, BABE.
Stephen: OKAY. YEAH. AND I ALSO BELIEVE IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. SEE, WE CAN BE LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN ONE BODY, WHICH IS WHAT I ENCOMPASS, BUT I DO KNOW THAT -- YOU CAN CHECK ALL MYSELF. COME FIND OUT WHAT I'M DOING, WHERE I BOUGHT STUFF, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO DO ANYTHING ODD WITH MY GUN.
Stephen: OH, YOU CAN DO BACKGROUND CHECKS? I THOUGHT YOU WERE OKAY WITH HIDDEN CAMERAS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I WASN'T SURE. ( LAUGHTER ) SHOW BUSINESS.
NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.
Stephen: YOU LOVE AN AUDIENCE.
YES, I DO.
Stephen: LET'S SAY ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE, ELIMINATE THE NEGATIVE?
WELL, I THINK WE NEED TO LAY DOWN AND GO -- WE CAN EITHER LAY DOWN AND GO BOO-HOO OR GET UP AND BE PROACTIVE. YOU NEED TO TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT YOU AND FIGURE OUT IF YOU WANT THEM. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE, NOT THE PARTY. IT'S ALWAYS AND SHOULD BE ALWAYS ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: ONE THING THAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, I THINK, IS THERE HAS BEEN MANY REVELATIONS ABOUT POWERFUL MEN ABUSING OR SEXUAL ASSAULTING THEM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. AS A WOMAN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY YOU HAVE BEEN FAMOUS SINCE --
THE EARLY '80s.
Stephen: DID ANY OF THIS SURPRISE YOU?
NO. I MEAN, PEOPLE IN POWER, BE THEY MEN OR WOMEN, ALWAYS PREY ON PEOPLE WHO THEY KNOW WON'T TELL.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY REVELATIONS ABOUT WOMEN IN THIS ONE.
NOT YET BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING, IT'S ALL -- LOOK, IT'S ALL COMING AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WOMEN ARE TAKING BACK THE NARRATIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING, LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT DANGEROUS FOR YOU TO SEXUAL ASSAULT US AND SEXUALLY ABUSE US, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT DANGEROUS, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR POWER BASE IF YOU DO THAT FROM NOW ON BECAUSE WOMEN ARE STARTING TO SPEAK. GAY FOLKS ARE COMING OUT SAYING, HEY, THIS HAPPENED TO ME, TOO. SO IT'S AN ISSUE THAT ISN'T ABOUT SEXUALITY, IT'S ABOUT POWER. AND WHEN YOU PREY ON THE WEAK, THE STRONGER OF US HAVE TO STAND WITH THE WEAK AND SAY WE GOT YOUR BACK AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. WOMEN ARE STANDING UP AND SAYING, HELL, NO, NOT ANYMORE, AND I THINK IT'S GREAT.
WHOO! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU WERE ELECTED TO THE BOARD OF THE ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURES. I BELIEVE HARVEY WEINSTEIN WAS KICKED OUT OF THAT.
THEY REMOVED HIM, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT CAN THE ACADEMY ITSELF DO? DOES IT HAVE ANY POWER OR IS IT CEREMONIAL?
I THINK THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY WE ARE AWARE, AND WE DON'T THINK THIS IS OKAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE IS TALKING NOW. IT'S ON THE TIPS OF EVERYBODY'S TONGUE. LET'S SEE HOW LONG THIS LASTS BECAUSE PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT STUFF AND THAT'S THE THING THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS AND EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS.
Stephen: SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SOMEONE NEW EVERY DAY.
YEAH, AND SO NOW YOU HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT DID I SAY SOMETHING, TOUCH SOMEONE IN A STRANGE WAY? AND I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY, OH, THAT'S SO P.C., BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S GET ALL THAT DONE AND THEN REWRITE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT SO WE CAN DECIDE HOW TO DO STUFF IS THAT LET'S GET BACK TO THESE SWEATERS.
THIS IS VERY HEAVY CONVERSATION.
Stephen: KEEP IT LIGHT, OKAY.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: LATE NIGHT TV. SO THIS --
ARE YOU POINTING AT SOMETHING? ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: I AM POINTING AT YOUR BABY BLACK SANTA.
AH.
Stephen: OKAY. JUST SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME.
Stephen: BABY BLACK SANTA. YOU GOT IT.
Stephen: THIS IS ANOTHER ONE YOU'VE DESIGNED.
YES.
Stephen: WHO CUT THE GINGERBREAD.
YES. AND YOU WILL NOTICE --
Stephen: I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE PUMPKIN SPICE COMING OUT. ( APPLAUSE ) WHY DUD YOU TACK IT ON YOURSELF TO DESIGN CHRISTMAS SWEATERS?
BECAUSE IT MADE ME HAPPY AND I LOVE THE HOLIDAYS AND I THINK IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE SMILE DURING THE HOLIDAYS, IT'S A GREAT THING. I LIKE THEM. THEY MAKE ME HAPPY. AND, SO, I THOUGHT, LISTEN, I CAN DO THIS.
Stephen: DO YOU SELL YOUR CANNABIS OIL FOR JOINTS STILL AND CRAMPS AND STUFF?
YEAH, WE DO. WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA AND JUST BRANCHED OUT INTO COLORADO.
Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WELL, I BROUGHT THIS ONE FOR YOU.
Stephen: THIS IS FOR ME? THIS IS FOR YOU.
Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHAT'S GOING HERE? THAT LOOKS INFLAMED.
I KNOW. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU SHOULD RUB SOME CANNABIS OIL ON IT JUST TO BRING THE SWELLING DOWN.
PERHAPS. DO YOU REMEMBER THE SANTAS YOU COULD GET AND PUT THEM ON AND THE BUTT WENT UP AND DOWN? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I DON'T REMEMBERING. THE JACK HAMMERING SANTAS? NO, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
IT'S A TWERKING SANTA.
Stephen: I DID NOT KNOW THAT ONE.
YES, THEY'RE REALLY FUN. I WANTED TO GET THE SWEATER TO DO THAT. AND THEY SAID, LISTEN -- ( LAUGHTER ) THERE YOU ARE. AND, SO, AND THEY SAID, WELL, IT WILL -- BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY $89. THEY SAID, IF YOU PUT A TWERKING SANTA IN THERE, THIS WILL BE A $400 SWEATER. I SAID, HE CAN JUST HAVE FUZZY F BUTT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WHOOPI'S HOLIDAY SWEATERS ARE NOW AVAILABLE ON ZAPPOS. WHOOPI GOLDBERG, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KATHRYN HAHN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW" ON THIS CRISP THURSDAY NIGHT! MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ACTRESS YOU KNOW FROM "TRANSPARENT" AND "BAD MOMS." SHE NOW STARS IN THE SEQUEL, "A BAD MOM'S CHRISTMAS."
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OF IT, BUT, UM, I'M KIND OF ON A FIRST DATE WITH ONE OF THE SANTAS.

Stephen: WOW. THANK YOU. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS MESSAGE.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: BACKIN WAXING THE (B OF THE DAL DALAI LAMA.
THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM, I HAVE HOLIDAY CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS SINCE MAY, BASICALLY.
Stephen: IS THAT WHEN YOU SHOT THE MOVIE?
WE SHOT THE MOVIE IN ATLANTA IN MAY FOR A CHICAGO CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: IT'S HOT IN ATLANTA.
VERY HOT. >.AND THERE'S A LOT OF FAKE HAIR GOING ON IN THIS PART.
Stephen: AND I IMAGINE A LOT OF WARM CLOTHING.
IT'S AMAZING. MY POOR HUSBAND WHO IS JEWISH AND JUST FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IS GETTING EARLIER AND EARLIER EVERY YEAR, IT'S, LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE BANANAS.
Stephen: WE JUST PASSED HALLOWEEN OFFICIALLY. YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO CHRISTMAS AFTER HALLOWEEN.
ALL I SMELL IS DOUGLAS FUR.
Stephen: ARE YOU A BIG DECORATOR? DO YOU DO THE YARD?
EVERYONE WHEN WE MOVED IN, THEY WERE, LIKE, IT'S BANANAS, THOUSANDS OF KIDS, THE WALKING DEAD, SO MANY CHILDREN, PILES AFTER PILES OF KIDS. SO WE SPENT -- WE GOT IT DECK RAID, SPENT THE MONEY WITH THE STYROFOAM TOMB STONES.
Stephen: TURNED YOUR FRONT YARD INTO A GRAVEYARD.
YES. SO THE NIGHT BEFORE HALLOWEEN IS THE BAD MOM'S PREMIERE. MY DAUGHTER RUNS INTO, SCREAMING. I'M COVERED WITH CRUSTY BABY IS NOSNOT ALL OVER THIS VELVET DRES I SAID, WHAT'S A MATTER? APPARENTLY OUR DOG WAS CHASING A BABY AS I RECALL UP A TREE AND IT FELL INTO OUR DOG'S MOUTH IN FRONT OF HER AND SHE WAS CRYING. I THINK IT DIED ON THE WAY DOWN SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS OUR DOG. SHE WAS CRYING AND I SAID, MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE FUNERAL FOR IT. AS SHE WAS CRYING, SHE WAS, LIKE, "AND WE CAN USE ONE OF OUR TOMB STONES! STONES." SHE NAMED THE BABY SQUIRREL PALM TRUSTEE.
Stephen: YOU TRIED TO CONVINCE ME AND YOURSELF THAT THE SQUIRREL DIED IN MID FLIGHT ON THE WAY TO THE DOG'S MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M A 53-YEAR-OLD MAN. I CAN TAKE IT. YOUR DOG MURDERED THAT SQUIRREL.
NO, NO, NO! ITS HEART EXPLODED.
Stephen: IS YOUR HUSBAND HOME? WAKE UP YOUR CHILD. IT'S TIME SHE LEARNED.
NO PUNCTURE WOUNDS!
Stephen: DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. SWALLOWED IT WHOLE.
IT SWALLOWED IT WHOLE! POOR PALM TREE!
YOU WERE RAISED CATHOLIC. , TOO.
Stephen: YEAH, STILL HANGING THERE, SKIN OF MY TEETH, MY FRIEND.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: OKAY, SO THE KIDS ARE JEWISH, CATH ARE LICK?
A LITTLE IN BETWEEN. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST INCLUSIVE. YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND THAT. SO MY SON, HE GOES TO HEBREW CLASS, WHICH ALWAYS ENDS UP WITH SOME SORT OF NERF WAR. WE'RE, LIKE, WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS CLASS? HE WENT WITH ME TO A FILM SET ONCE IN A CHURCH. I'M, LIKE, IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO THAT, IT'S INTERSECTION JESUS ON THE CROSS, IT'S AN INTENSE IMAGE IF YOU'RE NOT BROUGHT UP WITH IT.
Stephen: IT'S MEANT TO BE AN INTENSE IMAGE.
YES, IT IS.
Stephen: YEAH. HE WASN'T HANGING OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DRIVING HOME A POINT.
RIGHT, VISUALS.
Stephen: YEAH. O HE WAS LOOKING AT IT. I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY AND HE WAS, LIKE, MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY. I SAID, WHAT'S THE MATTER? HE SAID, WHY IS THAT NATIVE AMERICAN NAILED TO THAT CROSS?
Stephen: NATIVE AMERICAN? THAT'S PROGRESSIVE L.A. EDUCATION.
Stephen: CALLED IT A NATIVE AMERICAN AND NOT INDIAN.
YEAH.
Stephen: VERY NICE. I SAID, WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO. IT'S A CONFUSING TIME, GUYS.
Stephen: YEP. AND WHAT DID YOU ANSWER? WE WANTED THEIR LAND! ( LAUGHTER )
I WAS, LIKE, BE GOOD OR SANTA WON'T -- IT'S A MESS. SECULAR, NON-SECULAR, WHAT DO WE DO?
Stephen: GO SEE "A BAD MOM'S CHRISTMAS."
YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S A SEQUEL TO "BAD MOMS." HOW LONG AGO WAS "BAD MOMS"?
WE WERE JOKING, I WAS TAKING OFF MY EYE MAKEUP WHEN THE TRAILER FOR THIS ONE CAME OUT.
Stephen: YOU MADE IT FOR 1.25 AND IT MADE $400 MILLION OR SOMETHING. QUICK, QUICK, ANOTHER ONE! ANOTHER ONE! ( LAUGHTER ) HOW BAD TO THE MOMS GET? OBVIOUSLY (BLEEP) WAXING, WE'VE SEEN THAT.
WE'RE NOT NEGLIGENT MOTHERS, FOR SURE. BUT WE GET TO SEE OUR MOMS IN. THIS SUSAN SARANDON PLAYS MY MOM WHICH IS SO AWESOME.
Stephen: LOVELY. HE'S INCREDIBLE. AND CHERYL HEINZ, CHRISTINE BARANSKI, IT'S AN AMAZING GROUP OF WOMEN. IT'S THE NUTTIEST TIME OF THE YEAR FOR A MOM. YOU'RE JUST SO BUSY TRYING TO MAKE MAGIC HAPPEN FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, IT'S A SWEET LESSON OF JUST LIKE LETTING GO OF EXPECTATIONS AND TRYING TO JUST BE IN THE MOMENT WITH YOUR FAMILY AND NOT WORRY ABOUT, LIKE, THE PERFECTION.
Stephen: YEAH, AND THAT'S THE REAL MESSAGE OF THE SEASON WHICH IS GO ON A FIRST DATE WITH THE MAN WHOSE (BLEEP) HIS MOM JUST WAXED.
