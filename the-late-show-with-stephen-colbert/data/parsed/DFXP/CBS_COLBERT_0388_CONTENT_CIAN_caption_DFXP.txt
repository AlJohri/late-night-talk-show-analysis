Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY AND VANESSA BAYER, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen:  Captioning sponsored by CBS  HEY! HOW ARE YA? WHOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! THANK YOU, SIR! THANK YOU, MA'AM! HOW'S IT GOING? PLEASE SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY! YOU'RE TOO KIND! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I NEED THAT LOVE AND ENERGY BECAUSE I COME TO YOU TONIGHT A BROKEN MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE, THIS AFTERNOON, I WAS SHOCKED BY THIS BREAKING NOOCH:
THE MOOCH IS OUT.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, GONE AFTER JUST A WEEK AND CHANGE ON THE JOB!
THE MOOCH IS TOAST!
STEPHEN: YES, THE MOOCH IS TOAST. THE FRONT-STABBER HAS BEEN BACK-STABBED. ( LAUGHTER ) HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO FIRE EVERYBODY, AND YOU GOT TO ADMIT, HE DELIVERED. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S THOROUGH! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT IS THOROUGH! ( LAUGHTER ) THE MOOCH LASTED AS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR ONLY TEN DAYS. ( LAUGHTER ) YES, TEN DAYS! THAT'S NOT EVEN ONE WHOLE PAY PERIOD. ( LAUGHTER ) HIS GOING AWAY PARTY CAN SERVE WHAT'S LEFT OF HIS WELCOME CAKE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, "OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW, OUT WITH THE NEW!" THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO REPLACE HIM WITH SOMEBODY WHO WILL LAST LONGER, SO TODAY THEY ANNOUNCED NEW WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR EMMANUEL FRUIT FLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) JUST LIKE THAT. HE'S GONE. ( APPLAUSE ) I WAS IN MY DRESSING ROOM TYING MY TIE, I HAD CNN IN THE BACKGROUND WITH THE MUTE ON.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I'M READING THE LOWER THIRD ON SCREEN BACKWARDS AND I'M, LIKE, THAT CAN'T BE WHAT IT SAYS... ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S HOW IT WENT DOWN. ON FRIDAY, TRUMP HIRED NEW WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF AND GRANDPA WHO DOESN'T "DO HUGS," GENERAL JOHN KELLY. ( LAUGHTER ) NO SURPRISE TRUMP PICKED A GENERAL. ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE, "THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT TRUMP PARTICULARLY LIKES ARE PEOPLE WITH BUCKS, MONEY AND BRAIDS-- THE MILITARY." YES, HE LIKES PEOPLE WITH BUCKS AND BRAIDS. SO, IF KELLY DOESN'T WORK OUT, CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR NEXT CHIEF OF STAFF, SPARKLE THE SHOW PONY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) VERY STRONG. VERY STRONG. OF COURSE, KELLY'S REPLACING FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF, REINCE PRIEBUS,  SHOWN HERE SEEING IT COMING. ( LAUGHTER ) KELLY IS THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF REINCE PRIEBUS. KELLY IS MILITARY. PRIEBUS WAS A WASHINGTON INSIDER. KELLY'S FROM BOSTON, PRIEBUS IS FROM WISCONSIN. JOHN KELLY HAS TWO FIRST NAMES, AND REINCE PRIEBUS HAS NO RECOGNIZABLE NAMES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND ACCORDING TO WHITE HOUSE SOURCES, KELLY LET THE MOOCH GO BECAUSE HE WANTED "MORE STRUCTURE, LESS OF 'GAME OF THRONES'." ( LAUGHTER ) ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Jon: WOW.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A FAIR COMPARISON. WITH "GAME OF THRONES," YOU HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE WEEK FOR A NEW BEHEADING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) NOW, AT, "GAME OF THRONES"! VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW SEASON. KEEP THIS IN MIND -- AT 8:30 A.M. THIS MORNING, TRUMP TWEETED THAT THERE WAS NO WHITE HOUSE CHAOS! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN, SIX HOURS LATER, SCARAMUCCI WAS OUT. EVIDENTLY "NO CHAOS" WASN'T BRAGGING, IT WAS COMPLAINING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING TODAY, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SPOKE FOR MANY AMERICANS.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SHE LOOKS GOOD. SHE LOOKS GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I LIKE THE OUTFIT, THE MAKEUP'S VERY NICE. SARAH, I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MAKEUP AND HAIR PEOPLE WERE, BUT LET'S KEEP THOSE GUYS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: WHOA!
STEPHEN: I FEEL BAD FOR THE MOOCH BECAUSE THIS JOB WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM. SATURDAY, NEWS BROKE THAT HIS WIFE FILED FOR DIVORCE WHILE NINE MONTHS PREGNANT AND THAT HE MISSED HIS SON'S BIRTH TO BE WITH THE PRESIDENT. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) "HEY, WHY WOULD I SHOW UP FOR SOME KID I NEVER MET WHEN I CAN BE WITH THE MAN WHO'LL STAY LOYAL TO ME FOR THE REST OF MY... HOLD ON, I'VE GOT ANOTHER CALL. IT'S THE PRESIDENT. HE PROBABLY WANTS TO PROMOTE ME." THE MOOCH -- ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AND IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE, RECENTLY, WHICH APPLIES TO EVERYTHING ABOUT SCARAMUCCI, HE SAID THIS TO THE ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE STAFF: "YOU WANT TO SELL POSTCARDS TO THE TOURISTS OUTSIDE THE GATE, OR DO YOU WANT TO WORK IN THE WEST WING?" JIMMY, DO WE HAVE A SHOT OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE? YEAH, THERE YOU GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. ( PIANO RIFF ) MM-HMM. I TELL YA, THOUGH, SHOCKING AS IT IS, AS HARD AS IT'S BEEN ON SCARAMUCCI, IT'S BEEN HARDER ON ME. THE COLBOOCH. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE MOOCH FOR OVER A WEEK NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GET RID OF ALL OF MY MOOCH MEMORABILIA-- MY "MOOCH-ENDISE." ( LAUGHTER ) MY MOOCH POSTER. AND MY MOOCH BRAND STABBIN' KNIFE. FOR FRONTS ONLY! ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I HAD SUCH PLANS FOR HIM! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE -- WE LITERALLY JUST FINISHED THE CARTOON SCARAMUCCI TODAY.
HEY, I'M ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI! THERE'S A NEW MOOCH IN TOWN!
STEPHEN: GET OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
EH, SPICEY! WAIT UP!"
STEPHEN: BUT, NOW, I GUESS IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, WE BARELY KNEW-CHI. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERING ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THAT'S IT. HE'S GONE. HE'S GONE. WHEN WE FIRST MET SCARAMUCCI, WE PLAYED THE FUN SECTION OF "BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY."
♪ SCARAMOUCHE! SCARAMOUCHE! WILL YOU DO THE FANDANGO!
STEPHEN: NOW WE'VE MOVED ON TO THE SAD PART. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING ) ♪ MAMA... I JUST GOT CANNED. BARELY GOT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. ♪ SAID SOME DUMB STUFF, NOW I'M OUT. ♪ MAMA... MY JOB HAD JUST BEGUN. AND NOW I'VE GONE AND THROWN IT ♪ ALL AWAY. MAMA... MOOOOOOCH. ♪ DIDN'T MEAN TO CAUSE OUTCRY. I WON'T BE BACK TO MOOCH. ♪ THIS TIME TOMORROW, CARRY ON, CARRY ON, WITHOUT THE OLD FRONTSTABBER ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, HEY! ( PIANO RIFF ) THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: NO REHEARSAL! ( LAUGHTER ) LAST WEEK, NORTH KOREA CONDUCTED THEIR SECOND LONG RANGE MISSILE TEST IN FOUR WEEKS. THIS IS A SERIOUS THREAT. BUT DON'T WORRY, THIS MORNING, THE PRESIDENT HAD WORDS OF REASSURANCE.
WE'LL HANDLE NORTH KOREA. WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HANDLE THEM. IT'LL BE-- IT WILL BE HANDLED. WE HANDLE EVERYTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: WE'RE SO SCREWED. ( APPLAUSE ) NORTH KOREA LAUNCHED THE MISSILE ON FRIDAY, AND TRUMP LEAPT INTO ACTION... 24 HOURS LATER RETALIATING WITH THIS NUCLEAR-TIPPED TWEET. "I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN CHINA. OUR FOOLISH PAST LEADERS HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO MAKE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN TRADE, YET-- DOT, DOT, DOT" ( LAUGHTER ) "DOT, DOT, DOT, THEY DO "NOTHING" FOR US WITH NORTH KOREA, JUST TALK. WE WILL NO LONGER ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE. CHINA COULD EASILY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM!" OH, YEAH, DEMANDING ANOTHER COUNTRY SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS IS CLASSIC LEADERSHIP. IN THE WORDS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN "A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. SO WHEN IS CANADA GONNA FIX SLAVERY ALREADY?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT HERE'S WHAT MAKES THIS MISSILE TEST ESPECIALLY SCARY. PREVIOUS NORTH KOREAN MISSILES HAD THE RANGE TO REACH HAWAII AND ALASKA, BUT THIS NEW MISSILE HAS "THE RANGE TO HIT CHICAGO." BUT I LIVED IN CHICAGO FOR YEARS, AND I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING CHICAGOANS WOULD BE SCARED BY THIS. FOR PETE'S SAKE, THE CUBS WON THE WORLD SERIES, THEY KNOW THE END IS NEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE WORLD'S SEXIEST MAN, MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY IS HERE! STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE MAN RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: JON, THANKS FOR HAVING MY BACK. YOU ALWAYS DO.
Jon: YOU GOT IT!
Stephen: THANKS FOR JUMPING IN ON THAT BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY OVER THERE. WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THAT BEFOREHAND.
Jon: NOT AT ALL.
Stephen: THE MOOCH CAUGHT US WITH OUR POOCH DOWN. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SURE EXCITED ABOUT THE SHOW. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE GREAT MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY TONIGHT -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALWAYS FUN -- BUT TOMORROW WE'VE GOT SENATOR AL FRANKEN. PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. DOESN'T DO THESE SHOWS MUCH ANYMORE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND ON WEDNESDAY, WE HAVE DAVE CHAPPELLE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HE'S GOING TO BE HERE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THEN TOMORROW NIGHT, HE STARTS A 14-NIGHT RESIDENCY AT RADIO CITY, RIGHT?
Jon: MM-HMM.
Stephen: I'VE GOT TO SEE AT LEAST 13 OF THOSE SHOWS WHILE HE'S IN TOWN. BUT RIGHT NOW, LET'S NOT HOLD OFF ANY FURTHER, I'M NOT SURE I CAN TAKE IT BECAUSE MY FIRST GUEST IS AN OSCAR-WINNING, BOURBON-SIPPING AMERICAN ICON YOU KNOW FROM "DAZED AND CONFUSED," "TRUE DETECTIVE," AND "DALLAS BUYERS CLUB." HE NOW STARS IN "THE DARK TOWER".
DID YOU MISS ME? RUN! YOU TELL THE KID WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD CREW, YOU TELL HIM THAT EVERYONE WHO WALKS WITH YOU DIES WHICH MY HAND. WE BOTH KNOW THAT DEATH ALWAYS WINS -- THAT'S THE DEAL.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Stephen: IT'S REALLY NICE TO HAVE YOU ON ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
MAN, IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING.
Stephen: WE WERE TALKING, WE MET RIGHT BACKSTAGE BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED. WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE.
I KNOW.
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS FOREVER.
I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF YOURS SINCE 1994, BACK WHEN YOU WERE NAMED STEF-N CO-BERT.
Stephen: MORE ON THAT LATER. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE IS INJUST IN THE WORLD AND THEN THERE'S INJUSTICE. IN 2005 YOU WERE NAMED BY "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE AS THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS 12 YEARS AGO AND EVERY YEAR SINCE I HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED.
CAPITAL "I" INJUSTICE.
Stephen: THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED AGAIN. LOOK AT THE CLOWNS THEY'VE THROWN IN THERE, INSTEAD. CLOONEY -- COME ON, GRANDPA. DAMON, HE'S ADORABLE BUT BITE SIZED. HUGH JACKMAN, TAKE AWAY THE KNIVES FOR HANDS AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? JOHNNY DEPP, COME ON. RIIAN REYNOLDS? KIND OF CUTE.
THE COOL THING ABOUT THAT, SEXIEST MAN, I'M STILL ALIVE. DIDN'T SAY SEXIEST MAN TO HAVE THE YEAR, SAID SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. I FIGURE WHOEVER WINS IT KEEPS IT TILL THEY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LIFE.
Stephen: SO IT'S AGGREGATE. THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING NOW.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE THE HIGHLANDER. YOU HAVE TO DECAPITATE THE REST OF THOSE GUYS BECAUSE THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE.
OH, SO THIS IS A JEALOUSY THING.
Stephen: YOU SHOULDN'T BE JEALOUS AT ALL. YOU'RE IN THE CAT BIRD SEAT.
NO, I'M SAYING YOU DON'T LIKE IT THERE IS THE OTHER CATS SITTING AROUND THE PERIPHERY. I GOT IT.
Stephen: TAKE THEM OUT, METAPHORICALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M A FAN OF YOUR WORK. I THINK YOUR CHARACTER RICK PECK FROM TROPIC THUNDER MIGHT BE ONE OF THE GREATEST COMEDIC PERFORMANCES OF ALL TIME.
HE'S ON TiVo.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT A FAN I AM OF YOUR JOB AS CHIEF STORY TELLER.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE SMOOTH TENNESSEE WHISKEY NOW?
KENTUCKY WHISKEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WILD TURKEY CAME TO ME AND WANTED ME TO BE THE FACE OF THE BRAND. I SAID, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY COULD TAKE THE BRAND OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. I SAID, LET ME COME ON AS CREATIVE DIRECTOR. SO I CAME ON WITH CHILD TURKEY TO WORK TWO CAMPAIGN, WHERE WE REINTRODUCE WILD TURKEY, JUST THE FAMILY WHO HANDLES WILD TURKEY, THREE GENERATIONS, WENT TO KENTUCKY, HUNG OUT WITH THEM, AND WENT TO EDDY RUSSELL, JIMMY'S SON, THE BUDDHA OF BOURBON, I SAID, MR. JIMMY, I'M TAKING OVER THIS CAMPAIGN, I HOPE THIS WORKS. HE SAYS, WELL, MATTHEW, YOU KNOW, IF IT DOESN'T WORK, WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE STUCK WITH A WHOLE LOT OF BOURBON. AND THERE'S WORSE THINGS TO BE STUCK WITH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S A 101. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OF COURSE, THAT'S A VERY AUTHENTIC STORY YOU TOLD. I WILL NEVER BE OUT-AUTHENTICKED BY ANYONE. I ANSWERED WITH MY OWN ANSWER TO WILD TURKEY CALLED SAVAGE COCK. THERE WE GO.
DO WE GET TO TASTE THAT, TOO?
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO ROCK THE COCK?
ROCK THE COCK.
Stephen: I ONLY HAVE TWO CLASSES.
THAT'S OKAY.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS PROP LIQUOR OR -- WE MAY BE JUST ABOUT TO DRINK EVER CLEAR.
DON'T LIGHT A CIGARETTE. HERE WE GO, SAVAGE COCK.
Stephen: OH, THAT IS A HUGE MISTAKE.
OH, LOOK AT THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! PUT THAT IN THERE.
Stephen: LET'S GET BACK TO THE WILD TURKEY RIGHT HERE.
THAT'S THE 17-YEAR.
Stephen: THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, OKAY. THERE WE GO. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF INTERVIEWS TO GET THROUGH. IT'S JUST APPLE JUICE, CALM DOWN. JUST APPLE JUICE.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: NOW, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE McCONASANCE? WE'RE IN THE YEAR FIVE OF THE McCONASANCE.
YEAH.
Stephen: I THINK YOU SAID DOING THE ROMCOMS YOU DID FOR A FEW YEARS WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF AND TANNED IS HARDER THAN SOMETHING LIKE DALLAS BUYERS CLUB.
IT IS.
Stephen: HOW IS IT HARD TO DO LIKE GHOST OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST OR FOOLS GOLD.
FAILURE TO LAUNCH.
Stephen: HOW CAN THAT BE HARDER?
TEN DAYS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S WHAT I MEAN ABOUT THAT. IF YOU'RE REALLY HONEST ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL IN A ROMANTIC COMEDY, YOU SINK THE SHIP. YOU'VE GOT TO BOUNCE ALONG THE CLOUDS IN ROMANTIC COMEDIES. YOU CAN'T LOVE AS HARD, GET MAD AS HARD, HATE OR LAUGH AS HARD IN THOSE THINGS, YOU JUST BOUNCE IN THE CLOUDS. IN DRAMA, YOU HANG YOUR HEAD ON HUMANITY EVERY SINGLE TURN, HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT THAT, THE CEILING IS HIGHER AND BASEMENT IS LOWER IN A DRAMA. IN A ROMCOM, YOU'RE JUST ALL SKIRTING ACROSS THE TOP. IT'S ALL SATURDAYS IN A ROMCOM.
Stephen: I CAN SEE THAT. ARE DRAMAS MORE MONDAY MORNING? ABSOLUTELY, BUT THEY'RE A WHOLE LOT MORE HONEST. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT SOUND THAT HARD. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
Stephen: WELL, OKAY, SO, NOW, HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THIS IS A DRAMA AS SORT OF A THRILLER DRAMA, STEPHEN KING'S DARK TOWER IN THE MOVIE.
TIM MAN IN BLACK, THE DEVIL INCARNATE. THIS IS BIG SUMMER FUN BLOCKBUSTER STUFF FROM STEPHEN KING WHO'S GIVEN US MANY GREAT NIGHTMARES IN THE PAST.
Stephen: SURE. THIS IS THE MYTHIC GOOD VERSUS EVIL AND THERE'S THE KNIGHT, ROLAND THE GUN SLINGER -- AND I'VE HAD HIM CHASING ME FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN THIS MULTI-UNIVERSE PLACE WE ARE. THE TOWER IS THE VORTEX THAT HOLDS THE UNIVERSE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES. I WANT TO BRING THAT TOWER DOWN, RIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) I WANT TO BRING IT DOWN, HE WANTS TO KEEP IT UP. NOW, CAN HE DO THAT? HE'S GOT TO GET RID OF ME FIRST. I DON'T KNOW. YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE, I DON'T THINK HE CAN SEE IT.
Stephen: HE IS A KNIGHT, HIS GUNS ARE MADE FROM EXCALIBUR.
HE IS THE LAST LIVING PERSON THAT CAN TAKE ME OUT. NOT ON A DATE, BUT --
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF YOUR FAMOUS CATCH PHRASES? BECAUSE I REALLY ENJOY -- ( CHEERING ) THE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND FOR EVERYBODY, SAY IT. WHAT IS IT?
FIRST THREE WORDS I EVER SAID ON FILM, AUGUST 12th, 1992.
Stephen: COMING UP ON 25 YEARS NOW.
YEAH, MAN.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO CELEBRATE 25 YEARS IN FILM?
I'M NOT A BIG DATE KEEPER. I HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING MY ANNIVERSARY WITH MY WIFE. PERFECT THING ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE IS SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER EITHER. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW ABOUT J.K. LIVIN', JUST KEEP LIVIN'.
SIX DAYS INTO SHOOTING DAZED AND CONFUSED MY FATHER PASSED AWAY WITH A HEART ATTACK AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM IN THE SPIRIT. YOU KEEP THEIR SPIRIT ALIVE AND THAT'S WHERE JUST KEEP LIVING CAME FROM.
Stephen: I NEVER KNEW THAT. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BECAUSE I LIKE THAT MOTTO FOR SO MANY YEARS I STARTED ONE CALLED C.T. BREATHE WHICH MEANS CONTINUE TO BREATHE.
CONTINUE TO BREATHE.
Stephen: KEEP IT SIMPLE, CONTINUE TO BREATHE.
DON'T MAKE A STRAIGHT LINE CROOKED.
Stephen: WHAT? DON'T MAKE A STRAIGHT LINE CROOKED.
Stephen: YOU GOT ANY OTHER GOOD ONES RIGHT NOW? YOU WORKING ON ANYTHING NEW?
THEY KIND OF COME TO ME.
Stephen: WHAT'S NEW FOR FALL OF 2017?
THE OTHER DAY, I HAD ONE THAT GAVE ME A GIGGLE, AND I PUT IT ON THERE, SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT? FOUND MYSELF RIGHT WHERE I LEFT ME. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I HAD ONE THAT HAS A LOT OF HISTORY WHICH IS, KISS THE FIRE AND WALK AWAY WHISTLING. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY THAT ONE?
Stephen: NO. LICK THE LION'S MANE AND CALL ME CAPTAIN THUNDER.
MAKE IT HAPPEN ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IF YOU SAY IT WITH ENOUGH SUAVITY AND ASSURANCE IT SOUNDS LIKE A CATCH PHRASE.
WE ALL KNOW THE BASS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE TREBLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU SHOULD OPEN A MONASTERY OR SOMETHING.
OR I SHOULD JUST START MAKING BUMPER STICKERS.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF BREAK. STICK AROUND. BACK WITH MORE MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) POOH ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HEY, EVERYBODY! WE'RE RIGHT HERE WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WANT TO GET BACK TO SOMETHING. THIS IS A GREAT COMPLIMENT YOU PAID ME. I DID A SHOW WITH SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS, JAMIE, PAUL AND THOSE I USED TO WORK WITH IN THE '90s CALLED "EXIT 57", AND I THINK MAYBE A BAKER'S DOZEN PEOPLE IN AMERICA WATCHED THAT SHOW IN '95. YOU WATCHED THAT SHOW. YOU ACTUALLY CAME BACKSTAGE AND STARTED QUOTING THAT SHOW TO ME.
RELIGIOUSLY WATCHED THAT SHOW.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW THAT SHOW.
OH, I KNOW THE SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) GUYS, IT'S HARD TO FIND BUT IT'S WORTH THE LOOKING FOR. IT WAS ON COMEDY CENTRAL 9:30, I BELIEVE SUNDAY NIGHT, '94, '95. I WOULD GO TO (BLEEP) KEVIN AND GAVIN'S EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT. WE WOULD ROLL A FUNNY CIGARETTE, SHE WOULD MAKE TURKEY TACOS AND WE WOULD WATCH "EXIT 57". IT'S A 30-MINUTE EPISODE. THAT I HAVE SIX HITS. TWO OUT OF THE THREE WERE HOME RUN SOCIAL COMMENTARY. KNOCKOUT STUFF. I HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING -- WHEN YOU GUYS HIT IT, I'VE NOT FOUND ANYTHING MORE FUNNY SINCE.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S NICE OF YOU TO SAY. I HAVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MOSTLY NOT MY WORK.
THIS IS STUFF WHERE -- ALL RIGHT, COLBERT HERE, OKAY, THIS IS THE KIND OF COLDY. OPEN UP ON NEW YORK CITY, HIGH RISE, HE'S OUT ON HIS PORCH, 77th STREET. HE'S A WELL-TO-DO STOCKBROKER AND HE COMES HOME, OUT ON THE PORCH BY HIMSELF, HE'S HAVING DIALOGUE WITH HIMSELF, LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS OF NEW YORK CITY REALLY TAKING HIS TIME. AND HIS WIFE SHOWS UP PLAYED BY AMY SEDARIS. SHE WALKS IN. HE DOESN'T SEE HER. SHE HESITATES BECAUSE SHE KNOWS HE LIKES "HIS TIME." SHE DECIDES TO COME UP AND PUT A SOFT HAND ON HIS SHOULDER. AS HE DOES -- AS SHE DOES, HE SNAPS A SECOND. SHE SAYS, I'M SORRY. HE SAYS, NO, I'M SORRY, I'M NOT PUSHING YOU AWAY, I'M PULLING ME CLOSER TO MYSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GREAT STUFF.
Stephen: WELL, HERE'S THE THING, WE LIKE TO DO BITS WITH OUR GUESTS SOMETIMES. WE WROTE "SEXY SOUTHERN LAWYERS" BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, TIME TO KILL, LINCOLN LAWYER, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SEXY SOUTHERN LAWYER FOR A JUDGE.
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
Stephen: BUT THEN YOU SAID COULD WE DO A SCENE ABOUT TWO GUYS THAT WORK IN A NEWSPAPER. I DIDN'T REMEMBER THE SCENE. THIS IS THE BEGINNING TO HAVE THE SCENE.
JUST WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PAPER YOU THINK YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND HERE?
YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH, MERKIN. YOU'RE ALREADY AT THE TOP OF MY PISS LIST. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SO, THERE I AM AT ABOUT AGE 14, I THINK, AND I DIDN'T REMEMBER THE SCENE AT ALL BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO LONG AGO, WE HAD WRITTEN SO MANY THINGS SINCE, BUT PAUL FOUND AN OLD VHS OF THAT SHOW, AND WE TRANSCRIBED THE TAPE, AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT SKETCH?
YES! I WOULD LOVE TO, MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS MY FAVORITE SKIT OF ALL THE YEARS OF "EXIT 57", AND I'VE SEEN THEM ALL MANY TIMES. THIS IS MY FAVORITE SKIT. AS YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY CALLED SOMEBODY MERKIN. ME AND MY BUDDY JOHN, I TURNED HIM ON TO THIS. WE LOVED THE SKIT SO MUCH I CALL HIM MERK AND HE CALLS ME MERKIN. WE DID THIS FOR YEARS. ONE DAY HE SAID MERKIN WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR BREAKFAST? I SAID, TWO EGGS AND TOAST. HE SAID, I GOT, I SAID THANK YOU MERKIN. SOMEBODY SAID, WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM? MERKIN, A SKIT. HE SAID, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? A PUBIC WIG. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WE STILL CALL EACH OTHER THAT.
Stephen: WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL MAKE MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY'S DREAM COME TRUE. STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! AND NOW, BECAUSE YOU ASKED FOR IT, AND BY "YOU," I MEAN MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY, "THE LATE SHOW" IS PROUD TO PRESENT "FORECAST" FROM "EXIT 57". ♪ ♪ ♪
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PAPER YOU RUNNING AROUND HERE?
YOU WETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH, MERKIN. YOU'RE ALREADY AT THE TOP OF MY LIST.
FINE. THEN WHY DON'T YOU PRINT THAT? AT LEAST IT MIGHT HAVE SOME SHRED OF REALITY TO IT.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM THIS TIME?
WHAT'S MY PROBLEM? THIS RIGHT HERE IS MY PROBLEM. I WRITE "SUNNY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN" AND YOU, WITH YOUR AMAZING LET'S-SCREW-THE-FORECAST ATTITUDE, CHANGE IT TO "POSSIBLE SHOWERS," AND IT MAKES ME LOOK BAD.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
WHAT'S MY POINT? COME ON, THIS IS MY POINT. I WRITE "INTERMITTENT SHOWERS," AND YOU PUT "THUNDERSTORMS." OH, YOU'RE A SENSATIONALIST. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER'S GONNA SELL A FEW MORE PAPERS. THAT'S WHAT YOU WRITE.
YOU'RE WAY OUT OF LINE, MERKIN.
OH, REALLY? AM I WAY OUT OF LINE?
Stephen: YES. IS THIS RIGHT HERE OUT OF LINE? WHAT DUD I DO? I WRITE "HOT AND HUMID" AND YOU PUT "HEAT WAVE." YEAH, WHATEVER'S GONNA SELL A FEW MORE PAPERS, THAT'S YOUR GIG! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU WOULD TAKE ONE MINUTE TO LOOK OUT OF THIS CORNER OFFICE WINDOW THAT YOU FEEL YOU SO RICHLY DESERVE, YOU MIGHT SEE THAT IT IS SUNNY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSSIBLE SHOWERS AND SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN. SO LET'S GET OFF THIS MY-WORDS-ARE-GOLDEN KICK AND GET BACK TO OUR DESK, MR. HEMINGWAY. ( LAUGHTER )
SLIGHT CHANCE AND POSSIBLE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, OR DIDN'T THEY TEACH YOU THAT IN YOUR I'M-THE-EDITOR-I-GET-TO-TAKE-OUT -RUN-ON-SENTENCES- AND-USE-OTHER-WORDS-TO-DESCRIBE- THINGS CLASS, MR. E.B. WHITE?
YOU'RE REALLY PUSHING IT, MERKIN!
REALLY? PUSHING? OR SHOVING? IF THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "SLIGHT CHANCE" AND "POSSIBLE" THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU CHANGE IT?
I DON'T KNOW. GUESS I FELT I WAS TRYING TO HELP, THAT'S ALL.
DAMN IT, WHEELER. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR OVER 15 YEARS. WE CAN'T LET SOMETHING LIKE THIS COME BETWEEN OUR RELATIONSHIP, OUR FRIENDSHIP. ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT HAVE I BECOME? AM I A MONSTER? HAVE I TURNED INTO THAT WHICH I MOST REVILE? OH, GOD, TOM, I'M SORRY. ( LAUGHTER )
DON'T PUT IT ALL ON YOURSELF. IT'S MY FAULT, TOO. YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY AFTER YOU HIRED ME?
YEAH. YOU WERE SO YOUNG.
YOU PULLED ME ASIDE AND YOU SAID, "TOM, I WANT YOU TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO REPORT THE WEATHER," AND I DID. UI DID. YOU GAVE A SMALL TOWN BOY FROM TENNESSEE HIS DREAM ABOUT THE WEATHER. ( LAUGHTER )
I'M THROUGH HERE. IT'S TIME TO GO. I'M RESIGNING. I HAD NO RIGHT. BUT BEFORE I GO, I'M GOING TO PRINT A RETRACTION IN TOMORROW'S PAPER. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR "SUNNY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN." I'M GOING TO GIVE YOUR INTEGRITY, YOUR RESPECT, AND YOUR PRIDE. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO CLEAN OUT MY DESK.
HANG ON, WHEELER. IF YOU GO, I GO.
THEN I'LL STAY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE THE BEST THERE IS AND THIS PAPER'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU ( LAUGHTER ) DAMN LUCKY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: "THE DARK TOWER" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH VANESSA BAYER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW." FOLKS, MY NEXT GUEST IS EMMY-NOMINATED FOR HER WORK ON "SNL" THIS SEASON WHERE SHE PLAYED EVERYONE FROM MILEY CYRUS TO JACOB THE BAR MITZVAH BOY, PLEASE WELCOME VANESSA BAYER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) NICE TO MEET YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: SO NICE TO SEE YOU!
OH, MY GOSH, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: WE'LL EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE MET.
YES.
Stephen: FIRST TIME IS 13 YEARS AGO.
YES.
Stephen: MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMMY NOMINATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIFF SO NICE. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENED. WHEREWHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU FOU OUT?
I WAS LEAVING MY PILATES CLASS AND MY PHONE STARTED BLOWING UP AND I WAS GETTING TEXTS THAT WERE FROM EDIE BRYANT. I GUESS HER EIGHT SAW I WAS NOMINATED AND KNEW SHE WOULD BE EXCITED AND TEXTED HER AND THEN SHE TEXTED ME. AND I SAID, OH, WAS I NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY? AND MY PILATES TEACHER WAS IN THE BATHROOM AND I WAITED FOR HER TO COME OUT TO TELL HER I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS NOMINATED. WE TRIED TO LOOK IT UP ON MY PHONE. IT SEEMS SIMPLE TO GOOGLE VANESSA BAYER. BUT WE WERE, LIKE, WHY DO YOU USE A PHONE? WE COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
Stephen: YOU WERE TOO EXCITED.
WE WERE SO EXCITED, YEAH.
Stephen: GREAT. I'M HOSTING THE SHOW.
YEAH, THAT'S SO GREAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, LET'S EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE HOW WE KNOW EACH OTHER.
OKAY.
Stephen: IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME, I HAD TO BE REMINDED THAT WE HAD MET EACH OTHER BEFORE.
IT'S REALLY FINE.
Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. SO I WAS A SENIOR IN COLLEGE, AND THERE WAS THIS COMEDY FESTIVAL THAT THE MALE COMEDY TROOP -- WE CALL THEM TROOPS, THAT'S VERY DORKY -- BUT THE MALE COMEDY TROOP PUT ON. STEPHEN HOSTED THE EVENT. I WAS IN WITH THE COMEDY CROWD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.
Stephen: 2004. 2004, RIGHT.
Stephen: I WAS STILL AT "THE DAILY SHOW."
RIGHT. AND I MET YOU AND TOLD YOU I WAS ABOUT TO MOVE TO CHICAGO TO PURSUE COLDY, AND YOU WERE SO NICE TO ME, AND THIS IS WHAT I TRULY CANNOT BELIEVE IS YOU TOLD ME TO TAKE CLASSES FROM THIS GUY NICK NAPIER WHICH WAS SO NICE AND YOU WERE, LIKE, IF YOU FORGET ANY OF THIS OR NEED ANY MORE INFORMATION, HERE'S MY EMAIL, AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR EMAIL, BUT I WOULD NEVER -- LIKE, I CONSIDER MYSELF PRETTY NICE, BUT TO GIVE YOUR EMAIL TO SOME COLLEGE KID, LIKE, OKAY, BUT --
Stephen: REALLY SOUNDS CREEPY NOW THAT YOU TALK ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT IF I GAVE IT TO MY FRIENDS? IT WAS SO NICE OF YOU.
Stephen: NO ONE'S EVER ABUSED IT, I DO IT ALL THE TIME.
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
Stephen: WELL, HERE'S THE NOT NICE PART.
THE NOT NICE PART IS I DID EMAIL YOU AND I SAID, YOU KNOW --
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.
YEAH. JUST READ IT? OKAY. DEAR STEPHEN. REALLY GREAT SEEING YOU AT COM FESTIVAL.
