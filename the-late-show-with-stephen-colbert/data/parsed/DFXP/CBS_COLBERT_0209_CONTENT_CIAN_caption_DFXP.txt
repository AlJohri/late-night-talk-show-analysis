AND NOW, A "LATE SHOW" EXCLUSIVE  TRAILER. ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ LOOK SO CRAZY ♪
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS ORGY STARTED. I SAY THE THREE OF US IN THE FLESH PIT. WHO UPONS TO GREASE ME UP? HOW, WHERE IS SHE GOING? WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN THE PARTY HAS TO END. DAMN IT. I LEFT MY NIPPLE CLIPS IN MY OTHER SUIT.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES TREVOR NOAH ALLEN IVERSON AND CHRIS GETHARD FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANKS, IT'S. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! VERY NICE. HEY, EVERYBODY! MARK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. I DON'T GET THAT EVERY NIGHT. THAT'S NICE!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE. WE DON'T GET THAT EVERY NIGHT. YOU DON'T GET THAT EVERY NIGHT. HEY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT.
THERE'S A BIG STORY THAT REINFORCED WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE CENTRAL MESSAGE OF THE 2016 ELECTION-- NEVER USE E-MAIL. THE LATEST PERSON CAUGHT WITH HIS INBOX FLAPPIN' IN THE WIND IS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, COLIN POWELL, WHO HAD ABOUT TWO YEARS OF E-MAILS STOLEN AND THEN POSTED ON LINE. TWO YEARS! WOW! THAT IS A DEEP DIVE INTO THE COLIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. AND THESE EMAILS CONTAIN SOME REAL BOMBSHELLS. FOR INSTANCE, POWELL CALLED DONALD TRUMP "A NATIONAL DISGRACE AND AN INTERNATIONAL PARIAH." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY FAIR. HE'S ALSO AN INTERNATIONAL DISGRACE AND A NATIONAL PARIAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IN ANOTHER EMAIL, POWELL SAID THAT ANY MEDIA ATTENTION JUST HELPS TRUMP, EVEN CRITICISMS, WRITING, "TO GO ON AND CALL HIM AN IDIOT JUST EMBOLDENS HIM." IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE. YOU CANNOT STOP TRUMP BY CALL HIM STUPID. HE'S JUST LIKE FORREST GUMP: HE WAS BIG IN THE '90s, SOMEHOW ACQUIRED A FORTUNE, AND RUNS LONGER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT HE COULD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE ONLY DIFFERENCE-- RUN, FOREST! RUN! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS FORREST GUMP WENT TO VIETNAM. IT'S TRUE. COLD-BLOODED! BUT SECRETARY POWELL DIDN'T JUST TALK TRUMP. HE LET LOOSE ON HILLARY CLINTON WITH EITHER A BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT OR A FRONTHANDED INSULT WRITING:
Jon: OH, COLD-BLOODED.
Stephen: "BIMBOS." A DAMNING ACCUSINGATION. AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, THE WORST DAVE MATTHEWS SONG EVER. THAT'S MY DAVE MATTHEWS. IT'S NOT VERY GOOD. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THESE TWO HAVE BUTTED HEADS. BECAUSE HILLARY HAS REPEATEDLY CLAIMED THAT COLIN POWELL WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD HER TO SET UP A PRIVATE SERVER, WHILE IN THE LEAKED E-MAILS COLIN POWELL WRITES: IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED AS THIS COUNTRY'S TOP DIPLOMATS COMMUNICATE VIA "MINI-TANTRUMS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT AT LEAST-- ( APPLAUSE ) AT LEAST-- MINI-TANTRUM. JUST A MINI-TANTRUM. BUT AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T GET THE FULL COLIN FREAKOUT. SHE JUST GOT THE SEMI-COLON. ( APPLAUSE ) YES, THANK YOU. THAT DESERVED-- THAT'S A JOKE YOU WANT TO END WITH THAT-- SEMICOLON. GUESS WHAT, GUESS WHAT? THIS IS GREAT NEWS. A NEW CENSUS DATA JUST CAME OUT. SIT DOWN, I KNOW WE'RE ALL EXCITED. THE REPORT SHOWED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN YEARS, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WENT UP. IT ALSO HAD SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE LADY BECAUSE THE GENDER WAGE GAP HAS CAN DECREASED BY ONE CENT, ONE CENT. SO, GALS, WHY DON'T YOU CELEBRATE WITH A NICE PIECE OF PENNY CANDY. NOT TWO PIECES, THOUGH. THAT'LL TAKE ANOTHER 25 YEARS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN BEATING AROUND THE BUSH HERE. I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF UPSETTING ME, I WAS HOPING I COULD GET IT OFF MY CHEST. WOULD THAT BE OKAY? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER. I FEEL DUMB. I'M SUCH AN IDIOT. I NEVER KNEW THERE WERE FOUR DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GIRAFFES. THAT'S RIGHT. APPARENTLY, A NEW STUDY FOUND THERE ARE FOUR SPECIES OF GIRAFFE INSTEAD OF JUST ONE. I GUESS NOW WHEN YOUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD SAYS THEIR FAVORITE ANIMAL IS A GIRAFFE, YOU CAN SAY, "BE MORE SPECIFIC, JONATHAN, OR YOU'LL NEVER GET INTO THE RIGHT PRE-SCHOOL." ( LAUGHTER ) AND, SURE, NO ONE KNEW THAT UNTIL THIS WEEK, BUT I STILL FEEL PRETTY STUPID. PLUS, UP UNTIL NOW, I JUST THOUGHT A GIRAFFE WAS JUST A SNAKE ON TOP OF A HORSE. SCIENTISTS MADE THE DISCOVERY BY PERFORMING SKIN BIOPSIES ON 190 GIRAFFES FROM ALL AROUND AFRICA. THEY FOUND FOUR DISTINCT SPECIES AND THREE MOLES THE GIRAFFES MIGHT WANT TO HAVE CHECKED OUT. ADDITIONALLY, "THE FOUR NEWLY DEFINED SPECIES CANNOT BREED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE WILD," ALTHOUGH, IN THE GIRAFFES' DEFENSE, THEY'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT OF STRESS AT WORK, AND THEY GOT KIDS NOW. AND, FRANKLY, EVEN WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER THE SEX WAS GOOD, BUT NOT EXACTLY "IN THE WILD." GIRAFFES USUALLY DON'T MAKE IT PAST THE NECKING PHASE.
Jon: HEY, HEY, HEY!
Stephen: IS THAT TOO DIRTY? IS THAT TOO DIRTY?
Jon: NO, IT'S A FAMILY JOKE.
Stephen: DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THE RAPPER, NELLY. HE'S IN THE NEWS. AND DON'T WORRY, YOU DID NOT JUST EMERGE FROM A REVERSE COMA AND WAKE UP IN 2001. APPARENTLY, THE ST. LOUIS RAPPER HAS BEEN HIT WITH A FEDERAL TAX LIEN THAT AMOUNTS TO $2,412,283. I ALMOST NEVER GET TO SAY THIS, BUT, WHOA, NELLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT, LUCKILY, HIS FANS HAVE COME TO THE RESCUE BY LISTENING TO HIS SINGLE "HOT IN HERRE" OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FANS HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT WITH SPOTIFY PAYING ARTISTS IX-TENSION OF A CENT PER TREME:  THAT IS A LOT. MAYBE NELLY COULD MAKE SOME CASH BY PUTTING HIS SONG OVER SOME FOOTAGE THAT IS GETTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PLAYS THIS WEEK. MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE... ♪ IT'S GETTING HOT IN HERE SO HOT ♪ SO TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOACTS  ♪ ♪.
Stephen: THEY DID CLAIM IT WAS THE HEAT. THEY DID CLAIM IT WAS HEAT EXHAUSTION. THEY CLAIMED THAT. WELL, JUST TO MAKE SURE NELLY HAS LEARNED HIS LESSON, I'VE UPDATED HIS HIT "HOT IN HERRE" TO TEACH HIM ALL ABOUT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. THIS RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE MATCHUP: JETS VERSUS BILLS WITH FORMER BILLS COACH REX RYAN NOW COACHING BUFFALO, AND FORMER BILLS QUARTERBACK RYAN FITZPATRICK NOW LEADING THE JETS.

Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: TREF OVER, TREF OVER! DO THEY HAVE EVER CHANT YOUR NAME AT "THE DAILY SHOW. OF.
NO, YOU EARN A CHANT. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? I DID NOT TRULY UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE CHANTED THE WAY THEY DID, UNTIL I WATCHED YOU DURING THE CONVENTIONS, AND I SAW THE BITS THAT YOU WERE DOING, AND THEN-- YOU MUST REMEMBER, WE DIDN'T GET "THE COLBERT SHOW "IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE. I SAID THAT'S HOW YOU CHANT YOUR NAME. YOU'RE AMAZING, MAN. I WILL EARN THE CHANTING, BUT NOT NOW.
Stephen: YOU'RE AMAZING, TOO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: YOU'RE COMING UP ON ONE YEAR.
YES.
Stephen: OF "THE DAILY SHOW, "AND THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE WAS SHORTLY BEFORE YOU STARTED SHOW OVER THERE.
YES, YES.
Stephen: SO WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED, MY FRIEND?
I HAVE LEARNED-- I THINK IN SOME WAY, I MAY BE CONNECTED TO TRUMP. I THINK I-- I THINK --
YOU ARE RELATED TO HIM?
I THINK SOMEHOW, SOMEHOW LIKE HARRY POTTER AND VOALDER MORTS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND THIS THING CAME OUT AND IT KIND OF HAPPENED AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING. I THINK I MAY NEED TO DIE TO SAVE AMERICA! TO SAVE YOU ALL!
Stephen: WOW. WELL, I MEAN, THEY-- YOU KNOW, YOU DID COME HERE-- I MEAN, IT'S-- YOU CAME FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
YES.
Stephen: TO SAVE US. ( LAUGHTER ) DID YOU-- WHEN YOU LOOK AT AMERICAN POLITICS NOW-- BECAUSE THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, TRUMP HAD, YOU KNOW, MADE A SPLASH BUT EVERYONE STILL THOUGHT, CAN'T POSSIBLY HAPPEN. CAN'T POSSIBLY HAPPEN.
I THINK PEOPLE STILL THINK THAT.
Stephen: IF I THOUGHT THAT I COULD SLEEP AT NIGHT. IT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.
WE'RE LEARNING IT'S TIME. IT'S TIME. YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR-- LET'S STOP THERE, HAVE YOU?
Stephen: YES.
OKAY, COOL, JUST MAKING SURE. AND YOU'RE CHOOSE AGO YOU ARE GETTING TO CHOOSE THE FLAVORS. NOW IN AMERICAN ELECTIONS YOU ONLY HAVE TWO FLAVORS TO CHOOSE FROM, AND THEN THEY GO HEY, YOU HAVE A YEAR TO CHOOSE YOUR FLAVORS. YOU'RE GOING TO STAND THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND SAY DO I TAKE THE VANILLA OR THE RACIST GINGER. AND YOU GET TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME CHOOSING THE --
DO NOT SELL THE RACIST JINGER SHORT BECAUSE IT GETS YOU RIGHT HERE.
THEY SAY, HEY, YOU'VE GOT A YEAR. IF THEY SAY, "CHOOSE NOW, ""YOU'LL PICK. IF THEY SAY A YEAR YOU TAKE YOUR TIME. RACIST GINGER SOUNDS INTERESTING. IT IT WOULD MAKE LIFE EXCITING.
Stephen: IT WOULD.
PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT AN OUTSIDER, AND I UNDERSTAND IF YOU LOOK AT POLITICS AND HOW CONVOLUTED IT BECOMES I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT AN OUTSIDER TO WHAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ASKING.
Stephen: TO THE THE INSIDERS?
THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH.
Stephen: IT'S NOT?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: IT'S SPECIFIC ENOUGH FOR TRUMP. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.
AND THE PEOPLE VOTING FOR HIM. ALL PEOPLE IN THE BASKENT. THE BASKET WAS IS DISPLT BASKET OF DEPLORE ABLES.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT. I GUESS HE SAID HE HAS FOLLOWERS ARE RACIST, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BASKET OF DEPLORABLES.
I THINK THE BASKET THING IS MORE OFFENSIVE. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, IF YOU PUT ME IN A BASKET, I'M OFFENDED BY THAT. IF YOU RANDOPLY SAID I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND SAW A BASKET OF BLACK PEOPLE. YOU WOULD SAY, WHOA, WHOA.
Stephen: BECAUSE I SAID IT WAS FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
NO, BUT IT'S THE BASKET THAT'S OFFENSIVE.
Stephen: A BASKET OF PUPPIES IS FANTASTIC. A BASKET OF BLACK PUPPIES WOULD BE FAN TACK.
IT SKIRTS THE LINE. IF SHE SAID, A TUPPERWARE OF DEPLORABLES," PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS OFFENDED.
Stephen: LET ME TRY THIS. I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND I SAW A TUPPERWARE FULL OF BLACK PEOPLE.
YOU CAN'T SAY "FULL OF "BECAUSE THAT MEANS THEY CONTAIN BLACK PEOPLE. TRY IT AGAIN WITHOUT FULL OF.
Stephen: I SAY, I SAW TUPPERWARE FULL OF BLACK PEOPLE.
AND I WOULD SAY, WHAT, DO YOU MEAN BY THAT, STEPHEN? AT LEAST IT MAKES ME THINK. IT MAKES YOU THINK.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE TREVOR NOAH. A BASKET. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEFORE THE BREAK I WAS SAYING YOU'RE COMING UP ON CELEBRATING YOUR FIRST YEAR OF HOSTING "THE DAILY SHOW." I RAN INTO YOU AT A PARTY, AND YOU SAID TO ME ON THE WEEKENDS YOU SOMETIMES FLY BACK TO SOUTH AFRICA TO SEE YOUR FAMILY.
YEAH, I TRY.
Stephen: IT'S AN 18-HOUR FLIGHT TO JOHANNESBURG.
NO, NO, NO, 16 HOURS.
Stephen: OH, 16 HOURS. MY APOLOGIES.
18 WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU DO THAT, LEAVE FRIDAY MORNING?
I FLY THURSDAY LATE NIGHT, CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT. AND I'LL LAND ON THE FRIDAY, AND THEN I'LL HAVE A FRIDAY FULL DAY, AND THEN SATURDAY I FLY BACK AND I'M HERE ON A SUNDAY.
Stephen: SO 36 HOURS IN JOHANNESBURG.
NOT EVEN, I GUESS. IT'S BARELY 24.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU ALIVE? HOW DO YOU DO THAT? HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU DONE THAT OVER THE PAST YEAR?
SIX, SEVEN TIMES, MAYBE. I LOVE SLEEPING ON A PLANE. I FEEL LIKE AIRPLANES ARE THE LAST PLACE OF SLEEPINGNESS. IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. I JUST SLEEP.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT? DON'T THE STEWARDESSES COME UP AND SAY, "WOULD YOU LIKE A PILLOW?"
NO, NO, I WRAP-- I HAVE THIS MASK THAT PROVIDES HUMIDITY, AND I WEAR, LIKE, A HOODIE AND TAPE MY NOSE CLOSED-- THIS IS ALL TRUE. THIS IS ALL TRUE. AND I WRAP MYSELF UP. SO I HAVE HUMIDITY AND I CLOSE EVERYTHINGEP AND IT'S GONE.
Stephen: DO YOU LOOK BANE.
I LOOK LIKE BANE AND DARTH VADER HAD A CHILD.
Stephen: I'D SEE THAT MOVIE. YOU HAVE A BOOK COMING OUT RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION. IT'S CALLED--
"BORN A CRIME."
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
I WAS BORN A CRIME. I WAS BORN TO A BLACK SOUTH AFRICAN MOTHER AND A WHITE SWISS FATHER DURING APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND THEM DOING THE THING WAS ILLEGAL.
Stephen: THE THING?
THE THING. THE THING OF MAKING ME.
Stephen: THIS THING? WHEN THAT THING DOES THAT?
WELL, THAT'S WORSE THAN ME SAYING "THE THING." I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
Stephen: JUST BEING--
THAT'S EVEN WORSE.
Stephen: REALLY?
THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE WILL THING. IT'S GOING INTO NOTHING.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE THING AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING RIGHT THERE. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. YOU KNOW HOW THE THING WORKS, RIGHT?
I I HOPE SO. MY PARNS GOT TOGETHER DURING THAT TIME WHICH WAS AGAINST THE LAW, AND I WAS BORN DURING THIS.
Stephen: WHEN WAS THAT?
1984.
Stephen: WHEN DID THAT LAW CHANGE?
APARTHEID ENDED IN MEAN 90. SO FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF MY LIFE I WAS LIVING A PHYSICAL CRIME. I HAD TO GO BACK THROUGH MY LIFE. I LEARNED THENGZ ABOUT MY LIFE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW. FOR INSTANCE, I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS AN INDOOR CHILD. TURNS OUT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE, BECAUSE IF I WAS SEEN IN SOWETO, THE AREA I LIVED IN, THE POLICE WOULD SEE ME AND GO, "THAT KID, HE'S A CRIME." YOU COULD SEE THAT. AND THEY WOULD SEND ME TO AN ORPHANAGE. MY MOM WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO HAVE ME.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF AMERICANS SAYING OUR RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY OR OUR COUNTRY BHEEG TAKEN FROM US, WHERE YOU GREW UP SOMEPLACE WHERE YOUR EXISTENCE ITSELF WAS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW?
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY TO PEOPLE, I CAN NEVER JUDGE SOMEBODY FOR THINKING THAT THEIR WORLD IS TOUGH BECAUSE IT IS TOUGH TO YOU. I LOOK AT MY UPBRINGING, AND I GO-- I REMEMBER WHEN I WENT TO BRAZIL, AND I VISITED THE FAVELLAS IN RIO DE JANEIRO, AND I SAID, MAN, THIS IS BAD. AND I GO WITH AN AMERICAN TO SOUTH AFRICA, AND THEY GO THIS IS BAD. NO, THIS IS BAD. IT'S BAD FOR YOU, AND THAT'S ALL IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE. WHEN PEOPLE GO, "MY RIGHT ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY." I GO, "DO YOU FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY?" "YEAH." AND I SAY, "WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?" "BECAUSE I CAN'T ORDER MORE FOOD." IT'S DIFFERENT, IT'S DIFFERENT, IT'S DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S STILL VALID. WE ALL HAVE OUR CHALLENGE S.
Stephen:  YOU ALSO HAVE A SHOW AT THE BEACON THEATER HERE IN THE NEW YORK TO THE NEW YORK COMEDY FESTIVAL. WHAT NIGHT IS THAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING STAND-UP COMEDY ON THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER. THAT WILL BE FUN.

HOW DID IT FEEL TO HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE, WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE BACK IN THE DAY SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T PUT THE EFFORT IN THAT WAS NECESSARY. THE PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL STYLE. CALLED YOU A THUG. TO BE UP THERE AND HAVE PEOPLE CHEERING YOU ON, AND SO EXCITED, AND SO READY TO HONOR YOU? HOW DID THAT FEEL?
I JUST-- IT JUST MADE ME LOVE GOD EVEN MORE THAN I DO NOW.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, IT'S-- IT WAS SPECIAL TO GET THAT FEELING. I REMEMBER BEING UP ON THE PODIUM AND FEELING LIKE, YOU KNOW, MY LEGS WERE SHAKING. I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO FAINT. AND I WAS SITTING THERE. I REMEMBER HAVING A MOMENT SAYING, "GOD, PLEASE DON'T LET ME FAINT." YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: YOU LOOKED A LITTLE CHOCKED UP BEFORE YOU EVEN STARTED TALKING.
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY, LIKE, THESE PEOPLE, ALL OF MY SUPPORTERS, THE PEOPLE WHO STUCK WITH ME THROUGH ALL MY UPS AND DOWNS, TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS, MY FAMILY BEING THERE, AND HAVING TO LOOK AT THEM AND SEE HOW PROUD THEY WERE OF ME, YOU KNOW, MY FANS, MY FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY THAT CONTRIBUTED AND TO HAVING A PART OF ME ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING SO BIG.

NICE MOVE BY ALLEN IVERSON.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN PLAYING WHEN YOU WENT UP AGAINST MICHAEL LIKE THAT? HOW MANY YEARS HAD YOU BEEN IN THE N.B.A. WHEN YOU WENT UP AGAINST MICHAEL LIKE THAT?
THAT WAS MY FIRST YEAR.
Stephen: THAT WAS YOUR FIRST YEAR. WAS THAT-- WAS THAT ONE OF THE HIGH MOMENTS OF YOUR CAREER?
IT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. I DIDN'T REALLY PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IT UNTIL THE AFTERMATH OF IT ALL. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ONCE I GOT RESPONSE FROM EVERYBODY ELSE WORLDWIDE, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY TIMES HAY SHOWED IT ON ESPN, AND STILL TODAY, LIKE, LITTLE KIDS, FIVE AND SIX YEARS OLD COME UP TO ME AND THEY DON'T SAY, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU ALLEN IVERSON?" THEY SAY, "YOU'RE THE GUY THAT CROSSED UP MICHAEL JORDAN, AREN'T YOU?" ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S A SPECIAL-- IT WAS A SPECIAL MOMENT IN MY CAREER BECAUSE THAT WAS MY IDOL. THAT WAS MY FAVORITE. IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, I WOULDN'T HAVE NEVER BEEN A BASKETBALL PLAYER. I WOULDN'T HAVE NEVER HAD THE VISION. YOU KNOW, I TRULY WANTED TO BE LIKE MIKE. THAT MIGHT, WE WAS JUST IN A WAR, AND WHEN YOU'RE IN A WAR, AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE THE THE PERSON THAT YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST, YOU KNOW, MY PHILLY TEAMMATES AND MY PHILLY FANS, I WAS ON THEIR SIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, FOR WHATEVER REASON CRITICIZED ABOUT YOU BACK THE IN THE DAY IS THAT YOUR STYLE WAS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE OTHER STYLES. I DON'T MEAN JUST YOUR GAME PLAY, LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU HAD TATTOOS. THE FACT THAT YOU WORE YOUR HAIR IN CORNROWS. NOW, PLAYERS CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT. THEY CAN CAN HAVE STYLE THEY WANT. LeBRON CAN BE ALL TATTED OUT AND NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING. DO YOU THINK THEY OWE A LITTLE DEBT TO YOU FOR BEING YOUR OWN REAL SELF?
THAT'S A BITTERSWEET THING FOR ME. BECAUSE I WAS YOUNG. I WAS 21 YEARS OLD. AND I TOOK THE ASSPOSITIVE WHOOPING FOR THESE GUYS TODAY TO BE ABLE TO BE THEMSELVES. I WASN'T AFRAID TO BE WHO I AM. I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT. I DRESSED LIKE THE GUYS I GREW UP WITH. I LOOKED LIKE THE GUYS THAT I GREW UP WITH. AND MY CORNROWS, IT WAS JUST BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF GOING FROM CITY TO CITY, HAVING DIFFERENT BARBERS CUT ME HAIR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND THEY WERE MESSING ME HAIR UP. AND I WAS SAYING, OKAY, WELL, IF I GET CORNED ROWS, I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM. AND THE TATTOOS, I ALWAYS HAD A FETISH FOR IT. BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU SEE IN GEORGETOWN, I ONLY HAD ONE. AND ONCE I CAME INTO SOME MONEY AND THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME ADDICTIVE AND I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SO THAT'S HOW I GOT MORE AND MORE. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. I THINK A LOT OF TIMES EYE LOVE THE THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE GET A CHANCE TO MEET ME AND BE AROUND ME, THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I'M NOT THE PERSON THAT THE MEDIA MADE ME OUT TO BE. A NEGATIVE ALLEN IVERSON STORY IS THE GREATEST ALLEN IVERSON STORY FOR SOME REASON, YOU KNOW, WHAT I MEAN? THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT I DO FOR THE AIDS AWARENESS, WHAT I DO FOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB, YOU KNOW, WHAT I DO ON THANKSGIVING, GIVING OUT TURKEYS AND GIVING OUT GIFTS ON CHRISTMAS.

Stephen: NO, NO, YOU ARE! YOU'VE GOT THE SHOW. YOU'VE GOT THE MOVIE. YOU'VE GOT A NEW-- YOU'VE GOT A SHOW THAT'S MOVING OFF BROADWAY AT THE LYNN RED GRAVE THEATER CALLED "CAREER SUICIDE."
I'M SEMISUCCESSFUL. THAT BEING SAID, ALLEN IVERSON'S SWEAT PANT ARE WORTH MORE THAN MY SUIT SO I'M NOT THAT SUCCESSFUL.
Stephen: HE GAVE ME THESE SHOES.
HE DID!
Stephen: WHAT SIZE SHOE DO YOU WEAR?
11 AND A HALF.
Stephen: THESE ARE 10 AND A HALF. HOW TALL ARE YOU?
I'M 5'7".
Stephen: YOU AND HAVE AN 11 AND A HALF FOOT SHOE? WOW? ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT ARE YOU DEPRESSED ABOUT? ( LAUGHTER )
A LOT OF THINGS. A LOT OF THINGS.
Stephen: YOU TALK ABOUT-- A LOT ABOUT ANXIETY.
YEAH.
Stephen: IN YOUR SHOW. WHAT MAKES YOU ANXIOUS?
ALL KINDS OF THINGS. MY SHOW IS ALL ABOUT MY DEPRESSION ISSUES. IT'S A COMEDY SHOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.
Stephen: ALL COMEDY IN SOME WAY IS ABOUT ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL SCARED TO TALK ABOUT THIS STUFF AND I WANT TO LAUGH ABOUT IT AND SEE IF THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT THE ANXIETY-- ONE LOW-LEVEL, MY WIFE IS INCREDIBLE, AN INCREDIBLE PERSON, BUT IF SHE HAS ONE FLAW, IT IS IF SHE USES A CABINET, IT JUST STAYS OPEN.
Stephen: ALL THE THE WAY OPEN?
LIKE, SHE WILL OPEN IT AND WALK AWAY. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE KNOWS THEY MOVE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. LIKE, IT'S BAD. AND THERE WAS ONE NIGHT WHERE WE LAID DOWN IN BED AND I COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP BECAUSE I KNEW, "THERE'S A CABINET OPEN IN OUR KITCHEN." AND IN MY HEAD I'M LIKE WHO CARES? IT'S FINE. THERE ARE NO NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS. AND IN MY HEAD I SAID, "YOU CANNOT MAKE THAT PROMISE." I KNEW I WAS CRAZY. I SAID, "DON'T DO IT. IT'S CRAZY IF YOU DO IT." BUT I DID. I TIPTOED INTO OUR KITCHEN, AND I SHUT THE CABINET DOOR, AND I SAID OUT LOUD, "IT'S OVER." AND I FELL ASLEEP. THAT'S HOW I LIVE.
Stephen: THE FUNNY THING SICAN TOTALLY RELATE TO YOUR WIFE, BECAUSE THAT'S MY WIFE. MY WIFE IS LIKE THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BED AT THE END OF DAY AND SHE'LL BE LIKE, "YOU CAN TURN OFF THE LIGHTS IN THE KITCHEN." I SAID, "YOU BET." AND I OPEN A CABINET AND START TO TURN OFF LIGHTS. AND SHE'S LIKE, PLEASE DON'T, PLEASE CLOSE THAT. SHE'LL RUN OVER AND GO TO CLOSE THE CABINET AND RUN OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND I'LL GO, "TURN OFF THE LIGHT."
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND MY WIFE ARE DRIVING PEOPLE LIKE ME AND YOUR WIFE INSANE.
Stephen: YOU ALSO ARE-- YOU'RE ALSO VERY OPEN ABOUT TAKING ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND THAT SORT OF THING.
YEAH.
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT COMEDIANS, ARE A SAD ON THE INSIDE CLOWN. AND IF YOU AREN'T SAD OR DEPRESSED YOU CAN'T BE FUNNY. DID THAT WORRY YOU AT ALL.
IT DID. AND I THINK IT'S A SAD MYTH. I ALWAYS ARE WORRY I'LL LOSE MY IDEAS IF I'M ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS. AND I WENT ON THEM AND I'M SO MUCH FUNNIER NOW, WHICH IS STUNNING TO SEE. I REMEMBER ONE OF THE IDEAS-- I THINK BACK TO THESE IDEAS. I WENT TO RUTGERS UNIVERSITY-- THE RARE CLAP FOR RUTGERS, WELL DONE. AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CLAPPING FOR RUTGERS UNIVERSITY. I WAS THERE AND I HAD FRIENDS DICOMEDY WITH AND I CALLED THEM UP AND SAID, "I HAVE THE BEST IDEA I EVER HAD. GET OVER HERE."
Stephen: THIS WAS PREANTIDEPRESSANTS.
IT WAS PREANTIDEPRESSANTS. AND I SAID, "WE'RE GOING TO WRITE A PLAY TONIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE CALLED TIME PHONE AND IT WILL BE ABOUT A PHONE WHERE YOU CAN PICK IT UP AND YOU CAN TALK TO PEOPLE IN OTHER ERR AS OF TIME. WE'LL PERFORM IT ONE NIGHT ONLY ALSO TONIGHT AT AN A.T.M. BOOTH AT A LOCAL BANK. WHO'S GOING TO SEE IT? IF ANYBODY NEEDS CATCH THEY WILL CATCH A FEW MINUTE OF TIME PHONE. AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE, "NO, NO, WE'RE NOT DOING IT." AND NOT ONLY IS THAT A BAD IDEA THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SCARED TO LOSE, IT'S THE PLOT OF A DENNIS QUAID MOVIE. "FREQUENCY "IS THAT WITH A HAM RADIO.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SCARED OF IF I WENT ON MEDS I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO INTO A MANIC PHASE AND RIP OFF DENNIS QUAID.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
