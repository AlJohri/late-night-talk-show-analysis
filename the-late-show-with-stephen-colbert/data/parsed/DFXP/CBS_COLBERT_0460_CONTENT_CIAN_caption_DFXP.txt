YEAH!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, NO MOORE! PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES NICK JONAS DENNIS RODMAN AND MUSICAL GUEST JEEZY, FEATURING TORY LAYNZE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY!
Stephen: LOOK WHAT JUST HAPPENED. HEY, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M A LITTLE SHAKY TONIGHT BECAUSE MY HEART HAS BEEN HURTING ALL DAY DUE TO A CONDITION MY DOCTOR CALLS "HOPE."  (  LAUGHTER  ) I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY. I HAVEN'T-- I HAVEN'T BEEN SAYING THAT WORD THAT MUCH THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR. WE HAVE  BURIED UNDER AN AVALANCHE OF BAD NEWS, BUT THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF 2017, THERE WAS A GLIMMER OF LIGHT, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, ROY MOORE LOST TO DOUG JONES! IN ALABAMA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. I MEAN IT'S A GOOD COUNTRY. IT JUST-- JUST NEED A LITTLE SOMETHING. JUST FEELS GOOD.
IT ISLET BEST GIFT GIVEN ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF HAN WHAT. YOU'RE WELCOME, ROY MOORE'S JEWISH LAWYER. THIS IS THE DEEPEST OF THE DEEP SOUTH. ALL ROOTEDS LEAD NORTH FROM THIS ELECTION. JONES IS THE FIRST DEMOCRAT TO WIN AN ALABAMA SENATE SEAT IN 25 YEARS.  ( APPLAUSE ) SO-- A QUARTER OF A CENTURY. SO THE LAST TIME ALABAMA ELECTED A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, THE BIGGEST MOVIE WAS "ALADDIN," OR, AS ROY MOORE CALLS IT, "THE PERFECT DATE MOVIE." WHAT HE CALLS IT, NOT ME. THAT'S WHAT HE CALLS IT. NOW, AFTER WINNING BY 1.5%, JONES, THE WINNER, SHARED A MESSAGE OF HOPE FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
THE PEOPLE IN ALABAMA HAD MORE IN COMMON THAN THAT DIVIDE US. WE HAVE SHOWN, NOT JUST AROUND THE STATE OF ALABAMA, BUT WE HAVE SHOWN THE COUNTRY THE WAY THAT WE CAN BE UNIFIED.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YES! WE ARE UNIFIED AGAINST PEDOPHILIA, PLUS OR MINUS THE MARGIN OF ERROR!  (  LAUGHTER  ) SO WHO CAN WE THANK? WELL, IT TURNS OUT AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS MADE DOUG JONES A U.S. SENATOR IN ALABAMA.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES. YES! YES! YES! THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, BLACK VOTERS. IT IS THE BEST THING AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE DONE FOR ALABAMA SINCE THEY BUILT IT FOR FREE. JUST TAKE A LOOK-- I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF IT. I'M JUST SAYING, THEY DIDN'T GET PAID! JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. JONES GOT 30% OF WHITE VOTERS, AND 96% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. 96%! I THINK, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN--  ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK-- I THINK THAT MEANS AFRICAN AMERICANS GET AN "A+," WHILE WHITE VOTERS WILL BE HELD BACK TO REPEAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT'S ELECTION WASN'T JUST A LOSS FOR ROY MOORE. IT'S A LOSS FOR ALL REPUBLICANS, ESPECIALLY FORMER TRUMP ADVISOR AND LABORATORY MONKEY RECEIVING THE PLACEBO IN A SYPHILIS TRIAL, STEVE BANNON. BANNON BACKED MOORE IN THE PRIMARY AGAINST ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN LUTHER STRANGE. NOW, THANKS TO STEVE "THE WONDER CORPSE" BANNON, REPUBLICANS LOST THE REDDEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY. JUST LISTEN TO NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN AND GROCERY STORE MANAGER WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THOSE TEENAGERS IN THE DAIRY AISLE, PETER KING.
THIS GUY DOES NOT BELONG ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. HE LOOKS LIKE SOME DISHEVELED DRUNK THAT WANDERED ONTO THE POLITICAL STAGE.
Stephen: PERHAPS IT WAS JOHN McCAIN'S DAUGHTER, MEGAN, WHO HAD THE MOST ELOQUENT TAKEDOWN. "SUCK IT, BANNON!"
Jon: OH, WOW!
Stephen: I'M SORRY, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI? THAT'S WHAT BANNON'S BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS WHOLE TIME.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT'S AN OLDY BUT A GOODY. BUT THE REAL LOSER HERE IS DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE HE WAS ALL IN ON ROY MOORE. A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE SAID, "IT'S DEVASTATING TO THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS AN EARTHQUAKE, LIKE VIRGINIA, BUT ON STEROIDS." COINCIDENTALLY, "LIKE VIRGINIA BUT ON STEROIDS" IS THE ALABAMA STATE MOTTO.  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT TO THE PRESIDENT'S CREDIT, AFTER MOORE'S LOSS LAST NIGHT, HE TWEETED SOMETHING ALMOST SPORTSMANLIKE: "CONGRATULATIONS TO DOUG JONES ON A HARD-FOUGHT VICTORY. THE WRITE-IN VOTES PLAYED A VERY BIG FACTOR, BUT A WIN IS A WIN. THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA ARE GREAT, AND THE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE ANOTHER SHOT AT THIS SEAT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT NEVER ENDS!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) YES, IT NEVER ENDS. BUT ROY MOORE'S POLITICAL CAREER? THAT APPEARS TO BE OVER.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT THEN THIS MORNING, TRUMP TOOK STOCK OF HIS ACTIONS, TOOK STOCK OF THE MORAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES THAT MOTIVATED THE VOTERS, AND GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED HIS SHARE OF THE BLAME. I'M JUST KIDDING. LAUGH NO, HE TWEETED, "THE REASON I ORIGINALLY ENDORSED LUTHER STRANGE-- AND HIS NUMBERS WENT UP MIGHTILY-- IS THAT I SAID ROY MOORE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WIN THE ELECTION. I WAS RIGHT! ROY WORKED HARD, BUT THE DECK WAS STACKED AGAINST HIM!" YES, THE DECK WAS STACKED, AND WE ALSO LEARNED THAT DONALD TRUMP'S ENDORSEMENT IS A ROYAL FLUSH. ( TOILET FLUSHING )  ( APPLAUSE ) WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER ONE THING IS TRUE:  TRUMP WAS A STAUNCH BACKER OF LUTHER STRANGE IN THE PRIMARY. BUT AS SOON AS STRANGE LOST, TRUMP DELETED ALL HIS TWEETS SUPPORTING HIM. AND HE'S GOING TO DO THE SAME THING FOR ROY MOORE. BECAUSE BACKING A RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC, TEEN-SQUEEZER IS ONE THING. "BUT BACKING A LOSER? THAT'S OFF-BRAND. NOTICE." TRUMP WAS SO TIED TO ROY MOORE THAT, IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE RACE, HE RECORDED THIS ROBO-CALL.
HI, THIS IS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AND I NEED ALABAMA TO GO VOTE FOR ROY MOORE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. WE NEED ROY TO HELP US WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATE. WE WILL WIN, AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
Stephen: AND YOU CAN'T DELETE A ROBO-CALL, BUT YOU CAN RECORD A FOLLOW-UP.
HI, THIS IS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AND I NEED ALABAMA TO NOT GO VOTE FOR ROY MOORE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. WE NEED NOT ROY TO HELP US WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATE. WE WILL NOT WIN, AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. NOT.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH. HE NEVER SUPPORTED HIM. NEVER SUPPORTED HIM! SO IT SEEMS LIKE ALABAMA, SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN ALABAMA, REALLY DEALT TRUMP A BLOW LAST NIGHT. AND TRUMP REACHED OUT TO THEM BY FIRING HIS ONLY FEMALE AFRICAN AMERICAN ADVISOR, BECAUSE OMAROSA IS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE. FOLKS, THIS IS HUGE! WITH OMAROSA GONE, WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF  (  LAUGHTER  ) ACCORDING TO A WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT, OMAROSA MANIGAULT NEWMAN RESIGNED YESTERDAY TO PURSUE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. I DIDN'T REALIZE "BIG BROTHER" WAS HIRING. BUT THIS MORNING, REPORTER APRIL RYAN TWEETED, "SOURCES SAY GENERAL KELLY DID THE FIRING, AND OMAROSA IS ALLEGED TO HAVE ACTED VERY VULGAR AND CURSED A LOT AND SAID SHE HELPED ELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP." AND YOU GOTTA BELIEVE GENERAL KELLY ENJOYED THAT FIRING, BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS HE IS A MESSY BITCH WHO LOVES DRAMA. APPARENTLY, OMAROSA DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT FROM GENERAL KELLY BECAUSE "A LITTLE LATER ON, SHE TRIED TO GO SEE THE PRESIDENT. SHE TRIED TO GO INTO THE WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE." BAD IDEA. I MEAN, YOU COULD GET SHOT-- OR WORSE, SEE TRUMP IN HIS BATHROBE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND THAT'S WHEN (BLEEP) GOT REAL.
SHE CONTINUED TO TRY TO GO IN, FROM WHAT I'M HEARING, AND GENERAL KELLY WAS CALLED. AND HE CAME OVER, AND HE AND TOLD THE SECRET SERVICE TO GET HER OUT OF THERE.
WHAAAT?
Stephen: WHAAAT? THAT'S AWESOME! IS THERE ANY CHANCE THERE'S FOOTAGE OF THAT?  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND SHE DIDN'T GO QUIETLY. ACCORDING A WHITE HOUSE SOURCE, OMAROSA HAD TO BE "PHYSICALLY DRAGGED" FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. OH, GIRL. RESPECT YOURSELF. THIS IS INCREDIBLE: THE SECRET SERVICE PHYSICALLY DRAGGING SOMEONE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE-- THOUGH, IT'S GOOD PRACTICE FOR WHEN ROBERT MUELLER FINISHES HIS INVESTIGATION.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAAAT! WHA-AAAT? BUT, FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, I AM LIVID ABOUT THIS, NOT BECAUSE OMAROSA SHOULD BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE-- SHE SHOULD NOT-- BUT BECAUSE DONAL TRUMP LET GENERAL KELLY DO THE FIRING. WHAT THE HELL?! FIRING OMAROSA IS LITERALLY THE ONLY JOB DONALD TRUMP IS QUALIFIED FOR! MEATLOAF, IF YOU'RE WATCHING, STAY BY THE PHONE. I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET AN IMPORTANT CALL. ANYWAY, BACK TO ALABAMA-- IS WHAT TRUMP SCREAMS AT JEFF SESSIONS EVERY DAY. THE ALABAMA SENATE RACE IS FINALLY OVER, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO THE WINNER IS, EXCEPT THE LOSER, BECAUSE ROY MOORE REFUSES TO CONCEDE AND WANTS A RECOUNT. UNFORTUNATELY, MATH IS NOT ON ROY MOORE'S SIDE. HE LOST BY 1.5%, THREE TIMES THE MARGIN REQUIRED TO TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC RECOUNT. BUT MOORE'S CAMPAIGN HOPES A REVIEW OF WRITE-IN BALLOTS COULD NARROW THE MARGIN ENOUGH TO TRIGGER A RECOUNT. WAIT, WHY WOULD PEOPLE WRITE IN ROY MOORE? HIS NAME WAS ON THE BALLOT! WHAT, DID PEOPLE GET IN THE VOTING BOOTH AND SAY, "YES, I COULD JUST HIT THIS BUTTON, BUT I'D RATHER PRACTICE MY CALLIGRAPHY."  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT ROY MOORE HAS ONE MORE WAY HE THINKS HE COULD STILL WIN THIS SENATE SEAT.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT GOD IS ALWAYS IN CONTROL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO, IS WAIT ON GOD AND LET THIS PROCESS PLAY OUT.
Stephen: SO, I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER, IS GOD REALLY GOING TO SAVE ROY MOORE'S CANDIDACY?
NO WAY, JOSE!
Stephen: HEY, IT'S GOD, EVERYBODY!
Stephen: HEY, PEOPLE! YEAH. HAPPY HANNUKAH, EVERYBODY. AND HAPPY TOYOTATHON.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: SO, LORD, DO YOU THINK ROY MOORE IS GOING TO GET A RECOUNT?
I GOT TWO WORDS FOR YOU, STEPHEN: NOT A CHANCE.
Stephen: THAT'S ACTUALLY THREE WORDS.
OH, YEAH, I'M NOT SO GOOD WITH NUMBERS. I STILL DON'T GET THAT HOLY TRINITY THING. I'M ME, MY SON, AND A GHOST? WHO WROTE THIS, M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN?
Stephen: SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, LORD, YOU WEREN'T GUIDING ROY MOORE'S CAMPAIGN FROM HEAVEN?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT. BESIDES, ROY MOORE DOESN'T NEED ME. HE CAN PERFORM HIS OWN MIRACLES-- LOSING TO A DEMOCRAT IN ALABAMA!
Stephen: GOD, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BIKER LORD.
HEY, GREAT TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. NICK JONAS IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, HOW ABOUT SOME PUPPIES? WOULDN'T THAT FEEL GOOD?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW THERE ARE DOG PEOPLE AND THERE ARE CAT PEOPLE, AND THEN THERE ARE THE DREADED MOLE PEOPLE. THEY'RE SAD AND LONELY AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE PETS DOWN THERE. IT'S SAD. MY FAVORITESES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DOGS AND IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET FOR A DOG, I DO A SEGMENT CALLED "RESCUE DOG RESCUE." WHERE A CELEBRITY FRIEND JOINS ME TO TELL FLATTERING LIES ABOUT PUPPIES TO GET THEM ADOPTED. MOST RECENTLY, BILLY EICHNER AND I LIED ABOUT SOME PUPPIES IN HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, AND JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER TIMES WE'VE DONE THE SEGMENT, EVERY SINGLE DOG WAS ADOPTED.  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH! SADLY, WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A FOREVER HOME FOR BILLY, BUT YOU CAN STILL ADOPT HIM. WE EVEN GAVE HIM ONE OF THOSE I.D. CHIP IMPLANTS IN CASE HE RUNS AWAY. WELL, THIS HOLIDAY SEASON, WE'RE OPENING A BIG BOX OF PUPPIES FOR YOU. THIS IS "RESCUE DOG RESCUE." ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "RESCUE DOG RESCUE." LET'S GET THESE DOGS SOME NEW HOMES. IF ONLY THERE WERE A FAMOUS CELEBRITY WILLING TO BE APPEAR ON CAMERA WITH SOME ADORABLE ANIMALS.
I'M ONE OF THOSE!
Stephen: NICK JONAS! GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: AWESOME! AWESOME. OKAY, NICK, OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.
YEAH, I'M GOING TO VOTE SO MANY DOGS OFF THE ISLAND, IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING.
Stephen:  NOT HOW THIS WORKS. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE UP SOMEALIZE, SOME BIG ONES, ABOUT THESE PUPPIES TO MAKE SURE THEY GET GOOD HOMES.
BEAUTIFUL, LET'S DO IT.
Stephen: HERE WE GO, FIRST PUPPY UP. WHO DO WE HAVE HERE? EVERYBODY, YAY! THIS IS JACK. JACK HAS A-- COME ON, JACK. DON'T EAT MY TIE. JACK HAS A BARTENDER'S LICENSE, BUT CONSIDERS HIMSELF MORE OF A "MIXOLOGIST." HE'LL CREATE CUSTOM CRAFT COCKTAILS AT YOUR NEXT PARTY, BUT DON'T CALL HIM A BOOZE HOUND. BECASUE HE HATES LAZY WORDPLAY.  ( APPLAUSE )
THIS IS ROCKY. HE'S A VERY LUCKY DOG. IN FACT, HE HAS WON THE POWERBALL SIX TIMES FOR A TOTAL OF $18 MILLION! BUT BECAUSE HE'S A DOG, HE DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW MONEY WORKS, SO IT'S ALL YOURS!  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NEXT UP, WE'VE GOT LOGAN. LOGAN IS A CERTIFIED HOT YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND CAN GET YOU IN SHAPE FOR BEACH SEASON. TRAIN WITH LOGAN, AND SOON YOU, WILL BE ABLE TO LICK YOURSELF IN PLACES YOU'VE NEVER IMAGINED.  ( APPLAUSE )
Audience: OOOH!
SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO MINNIE. MINNIE LOVES YOU. YES, YOU, MARTIN JOHNSON OF DES MOINES, IOWA. WHO, IF THAT IS A REAL PERSON, BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO ADOPT THIS DOG.
Stephen: HERE WE GO. OH! HEY THERE! THIS IS LUCY. LUCY IS POLITICALLY ACTIVE AND WENT DOOR TO DOOR TO GET OUT THE VOTE IN THE ALABAMA SENATE RACE.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HER WORK HELPED PUT DOUG JONES OVER THE TOP. BUT FULL DISCLOSURE: SHE ONLY VOLUNTEERED BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HIS NAME WAS "DOG" JONES.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
THIS IS VIXEN. VIXEN KNOWS ALL THE IMPORTANT COMMANDS, INCLUDING "SIT," "STAY," AND "KEEP THE CAR RUNNING WHILE I ROB THIS BANK."  (  LAUGHTER  ) YEAH!
Stephen: WHO DO WE HAVE HERE? OH, YES. OH! THIS-- THIS IS KRINGLE! HELLO! HELLO! KRINGLE IS A DOG YOU WILL LOVE. WITH A DOG LIKE KRINGLE, YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF PUPPY LOVE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIS EVIL EYEPATCH-WEARING TWIN BROTHER IGNACIO SHOWING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF CHRISTMAS DINNER AND DECLARING HIS LOVE FOR YOUR WIFE. AND SO YOU ALSO WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT KRINGLE THEN SHOUTING, "IGNACIO! HOW DARE YOU TRY TO TEAR APART THIS FAMILY!" WHICH MEANS YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE TWO OF THEM ERUPTING INTO A MAGNIFICENT SWORD FIGHT THAT CARRIES OUT ONTO A WINDBLOWN CLIFF BECAUSE THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN... TWICE.  ( APPLAUSE )
SAY HELLO TO NOELLE. NOELLE ONCE SAVED J.J. ABRAMS' LIFE, WHICH MEANS ANYONE WHO ADOPTS HER GETS TO BE IN THE NEXT "STAR WARS" AS CHEWBACCA'S BROTHER, FRANK-BACCA.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )

I HAD A CHANCE TO WRITE THIS SONG "HOME" NERD NAND.
Stephen: FER NAND, THE BULL WITH THE DELICATE EGO, YES.
SO BASICALLY, I TRIED A BUNCH OF TIMES AFTER I SPOKE TO THE DIRECTOR, CARLOS, WHO IS AN AMAZING GUY AND DID A BRILLIANT JOB WITH THE FILM AND THEY GAVE ME A BRIEF OF WHAT THEY WANTED AND I COULDN'T GET IT RIGHT. I PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON MYSELF, AND I TEAMED UP WITH JUSTIN CANTOR, A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, AND WE WENT INTO THE STUDIO TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS TO BE ACCEPTED, TO BE LOVED, AND WHAT THAT IS FOR EACH OF US. TO BOTH OF US IT WAS HOME, OUR FAMILY, OUR FRIEND. I WOKE UP IN A PANIC ON MONDAY MORNING BECAUSE I THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD GONE TERRIBLY WRONG BECAUSE MY FRIEND WAS BANGING ON MY DOOR WITH THE PHONE OUT LIKE THIS. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. HE COULD HAVE JUST COME AND BEEN EXCITED WHEN HE HANDED ME AT THE TIME WHO-- I DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME-- WAS MY MANAGER ON THE PHONE TELLING ME I WAS NOMINATED. HE LOOKED LIKE THIS. I WAS LIKE, OKAY, SOMEBODY DIED. I GRABBED THE PHONE, HELLO." I'M HALF ASLEEP. AND MY MANAGER SAID, "YOU DID IT! YOU'RE NOMINATED FOR A GOLDEN GLOBE." I AND I DID LAPS AROUND MY HOUSE. I WAS SO EXCITED.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN BEFORE?
I HAVE BEEN ONCE BEFORE. I'VE BEEN TO SOME OF THE PARTIES AND THINGS BUT THE OTHER TIME I WENT WAS BACK WITH MY BROTHERS AND WE WERE SITTING AT-- I THINK IT WAS THE KIDS' TABLE. AT THE TIME --
Stephen: YOU WERE KIDS.
YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT DOES MAKE SENSE.
Stephen: NOW, THE GOLDEN GLOBES ARE FAMOUS FOR PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO DRINK THERE.
YES.
Stephen: PEOPLE GET LIT AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES, AND IT REALLY IMPROVES THE ACCEPTANCE SPEECHES.
YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU GUYS INDULGE AT ALL?
WE DID NOT.
Stephen: NO?
NO, WE WORKED FOR A COMPANY CALLED DISNEY AT THE TIME.
Stephen: I'M FAMILIAR. I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WORK. THEY WOULD FROWN ON THAT?
I THINK MY OLDEST BROTHER WAS OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK, BUT EVEN HE WAS LIKE, THEY'RE WATCHING. THE MOUSE SANDER HERE SOMEWHERE.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU HANDLE OR HOW DID YOU LEARN TO HANDLE STARDOM BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT SORT OF GANGS OF TEENAGED GIRLS COMING AFTER YOU?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE LIVING ROY MOORE'S DREAM, IS WHAT I'M SAYING!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, GOD!
Stephen: BUT HONEST TO GOD, DID YOU LIKE IT WHEN THE SCREAMING GANGS OF GIRLS IN THE MALLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
YOU KNOW, IT-- AT 16, 17 YEARS OLD, IT'S KIND OF THE DREAM SCENARIO. AND-- AND SO IT WAS-- IT WAS A GOOD THING. BUT, ALSO, YOU KNOW, THERE IS THAT ELEMENT WHERE UP THERE TIMES IT WAS A BIT OF AN INVASION OF PRIVACY.
Stephen: SURE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO GROW UP AND YOU'RE TRYING TO JUST LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH LIFE IN GENERAL BUT YOU ALSO HAVE EXTRA EYEBALLS ON YOU AND IT'S TOUGH. THANKFULLY I HAD SOME AMAZING PEOPLE AROUND ME, AND IT ALL WORKED OUT.
Stephen: YOU'RE A DARLING OF THE TABLOIDS. THEY ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU AND YOUR LOVE LIFE AND I HAVE A PICTURE THAT'S PRETTY REVEALING. YOU TWEETED THIS, AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GIVING ANYTHING AWAY THAT YOU'RE IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE DATING A DOUGLAS FIR. RIGHT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS PHOTO RIGHT NOW?
YOU HAD ME SO NERVOUS.
Stephen: REALLY?
BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, IS HE REALLY GOING TO ASK ME ABOUT MY DATING LIFE RIGHT NO?
Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PHOTO. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO PLANT A WET KISS ON THIS TREE.
WE GOT TO SECOND BASE IN THAT ONE. THAT WAS A BIG MOMENT NO, I LOVE CHRISTMAS --
Stephen: IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST. IN JANUARY, YOU'RE LITERALLY GOING TO KICK HER TO THE CURB.
THAT'S GOOD.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
THAT'S A GOOD JOKE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH. YEAH.
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.
Stephen: YEAR, SURE, YEAH. PLEASE PROMISE ME YOU'RE WEARING PROJECTION. OKAY. NOW-- SEE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU COULDN'T ASK WHEN YOU WORKED FOR DISNEY. YOUR BRO JOE IS ENGAGED TO SANZA STARK.
THAT'S THE CHARACTER'S NAME.
Stephen: SOPHIE TURNER. DO YOU WATCH "THE GAME OF THRONES?"
I LOVE THAT.
Stephen: WHY DID ED SHEER AN GET TO BE IN "GAME OF THRONES." WHY NO NICK JONES?
GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: I WOULD ENJOW YOU BEING MURDERED BY ARIAS STARK.
I WOULD BE HONORED TO BE MURDERED BY ARIAS STARK. DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT TOGETHER? I WOULD PITCH THAT.
Stephen: I AM NOT JOKING. DO NOT TEASE ME.
SHE MIGHT BE WATCHING.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE A CONNECTION HERE?
I HAVE AN IN RIGHT NOW. I'M THRILLED FOR MY BROTHER AND HIS BEAUTIFUL FIANCE AND THEIR MARRIAGE-TO-BE AND THEIR LOVE. BUT I'M NOT SURE I'M GOING TO PRESS "THE GAME OF THRONES" CARD TOO HARD IN THE FIRST YEAR OF ENGAGEMENT.
Stephen: IF FAMILY JONAS HAD A SIGN LIKE THE WOLF OR THE STAG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR FAMILY SIEGEL WOULD BE ON THE ARMS?
IT WOULD BE BIG EYEBROW S.
Stephen:  EYEBROWS AND CROSSED BY A TWEEZER.
EXACTLY, YEAH.  (  LAUGHTER  )
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING?
Stephen:  THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "JUMANJI: WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE." CONTINUATION OF THE 1995 FILM.
CORRECT.
Stephen: WHAT IS DIFFERENT? HOW DOES IT CONTINUE?
THIS-- OKAY, SO BASICALLY, I WAS A HUGE FAN OF THE ORIGINAL, WHICH I WATCHED WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX. AND I-- I WAS KIND OF FREAKED OUT, YOU KNOW. IT WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY SCARY MOVIE FOR THAT AGE. BUT I WATCHED IT THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD, AND THEY CALLED ME ABOUT THIS ONE. AND I WAS CURIOUS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A BELOVED FILM. I THINK THERE'S A PERSONAL ATTACHMENT TO IT, AND, YOU KNOW, I READ THE SCRIPT AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE WAY THEY WERE APPROACHING THIS. BASICALLY FOUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET DETENTION AND THEY HAVE TO CLEAR OUT THIS STORAGE UNIT IN THE SCHOOL, AND THEY GET STUKD SUKD INTO THE "JUMANJI" GAME CONSOL INSTEAD OF THE BOARD GAME AND BOTTOM THE AVATARS THEY CHOOSE. AND WE HELP EACH OTHER FINISH THIS GAME.
Stephen: I MEAN, YOU GUYS-- IT'S SHOT IN HAWAII, RIGHT?
SHOT IN HAWAII, BEAUTIFUL HAWAII.
Stephen: YOU'RE IN THE JUNGLE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S KEVIN HART, JACK BLACK, "THE ROCK," YOU. WHO AMONG YOU WOULD ACTUALLY NOT SURVIVE IN THE JUNGLE, DO YOU THINK?
KEVIN HART.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HE'S VERY FIT. HE IS VERY FIT.
NO, HE'S DONE. I GIVE HIM TWO HOURS WITHOUT--  (  LAUGHTER  ) WITHOUT ALL-- YOU KNOW, HIS TRAILER AND EVERYTHING ELSE. HE ALSO IS-- I MEAN, DEATHLY AFRAID OF BUGS.
Stephen: I'M GUESSING THEY HAVE THOSE THERE.
A LOT OF BUGS. A LOT OF CENTIPEDES, A LOT OF MOSQUITOES. AND DWAYNE CAUGHT ON TO IT. THEIR CHEMISTRY IS AMAZING, BECAUSE THEY DID "CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE" TOGETHER AND THERE'S CHEMISTRY AND THEY'RE A BROMANCE. DWAYNE CAUGHT WIND OF IT AND STARTED PLANTING FAKE BUGS ALL OVER THE SET. IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCENE, KEVIN WAS LIKE YAAH! (BLEEP).
Stephen: JACK BLACK'S IN IT, TOO, AND HE IS A GREAT SINGER.
HE'S A FANTASTIC SINGER.
Stephen: DID YOU GUYS EVER, LIKE, DID YOU GUYS EVER MAKE ANY MUSIC ON THE SET TOGETHER?
WE DID, ACTUALLY. WE WROTE A-- THE UNOFFICIAL "JUMANJI" THEME SONG.
Stephen: WOULD YOU --
I'D BE THRILLED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU.

YOU MUST BE HIGH.  ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT IS-- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
GOOD ONE.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN OVER TO NORTH KOREA. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN OVER THERE FIVE TIMES SINCE 2013. THREE MEETINGS WITH KIM JONG-UN. WHY DO YOU GO?
WELL, FOR SOME REASON, HE LIKES ME. I'M BEING HONEST. HE LIKES ME. AND I THINK THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IF YOU ACTUALLY GO OVER THERE AND MEET HIM, OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T SEE HIM TALK ON TV. BUT FOR SOME REASON, HE TRUSTS ME. AND WHEN I WENT OVER THERE, THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME, HE SAID, MR. RODMAN WE JUST WANT TO KNOW, CAN WE TRUST YOU?" I SAID, "ABSOLUTELY." AND THAT'S HOW OUR CONSERVATION STARTED.
Stephen: WOW. AND WHY YDO YOU THINK HE BELIEVED YOU, BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING? "MR. COLBERT," CAN WE TRUST YOU?" "ABSOLUTELY." AND THEN I'D START RECORDING THEIR NUCLEAR SITES.
IT'S ALL GOOD. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE IN THE WORLD THAT WOULD ACTUALLY TRY TO KILL ANYONE ON THIS PLANET. I DON'T GET THAT. YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE --
Stephen: BUT HE HAS.
I'M JUST SAYING A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE AROUND THE WORLD. I'M SAYING I'M NOT PROTECTING HIM. AND PEOPLE THINK THAT I SIT THERE AND SAY, "HEY, HE'S MY BEST FRIEND." THAT'S NOT THE CASE. HE JUST TREATS ME AS A FRIEND.
Stephen: THIS IS ONE OF YOUR TRIPS OVER THERE. DO YOU REMEMBER THIS ONE THIS WAS, WHICH TRIP THIS WAS?
THAT'S PROBABLY THE SECOND ONE.
Stephen: SECOND TRIP. HERE YOU ARE WITH KIM JONG-UN AT A--
LOOK HOW DRESSY RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU WORE YOUR FORMAL VEST.
RIGHT.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT WAS WARM OVER THERE. NOW WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT HERE? DOES HE SPEAK ENGLISH? DO YOU SPEAK KOREAN? IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION HERE. WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT WITH-- I DON'T MEAN THIS INSULTINGLY-- A MAD MAN MURDEROUS DICTATOR?"
ACTUALLY, WE TALK ABOUT BASKETBALL.
Stephen: OH, OKAY. DID HE EVER PLAY?
IN SWITZERLAND HE DID.
Stephen: IN SWITZERLAND.
HE WENT TO SCHOOL THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT COUNTRY FOR--
THEE WENT TO SCHOOL OVER THERE. I'M SAYING PEOPLE LIKE THAT-- YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR COLOR, I DON'T JUDGE WHERE THEY COME FROM, STUFF LIKE THAT. I JUDGE PEOPLE WHERE-- YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. THROUGHOUT THE DAY, WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. AND IT'S FUNNY, THOUGH, THAT I DON'T SEE HOW PEOPLE CAN SIT THERE AND SAY THIS PERSON IS A MAD MAN. HE PROBABLY IS. BUT I DIDN'T SEE THAT. HE PROBABLY IS. I'M JUST SAYING --
Stephen: REPORTS ARE HE MURDERED HIS UNCLE AND FED HIM TO DOGS.
HE DID?
Stephen: YEAH.
WELL, IF YOU SEE THE VIDEO IN THE BASKETBALL GAME, AND YOU ACTUALLY SEE HIS UNCLE STANDING RIGHT BEHIND-- RIGHT BEHIND THE BENCH.
Stephen: OKAY. SO HIS UNCLE IS FINE?
HIS UNCLE IS FINE.
Stephen: OKAY. MAYBE HE HAS MORE THAN ONE UNCLE. MAYBE THAT'S A SPARE UNCLE RIGHT THERE.
EITHER WAY.
Stephen: HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO KIM JONG-UN ABOUT HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AT ALL? HAVE YOU SAID, "PLEASE DON'T START A NUCLEAR WAR?"
HE ASKED-- HE HAS SPOKEN TO ME LAST TIME I WAS THERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. HE SAID-- HE SAID, "I DON'T WANT WAR." THESE ARE TRUE WORDS. "I DON'T WANT WAR." I WOULD TAKE YOU OVER THERE AND LET YOU LISTEN TO HIM THE WAY HE TALKS. HE'S MORE OF A KID, THAN ANYTHING.
Stephen: OKAY.
I THINK HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER, THAT REGIME HAS PASSED DOWN TO HIM. AND I THINK HE REALLY WANTS TO CHANGE HIS CULTURE BUT I THINK HE'S FORCED TO BE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE EVERY TIME I GO OVER THERE, HE'S CHANGED SO MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE DON'T SEE THAT.
Stephen: AND HE'S A KID, BUT HE'S A KID WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
WELL, HEY.
Stephen: A TOUGH COMBINATION.
I KNOW, THAT RIGHT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS? DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIM TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS?
WELL, I'M CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIM TO THE FACT THAT HE CAN DISCUSS ANYTHING WITH ME. THE DEAL, IS I DON'T DISCUSS POLITICS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT MY JOB. MY JOB IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING, TO TRY TO CONNECT US WITH HIM BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SIT THERE AND LOOK AT ME AND SAY, "OKAY,UN WHAT? YOU BETRAYED AMERICA." NO, I DIDN'T. I WENT OVER THERE TO TRY TO SOLVE THINGS, TO TRY TO OPEN THE DOOR SO WE CAN HAVE SOME COMMUNICATION. LIKE I SAID, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE SOMEBODY TO BE AROUND THEM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOVE SOMEBODY TO LIKE THEM. IT'S LIKE PLAYING SPORTS. WHEN I WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOVE THEM OR LIKE THEM TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. BUT I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, THOUGH.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT.
I BROUGHT SOMETHING I HAVE FOR YOU. MAN, IT'S TIGHT RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU, PRESILLA. SO HERE YOU GO. THIS IS GOING TO BE FUNNY, GUYS.  ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S GOING TO BE FUNNY. I'M GOING TO SEE IF HE'LL WEAR IT.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY. AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT ME-- YOU'VE GOT ME OVER HERE, YOU'VE GOT ME ON THIS SIDE. AND I WILL SAY AGAIN--  ( APPLAUSE ) I WILL SAY ONE MORE TIME YOU MUST BE HIGH. WELL, DENNIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK. STAY SAFE.
Stephen: DENNIS RODMAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY JEEZY, FEATURING TORY LANES.
