DO YOU THINK THAT GUNS HAVE ANY PLACE IN AND AROUND SCHOOLS?
I THINK THAT THAT IS LEFT TO LOCALES AND STATES TO DECIDE. IF THE UNDERLYING QUESTION IS.
YOU CAN'T SAY DEFINITIVELY TODAY THAT GUNS SHOULDN'T BE IN SCHOOLS?
WELL, I WILL REFERñr BACK TO SENATOR ENZI AND THE SCHOOL THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUTñr IN WYOMIN I THINK PROBABLY THERE, I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THERE IS PROBABLY A GUN IN THE SCHOOL TO PROTECT FROM POTENTIAL GRIZZLIES. (LAUGHTER)
YES, TAMMY.
WE'VE HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF YOU, MISTER. IT'S THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES IDINA MENZEL, RACHEL BLOOM AND LOUIE ANDERSON. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE FROM T-E ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY. HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY, WELCOME TO THE SLATE THOUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PLEASE V A SEAT. TOO KIND, TOO KIND. WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. I AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. THAT'S ME, THAT'S ME.
Jon: THAT'S HIM.
Stephen: YOU GUYS ARE A CHEAP DATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCHED THE TV THIS AFTERNOON BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA HELD HIS LAST PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY. HE TALKED ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, JOB CREATION. PRETTY BORING STUFF. AND MAN, I AM GOING TO MISS BEING BORED. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AT ONE POINT-- NOT GOING TO BE BORING. IT'S GOING TO BE EXCITING. AT ONE POINT HE DID HAVE SOME STRONG WORDS FOR RUSSIA.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST TO REMEMBER THAT THE REASON SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE AGAINST RUSSIA HAS TO DO WITH THEIR ACTIONS IN UKRAINE. AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE UNITED STATES TO STAND UP FOR THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BIG COUNTRIES DON'T GO AROUND AND INVADE AND BULLY SMALLER COUNTRIES.
Stephen: WELL SAID, BIG COUNTRIES DON'T INVADE SMALLER COUNTRIES FOR TWO MORE DAYS. AFTER THAT, TRUMP AND PUTIN ARE GOING TO FLIP A COIN TOñr SEE WITHOUT GETS DENMARK. (LAUGHTER) THERE WAS AN INSPIRING MOMENT, I REALLY LIKE 24-D ONE. THE FIRST NONWHITE MALE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT HE WILL NOT BE OUR LAST.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LATINA PRESIDENT, A JEWISH PRESIDENT, A HINDU PRESIDENT. WHO KNOWS WHO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE. I SUSPECT WE'LL HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF MIXED UP PRESIDENTS AT SOME POINT THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO CALL HIM 6789 (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: YEAH. YEAH. (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: A WHOLE MIXED BAG. A MIXED BAG.
Stephen: NO, THAT'S A HOPEFUL FEELING AM BUT I HAVE A FEELING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MIXED UP PRESIDENT IN ABOUT 36 HOURS. BUT I DO HAVE SOME IDEAS OF WHAT TO CALL HIM. AND BARACK OBAMA ENDED THE ENTIRE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH A MESSAGE OF HOPE.
AND MY CORPS,-- AT MYçó CORE  THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY WELCH HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. WE HAVE TO WORK FOR IT AND NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND I THINK YOU WILL HELP US DO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PRESS CORPS, GOOD LUCK.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK. SEEIA, WOULDN'T WANT BE TO YA. BYE BYE. BYE BYE. I'M OUTTA HERE. I'LL SEE YA. THERE HE GOES. SUCKS TO BE YOU. BYE BYE. (LAUGHTER) SHOOT. BEFORE HE LEFT HE DID STUN EVERYBODY YESTERDAY BY COMMUTING THE SEN TENSION OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT LEAKER CHELSEA MANNING. THAT WAS WEIRD. THAT REALLY SURPRISED ME. CUZ I HEARD TRUMP WAS THE ONE WHO LOVED HUGE LEAKS. NOW THE QUESTION IS-- REALLY, REALLY, REALLY? TOO SOON? TOO FRESH? NOW THE QUESTION IS WILL WHISTLE-BLOWER EDWARD SNOWDEN NOW GET A PARDON. BECAUSE TODAY RUSSIA ANNOUNCED IT WAS EXTENDING HIS ASYLUM AFTER THAT, OF COURSE, HE WILL FACE TRIAL UNDER U.S. PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. MEANWHILE EVERY ONE ISñr GETTING READY FOR TRUMP'S INAUGURATION INCLUDING, AND THIS REALLY SURxR&SED ME, DONALD TRUMP. TODAY HE TWEETED OUT THIS PICTURE WITH THE CAPTION, WRITING MY INAUGURAL ADDRESS AT THE WINTER WHITE HOUSE. MAR-A-LAGO. ARE WE SURE-- WE PUT THAT BACK UP. ARE WE SURE IT'S MAR-A-LAGO. BECAUSE IT REALLY JUST LOOKS LIKE HE MOVED HIS DESK INTO SADDAM HUSSEIN'S BATHROOM. BEAUTIFUL, GOLDEN TOILET. GOLDEN TOILETS EVERYWHERE. AMAZINGñr WORK. AND THIS MORNING THE DONALD ELECT STAT DOWN FOR AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW ON FOX AND FRIENDS WHERE HE INAUGURATION PRIORITIES.
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE WHITEñr HOUSE?
WELL, I WANT TO GO TO WORK. MONDAY IS REALLY THE DAY THAT WE START SIGNING AND WORKING AND MAKING GREAT DEALS FOR THE COUNTRY. TO POINT OUT, YOU'RE PRESIDENT FROM NOON ON FRIDAY. OF COURSE, I CAN UNDERSTAND,çó FRIDAY'S GOING TO BE TOUGH BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN HE GETS SWORN IN AND THEN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY HE WILL BE GOOGLING STUFF PRESIDENTS DO. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: CATCH UP ON THAT.
Stephen: THAT'S MYçó TRUMPÑi SURPRISE.ç MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHOçó TURNS OUT ARE BOYCOTTING HIS INAUGURATION.
AS FAR AS OTHER PEOPLEçó NOTÑ GOING, THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE NEED SEATS SO BADLY. I HOPEÑi THEY GIVE ME THEIR TICKETS.
Stephen: WAIT, DID YOU JUST SAY YOU HOPE THEY GIVE YOU THEIR TICKETS? IS DONALD TRUMP SCALING TICKETS TO HIS OWN INAUGURATION? ALL RIGHT, WHO NEEDS TWO. WHO NEEDS TWO? WHOçóÑi NEEDS TWO.Ñi I GOTÑiçó TWO, WITHñr ANÑi OBSTR VIEWñr OF MELANIA. WHO NEEDS THEM? SMOKE, SMOKE, SMOKE. I DON'T KNOW WHY HEñKi WOULD SAY THAT. AND HE DOESN'T SEEM WORRIED A INAUGURATION ISN'T GOING TO HAVE ANY CELEBRITIES.
WHAT ABOUT THE CELEBRITIES WHO ARE NOW PULLING OUT.
MANY OF THE CELEBRITIES THAT ARE SAYING THEY ARE NOT GOING, THEY WERE NEVER INVITED. I DON'T WANT THEÑiw3 CEL WANT THE PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE THE BIGGEST CELEBRITIES IN THE WORLD THE BIGGEST IN THExD WORLD.
I WON'T SAY THAT, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Stephen:Ñi WOW!Ñi THEY GOT OBAMA. OBAMA IS A HUGE CELEBRITY, PEOPLE LOVE THAT GUY. I MEAN MORE AND MORE EACH DAY FOR SOME REASON. I DON'T KNOW WHY. OBAMA. (CHEERS ANDxD APPLAUSE) I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WOW. AND THEN TRUMP EVEN ADDRESSED THE,  SHALL WE SAY LITTLE BIRD IN THE ROOM.
WHAT ABOUT TWITTER. ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO TBEET?
YEAH, LOOK. I DON'T LIKE TWEETING. HAVE I OTHER THINGS I COULD BE DOING. BUT I GET VERY DISHONEST MEDIA, VERY DISHONEST PRESS.
Stephen: YEAH, THE MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST. VERY DISHONEST PRESS. THEY LIE ALL THE TIME. FOR INSTANCE, JUST THIS MORNING ON FOX I SAW SOME ORANGE GUY SAY THAT TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE TWEETING. THAT IS FAKE NEWS. THAT IS A LIE. (APPLAUSE) THAT GUY, I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS. I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS BUT THAT GUY IS A LIAR.
Jon: SOMEBODY LYING.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF WHICH, THE PRESIDENT-ELECT ADDRESSED THAT FAKE NEWS PROBLEM TOO.
IT'S ALL FAKE NEWS. I CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON. I CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
Stephen: YEAH, PEOPLE MAKE UP FAKE NEWS ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN ALL THE TIME. I MEAN FOR INSTANCE, THE MEDIA WANTS US ALL TO BELIEVE THAT HE WON THE CIVIL WAR BUT I DON'T KNOW. I SAW A LOT OF CONFEDERATE FLAGS AT THOSE TRUMP RALLIES. I DON'T SEE HOW-- WHY WOULD THERE BE CONFEDERATE FLAGS. FAKE, ALL FAKE. AND GET READY FOR SOME MORE RALLIES, FOLKS. BECAUSE WHILE WE'RE STILL TWO DAYS AWAY FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HE HAS ALREADY DECIDED ON HIS SLOGAN FOR A RE-ELECTION BID IN 2020. NO! NO SIR! BAD TRUMP! YOU DO NOT GET TO DO THAT YET. WE JUST GOT DONE WITH THE LAST ELECTION. YOU CAN'T START CAMPAIGNING FOR RE-ELECTION TWO DAYS BEFORE YOU START THE JOB YOU CAMPAIGNED FOR. ARE YOU READY FOR THE NEW SLOGAN? IT'S KEEP AMERICA GREAT. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOUR LAST SLOGAN WAS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND YOUR NEW SLOGAN IS KEEP AMERICA GREAT. AREN'T YOU SKIPPING OVER A PRETTY IMPORTANT MIDDLE STEP THERE. THE ONE WHERE YOU MAKE AMERICA GREAT? IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A RES RECIPE FOR FRIED CHICKEN WAS, BUY RAW CHICKEN, WHO WANTS SECONDS. OF COURSE-- HMMMM, HMMMM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
Jon: THAT WAS NICE.
Stephen: I GOT TO SAY.
I'M ALL FOR CHICKEN.
Stephen: I WILL TAKE FRIED CHICKEN ANYWAY CAN I GET IT.
Jon: OH MAN.
Stephen: OF COURSE THE TRUMP PEOPLE WANT TO COVER ALL THEIR BASES WITH THE NEW SLOGAN. SO THEY TRADEMARKED A FEWÑi OTHE 2020 SLOGANS JUST IN CASE THE NEXT FOUR YEARS DON'T GO AS PERFECTLY AS I'M SURE THEY WILL. AND WE AT THE LATE SHOW HAVE MANAGED TO GET OUR HANDS ON THESE SLOGANS. OKAY, AGAIN, WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE, WHAT I HAVE HERE ARE THE BACKUPÑi TRUMP SLOGANS, JUST IN CASE THEY NEED A DIFFERENT SLOGAN. AM I CLEAR ENOUGH WHAT THIS IS? THIS IS DIFFERENT. HERE WE GO. OKAY. FIRST ONE IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AGAIN. (LAUGHTER) I LIKE THIS ONE. OKAY, THIS TIMEÑi WE REALLY ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, Iñr SWEAR. THIS ONE MIGHT COME IN HANDY. THOSE WOMEN ARE LIARS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS ONE SAYS BECAUSE IT'S IN RUSSIAN. I'M NOT SURE-- (LAUGHTER) THIS ONE, I HOPE WE DON'T NEED THIS ONE HERE. THE ATOMIC MONSTERS WEREN'T MY FAULT. THOUGH I THINK THIS NEXT ONE HERE, I THINK THIS ONE MIGHTñr B THE ONE THAT WE REALLY ARE GOING TO NEED IF FOUR YEARS. MAKE AMERICA AGAIN. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. IDINA MENZEL IS HERE. BUT FIRST I GET SOME THINGS OFF MY CHEST WITH MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IFñr YOU'R REGULAR WATCHERS OF THE SHOW YOU KNOW I'M A DEVOUT CATHOLIC BUT I'M SO BUSY WITH THE SHOW I ALMOST NEVER GET TO SUNDAY MASS. BUT I BELIEVE IF GOD WANTED ME TO GO TO CHURCH HE WOULD HAVE PUT IT ON NETFLIX. BUT I TELL YOU, I REALLY MISSION MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITION AND THAT'S CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WOULD LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
OF COURSE NOT.
Stephen: GREAT.ÑiÑMóiUIn THIS IS IS MIDNIGHTxDxDxDñr CONF (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)e1yofpLKoLh STANDARD DISCLAIMER, I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, IF I EVER TELL YOU I'M STUCK IN TRAFFIC, IT MEANS I HAVEN'T LEFT HOME YET. I ALWAYS IMAGINED MY MOST SATISFYING EXPERIENCE WOULD BE FATHERHOOD BUT ACTUALLY IT'S EATING YOGURT PRETZELS DRUNK. OH MY GOD. HMMMM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M KIND OF JEALOUS THAT I'LL NEVER EXPERIENCE THE WONDER OF CHILD BIRTH. BUT SOMETIMES AFTER I EAT A BURRITO I RUB MY STOMACH AND SING RAFFI TO IT. SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES AUDIENCE, SOMETIMES I STARE INTO THE DISTANCE TO SEEM THOUGHTFUL. BUT I'M REALLY JUST TRYING TO MAKE A BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW EXPLODE WITH MY MIND. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW THAT GUY IN THE OFFICE WHO ALWAYS TAKES THE LAST CUP OF COFFEE WITHOUT MAKING A NEW POT? I HAD THAT GUY MURDERED. (APPLAUSE) IF I'M OUT OF SALAD DRESSING I'LL SOMETIMES JUST USE MARSHMALLOW FLUFF. AND I MAKE SURE I'M ALWAYS OUT OF SALAD DRESSING. AUDIENCE, I KNOW HOW TO FOLD FITTED SHEETS, BUT I WILL NEVER TELL MY WIFE. (LAUGHTER) I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLAMMABLE AND INFLAMMABLE. WHICH IS WHY THE JUDGE TAUGHT ME THE DIMPS BETWEEN GUILTY AND NOT GUILTY. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I CHEATED IN PSYCHOLOGY. SO I WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT ME. (APPLAUSE) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE.
WE FORGIVE YOU.
Stephen: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH IDINA MENZEL. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS A FONNEE AND GRAMMY AWARD WINNER FROM WICKED AND RENT AND THE VOICE OF ELSA IN FROZEN. SHE'S NOW IN THE LIFETIME REMAINING OF "BEACHES."

THE ONLY TIENL HE REALLY LIKES IT IS WHEN I WAS VOLUNTEER NGHT KINDERGARTEN CLASS, AND WE WERE DOING ARTS AND CRAFTERS.

WHEN I CAME OUT IT SOUNDED LIKE AN EGG ROLL FROM CHINESE FOOD.
Stephen: YEAH.
Stephen: JESUS LOVED EGG ROLLS. AT THE LAST IS UPPER, ALL EGG ROLLS.

Stephen: SO WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. I PARTICULARLY LIKE-- ARE YOU SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
I'M SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM THERE.

AND MY SON SAID DID YOU LOOK LIKE ME WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE. AND HE HELD HIS-- KIND OF LIKE THAT FAMOUS PICTURE THEY KEEP SHOWING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: THE LITTLE BOY ASKED.
KEEPS REMINDING ME OF THAT. HE SAID OH MAN, I WISH MY HAIR WAS AS COOL AS YOURS, YOU ARE MUCH BETTER LOOKING THAN I WAS. IT WAS SO SWEET. AND THEN, AND THEN I SAID MR. PRESIDENT, I'M SORRY, NERVOUS, NATIONAL ANTHEM T IS TOTALLY REHUMILIATING IF YOU FORGET THE WORDS. HE LEANED OVER, I'LL HELP YOU. OH, SAY CAN YOU-- .
Stephen: HE HAS A NICE VOICE.

THAT IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE GLOBS THERE WAS A REASON THAT WE GOT RENEWED TO A SECOND AND THIRD SEASON.
Stephen: THIRD SEASON HAS JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. (APPLAUSE) I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE REASON YOU LIKE THE GOLDEN GLOBES IS BECAUSE THERE IS A BAR.

Stephen: YOU GOD GLOBED FACED.
I GOT GLOBED PHASE.
Stephen: I HAVE NEVER BEEN BUT THE EMMYS AND GRAMMIES, THE BAR CLOSES, AS SOON AS THE SHOW STARTS THE BAR CLOSES WHICH IS RIDICULOUS, BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE, THAT IS WHEN YOU REALLY WANT A COCKTAIL.

Stephen: DID YOU BRING ENOUGH ENOUGH TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE.
I WISH HI ONE RIGHT NOW, IT WAS LIKE A SUPER LONG STRAW AND I COULD FEED THE FANS.
Stephen: CAN I-- WHAT IS ON THE NAILS THERE.

Stephen: IT'S LIKE LIKE HE HAS THREE MUSTACHES ON HIS FACE. HE'S THREE TIMES THE TOM SELLECK.
HE REALLY IS. NOW YOU STARTED OFF IN MUSICAL THEATER AND SWITCHED OVER TO DO COMEDY.

Stephen: YOU WERE AT NYU, GRADUATE STUDENT.
I WAS UNDERGRAD.
Stephen: AND THEN YOU SWIMPED OVER TO STUDY WITH THE PEOPLE ATU CB HERE IN NEW YORK. WHY, YOU STAYED STILL STUDYING AT NYU THOUGH, YOU JUST DOUBLED UP.
I WAS KIND OF DOING BOTH. ON A SCRECH GROUP AT NYU AND I REALLY FELL HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH COMEDY. LIKE INSTANTLY AS I STARTED DOING IT.
Stephen: WERE YOU HEDGING YOUR BETS OR OBSESSIVE, LIKE YOU HAVE TO KEEP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
I-- YOU KNOW WHAT, I DIDN'T, MY WHOLE LIFE I HAD BEEN LIKE I WANT TO BE ON BROADWAY AND IF I DON'T GET ON BROADWAY I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON WHO SHOULD KILL HER SEVERE. AND I DIDN'T HAVE-- BUT THAT'S HOW MUSICAL THEATER KIDS ARE, YOU ARE TALENTED IS SYNONYMOUS WITH YOUR SELF-WORTH, AND IT'S NOT 45E89Y. BUT WHEN I GOT INTO COMEDY I HADN'T TOLD MYSELF MY WHOLE LIFE I'M GOING TO A WORLD FAMOUS COMEDIAN SO I WENT INTO IT WITH THIS OPEN MIND, I DON'T HAVE TO BE THE BEST, I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN.
Stephen: DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE IN SHOW BUSINESS. DID YOU CONSIDER ANYTHING ELSE. YOU GREW NEWSPAPER L.A.
I DID.
Stephen: YOU SOO TO CONSIDER SHOW BUSINESS IN L.A., IT'S SORT OF LIKE, IT'S THE FACTORY JOB IN TOWN.
IT IS KIND OF THE FACTORY JOB. I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS AND NO ONE IN MY FAMILY WAS REALLY IN SHOW BUSINESS EXCEPT FOR MY GRANDFATHER WAS LIKE AN AMATEUR STAND UP COMEDIANS BUT STOLE ALL HIS JOKES FROM BOOKS. BUT I DID FOR AWHILE, I WAS ALSO REALLY INTERESTED IN, I KIND OF WANTED TO BE A SURGEON FOR AWHILE. BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE CUTTING THINGS OPEN AND SEEING THEIR GUTS. AND I VOLUNTARILY JOINED  A-- DPSH.
Stephen: YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THAT PART.
WHAT? NO.
Stephen: MUSICAL THEATER OR CUT PEOPLE OPEN, SO SWEENEY TODD WAS YOUR FIRST MUSICAL I'M GUESSING.
HONESTLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES, YES.
Stephen: WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THE DOCTOR?
WELL, I JOINED THE-- I JOINED THIS THING IN MY MIDDLE SCHOOLED, THE FUTURE SURGEONS OF MBMS AFTER SCHOOL WHERE WE VOLUNTARILY DISSECTED PIGS THE WHOLE TIME. AND I JUST ACCIDENTALLY KEPT CASS TRAITING THEM. AND I-- I REALIZED THAT-- -- I JUST REALIZED I DON'T HAVE QUITE-- I THINK MY-- I THINK I HAD TOO CLUMSY A HAND. AND SO I WENT TO THE OBVIOUS NEXT CHOICE WHICH WAS MUSICAL THEATER.
