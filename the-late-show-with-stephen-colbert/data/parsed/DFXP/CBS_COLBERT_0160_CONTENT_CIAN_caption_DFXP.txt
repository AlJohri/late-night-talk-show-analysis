Stephen: WELL, YESTERDAY WAS THE VERY LAST PRIMARY SO THE PRIMARY SEASON IS OFFICIALLY OVER. LOOKS LIKE I WON'T BE NEEDING THIS ANYMORE. MMM. ( LAUGHTER ) OR MY LIQUOR. ( LAUGHTER ) OR MY MEDS. OR MY TRUSTY AIRPLANE GLUE. GONE, FRIEND. NOPE, NOW IT'S ON TO THE GENERAL ELECTION. NOW IT'S TIME TO BRING UP ON THE THE PSYCHEDELIC TOADS. WHOOOO!
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES LIAM HEMSWORTH. ANA GASTEYER. AND A PERFORMANCE BY COMEDIAN PAUL MECURIO. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHOOO! HEY, HOW ARE YOU? HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY, UP THERE. HEY, DOWN HERE! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! NICE TO SEE YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THE GARAGE DOOR DIDN'T OPEN WHEN I CAME OUT HERE. I GUESS I DIDN'T HAVE MY KEY CARD IN MY POCKET. I'M NOT SURE. MAGNETIC OR SOMETHING. WELL, FOLKSES, WELCOME TO THE SHOW, YOU CAN FEEL A SENSE OF RELIEF IN THE NATION RIGHT NOW.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU CAN FEEL IT.
Stephen: LAST NIGHT, THE LAST PRIMARY WAS HELD IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE PRIMARIES BEING OVER REMINDS ME WHAT MY BROTHER USED TO SAY WHEN I WAS A KID-- AH, I'M GOING TO KEEP PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE BUT IT WILL FEEL SO GOOD WHEN IT'S OVER." ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: IT NEVER DOES!
Stephen: DON'T TELL MOM! LAST NIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON BEAT BERNIE SANDERS BY 57 POINTS. ( APPLAUSE ) TURNS OUT, RUNNING AS A WASHINGTON INSIDER REALLY HELPS WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING INSIDE WASHINGTON. BUT HILLARY'S WIN IS NOT THE BIGGEST DEMOCRATIC NEWS FROM YESTERDAY BECAUSE IT IS NOW BEING REPORTED THAT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMIT WAS HACKED BY THE RUSSIANS. HEY, MAYBE THEY KNOW WHERE HILLARY'S EMAILS ARE. AND WHILE THEY WERE IN THE D.N.C. CYBER MATRIX-- THIS IS MY CYBERRING-- THE RUSSIANS APPARENTLY STOLE OPPOSITION RESEARCH ON DONALD TRUMP. RUSSIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IF YOU WANT DAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, JUST WAIT FOR HIM TO TALK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S ON THE TV! YOU CAN RECORD IT. IT'S ON YOUR PHONE. AND IT'S THE MOST ADORABLE SECURITY BREACH OF ALL TIME BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN HACKERS ARE CODENAMED COZY BEAR AND FANCY BEAR. I ASSUME THIS IS ALL PART O "OPERATION: PANDA GIGGLE RAINBOW SPARKLE." WELL, I, FOR ONE, AM TERRIFIED AT THE NEWS THAT RUSSIAN HACKERS ARE TARGETING US, SO I HIRED SOME NEW I.T. GUYS TO CHECK MY SERVER. HOW'S IT GOING OVER THERE, BRIAN?
A-OKAY, COWBOY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYTHING IS TOP GUN BLUE JEANS!
Stephen: THANKS, THANKS. MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY GOVERNMENT WITH PROBLEMS OUT THERE. THE BRITISH ARE ABOUT TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION. THEY CALL IT THE BREXIT, WHICH, IN AMERICA, OF COURSE IS THE MEAL BETWEEN BREAKFAST AND EXITING BREAKFAST. AND RIGHT NOW IN THE POLLS, BREXITING HAS A SEVEN-POINT LEAD OVER STATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND IT COULD BE EVEN BIGGER THAN IT SOUNDS BECAUSE, REMEMBER, BRITISH POLLS ARE ALL IN CELSIUS. BUT THERE'S ALSO HAPPY NEWS FROM THE BRITISH ISLES. I JUST READ A MAN IN IRELAND HAS FOUND A 2,000-YEAR-OLD, 22-POUND, STILL-EDIBLE HUNK OF BOG BUTTER. ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. 2000-YEAR-OLD BUTTER! THAT IS BUTTER FROM THE TIME. JESUS. YOU'RE TELLING ME I COULD EAT 22 POUNDS OF BUTTER AND HAVE ABS LIKE THAT? THAT'S A MIRACLE! NOW, ONE THEORY-- HE'S CUT.
Jon: HE'S CUT, MAN.
Stephen: CARPENTER, MAN, WORKS THE CORE, WORKS THE WORK. ONE THEORY HOLDS THAT THE BUTTER WAS BURIED BY ANCIENT PRIESTS AS A RITUAL OFFERING TO THE GODS. AND ONE EXPERT SAYS, "THEORETICALLY, THE STUFF IS STILL EDIBLE, BUT WE WOULDN'T SAY IT'S ADVISABLE." ( LAUGHTER ) COINCIDENTALLY, "EDIBLE BUT NOT ADVISABLE" ALSO THE SLOGAN FOR SLIM JIMS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES. SLIM JIMS, IT LOOKS LIKE HAIR AND OIL IN A TUBE. WELL, FOLKS, LOCK-TIME VIEWURES KNOW NOT VISIBLE IS MY MIDDLE NAME. SO I GOT SOME OF THAT BOG BUTTER, AND I'M GOING TO EAT IT RIGHT HERE TONIGHT. BRING IT OUT, BOYS! BOG BUTTER. THANK YOU, ED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. ( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. MMMM-MMMM-MMMM. ( THUNDER )
OH, LOWLY HUMAN, TAKE HEED! YOU MUST NOT PARTAKE OF THE SACRED  BUTTER THAT WAS GIFTED TO THE GODS OF YORE! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHY, BECAUSE IF A MORTAL EATS IT, HE WILL BE CURSED?
NO, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN IN THE GROUND. IT'S GROSS. YOU DO KNOW THAT YOUR MODERN GROCERY STORES ARE FULL OF BUTTER, RIGHT, LIKE THIS DELICIOUS TUB OF BUTTER I GOT AT KROGER.
BEHOLD! THE SACRED BUTTER! ( RUMBLING NOISE )
Stephen: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW THAT'S MARGARINE, RIGHT?
WHAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DID YOU APPEAR FROM THE PRIMORDIAL PAST JUST TO SET YOURSELF UP FOR THAT JOKE?
YES.
Stephen: ANCIENT BUTTER DRUID, EVERYBODY.
CAN I STAY FOR LIAM HEMSWORTH?
Stephen: NO! YOU'RE NO FUN.
Stephen: OFF! NOW SAY HEY TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU.  ( CHEERS ) GOTTA SAY, THAT ANCIENT BOG BUTTER REALLY WAS PRETTY BAD. IT'S UNSALTED. I DON'T KNOW. SO LAST NIGHT I WAS WATCHING REUNIONS WHEN I STUMBLED ON ONE OF MY FAVORITE OLD TV SHOWS "QUANTUM LEAP." DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT SHOW? ( APPLAUSE ) BAN PACIFIC, I LOVED IT. SCOTT BAKULA LEAPS BACK IN TIME INTO DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S BODIES IN ORDER TO CHANGE HISTORY. AND I SAW THIS ACTUAL EPISODE OF "QUANTUM LEAP," WHERE BAKULA'S CHARACTER, DR. SAM BECKETT, LEAPS INTO THE BODY OF A '50s NEW YORK CAB DRIVER AND INFLUENCES A VERY SPECIAL YOUNG BOY.
SO WHERE YOU GOIN'?
A BROKER'S MEETING, NEW YORK REALTORS.
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF MONEY MADE IN REAL ESTATE IN THE FUTURE.
REALLY? WHERE?
OH, UM, WELL, I BET THERE ARE GONNA BE A LOT OF TALLER BUILDINGS ALL AROUND HERE. AND, UM, MIGHT EVEN BE SOME BIG GLASS TOWER RIGHT THERE NEXT TO TIFFANY'S.
HERE YOU GO. COME ON, DONALD.
HELLO, MR. TRUMP.
TRUMP?
SEE YA.
Stephen: THERE IT IS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU HEAR THAT? HE SAID, "MR. TRUMP." DONALD TRUMP'S RISE IS THE FAULT OF SCOTT BAKULA. HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REVEALED THE SECRET THAT NEW YORK REAL ESTATE IS VALUABLE. WELL, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REVERSE THIS BECAUSE I'VE GOT MY OWN QUANTUM LEAPY THING RIGHT HERE SO I CAN LEAP BACK AND STOP IT FROM HAPPENING. YOU GUYS READY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, ZIGGY, SET QUANTUM LEAP ACCELERATOR FOR THE YEAR "YOUNG DONALD TRUMP." IT WORKED! DR. SAM BECKETT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
PLEASE, STEPHEN, CALL ME SCOTT BAKULA.
Stephen: SURE THING, DR. BECKETT. NOW PICK UP LITTLE TRUMP AND LET'S GET READY TO CHANGE THE FUTURE. REMEMBER, I'M A HOLOGRAM THAT ONLY YOU CAN SEE OR HEAR.
AND WHY IS THAT AGAIN?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW! IT'S YOUR SHOW.
WHERE YOU HEADED, KID?
MY DAD'S OFFICE. SOME DAY I'M GONNA BE IN REAL ESTATE JUST LIKE HIM!
Stephen: OKAY, SCOTT, FIX THE FUTURE.
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD JOB. BUT, LISTEN, KID, PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER GET INTO POLITICS. IT'S A CRUEL BUSINESS, AND YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT. ( BEEPING )
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD. ZIGGY SAYS THERE'S AN 85% CHANCE THAT TRUMP GOES INTO POLITICS SOONER JUST TO, "SHOW SOME DUMB CAB DRIVER WHO SAID I COULDN'T HANDLE IT!"
AND HE'S ELECTED PRESIDENT?
Stephen: NO. HE'S ELECTED POPE!
OH, MY GOD!
Stephen: HIS GOD NOW! DO SOMETHING.
HEY, KID, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? MEXICAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE.
YEAH, MEXICANS ARE GREAT! ( BEEPING )
Stephen: SCOTT, NO! NO!
WHAT?
Stephen: NOW HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A MEXICAN GIRL NAMED MARIELA, AND SHE ENDS UP BREAKING HIS HEART! THERE'S A 99%  CHANCE HERE THAT POPE TRUMP STILL BUILDS THE WALL, DEPORTS ALL THE HISPANICS, PLUS ANYBODY NAMED PAUL.
WHO'S PAUL?
Stephen: THE GUY MARIELA LEFT HIM FOR!
WHAT SHOULD WE DO? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? DO YOU HAVE A MOISTURE IN YOUR POCKET, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MESSED THIS UP. I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR GEORGE BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHTY, NOBODY'S AROUND, YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A CROWBAR IN THE TRUNK, AND THE EAST RIVER IS RIGHT OVER THERE.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, STEPHEN?
Stephen: I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING, SCOTT.
LOOK, KID, FORGET ABOUT REAL ESTATE. IT'S A TERRIBLE INVESTMENT. ( BEEPING )
Stephen: UH-OH, SCOTT. NOW AN 80% CHANCE THAT INSTEAD OF REAL ESTATE, TRUMP GETS INTO BIOENGINEERING AND ENDS UP CLONING DINOSAURS WHO DEVOUR ANYONE WHO QUESTIONS THE WORD OF MEGA-POPE TRUMP! ( LAUGHTER )
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. HOW ARE YOU SO BAD AT THIS! IT WAS A GOOD SHOW, BUT YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT THIS! AT THE LEAST, AT THE VERY LEAST, PLEASE--
YOUR CIGAR IS NOT EVEN LIT GLI CAN'T. IT'S ILLEGAL TO SMOKE ON STAGE HERE! FOR PETE'S SAKE, SHOW SOME PROFESSIONALISM AND TRY TO SET THIS THING BACK WHERE IT WAS BEFORE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME, KID. FORGET EVERYTHING I SAID TO YOU TONIGHT. JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND ALWAYS SAY THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND.
SHUT UP, YOU CLOWN!
SO, DID IT WORK?
Stephen: WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT!
Stephen: WHEW. HEY! ZIGGY SAYS WE DID IT, TRUMP IS STILL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BUT THE TIME STREAM IS BACK TO NORMAL. THANK GOD WE DIDN'T CREATE SOME WEIRD FUTURE, SCOTT.
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN, STEPHEN.

A STAND AND CLAP.
Stephen: WE CALL THAT A STANDING OVATION.
OR A STANDING OVATION.
Stephen: IT'S SIMPLER.
I DIDN'T FINISH SCHOOL, SO.
Stephen: YOU KNOW I'M A LIAM HEMSWORTH FAN, RIGHT?
REALLY.
Stephen: I MEAN, OF THE BROTHERS, OF THES HEMSWORTH BROTHERS, THE THREE OF YOU, I'M ON TEAM LIAM.
ARE YOU? GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS?
NO.
Stephen: I SAID PUBLICLY WHEN YOUR BROTHER CHRIS WAS NAMED "PEOPLE "MAGAZINE'S SEXIEST MAN ALIVE I WENT ON THE AIR AND SAID,"HE'S NOT EVEN THE SEXIEST HEMSWORTH ALIVE." THAT'S YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
Stephen: PLEASE TELL HIM I SAID THAT AND HAVE HIM COME ON THE SHOW. I'LL CHANGE MY TUNE IF HE'S SITTING THERE. YOU'RE THE BABY, RIGHT?
I'M THE BABY, YUP. THE RUNT OF THE LITTER.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT LIKE BEING THE BABY OF THOSE GUYS? WERE YOU CODDLED BY THEM, OR WERE YOU USED AS A TACKLING DUMMY?
THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME SHENANIGANS GROWING UP.
Stephen: SHENANIGANS.
SHENANIGAN S.
Stephen:  THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW, LET'S KEEP THIS CLEAN. I'M THE YOUNGEST OF EIGHT BROTHERS AND I WAS USED, LIKE, AS A WRESTLING DUMMY.
I HEARD 11.
Stephen: EIGHT BOYS, THREE GIRLS. THE GIRLS WERE NICE TO ME, THE BOYS WERE ABUSIVE.
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST FAMILIES I'VE HEARD ABOUT. THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: DID THEY DO ANYTHING TO YOU LOVING BUT VIOLENT.
LOVING BUT MOSTLY TRAUMATIC. THEY USED TO PUT ME IN THE DRYER A LOT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, THEY WOULDN'T PUT THE HEAT ON, BUT THEY'D PUT ME IN THERE --
JUST A LITTLE FLUFF TO GET WRINKLES OUT. NOW, DID YOUR PARENTS KNOW THIS WAS HAPPENING?
WELL, I THINK THEY KIND OF JUST TURN A BLIND EYE TO THAT SORT OF THING. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
Stephen: I'M NOT TELLING ANY TALES OUT OF SCHOOL HERE BUT YOU'RE FROM AUSTRALIA.
YES.
Stephen: AND AMERICANS HAVE A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT AUSTRALIA. WE THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING-- EVERY SPIDER IS OUT TO GET YOU. IS THAT TRUE?
IT'S 100% TRUE, YEAH.
Stephen: REALLY, AS A KID, WAS IT SPIEDERS AND SNAKES AND THAT KIND OF THINGS?
LOT OF-- LOT OF DEADLY SNAKES AIR, FEW DEADLY SPIDERS, BIG SHARKS, BIG CROCODILES.
Stephen: YEAH?
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST GOT TO FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH LIFE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AND EVEN IF YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THAT YOUR BROTHERS STUFF YOU IN A DRYER AT THE END OF IT.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOUR DAD, YOUR DAD-- WHAT WOULD HE DO TO WATER BUFFALO? I HEARD THIS STORY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT THIS RIGHT.
YEAH, MY MOM AND DAD, WHEN I WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD, WE LIVED ON A CATTLE STATION IN THE OUTBACK IN AUSTRALIA.
Stephen: IS THAT LIKE A RANCH? WE CALL THAT A RANCH UP HERE?
YEAH, A LITTLE MORE REMOTE, I THINK, AND A LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS, THAN A TYPICAL RANCH.
Stephen: SO TOUGHER THAN AN AMERICAN RANCH. OKAY.
TOUGHER THAN AN AMERICAN RANCH GLI KNOT YOU.
I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND ANYONE. WE'RE IN AMERICA.
Stephen: TOO LATE, TOO LATE. BUT A CATTLE STATION.
BASICALLY HIS JOB WAS TO CATCH WATER BUFFALO AND THE WAY THEY DOHA IS THEY STRAP TIRES AROUND THE FRONTAVE JEEP AND THEY DRIVE UP NEXT TO A BUFFALO AS IT'S RUNNING AWAY AND THEY KNOCK IT OVER AND TIE IT UP AND THROW IT ON THE THE BACK OF A TRUCK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU KNOCK IT OVER AND THE BUFFALO GOES, "YOU GOT ME, OKAY, GO AHEAD."
NO, NOT AT ALL. YOU'VE GOT TO JUMP OUT REAL QUICK AND WITH A NUMBER OF LARGE MEN GET ON TOP OF THAT BUFFALO AND TIE HIM UP.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND THEN IT GETS DRAGGED TO THE OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE, AND THEN THEY--
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU-- WHAT'S THE MOST OFFENSIVE THING THAT AMERICANS SAY TO SOMEONE-- LET ME GET THAT FOR YOU.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT YOU TO DROWN IN HALF AN INCH OF WATER.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU BLESS YOU.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE MOST OFFENSIVE THING THAT AMERICANS SAY TO SEEM INDUSTRIALIAN. IS IT LIKE, "THAT'S NOT A KNIFE." WOULD YOU LIKE A BLOOMIN' ONION?
THAT ONE-- I WOULD SAY THE WORST IS SHRIMP ON THE BARBIE. SHRIMP ON THE BARBIE --
ARE THERE NOT BARBIES DOWN THERE. WE DEFINITELY HAVE BARBIES, BUT WE DON'T CALL SHRIMP, SHRIMP, WE CALL THEM PRAWNS. AND TYPICALLY IN AUSTRALIA WE DON'T BARBECUE PRAWNS, WE BOIL THEM. SO THE WHOLE STATEMENT IS RIDICULOUS. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. YOU HEARD IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S OVER. NO MORE! NO MORE. OKAY, WELL, THE NEW MOVIE IS "INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE" HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THE THE FIRST ONE CAME OUT 20 YEARS AGO.
SIX YEARS OLD.
Stephen: DID GUSEE IT?
I DIDN'T GO SEE IT IN THE THEATER. I WATCHED IT WITH MY BROTHERS ON VIDEOTAPE. I HAD IT ON VIDEOTAPE YOU.
Stephen:  ARE OLD, VIDEOTAPE.
YEAH, VHS.
Stephen: NOW, IT DOESN'T COME OUT ON INDEPENDENCE DAY THIS YEAR. IT COMES OUT NEXT FRIDAY, RIGHT?
THE 24th OF JUNE, THE WEEKEND BEFORE INDEPENDENCE DAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REASONING BEHIND THAT IS.
Stephen: IS THAT AUSTRALIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY? DO YOU GUYS HAVE AN INDEPENDENCE DAY OR ARE YOU NOT INDEPENDENT?
NO, WE'RE PRETTY INDEPENDENT DOWN THERE.
Stephen: REALLY.
I THINK INDUSTRIAL IS QUITE INDEPENDENT.
Stephen: DO YOU STILL HAVE THE QUEEN ON YOUR MONEY?
YES.
Stephen: THEN YOU'RE NOT INDEPENDENT. SORRY, THERE YOU GO. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. PREMIERES NEXT FRIDAY, NOT THE 4th OF JULY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE LIAM HEMSWORTH.

( APPLAUSE ) BUT I KNOW I AM LEAVING OUT AN IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC-- ANIMALS WHO WATCH THE SHOW. WELL, THAT CHANGES TONIGHT WITH OUR NEW SEGMENT:  "STEPHEN COLBERT'S BEAST REALITY." ( ANIMAL NOISES ).
SHARK, SHARK!
Stephen: TONIGHT, I'VE GOT SOME GREAT NEWS IF YOU'RE A FROG, BECAUSE SCIENTISTS IN INDIA HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW SEX POSITION FOR FROGS. IT'S EXCITING NEWS FOR AMPHIBIANS EVERYWHERE. ALSO, ONE LUCKY PIG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) APPARENTLY, THERE ARE NEARLY 7,000 SPECIES OF FROGS OUT THERE, BUT UP UNTIL NOW, THERE HAD BEEN ONLY HAD BEEN ONLY SIX KNOWN SEX POSITIONS. STILL THREE MORE THAN HUMANS HAVE. LET'S SEE THERE'S... LIGHTS ON, LIGHTS OFF, AND BIRTHDAY. RESEARCHERS CAME ACROSS THE NEW POSITION AFTER SPENDING 40 NIGHTS IN A DENSE INDIAN FOREST OBSERVING THE MATING HABITS OF FROGS, WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR THOSE SCIENTISTS, BECAUSE WHEN YOU'VE DEDICATED YOUR LIFE TO STUDYING FROGS, YOU DESERVE TO SEE SOMEONE HAVE SEX. THE NEW FROG SEX POSITION--  ( CHEERS ).
Stephen: YOU ARE APPLAUD AGO I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE APPLAUDING SCIENTISTS ENJOY WATCHING FLOGS HAVING SEX IN A NONSCIENTIFIC WAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE NEW POSITION IS CALLED THE DORSAL STRADDLE. AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT, BUT FIRST, IF THERE ARE ANY TADPOLES IN THE ROOM, YOU MIGHT WANT TO COVER WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE THEIR EYES. HERE IT IS. WOW. FROGGY WENT A-COURTIN', AND HE DID RIDE. NOW HERE'S THE THING. THIS IS CBS, AND AT THIS POINT I HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY'RE GOING TO BLUR FROGS HAVING SEX OVER MY SHOULDER TONIGHT. I CAN'T WAIT TO GO HOME AND FIND OUT. THIS ONE HAS TO BE DONE UP AGAINST A ROCK, OR MAYBE THE KITCHEN COUNTER WHEN THE FROG'S ROOMMATE ISN'T HOME. SO THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE NEW POSITION. AND FOR ANY OF YOU UNFAMILIAR WITH THE OTHER POSITIONS, THOSE WERE ALSO ILLUSTRATED IN THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY. SO LET'S REVIEW. AGAIN, FOR SCIENCE. NUMBER ONE: AXILLARY, FROGGY STYLE. NUMBER TWO: IN-GUINAL. THAT'S RIBBIT, FOR HER PLEASURE. NUMBER THREE:  CEPHALIC. THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GOING FOR AXILLARY, BUT YOU BOTH HAD A LONG DAY AT WORK. NUMBER FOUR:  GLUED. THAT'S AFTER ONE OF YOU WENT OUT FOR DINNER AT THE INDIAN BUFFET. NUMBER FIVE: INDEPENDENT. THAT IS WHEN YOU'RE SO TIRED FROM THE FIRST FIVE POSITIONS THAT YOU JUST ROLL OVER AND WATCH SEPARATE THINGS ON YOUR PHONES. AND LASTLY, NUMBER SIX: HEAD STRADDLE. FROGS: THEY'RE JUST LIKE US. ( LAUGHTER ) SO CONGRATULATIONS! AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN! I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, AND I DO NOT KNOW AT THIS POINT OF THE DAY WHETHER CBS IS GOING TO BLUR FROGS SPAWNING. SO, CONGRATULATIONS, FROG SCIENTISTS, ON THIS BREAKTHOUGH DISCOVERY. BUT DON'T STOP, BECAUSE THERE IS AT LEAST ONE MORE FROG SEX POSITION WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT. SOME DAY WE'LL FIND IT. THE RAINBOW CONNECTION. THAT ONE IS FOR THE LOVERS, THE DREAMERS, AND ME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANA GASTEYER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT IS A HILARIOUS COMEDIAN WHOSPENT SIX YEARS ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" AND NOW STARS IN THE NEW SHOW "LADY DYNAMITE." PLEASE WELCOME ANA GASTEYER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YOU!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. THAT WAS A VERY FESTIVE ENTRANCE. VERY NICE.
THE MUSIC WAS FUN, AND I'M WEARING A FLORAL.
Stephen: YOU ARE, YOU'RE READY FOR SUMMER.
I'M READY FOR FUN!
Stephen: IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU. I THINK I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE YOU SAT IN MY OFFICE AT "SATURDAY NIGHT" WHEN YOU WERE A GUEST WRITER.
Stephen: FOR ONE MONTH I WROTE FOR "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
AND YOUR GUITAR. YOUR DAUGHTER WAS A LITTLE BABY.
Stephen: SHE WAS. MY DAUGHTER ACTUALLY THREW UP IN LORNE MICHAEL'S OFFICE.
THAT'S SO CUTE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I WAS THERE FOR ONLY ONE MONTH.
ALMOST EVERYONE HAS THROWN UP IN LORNE MICHAEL'S OFFICE. IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOUR DAUGHTER IS GOING TO BE WATCHING THE SHOW TONIGHT BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO SEE YOU ON.
NO, NO, TO SEE LIAM. YEAH. AND, OF COURSE, SHE'S A "HUNGER GAMES" FAN. SHE'S GOING TO BE TURNING 14 THIS WEEK, AND SHE IS A "HUNGER GAMES" FAN. LIKE ALL YOUNG CHILDREN. WE ALL READ IT WHEN SHE WAS IN FIRST AND SECOND. IT'S THE MOST DEPRESSING THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD WITH YOUR CHILDREN.
Stephen: IT'S GREAT TO BE READING TO A SEVEN- AND EIGHT-YEAR-OLD. "AND THE CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO HUNT EACH OTHER."
"SO THEY CAN SURVIVE."
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, SLEEP TIGHT.
BUT SHE LIKES ALL OF THE REALLY SAD, LIKE, THENICULAR SPARKS MOVIE THAT HE DID, "THE LAST SONG." BECAUSE SHE'S AT THAT AGE WHERE SHE GOES WITH ALL HER GIRLFRIENDS AND THEY AUDIBLY SOB AT THE MOVIES FOR A FUN TIME.
Stephen: ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT GETTING ONE OF THOSE DOLLS. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT GIFT.
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT GIFT. BUT BEFORE THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL, SHE SAID, "LOOK AT MY EYES. I BROKE A BLOOD VESSEL, I CRIED SO HARD."
Stephen: WERE YOU LIKE THAT WHEN UPPER 14?
A GROUP SOBBER? I DO LIKE A CATHARTIC MOVIE CRY. I HAVE ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS-- WHEN I SAW "THE HELP "SOME PEOPLE GOT UP AND MOVED AWAY. SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S A MOVIE SOB, IT'S REAL GUTTY AND YOU CAN'T STOP IT. I'M A COMEDIAN AND I LIKE TO KEEP IT TAMPED AND WHEN IT COMES, HOLY COW, A TSUNAMI.
Stephen: THANKSGIVING DINNER AIR, COUPLE OF OLD FASHIONED. FOR ME IT'S "A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT." BRAD PITT, TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR THIS WORLD.
IT HURT. IT ACHES. IT'S AN ACHE. IT'S A THROAT ACHE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? WHEN YOU START TO CRY AND IT'S-- IT'S A ZOMBIE MOAN IS REALLY WHAT HAPPENS. AND PEOPLE THINK THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IS HAPPENING AND THEY FLEE THE THEATER YOU.
Stephen:  ARE NOW IN "LADY DYNAMITE" WITH MARIA BAMMED FORD. IS THIS LOOSELY BASED ON MARIA'S LIFE?
IT IS VERY MUCH BASED ON HER LIFE. "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT" CREATED IT FOR MARIA BASED ON HER LIFE AND HER EXPERIENCE WITH HER BIPOLAR 2 DIAGNOSE.
Stephen: SHE'S VERY OPEN ABOUT HER OWN MENTAL ILLNESS. AND HILARIOUS ABOUT IT AND YOU FEEL BAD ENJOYING HER JOKES SO MUCH SOMETIMES.
IT'S SO DELIGHTFUL. BECAUSE SHE'S SO HONEST ABOUT HER OWN FRAGILITY AND HER OWN MANIA. AND THIS SHOW IS A RIDICULOUS COMEDY THAT TAKES PLACE DURING HER EXPERIENCES OF MANIA AND DEPRESSION, AND SORT OF NOW TRYING TO HOLD STEAD NEHOLLYWOOD, WHICH SAY PLACE VERY PRONE TO MAINIA AND DEPRESSION.
Stephen: AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR CHARACTER COMES IN, I UNDERSTAND.
MY CHARACTER IS EYE PLAY THE MOST POWERFUL AGENT IN HOLLYWOOD, KAREN GRISHAM.
Stephen: OH, I HAVE HEARD OF HER. SHE'S VERY GOOD.
SHE'S A BIG CHEESE. AND I SORT OF CONTRIBUTE TO TH THE-- HER ENORMOUS SUCCESS IN HOLLYWOOD AND HER MASSIVE DEPRESSION AND BREAKDOWN.
Stephen: IS SHE A NICE PERSON?
NO, SHE'S THE MEANEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. IT'S SUPER FUN. AND SHE SWEARS-- IT'S NETFLIX SO YOU CAN REALLY LET IT FLY WHICH IS REALLY SATISFYING AFTER NETWORK TELEVISION AND STANDARDS AND PRACTICES AND THESE WRITERS, THE WRITERS' ROOM WAS REALLY JUST HAVING A FIELD DAY. I MEAN, USES-- USES OF SWEARS THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WERE POSSIBLE JUST IN TERMS OF GRAMMATICAL SWIM-EM-UPS.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT EITHER BECAUSE THE CLIP YOU BROUGHT TONIGHT TO SHOW I DON'T KNOW IF ANY WILL BE UNBLEEPPED.
YOU CAN ALWAYS WATCH IT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE HAVE TO WATCH THE SHOW NOW. THIS IS A REAL TEASER.
EVERYONE IS GOING TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY SAYING.
Stephen: JIM?
MARIA!
HI!
I HEARD YOU GOT BABY ON BOARD. THAT LITTLE ( BLEEP ) IS A PIECE OF ( BLEEP ). HOW IS IT GOING?
GREAT. I JUST GOT FIRED. BUT BRUCE WORKED IST SO I CAN STAY AND FINISH MY SCENES.
WHAT! THAT GIMPY THUNDER ( BLEEP ). HE'S MAKING YOU WORK AFTER YOU GOT ( BLEEP )! ( BLEEP )! HERE'S 100 BUCKS. THIS NEVER HAPPENED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE DON'T GET THAT. IT WAS A--
YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T PLAY SOMEONE THAT RAGING AND SAY "FUDGE."
Stephen: NO, NO, THERE'S A POETRY TO THAT.
IT'S DEEPLY UNSATISFYING TO HEAR THAT PERSON CALL SOMEONE A "DARN JERK."
Stephen: YES. ARE YOU OKAY WITH YOUR KIDS SEEING THAT?
WELL, ODDLY ENOUGH, I MADE THE 14-YEAR-OLD, BECAUSE, WHATEVER, SHE CUT HER TEETH ON "THE HUNGER GAMES." MY EIGHT-YEAR-OLD HASN'T SEEN IT. THOUGH, GOD KNOWS, I'VE EXPOSED THOAM FAR WORSE PROBABLY AT THE HOUSE.
Stephen: AT WHAT AGE WILL YOU ALLOW HER TO HEAR YOU SAYING THUNDER ( BLEEP )?
SHE'S ALREADY HEARD THAT. THAT'S WHAT I CALL HER FATHER WHEN HE GET IN FIGHTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, "LADY DYNAMITE" IS NOW STREAMING. GO SEE IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE GREAT ANA GASTEYER, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANA.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY COMEDIAN PAUL MECURIO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN, WHO HOSTS THE PODCAST "2 CHAIRS & A MICROPHONE." PAST GUESTS HAVE INCLUDED PAUL McCARTNEY, BRYAN CRANSTON, AND STEPHEN COLBERT. PLEASE WELCOME PAUL MECURIO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M GOING TO QUIT WHILE I'M AHEAD. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT WAS AMAZING. SO, I WAS A LAWYER ON WALL STREET AND QUIT TO BE A COMEDIAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NOT HOW MY MOTHER REACTED. ( LAUGHTER ) I WAS LIVING A SECRET DOUBLE LIFE. I WAS A LAWYER BY DAY, COMIC BY NIGHT. AND PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY TO ME, "DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO BE A COMEDIAN?" I SAID, NO." THEY SAID, "WERE YOU FUNNY?" I WAS LIKE, "YES, I WAS THE FUNNIEST LAWYER IN MY LAW FIRM, "WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE BEING THE SEXIEST I.T. GUY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I TELL YOU THESE REALLY FUNNY THINGS TO GET LAUGHS FROM THE OTHER LAWYERS, STUFF LIKE, "WE CAN'T DO THAT! THAT'S UNETHICAL." AND PEOPLE HERE-- I DID CORPORATE LAW, AND PEOPLE WHO DO CORP RATE LAW SAY THAT'S THE WORST, THE LOWER OF THE LOW, YOU'RE EVIL. YOU KILL KITTENS. I WAS LIKE, WE WOULD OUTSOURCE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN I ASK YOU GUYS SOMETHING?
YEAH!
HOW DO THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE VASELINE MAKE ANY MONEY? I HAVE HAD THE SAME TUBE OF VASELINE, RIGHT, RIGHT? THE GUY WITH THE GLASSES, AM I RIGHT? MY VASELINE WAS HANDED DOWN TO ME BY MY GRANDFATHER IN A WILL. YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THIS PHRASE UTTERED IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND-- "HONE, I'M GOING OUT TO GET MORE VASELINE." YOU COULD GO THROUGH 50,000 BAGS OF GARBAGE, YOU'RE NOT ANYTHING TO FIND ONE EMPTY CONTAINER OF VAS LINE. ONE TIME I ALMOST THREW MY VASELINE OUT. I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T RECOGNIZE THESE FINGERPRINTS. I THINK MY WIFE IS CHEATING ON ME. AW, SCREW IT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WAS AT COSCO, AND THERE WAS, LIKE, A 90-YEAR-OLD GUY WHO HAD A SHOPPING CART FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT, LIKE, 40 CANS OF PROGRESSO SOUP, NOTHING BUT 40 CANS-- EYE 90-YEAR-OLD GUY, 40 CANS OF SOUP. I'M LOOKING AT THAT AND I'M LIKE, AH, THAT'S OPTIMISTIC. YOU WANT TO LAUGH. THERETO OUT. I CAN FEEL IT. YOU GOTTA LET IT OUT. SO I WAS ON A SHOW RECENTLY, AND THEY ASKED US, "WHO MANIPULATEES MORE IN A RELATIONSHIP, MEN OR WOMEN?" AND I'M LIKE EVERYBODY MANIPULATES EQUALLY. WOMEN, I THINK MANIPULATE BETTER THAN MEN, BECAUSE WOMEN CAN USE SEX TO MANIPULATE AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE GREAT THINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY MEN BECAUSE WOMEN USED SEX TO MANIPULATE. LIKE THE CAVEMEN ONLY INVENTED FIRE BECAUSE A WOMAN WHINED, IT'S TOO COLD TO HAVE SEX. BOOM, FIRE RIGHT THERE. THEN THEY SAID WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT, COMMUNICATION OR SEX? BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WERE ON EVERYBODY SAID COMMUNICATION, P.C., COMMUNICATION. NO, WE KNOW. SEX! BECAUSE NOBODY FANTASIZES ABOUT COMMUNICATION. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S NO GUY OUT THERE GOING, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I WISH WE COULD HAVE A THREE-WAY DIALOGUE WITH TWO WOMEN ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO MY WIFE AND I ARE COMPLETELY OPPOSITES. SHE'S VERY ORGANIZED. I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE-- IMPATIENT. AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS ONE ARGUMENT FOR YEARS, AND I DO THIS ONE THING THAT DRIVES HER CRAZY, BUT HER REACTION TO ME DRIVESLY MIKE-- NNN. IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP YOU'VE HAD THIS ARGUMENT. I'M IN THE REFRIGERATOR WITH THE DOOR OPEN AND SHE'S IN THE THE LIGROOM AND I SAY, "CAROL, WHERE ARE THE PICKLES?" YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING. KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? NO, I DON'T. YES, YOU DO. THEY'RE IN THE REFRIGERATOR.
I KNOW THAT. NO I DON'T. THEY'RE ON THE SHELF. I KNOW, PICKLES ARE ON THE SHELF. THIS IS FUNNY TO YOU, LADY? I'LL COME OVER THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE ON THE SHELF. I KNOW. AND THIS IS THE LINE, THIS IS LINE WHERE SHE SAYS IT AND YOU THINK, AAAH, DIVORCE. I DON'T SEE THEM. "ARE YOU LOOKING?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN THIS NEXT LINE-- TRY FIGURING THIS NEXT LINE OUT. YEAH, I'M LOOKING. "ARE YOU LOOK-LOOKING OR JUST LOOKING." I'M LOOKING. YOU NEVER LOOK FOR THINGS. YOU'RE LIKE A CHILD. YOU NEVER LOOK. I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK FOR YOU. THEN SHE GETS COND ECONDESCENDING LIKE SHE'S A IN A CONTROL TOWER AND I'M A BAG OF ROCKS. DO YOU SEE THE BREAD. IF YOU LOOK, THE PICKLES ARE BEHIND THE BREAD. I DON'T SEE THEM. THEN COMES THE NEXT LINE "DID YOU MOVE THE BREAD?" YEAH? "DID YOU MOVE-MOVE THE BREAD OR MOVE THE BREAD?" ALREADY LAWYER, I MOVED THE BREAD. AND WHAT DO YOU SEE, NOTHING? EXACTLY, PAUL, BECAUSE YOU FORGOT TO BUY PICKLES ON THE WAY HOME LAST NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
