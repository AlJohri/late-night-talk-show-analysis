Stephen: I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT'S SHOW. BOTH RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE ARE HERE AND I'M GOING TO STOP BY AND SAY HI. DO ALL OF YOU NEED TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER)
YES, WE ALL NEED TO BE DOWN HERE. FOR WORK.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? SO YOU'RE NOT JUST STANDING HERE WAITING FOR RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE TO WALK OUT?
NO. ARE THEY ON THE SHOW TONIGHT? WE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE. AWKWARD.
Stephen: WELL, I'M GOING TO SAY HI.
WE WILL WATCH YOU.
Announcer: TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE! JESSIE MUELLER! AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY ANIMAL COLLECTIVE! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪  Captioning sponsored by CBS ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YA?! (DRUM SNAP)
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANKS, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, I'M WEARING YOUR MOTHER'S FAVORITE SUIT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOKS EVEN BETTER ON THE FLOOR. DON'T ASK. DON'T ASK. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT. AS USUAL, THERE'S ONE BIG ORANGE STORY TONIGHT, DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER) HE'S THE PRESUMPTIVE G.O.P. NOMINEE, BUT THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE HE STILL HAS TO WIN OVER. FOR INSTANCE, EVERYONE IN THE G.O.P. (LAUGHTER) BUT TODAY THE HEALING BEGAN. TRUMP WENT DOWN TO WASHINGTON TO MEET WITH SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN IN A HIGH-LEVEL SUMMIT, AFTER WHICH RYAN SEEMED VERY ENCOURAGED.
I THINK WE HAD A VERY ENCOURAGING MEETING. I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED WITH WHAT I HEARD. I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED. AGAIN, I'M VERY ENCOURAGED. THIS IS A FIRST, VERY ENCOURAGING MEETING. AGAIN, I'M VERY ENCOURAGED. I'M, I'M, I'M VERY ENCOURAGED.
STEPHEN: SOUNDS VERY ENCOURAGED. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) ONLY ONE WORD FOR IT, ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED, ENCOURAGED. YOU KNOW, YOU SAY A WORD OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING ANYMORE. HAND ME THE DICTIONARY NOW. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. ENCOURAGED. HERE WE GO. MEANINGLESS WORD MEANING SHEER PANIC. OKAY. SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE SAME MOTION WITH WHAT TRUMP IS GOING TO DO WITH RYAN -- HERE YOU GO! HERE'S THE THING -- RYAN HAD TO MEET WITH TRUMP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT IN CHAOS, THAT SOMEONE IS IN CONTROL, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. OKAY? THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT IS FOR THEM TO GET TOGETHER, US NOT TO SEE IT AND NOTHING HAPPENED. IT WAS PURE THEATER! THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ON CAPITOL HILL. THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THE MEETING ON BROADWAY, YOU KNOW, WITH MUSICAL NUMBERS! HEY, COOL BOY! (LAUGHTER) TRUMP IS GONNA ROCK IT TONIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WATCH OUT, PAUL RYAN! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EASY, MITCH McCONNELL! (LAUGHTER) RYAN DID NOT ENDORSE TRUMP OR POKE HIM WITH A STICK OR ANYTHING FUN. (LAUGHTER) INSTEAD, THEY JUST RELEASED A JOINT STATEMENT SAYING, THEY WERE "TOTALLY COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER." AND WHEN DONALD TRUMP COMMITS TO SOMETHING, HE TOTALLY MEANS IT. ASK ANY OF HIS WIVES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO BOTTOM LINE, THE LAST 24 HOURS OF ALL POLITICAL NEWS WAS COMPLETE B.S. OF COURSE, THE CREME DE LA CRAP WAS FROM MSNBC. HAD A COUNTDOWN CLOCK TO THE MEETING THIS MORNING WHERE NO CAMERAS WERE ALLOWED AND AFTER WHICH WE LEARNED NOTHING. JIM, CAN WE PUT UP MY COUNTDOWN CLOCK OF HOW MUCH LONGER WE ALL HAVE TO PRETEND THIS WAS NEWS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT WAS A LONG THREE SECONDS. REALLY. OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP, THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NOT HAPPENING. FOR INSTANCE, HE HASN'T PICKED A RUNNING MATE, BUT RUMORS SAY HE'S CONSIDERING NEWT GINGRICH (AUDIENCE REACTS) THEY'RE ALL CHANTING NEWT! YES. BETWEEN THEM, THEY'VE HAD SIX WIVES. APPARENTLY, TRUMP IS TRYING TO WIN THE WOMAN'S VOTE BY MARRYING THEM ALL. IF THEY GET ELECTED BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND LADY WILL BE THE THIRD LADY. (APPLAUSE) BUT THERE'S A SCANDAL LOOMING FOR TRUMP. SEE, SINCE THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN, TRUMP HAS BEEN PROMISING TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS, BUT HE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT HE MAY NOT DO THAT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. SO FAR, THE ONLY GLIMPSE OF HIS TAXES HE'S GIVEN US IS THIS PICTURE HE TWEETED OUT OF A HUGE STACK OF DOCUMENTS. IT'S A HUGE STACK. BUT TO BE FAIR, THAT STACK LOOKS A LOT LARGER NEXT TO HIS TINY, TINY HANDS. (APPLAUSE) PEOPLE LIKE MITT ROMNEY SAY HE'S HIDING SOMETHING. WE'VE GOTTEN OUR HANDS ON THE DOCUMENTS BY A PROCEDURE CALLED MAKING THEM UP. BRING OUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAXES, EVERYONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE REAL BECAUSE ONLY A REAL TAX RETURN CAN DO THIS -- (LAUGHTER) OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE. SIGNS HIS NAME TRUMP, COMMA, DONALD J. UNDER RACE, HE JUST CIRCLED THE ONES HE WANTS TO DEPORT. OKAY. LET'S SEE... SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, "A GOOD ONE. TRUST ME." (LAUGHTER) UNDER "EXEMPTIONS" HE'S LISTED "RESPONSIBILITY FOR THINGS I'VE SAID AND DONE," ARE (LAUGHTER) FOR INCOME HE JUST WROTE "YUUGE." (LAUGHTER) AND UNDER "ADJUSTED GROSS", HE WROTE: "ROSIE O'DONNELL." THAT'S NOT NICE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) LET'S SEE, AGAIN, HIS TAX RETURN, NOT MINE. (LAUGHTER) AND LET'S SEE, UNDER BIRTH DATE HE WROTE "SLUMBERING IN THE EARTH'S CORE FOR CENTURIES, WAITING FOR HUMANITY TO WAKE MY WRATH." SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW SAY HELLO TO MY DEPENDENTS, JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (HUMMING THEME SONG) FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW AND I HOPE YOU ARE, IT'S NO SECRET THAT I'M FASCINATED BY GWYNYTH PALTROW. NOT AS FASCINATED AS SHE IS, BUT STILL. PRETTY FASCINATED. I ESPECIALLY LOVE HER LIFESTYLE WEBSITE GOOP, YOUR NUMBER ONE SOURCE FOR $5,000 JUICERS. AND THIS WEEK WAS HUGE FOR GOOP HEADS LIKE ME BECAUSE GOOP JUST CAME OUT WITH ITS FIRST ANNUAL SEX ISSUE, FEATURING CURATED EROTIC MERCHANDISE FOR YOUR BEST LIFE, INCLUDING SEX TOYS. (LAUGHTER) FINALLY A PLACE TO FIND SEX TOYS ON THE INTERNET! (LAUGHTER) THE ISSUE WAS LOADED WITH SENSUAL MERCHANDISE GUARANTEED TO SHOCK YOUR PRUDISH AUNT. ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S ALSO YOUR ACCOUNTANT. FOR INSTANCE, GOOP RECOMMENDED THIS SEX WHIP THAT SELLS FOR $535. BECAUSE, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY $535 FOR A WHIP, YOU'RE CLEARLY INTO PUNISHING YOURSELF. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THAT'S A FINE JOKE, BUT IT DOES IMPLY I KNOW WHAT THE MARKET RATE FOR A WHIP IS. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW. THEY ALSO SELL THIS $15,000 GOLD PLATED -- LET'S SAY, "EXCLUSIVE MASSAGER." (LAUGHTER) YES, I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT IT IS BLURRED. YOU ARE NOT GOING BLIND FROM USING YOUR EXCLUSIVE MASSAGER. (APPLAUSE) I WISH -- I DON'T KNOW HOW -- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONVEY TO YOU HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW MUCH EFFORT WENT INTO FIGURING OUT WHETHER WE COULD SHOW THIS TO YOU NOT BLURRED, OR IF WE DID BLUR IT, HOW MUCH WE HAD TO BLUR IT, AND I ALSO -- WHAT I COULD CALL IT BEFORE WE SHOWED IT TO YOU. FOR INSTANCE, I COULD SAY PARTS TO HAVE THE WORD THAT IT IS. FOR INSTANCE, I COULD SAY THE WORD "DILL PICKLE." (LAUGHTER) AND I COULD SAY DOE, A DEER, A FEMALE DEER. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF I, UH, IF I TRIED TO ADD THAT PICKLE TO THE DEER -- CAN'T DO THAT. LET'S JUST SAY IT RHYMES WITH THE WORD BILBO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND IT'S THE WORD (BLEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOING TO BE TOTALLY (BLEEP)ED, RIGHT? TOTALLY BLEEPED. YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT I SAID. I HAVE TO SAY, A GOLD SEX TOY IS A GREAT GIFT. IT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO LET YOUR LOVER KNOW: "I AM A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH." ALTHOUGH IF $15,000 IS A LITTLE STEEP, FOR AROUND $8,000, THEY ALSO OFFER A SILVER EXCLUSIVE MASSAGER. AGAIN, IT'S BLURRED. SILVER, OF COURSE, FOR WHEN YOU FINISH SECOND. (LAUGHTER) THAT LOOKS LIKE NOTHING! THAT LOOKS LIKE NOTHING! THAT IS LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICKICLE MAP OF NEW ZEALAND! (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS THAT? THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK SILVER. ANYWAY, IT IS IN THERE. NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT SILVER TARNISHES, SO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO POLISH IT. A LOT. (LAUGHTER) AND REMEMBER IF YOU'RE AT A FORMAL ORGY, THE SILVER MASSAGER GOES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLATE. BUT WARNING: DO NOT USE IF YOU'RE A WEREWOLF. (LAUGHTER) THE LATEST GOOP ISSUE ALSO TAKES YOU INSIDE L.A.'S EROTIC THEATER "SNCTM." YES, SNCTM. YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY PUT THE VOWELS. SNCTM IS AN EYES WIDE SHUT-LIKE MONTHLY MASQUERADE IN AN L.A.-AREA MANSION THAT WARNS, "WHILE WOMEN CAN BUY A TICKET, MEN CANNOT ATTEND UNLESS THEY'RE MEMBERS, PART OF A COUPLE, OR RESERVE DINNER." THAT'S RIGHT. YOU MAY ONLY ENTER IF YOU'VE MADE RESERVATIONS, WHICH MEANS THIS SEX CLUB IS AS EXCLUSIVE AS A PONDEROSA. BUT GOOP ISN'T THE ONLY LIFESTYLE BRAND FEELING SEXY THIS SUMMER. I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT MY LIFESTYLE BRAND COVETTON HOUSE IS CELEBRATING OUR SEXUAL AWAKENING WITH COVETTON AFTER DARK. ♪ ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪ COVETTEN HOUSE... AFTER DARK ♪ OF COURSE, LUXURY PERSONAL MASSAGERS ARE ALL THE RAGE. COVETTON TAKES IT ONE STEP FURTHER WITH OUR GOLD-PLATED PERSONAL MASSEUR. (LAUGHTER) DIDN'T HAVE TO BLUR IT FOR SOME REASON. IT'S LIKE HAVING SEX WITH C3PO. (LAUGHTER) AND WHY NOT COMBINE DINNER AND DESSERT INTO ONE SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE MEATBALL GAG, FEATURING GRASS-FED BEEF AND ORGANIC MARINARA. ONE BITE AND YOU'LL BE SAYING... SOMETHING, I WON'T UNDERSTAND IT. AGAIN, DIDN'T HAVE TO BLUR IT FOR SOME REASON. FOR THE ECO-FRIENDLY SEX-THUSIASTS, COVETTON IS PROUD TO OFFER AN ARTISANAL RECLAIMED WOODEN SEX TOY MADE FROM THE SIDE OF A BARN. YOU'LL SCREAM-- FROM EITHER PLEASURE OR SPLINTERS. EITHER WAY, YOU'RE GETTING WOOD. SO GET COVETTON'S 2016 SEX LINE OR SUFFER THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING LAST-YEAR'S ORGASMS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH RUSSELL CROWE AND RYAN GOSLING. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY FIRST GUESTS ARE TWO OF THE MOST TALENTED ACTORS WORKING TODAY AND THE STARS OF THE NEW FILM "THE NICE GUYS." PLEASE WELCOME RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE. ( BAND PLAYING ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. (LAUGHTER) CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW BABY WITH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: THAT'S WONDERFUL. YOU GUYS ARE HANGING OUT A LOT TOGETHER.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU ARE. YOU'RE TOURING AROUND HERE, YOU'RE PROMOTING "THE NICE GUYS."
WE'RE TOURING THE WHOLE WORLD TOGETHER.
Stephen: REALLY? WOW. WOW. (LAUGHTER) WOW. ARE YOU REALLY BONDING DURING THIS TIME, RUSSELL?
YEAH. MM-HMM. WE'RE VERY CLOSE.
CLOSE.
Stephen: YEAH. (LAUGHTER) I LIKE THE MOVIE. I LIKE THE MOVIE A LOT. AS I SAID, YOU GUYS STRIKE ME AS YOU BOTH HAVE DONE A LOT OF ACTION, A LOT OF EXPLODING MOVIES, A LOT OF DEEP DRAMAS, A LOT OF CHALLENGING MOVIES, BUT THIS IS A COMEDY AND I DON'T NECESSARILY ASSOCIATE YOU GUYS DOING COMEDIES TOGETHER.
WELL, EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT BE TRUE --
WE WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY YOU WOULDN'T ASSOCIATE US DOING COMEDIES TOGETHER.
GREAT POINT.
Stephen: T T TUCHE. I'LL REMEMBER THAT WORD IN INTERVIEWS WHEN I GET THERE.
Stephen: THE FRENCH REALLY LOVE IT WHEN YOU TRY. JUST USE THE WORD TUCHE AND THEY WILL BE VERY HAPPY.
ANY QUESTION.
Stephen: YEAH. CONGRATULATIONS ON HAVING A BABY. TUCHE. (LAUGHTER)
AND YOU DON'T THINK OF COMEDY WHEN YOU THINK OF US. INTERESTING.
Stephen: THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.
IT HURTS TO HEAR YOU SAY IT. IT MIGHT BE TRUE, BUT IT HURTS.
CAN I CLARIFY SOMETHING?
Stephen: SURE. HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK OF THE TWO OF US TOGETHER? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SEE? AND THAT'S THE MAGIC. THAT'S THE MAGIC.
Stephen: TUCHE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP OF YOU TWO BEING FUNNY IN THE MOVIE TOGETHER. WANT THE SEE THAT? (LAUGHTER) HOW ABOUT THIS -- DO Y'ALL WANT TO SEE THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: JIM? I'M FALLING ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL HERE, MAN. I NEED YOU TO DRIVE. IVE GOING TO PULL OVER UP HERE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL OVER. THE CAR CAN DRIVE ITSELF.
WHAT? JUST TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL, MAN.
HMM... I DIDN'T KNOW IT COULD DO THAT.
WHERE YOU BEEN, MAN? EVERY CAR CAN DO THIS.
YEA, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, MAN? IDIOT. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
YOU FLY EVERYWHERE AND YOU DON'T EVEN DRIVE, AND YOU KNOW.
HE'S GOT A POINT THERE, BUMBLE.
YEAH, WHATEVER. WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! (TIRES SCREECHING, CRASHING SOUNDS) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S A VERY HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM YOU HAD THERE.
I JUST WANT TO SAY, OSCAR BUZZ... (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHY NOT? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN SMELL AN OSCAR.
Stephen: I CAN, TOO. MARK MY WORDS.
Stephen: MM-HMM, SOMETHING GOLD... (LAUGHTER) NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MOM WAS NOT A HUGE FAN OF ME.
YEAH, NOT A FAN.
Stephen: BUT SHE HAD A TURNING POINT AT A CERTAIN POINT.
SHE DID.
Stephen: I'M INTERESTED IN THIS.
SHE LOVES THE LORD OF THE RINGS.
Stephen: AS DO I. AS DO YOU. AND SHE WAS NOT A FAN, BUT THEN SAW YOUR -- YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF BATTLE YOU HAD WITH JAMES FRANCO, AND NOW SHE'S A HUGE FAN. MY MOM LOVES IT SO MUCH, OBVIOUSLY, SHE'S CONSTANTLY READING IT, BUT SHE ALSO, TO BACK THAT UP, HAS THE FILMS ON IN THE BACKGROUND SO SHE CAN BE CLOSE TO THE LANGUAGE OF IT.
Stephen: YEAH. AND I SAID, MOM, IS THERE A QUESTION I COULD ASK STEPHEN THAT MIGHT STUMP HIM, WHICH I KNOW HAS NEVER HAPPENED AND I'M NOT PREDICTING THAT IT WILL, BUT I THOUGHT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK.
Stephen: SURE, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. RUSSELL, IF YOU WILL INDULGE US. AGAIN, THIS IS TRUE. I HEARD THIS IS COMING. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.
SHE WROTE "B GOOD ON THE SHOW," AND IT'S A B.
Stephen: VERY NICE. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS BEING THE FIRST PART OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS, GANDOLPH IS TRYING TO FIND THE DOORS OF MAURIA AND A NOTCH APPEARS ON THE ROCK FACE. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
Stephen: YES, I REMEMBER THAT. IS THAT THE QUESTION? THE DOORS. WHAT ABOUT THEM?
ALL RIGHT, MY QUESTION, IS THE ARCHWAY APPEARS ON WHAT PAGE? (AUDIENCE REACTS) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE RUSSELL CROWE AND RYAN GOSLING! GET ME A COPY! (BAND PLAYING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WE'RE BACK WITH RYAN GOSLING AND RUSSELL CROWE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. DO YOU GUYS -- RUSSELL, DO YOU GUYS STILL DO YOUR OWN STUNTS?
I DO LESS NOW THAN I USED TO. A LOT OF THE ELDER ACTORS THAT I WORK WITH WOULD SAY, SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE STUFF YOURSELF? OF COURSE, YOU KNOW. AND THEY WERE KIND OF A LITTLE BIT NEGATIVE ABOUT IT. AND I THOUGHT, (BLEEP) THAT GUY, I'M GOING TO DO MY STUFF. AND AS YOU GET OLDER AND START LOSING TENDONS AND --
Stephen: JUST LOSING THEM COMPLETELY?
I'VE GOT NO CARTILAGE IN MY TOES BECAUSE OF SO MUCH LATERAL MOVEMENTS AND STOPS. ACHILLES TENDENTS, SHIN SPLINTS, BONE MARROW DISEASE AND BAD HIPS AND EVERY SINGLE INJURY BAR ONE ON MY FOOT IS FROM A MOVIE. AND YOU LOOK BACK AND THINK, THAT WAS WISDOM THEY WERE TRYING TO PASS ON TO ME.
Stephen: DOES RYAN PASS WISDOM ON TO YOU?
HE DOES GREAT PHYSICAL THINGS IN THIS FILM AND IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME IF THE DIRECTOR WAS CUTTING AROUND A STUNT MAN SO IT'S FANTASTIC HE'S DONE SO MUCH IN THE MOVIE (APPLAUSE)
MY STUNT GUY BRETT WAS FULLY IMPALED BY A BAYONET AND IN TRUE AUSTRALIAN FASHION CAME TO WORK ANYWAY, SO IT WAS HARD TO ASK HIM TO DO ANYTHING AFTER AT.
Stephen: ACTUALLY FULLY IMPALED?
YES. I'M SENSITIVE ABOUT MY ACROSS THE STREET RUN. I HOLD MY HANDS OUT A LITTLE TOO FORWARD. I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO, BUT I END UP -- (LAUGHTER) BUT I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE ASKING HIM TO DO THAT.
Stephen: I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY BUT THE TWO OF YOU DOING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS FUNNY, BUT IT IS ACTION AND IT IS TWO TOUGH GUYS, AS I SAID BEFORE. CAN YOU -- HOW DID IT BECOME THE TWO OF YOU DOING THIS TOGETHER?
WELL, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD MY AGENT TOLD ME RUSSELL WOULD NOT DO THE FILM WITHOUT ME. (LAUGHTER) I THOUGHT... REALLY? SO THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. (WHISTLING)
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE THE SAME FEELING?
WHAT?
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED? YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T DO THE FILM WITHOUT HIM?
YOU DID SAY THAT, RIGHT? WELL, THAT WAS MORE A GENERAL THING ABOUT PEOPLE CALLED "RYAN." BECAUSE KIND OF THERE IS A LOT OF RYANS.
THEY DON'T KNOW YOU'RE JOKING, OKAY?
Stephen:. REALLY -- JUST TELL THEM YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT ME, LET'S TALL A SPADE A -- CALL A SPADE A SPADE.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE SAME EXPERIENCE. IT WOULDN'T.
SO I GUESS I'M JUST UNNECESSARY, THEN. I GUESS YOU COULD DO THIS INTERVIEW WITHOUT ME, THEN, COULDN'T YOU?
THE INTERVIEW? YEAH. I PROBABLY COULD. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
BYE! WHAT? BYE. BYE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) BYE.

Stephen: DO YOU PLAY RUG BY YOURSELF? (BAND PLAYING)
Stephen: RYAN, DID YOU WANT TO COME BACK OVER HERE? WELCOME BACK ANYTIME.
JUST JAMMING WITH MY PAL, JON BATISTE.
Stephen: WE'RE TRYING TO FINISH THE INTERVIEW.
OH, SORRY. DO YOU NEED ME NOW FOR THE INTERVIEW?
Stephen: I ALWAYS NEEDED YOU FOR THE INTERVIEW.
DO YOU NEED RYAN GOSLING NOW FOR THE INTERVIEW? (CHEERING) HERE WE GO.
ANYWAY, MAY 20th.
Stephen: MAY 20th. MAY 20th, "THE NICE GUYS."
Stephen: THAT'S A WEEK FROM FRIDAY.
A WEEK FROM FRIDAY. CHEERIN(CHEERING)
BYE! BYE!

BYE.
Stephen: "THE NICE GUYS" IS IN THEATERS NEXT WEEK. RUSSELL CROWE AND RYAN GOSLING, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A BROADWAY STAR WHO WON THE TONY FOR HER PORTRAYAL OF CAROLE KING IN "BEAUTIFUL." SHE'S NOW NOMINATED FOR ANOTHER TONY FOR THE BROADWAY SHOW "WAITRESS." PLEASE WELCOME JESSIE MUELLER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (BAND PLAYING)
Stephen: MAE, JESSIE MUELLER. SO NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU'RE SO FANTASTIC AND BEAUTIFUL.
OH, THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS IN COMMON. WE BOTH LIVE AND WORK IN NEW YORK NOW. YOU'RE FROM EVANSTON, ILLINOIS, AND I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY. DO YOU MISS IT THERE?
I DO SOMETIMES. I MISS THE PEOPLE. I WAS IN THE THEATER COMMUNITY THERE FOR A WHILE AND IT'S AN AMAZING COMMUNITY SO I MISS EVERYBODY.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE ON BROADWAY IN "WAITRESS" BASED ON THE KERI RUSSELL FILM.
YES.
Stephen: YOU PLAYED THE WAITRESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FASCINATES ME ABOUT THIS IS YOUR CHARACTER IS -- MAKES BIBLICALLY GOOD PIES, THAT'S HOW SHE'S DESCRIBED. AND I UNDERSTAND THEY DO SOMETHING SPECIAL AT THE SHOW TO GET PEOPLE IN THE MOOD TO BE AT A DINER. WHAT DO THEY DO?
THEY BAKE A PIE IN THE LOBBY. ? LITERALLY BAKE A PIE IN THE LOBBY. THEY TALKED FOR A WHILE OF WE SHOULD HAVE THE SMELL OF A PIE IN THE THEATER. SO I THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE A CANDLE.
AIR WICK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
YEAH, OR SOMEONE WITH A SCRATCH AND SNIFF PLAY BILLS.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE NICE.
BUT THEY BAKE A PIE IN THE LOBBY. SOMEONE PUT AN OVEN BACK THERE.
Stephen: THEY BLOW THE SMELL OF PIE OUT TO THE AWED GLENS.
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BLOW IT. IT JUST COMES.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WHEN THEY -- (LAUGHTER) I'M SO SORRY. IT'S ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS.
IT IS.
Stephen: PUMPING UP THE SMELL OF FRESH BAKED GOODS IS WHAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY TRY TO SELL THEIR HOUSE. ARE THEY TRYING TO MOVE THE THEATER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
POSSIBLY.
Stephen: THE THEATER SENT A PIE, ONE OF THE PIES THEY MADE FOR THE SHOW. WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE PIE?
I'LL HAVE PIE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T ACTUALLY EVER GET TO EAT PIE IN THE SHOW. OTHER PEOPLE DO. I MAKE A LOT OF PIES BUT NEVER GET TO EAT IT.
Stephen: WELL, GOOD LUCK TALKING WHEN YOU'RE EATING PECAN PIE. THE SHOW, AS IT GETS INTO DEEP HUMAN STUFF, YOU KNOW, THE ABDOM NATIONAL HUMAN SPIRIT, DO YOU LIKE HUMAN BEINGS IF.
I'M A FAN. I'M A FAN. I BELIEVE ALL HUMANS ARE GOOD AT THE CORE. SOMETIMES THINGS OCCUR, AND IT GETS A LITTLE MESSY. LIFE. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, MOST OF US HAVE A GOOD CRUST UNDERNEATH, AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE -- CHEERS.
Stephen: CHEERS. CLINK.
CLINK. THAT'S A GOOD PIECE OF PIE!
Stephen: THAT IS FANTASTIC. THAT'S VERY GOOEY.
Stephen: MM-MM-MM... I CAN NO LONGER REMEMBER ANYTHING WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT.
WE'LL JUST TALK ABOUT THE PIE.
Stephen: MMM... HOW LONG DID YOU PLAY CAROLE KING ON BROADWAY?
I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S IT? ALMOST TWO YEARS FROM THE OUT OF TOWN RUN THAT WE DID, YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PORTRAYAL.
OH, THANK YOU.
Stephen: DO YOU CONSTANTLY HAVE THE MUSIC IN YOUR HEAD STILL OR DID YOU GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD?
I WAS JUST DONE LISTENING TO HER THE OTHER DAY. IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE I NEVER GOT SICK OF HER. I NEVER GOT SICK OF THE MUSIC. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: INCREDIBLE. SHE HAD 101 HIT RECORDS.
SERIOUSLY?
Stephen: YEAH, SHE'S A 101-HIT WONDER. (LAUGHTER) I KNEW THE MUSIC IN THE NEW MUSICAL "WAITRESS" IS FANTASTIC, BUT WOULD YOU INDULGE ME WITH ONE CAROLE KING? JUST RIGHT HERE. (CHEERING) BECAUSE CAROLE KING IS INCREDIBLE. IT'S SO PERFECT.
