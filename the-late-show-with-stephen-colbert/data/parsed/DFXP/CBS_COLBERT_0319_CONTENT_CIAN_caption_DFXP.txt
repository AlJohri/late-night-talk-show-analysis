IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES EMMA ROBERTS. KEN JEONG. AND MUSICAL GUESTS LUKE BRYAN AND DIERKS BENTLEY FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME. , WELCOME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. GOOD FOR YOU. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY KIND. WELCOME. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. HEY I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING: ANYONE HERE USE THE INTERNET ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOCK IT OFF BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS NOW VOTED TO ALLOW INTERNET PROVIDERS SELL YOUR WEB-BROWSING HISTORY.
Audience: BOO!
Stephen: I RCHED THAT REACTION. NOW MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO CLEAR YOUR BROWSER HISTORY. JUST HIT THAT BUTTON, OR PULL THE LEVER? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER USED IT. I'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE. I BURNED MY COMPUTER THIS MORNING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH WASHINGTON D.C. HERE'S THE DEAL. I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S NOT A VOTER OF ANY POLITICAL STRIPE ANYWHERE IN AMERICA WHO ASKED FOR THIS. NO ONE. NO ONE IN AMERICA STOOD UP IN A TOWN HALL AND SAID, "SIR, I DEMAND THAT YOU LET SOMEONE ELSE MAKE MONEY OFF MY SHAMEFUL DESIRES." I CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEBODY ASKED THIS TO HAPPEN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE PUBLICLY TAKING THE SIDE OF BIG INTERNET CABLE COMPANIES. TAKING THE SIDE OF A CABLE COMPANY? THE ONLY THING LESS POPULAR WOULD BE IF THEY PASSED A BILL ALLOWING TRAFFIC JAMS TO CALL YOU DURING DINNER TO GIVE YOU GONORRHEA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "HONEY, IT'S FOR YOU." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, NO ONE COULD THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA EXCEPT REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE AND REALTOR WHO ISN'T TELLING YOU THAT THIS CONDO WAS BUILT ON AN ANCIENT INDIAN BURIAL GROUND, MARSHA BLACKBURN.
CONSUMER PRIVACY IS SOMETHING WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT, AND CONSUMER PRIVACY WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED AND WILL ACTUALLY BE ENHANCED BY REMOVING THE UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION THESE RULES WILL CREATE.
Stephen: I KNOW WHAT'S IN HER SEARCH HISTORY, ""HOW TO SPOUT (BLEEP)." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF EVEN WORSE, THIS NEW LAW SAYS INTERNET PROVIDERS NO LONGER HAVE TO PROTECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION AGAINST HACKERS AND THIEVES. OKAY, THAT'S LIKE A HOTEL SAYING, "YOU CAN STAY HERE, BUT HEADS UP-- WE DON'T LOCK THE DOORS. ALSO, WE SELL VIDEOS OF YOU MASTURBATING. WANT TO BUY ONE? WE'LL CALL IT 'ENTERTAINMENT PARTNERS' ON YOUR BILL." FRANKLY, I FEEL SORRY FOR WHO ACTUALLY GETS TO LOOK AT AMERICA'S SEARCH HISTORY. SOMEONE AT A CABLE COMPANY-- SOMEBODY AT COMCAST RIGHT NOW THERE'S A COMCAST EMPLOYEE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO LOOK AT AMERICA'S SEARCH HISTORY. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME FOOTANG OF THAT NOW. BUT AT LEAST-- HE'S FINE! YEAH. REALLY EXFOLIATING. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AT LEAST CONGRESS DID SOMETHING. THAT'S REFRESHING. IT'S BEEN LESS THAN A WEEK SINCE THE REPUBLICANS' FLAMING FAILURE ON HEALTH CARE. THEY JUST COULDN'T GET PARTY UNITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MODERATES-- YEAH. MODERATES WANTED TO KEEP POPULAR STUFF LIKE MATERNITY COVERAGE, WHILE THE FAR RIGHT WANTED TO GIVE WOMEN IN LABOR A BITE STICK AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT NOW-- WE THOUGHT IT WAS OVER. BUT NOW CNN IS REPORTING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING ON A PLAN "B." WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS, BUT I'M BETTING IT WON'T COVER "PLAN B." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. THEY SAY IT'S GOING TO BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THIS TIME. TOTALLY-- TOTALLY DIFFERENT THIS TIME. BECAUSE-- THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND OUT-- WHEN THEY WERE PLANNING THE FIRST BILL, THEIR "ONE-HOUR WEEKLY MEETINGS WEREN'T ENOUGH TIME TO WORK THROUGH THE STICKING POINTS." ONE HOUR A WEEK! DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT, BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU HAVEN'T READ PAUL RYAN'S BOOK, ""60-MINUTE ABS AND TOTAL OVERHAUL OF HEALTH CARE." JACKED. HE'S HUGE.
Jon: I SEE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE JUST AS HARD AS THE FIRST TIME. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS VERY CONFIDENT.
I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO MAKE A DEAL ON HEALTH CARE. THAT'S SUCH AN EASY ONE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHEN HE SAYS STUFF LIKE THAT, IT WORRIES ME. ( LAUGHTER ) FIVE DAYS AGO, JUST FIVE DAYS AGO, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY EXPLODED IN A MIDST OF BLOOD AND BONE FRAGMENTS. DOES TRUMP NOT REMEMBER WHEN HE JUST SAID THIS:
NOBODY KNEW THAT HEALTH CARE COULD BE SO COMPLICATED. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: AND NOW...
THAT'S SUCH AN EASY ONE.
Stephen: HE HAS THE MEMORY OF A GOLDFISH. ( LAUGHTER ) MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE'S THE EXACT SAME COLOR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP, WE'VE BEEN TAKING-- WE'VE BEEN TALK AGO WE'VE BEEN TAKING AND TALKING. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ALL WEEK ABOUT HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND MAN WHO'S REALLY HAPPY YOU MET SOMEBODY NEW, DEVIN NUNES. HE'S LEADING THE ALLEGED INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED TIES BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA, ALLEGEDLY. BUT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE DEMANDING THAT HE STEP DOWN BECAUSE... ♪ HE SUCKS ♪ THE SPECIFIC SUCKING INVOLVES NUNES' UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIM THAT HE'S SEEN DOCUMENTS FROM A SECRET SOURCE THAT HE MET AT THE WHITE HOUSE PROVING THAT TRUMP AIDES WERE INCIDENTALLY CAUGHT UP IN GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE OF FOREIGN AGENTS. BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT RUSSIA, AND HE WON'T TELL ANYONE THE SPECIFICS. AND NOW NUNES VOWS HE WILL NEVER REVEAL HIS SOURCE, NOT EVEN TO INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. HE WANTS TO PUBLICLY ASSURE HIS SOURCE THAT HE'S NEVER GOING TO GIVE HIM UP. HE ACTUALLY MADE A PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT IT TODAY. ♪ NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: I AGREE WITH THE DEMOCRATS. HE REALLY SHOULD RICK-CUSE HIMSELF. THAT'S FUN. THAT DANCE IS FUN.
Jon: YOU GOT A GOOD FEEL FOR IT.
Stephen: REALLY WORKS THIS PART. NOW, IT'S NO SECRET WE'VE GOT OURSELVES AN UNCONVENTIONAL PRESIDENT. TODAY WE LEARNED THAT TRUMP IS VIOLATING ANOTHER NORM BECAUSE HE "WON'T THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH AT THE WASHINGTON NATIONALS OPENING DAY." I DON'T KNOW WHY. MAYBE HE'S WORRIED HIS HANDS ARE TOO SMALL TO PALM A BASEBALL ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: HE'LL HAVE TO-- HE'LL HAVE TO CHEST PAZ IT. HE'LL HAVE TO JUST-- LIKE THAT.
Jon: THE THUMB S.
Stephen:  IT'S ALL THUMBS. NOW THIS IS TRUE. SINCE TAFT, EVERY PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN JIMMY CARTER, HAS THROWN OUT THE FIRST PITCH OF THE SEASON OPENER. FOR GOD'S SAKE. THAT MEANS F.D.R. DID IT! ( LAUGHTER ) LET THAT SINK IN! NOT ONLY DID F.D.R. BEAT HITLER IN WORLD WAR II. HE ALSO STRUCK HIM OUT. I'M NOT SURPRISED. THREE UP, THREE DOWN, MAN. I'M NOT SURPRISED. PEOPLE-- I'M NOT SURPRISED. PEOPLE APPLAUDING HITLER STRIKE OUT. IT'S A GOOD FEELING. AND I'M SURPRISED THAT TRUMP WON'T THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH BECAUSE HE'S CLEARLY A HUGE BASEBALL FAN. ♪ TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME ♪ ♪ TAKE ME OUT TO THE CROWD ♪
Stephen: ARE WE SURE THAT'S NOT THE TAPE PUTIN IS BLACKMAILING HIM WITH? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE-- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE SOMEBODY PEE ON ME THAN HEAR THAT AGAIN. SO, HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO, AMERICA! TRUMP WON'T THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH. WHAT ELSE? HE WON'T GO TO THE CORREPSONDENTS' DINNER. HE WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. HE WON'T PUT HIS BUSINESS IN A BLIND TRUST. HE DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE IN D.C. WHAT PRESIDENTIAL TRADITION WILL TRUMP ABANDON NEXT? THIS THANKSGIVING, THOSE TURKEYS BETTER RUN. "I HEREBY PARDON THESE-- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M HUNGRY. GET ME SOME HEDGE CLIPPERS. COME HERE! COME HERE! COME HERE!" NOW, THEY'RE CALLING IT A SCHEDULING CONFLICT. THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT GOING TO THROW THE PITCH OUT. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. THAT IS SOMEWHAT BELIEVABLE. THE PRESIDENT DOES A LOT OF STUFF. FOR INSTANCE, EARLIER TODAY, HE SPOKE AT A WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT FORUM. IT WAS THE FIRST WOMEN'S EVENT HE'S ATTENDED SINCE SNEAKING INTO THE DRESSING ROOM AT THE MISS USA PAGEANT. "WHO WANTS TO BE EMPOWERED FIRST?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THE FIRST LADY WAS ALSO THERE-- LOVELY LADY. THE FIRST LADY WAS ALSO THERE, PRESENTING AWARDS TO BRAVE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN WHO'VE OVERCOME YEARS OF REPRESSION AND SILENT SUFFERING. HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLY RELATE TO THEM ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER, OF COURSE, WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SPEAKING TO WOMEN ABOUT EMPOWERMENT. LET'S LISTEN TO TRUMP'S REMARKS.
YOU KNOW, I'M AUTOMATICALLY ATTRACTED TO BEAUTIFUL-- I JUST START KISSING THEM. IT'S LIKE A MAGNET, JUST KISS. I DON'T EVEN WAIT. AND WHEN YOU'RE A STAR, THEY LET YOU DO IT, GRAB 'EM BY THE PUSSY. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
Stephen: THAT'S THE WRONG. AUDIO, JIMMY! COME ON! WOW! WOW! WOW, WHAT AN UNFORSEEN TECHNICAL BLUNDER THAT OUR EDITING DEPARTMENT SPENT AN HOUR MAKING THIS AFTERNOON. I AM SO, SO, SORRY. I'M SORRY. HERE IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE ACTUAL FOOTAGE, THE PRESIDENT PRAISING WOMEN'S UNIQUE CAPABILITIES.
TO BE HONEST, WHETHER YOU'RE A WOMAN OR WHETHER YOU'RE A MAN, YOU HAVE THAT SAME DREAM. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DREAM. YOU JUST HAVE A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US. YOU KNOW WHY? RIGHT THERE. HEH-HEH.

WHY, THANK YOU.
Stephen: THERE'S EMBROIDERY ON THERE THERE. WHAT IS THAT?
PLANETS AND MOON S.
Stephen:  I'M NOT SURPRISED. BECAUSE YOU'RE SOMETHING OF A STYLE ICON.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT. THERE ARE BLOGS AND INTEREST PAGES DEDICATED TO WHAT YOU'RE WEARING ON ANY GIVEN DAY.
I HAVE SEEN THOSE. I'M VERY FLATTERED. I HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH FASHION FOR MY WHOLE LIFE, SO IT'S SURREAL TO SEE MYSELF IN THOSE.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK OF MY LOOK? WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? THAT'S A BIGGER LAUGH THAN I EXPECTED TO GET. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LOOK?
I THINK IT'S AMAZING. I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EYEWEAR CONTRACT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU GLASSES SO WELL. YOU HAVE A FACE FOR GLASS GLIZ WEAR THEM FOR A PURPOSE.
YOU ME THOSE TO SEE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE WEARING THOSE FOR FASHION.
Stephen: NO, SO I CAN READ THE WORDS OVER THERE.
IF I HAD MY OWN SHOW LIKE YOU, I WOULD WEAR A DIFFERENT PAIR OF GLASSES EVERY DAY. I WOULD.
Stephen: GIVE IT A SHOT. GIVE IT A SHOT.
OH, WOW. YOU REALLY DO NEED THESE. DO MY EYES LOOK BIGGER?
Stephen: OH, WOW. IF I HAD GLASSON, I COULD TELL WHETHER THAT-- I COULD TELL WHETHER THAT LOOKED GOOD ON YOU. BUT I IMAGINE IT LOOKED FANTASTIC.
YES.
Stephen: ANYWAY, YOU DON'T NEED GLASS?
I FEEL LIKE I'M STARTING TO WHILE I'M READING LATELY. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I JUST WANT THEM AND I'M HAVING PSYCHOSOMATIC SYMPTOMS BECAUSE I WANT A COOL PAIR OF GLASSES. I'M NOT SURE.
Stephen: WE FIRST KNEW YOU FROM NICK, YOU KNOW, BUT AFTER NICKELODEON, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF HORROR. YOU'VE DONE "AMERICAN HORROR STORY" "OF "SCREAM QUEENS," AND NOW YOU'RE DOING ""THE BLACKCOAPT'S DAUGHTER." ARE YOU TRYING TO SCRAPE THE NICKELODEON OFF OF YOU?
IT'S ACCIDENTAL. EVERYONE THAT KNOWS HE SAYS YOU DO SO MUCH SCARY STUFF AND YOU'RE TERRIFIED OF EVERYTHING. AND IT'S LIKE I WOKE UP ONE DAY AND HAD BEEN ON IN A MOVIE CALLED "SCREAM" AND IN A SHOW CALLED "SCREAM QUEENS, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: DO YOU GO TO SCARY MOVIES YOURSELF?
I DO. BUT IT'S A PRODUCTION IF GITO A SCARY MOVIE.
Stephen: DO YOU MEAN?
MY GIRLFRIENDS KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO MY HOUSE BEFOREHAND, SLEEP OVER. IT'S A TWO-DAY AFFAIR IF I'M GOING TO SEE A HORROR MOVIE. WE HAVE TO HAVE A NICE BREAKFAST THE NEXT DAY THAT'S LIGHT AND FUN. YOU KNOW-- YEAH.
Stephen: WATCH THE VIDEO OF THE GIRL HUGGING THE WATER HEELTER.
I WAS GETTING TEARY EYED WITH THAT. THAT'S A GOOD ONE TO HAVE IN MY BACK POCKET AFTER SEEING A SCARY MOVIE.
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY, I'M GOING TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE YOU'RE A FRIEND OF MINE. I DON'T LIKE SCARY MOVIES. I WENT TO SEE "WORLD WAR "Z"" WITH MY DAUGHTER AND I PULLED MY NECK. I LITERALLY PULLED MY NECK GOING LIKE THAT.
I TOOK-- MY SISTER IS 16, MY LITTLE SISTER, GRATE GRAIS. AND SHE CAME WITH ME TO THE PREMIERE, AND SHE HAD TO LEAVE. SHE WAS LIKE, "I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M OUT." AND SHE LEFT.
Stephen: WOW!
AND I WAS LIKE, "GRACE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" AND SHE SAID, "I'M REALLY SORRY." THIS MOVIE IS SCARY.
Stephen: IT'S SUPER SCARY. I'VE SEEN CLIPS OF IT, AND THAT HAS SCARED ME, AND THAT WORRIES ME IF THE CLIPS SCARE ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
YES. WELL, WHEN I READ THE SCRIPT I WAS TERRIFIED, AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SCRIPTS THAT I READ AND I WALKED AWAY FROM. AND THEN IT SLOWLY SEEPED BACK INTO MY BRAIN AND KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT, AND I WAS LIKE, DOES THIS MEAN I SHOULD DO THE MOVIE OR I SHOULDN'T? I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T SLEEP. I CAN'T THINK. BUT I DID IT.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN SET UP WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IT'S--
I CAN'T.
Stephen: YOU CAN'T?
I CAN'T. NO, I'M KIDDING. I CAN'T SAY TOO MUCH.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT BASICALLY MY CHARACTER, JOAN, KIND OF GOES ON A BIT-- A BIT OF A ROAD TRIP WITH THIS COUPLE, AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHY OR WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS. SO THIS IS KIND OF THE ONE OF THE FIRST INTERACTIONS BETWEEN JOAN AND THE HUSBAND CHARACTER. SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT ODD.
Stephen: JIM.
ARE YOU GOING TO PAWRM, TOO?
NO, NOT EXACTLY. LINDA AND I ARE HEADED TO THE TOWN JUST BEFORE IT. WE'RE GOING TO BRANFORD. DO YOU KNOW BRANFORD?
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?
WHAT'S THAT? WHEN DO WE LEAVE?
Stephen: I WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU.
I JUST SCARED MYSELF.
Stephen: ARE THEY-- ARE-- ARE SCARY MOVIES SCARY TO MAKE?
NO.
Stephen: GOOD.
NOT AT ALL. ACTUALLY, ONE TIME I LITERALLY WAS DOING "AMERICAN HORROR STORY" AND I HAD BLOOD ALL OVER ME FOR THIS SCENE BUT I FORGOT BECAUSE THAT BECAME THE NORMAL. I FACE TIMED WITH MY SISTER, AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, WHAT'S UP?" AND SHE WAS LIKE, "AARRGGHH." I AND REALIZED I HAD BLOOD ALL OVER ME. AND SHE SAID YOU CAN'T FACE TIME SOMEONE LIKE THAT AND NOT GIVE A WARNING.
Stephen: WHEN I WANT TO CALM MYSELF DOWN I REMEMBER THEY HAD TO TAKE A BREAK FOR THE UNION GUYS TO GO TO LUNCH. ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, YOU ALSO GOT-- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS YOUR-- YOU'RE A BIG READER. WHICH IS GOOD. I LOVE BOOKS. THEY'RE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LEARN THINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU STARTED A BOOK CLUB?
I DID.
Stephen: AND THIS IS-- THIS IS YOUR ADVERTISEMENT FOR YOUR BOOK CLUB. I GOTTA SAY, NOT A LOT OF READING GOING ON IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH. ( LAUGHTER ) SO HOW DOES ONE--
IT WAS A READING BREAK.
Stephen: A READING BREAK. WHO IS IN YOUR BOOK CLUB AND HOW I CAN JOIN.
IT'S CALLED BELATRUS, AND WE HAVE A WEBSITE AND INSTAGRAM. AND OUR FIRST BOOK IS "SOUTH AND WEST" BY JOAN DIDION. BASICALLY MY BEST FRIEND KAREN AND I STARTED IT BECAUSE WE LOVE TO READ AND WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT MILLENNIALS DON'T READ AND I FOUND THAT TO BE TRUE FROM THE BOOK POSTING ON MY INSTAGRAM AND PEOPLE WERE ASKING ABOUT LISTS AND WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, AND WE START TO START A SITE.
Stephen: IT'S ONLINE. HOW DO I DISCUSS IT WITH YOU? INSTAGRAM LIVE.
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE DOING IT ON THE WEBSITE. BASICALLY, YOU CAN SEND IN QUESTIONS AND PARTICIPATE WITH US THAT WAY.

Stephen: WHERE IS YOUR ACCENT?
I THINK THEY WERE LOST WITH MY IMMIGRANT KOREAN PARENTS IN NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCENT AND DIDN'T SAY Y'ALL, I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY.
Stephen: MY PARENTS ARE FROM LARCHMONT, AND I SAY Y'ALL. DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY KIND OF ACCENT, EVEN WHEN YOU GET ANGRY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF I HAD THE THICKEST KOREAN ACCENT AND THEN GOT REALLY MAD. NEVER HAPPENED.

YUP, WENT TO DUKE.
Stephen: ATTENDED DUKE, THEN U.N.C. FOR MED SCHOOL.
YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MEDICAL DOCTOR.
YES.
Stephen: THEY KNOW ABOUT YOU NOW, BUT QUITE AN INTERESTING CAREER. WAS THAT TOUGH GOING FROM DUKE TO U.N.C. THAT'S LIKE CRIPS AND BLOODS SITUATION.
YES, IT WAS. TO BE HONEST, YOU GOTTA STAY LOYAL TO YOUR UNDERGRAD COLORS AND I WAS REALLY OBNOXIOUS AS A DUKE GRAD. I WOULD ACTUALLY DRIVE UP TO THE CAROLINA CAMPUS-- I HAD A DARK BLUE MUSTANG WITH DUKE BUMPER STICKERS. I HAD DARK BLUE SWEAT PANTS WITH DUKE ON MY ASS.

Stephen: ONE THING I WOULD LIKE YOU TO EXPLAIN TO ME IS THAT PERFORMING AT THE, AGAIN, THE "ACADEMY OF COUNTRY MUSIC AWADZ" ARE THE BACKSTREET BOYS.
THEY'RE NOT THE BACKSTREET BOYS ANYMORE. THEY'RE GOING COUNTRY. THEY'RE CALLED THE BACKROAD BOYS. WE'RE TAKING THEM INTO THE COUNTRY FOLD.
Stephen: WHAT IS-- WHY ARE THEY THERE?
THE BACKSTREET BOYS PUP KNOW, LUKE IS A DIEDZ HARD FAN. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT--
WELL...
I'M JUST MESSING. FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE IS DOING SOMETHING WITH THEM. AND WE'RE BRINGING EVERYONE INTO THE FOLD. JON AND THE BOYS, IF THEY WANT TO COME PLAY.
Stephen: WELL, YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING WITH JON AND THE BAND TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK, BUT BEFORE WE GO, WHAT IS IT YOU'RE PERFORMING.
WE'RE DOING A HAGGARD SONG. WE LOVE MERLE HAGGARD.
Stephen: WHY MERLE?
WE LOST HIM LAST YEAR. HE IS SUCH-- IN COUNTRY MUSIC, SPEAK OF THE BACKSTREET BOYS, HAGGARD WAS SUCH A DIVERSE-- HIS SOUND WAS SO DIVERSE. A LOT OF SAXOPHONES IN HIS MUSIC AND HORNED INSTRUMENTS SO WE'RE GOING TO COMBINE OUR THING WITH Y'ALL, WITH THESE GUYS, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.
