THIS SUNDAY ON "60 MINUTES," CHARLIE ROSE'S EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH STEVE BANNON.
SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE PERCEIVED, YOU TODAY? AND DESTROY HIS ENEMIES? ( LAUGHING )
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN'S TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP JR. TESTIFYING TO CONGRESS. AND STEPHEN WELCOMES JESSICA BIEL. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HOW YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON MAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ED FROM CROWD. THERE'S MOW MISTAKING A FRIDAY CROWD, MAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. YOU COULD TAKE A CORE SAMPLE OF THIS CROWD, PULL IT OUT, AND COUNT THE RINGS OF FRIDAY. THAT'S HOW PURE THE FRIDAY CROWD IS TONIGHT. NOW, I HOPE EVERYONE IS STAYING SAFE FROM OR EVACUATED AWAY FROM HURRICANE IRMA. THIS THING IS SERIOUS. LOOK AT THE WEATHER CHANNEL APP'S ACTUAL FORECAST FOR MIAMI BEACH THIS WEEKEND: 100% CHANCE OF RAIN, WINDS 127 MILES AN HOUR. STILL, LESS CHAOTIC THAN SPRING BREAK AT DAYTONA BEACH. ( LAUGHTER ) WE WANT TO SEND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO EVERYONE AFFECTED. ALSO, THOUGHTS AND MONEY. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GIVE, TUNE IN ON TUESDAY TO "HAND IN HAND," A TELETHON TO BENEFIT EVERYONE AFFECTED BY BOTH HURRICANES IRMA AND HARVEY. I WILL BE THERE, MANNING THE PHONES. GIVE ME A CALL. WHO KNOWS? YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME, LIKE MY PIN NUMBER, WHICH WOULD ALSO ALLOW YOU TO GIVE MORE MONEY. LOUVRE LAUGH GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. WHOONL, WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON. OH, YES, YESTERDAY! ELDEST SON AND MAN WHOSE HEAD MAKES ITS OWN GRAVY, DONALD TRUMP JR., HAD A REALLY BIG DAY. O EON CAPITOL HILL. HE MET WITH SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE INVESTIGATORS. SEE, HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING MET WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER IN HOPES OF GETTING DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON. BUT HE EXPLAINED IT WAS ALL A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING. IN FACT, HE ACTUALLY MET WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER IN HOPES OF GETTING DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON. ( LAUGHTER ) SEE, NOTHING TO SEE HERE, FOLKS BECAUSE HIS TESTIMONY WAS NOT ON CAMERA. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN DON JR. IS HIDING, RIGHT?
HE CAME IN. HE AVOIDED THE CAMERAS ON THE WAY IN. THEY CLEARLY DO NOT WANT PICTURES OF HIM DOING THIS. HE CAME IN THROUGH A HIDDEN LOADING DOCK DEEP IN THE BOWELS OF THE CAPITOL.
Stephen: YES, "THE BOWELS OF THE CAPITOL," WHERE ALL OF AMERICA'S MOST COURAGEOUS LEADERS ARE POOPED OUT. NOW, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" OBTAINED A COPY OF DON JR.'S STATEMENTS WHERE HE REPORTEDLY MAINTAINS THAT NOTHING CAME OF THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING, THEREFORE, HE NEVER COLLUDED WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. RIGHT. THAT MAKES IT PERFECTLY LEGAL. LIKE, IF YOU ROB A BANK, AND THE VAULT TURNS OUT TO BE EMPTY-- NO HARM, NO FOUL! CAN I HAVE A FREE CALENDAR? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT MAYBE THE SCARIEST RUSSIA STORY OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS THE REVELATION THAT RUSSIA-LINKED HACKERS BREACHED 100 NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANTS JUST THIS YEAR, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE PALO VERDE NUCLEAR POWER STATION'S EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH WAS DON. ( LAUGHTER ) SO FAR, THE HACKERS' INTRUSIONS HAVE BEEN GATHERING INTELLIGENCE: TECHNICAL DIAGRAMS, REPORTS, PASSWORDS, AND CRYPTO KEYS. "CRYPTO KEYS," BY THE WAY, WAS ALSO THE TITLE OF MY ALL-SYNTHESIZER CONCEPT ALBUM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE,-- IT WAS THE 80s.
Jon: I LIKE THAT ALBUM!
Stephen: OF COURSE, EVERY HACKER GROUP NEEDS A COOL NAME, AND THIS BEING RUSSIA, THEY WENT WITH "ENERGETIC BEAR." "ENERGETIC BEAR--" YOU MIGHT REMEMBER HIM AS THE MOST SEXUALLY ACTIVE CAREBEAR. WE MIGHT HAVE MADE THAT UP, FOR LEGAL REASONS. NOW, SO FAR, ALL THESE HACKERS HAVE DONE IS POKE AROUND. BUT SOME EXPERTS FEAR THAT IT'S THE FIRST STEP OF A PLAN TO CAUSE ELECTRICAL BLACKOUTS. BUT WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, I WON'T BE ABLE TO WATCH THE NEWS AND-- PLEASE, GOD, HACK OUR POWER PLANTS! ( LAUGHTER ) I HAVEN'T SLEPT SINCE JANUARY 20th. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP HAS JUST NAMED A NEW HEAD OF NASA, OKLAHOMA CONGRESSMAN JIM BRIDENSTEIN. BRIDENSTINE, OF COURSE, WAS SHORTENED AT ELLIS ISLAND FROM "BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT-- BUT-- HAD A NATURAL THERE FOR A WHILE. LOOKED VERY NICE. HERE'S THE DEAL: BRIDENSTINE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT HUMANS ARE CAUSING CLIMATE CHANGE. INTERESTING. THE GUY WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE ONE WITH EASY ACCESS TO SPACESHIPS. "EVERYTHING'S FINE. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU KEEP FIGHTING THOSE STORMS. I'LL BE IN THIS ESCAPE ROCKET." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, CRITICS POINT OUT THAT BRIDENSTINE IS NOT A SCIENTIST OR AND ENGINEER, THOUGH HE WAS INVOLVED WITH A ROCKET-POWERED AIRCRAFT LEAGUE. THINK NASCAR, BUT WITH ROCKET PLANES. THAT SENTENCE, "THINK NASCAR, BUT WITH ROCKET PLANES," IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN NORTH CAROLINA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHILE BRIDENSTINE WOULD BE THE FIRST HEAD OF NASA WITHOUT A SCIENCE OR ENGINEERING BACKGROUND, DO NOT WORRY, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO NPR, HE'S A BIG FAN OF THE MOON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) GREAT! BIG FAN OF THE MOON! WHY NOT? SO HE'S JUST AS QUALIFIED AS MY DOG. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, SPEAKING OF SPACE, SPEAKING OF SPACE-- THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY BIG NEWS. BIG NEWS FROM A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY--
Audience: WHOOO!
Stephen: THANK YOU, WEEKY. RECENTLY WE LEARNED THAT "JURASSIC WORLD" DIRECTOR COLIN TREVORROW IS OUT AS DIRECTOR OF "STAR WARS: EPISODE IX." I BELIEVE WE HAVE A VIDEO OF HOW HE WAS FIRED. OOH! THEY ALWAYS CHOKE YOU ON A FRIDAY. ( LAUGHTER ) LUCASFILM HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT, SAYING THAT THEY "HAVE MUTUALLY CHOSEN TO PART WAYS" WITH THE DIRECTOR, WHILE COLIN TREVORROW RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING, "IF YOU STRIKE ME DOWN, I SHALL BECOME MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE." THEN HIS ROBE JUST COLLAPSED. IT WAS WEIRD. THERE WAS NOBODY THERE. NOW, THIS TURNOVER IS JUST THE LATEST INDICATION THAT NOT ALL IS WELL IN THAT WRETCHED HIVE OF SCUM AND VILLAINY WE CALL HOLLYWOOD, BECAUSE IT COMES AFTER DISNEY FIRED THE DIRECTORS OF THE YOUNG HAN SOLO MOVIE AND HAD TO DO EXPENSIVE RESHOOTS ON "STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE." PLUS, THE ASPCA CAME DOWN ON THEM PRETTY HARD FOR THEIR TREATMENT OF CHEWBACCA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SORRY. WOOO! WOOO! "EPISODE IX" IS SLATED TO COME OUT IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, SO, OBVIOUSLY, DISNEY IS SCRAMBLING TO FIEWND A REPLACEMENT DIRECTOR AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HELP HERE AT THE "LATE SHOW" BY PEOPLE WE THOUGHT WOULD DO A GREAT JOB. FIRST UP, IF THERE'S ONE THING I THINK WE ALL AGREE THE "STAR WARS" FILMS WERE MISSING, IT'S '70s MUSIC AND EXTENDED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CHEESEBURGERS. SO GET READY FOR QUENTIN TARANTINO'S "STAR WARS: EPISODE IX: EVERYBODY SHOOTS FIRST." I'D WATCH THAT. I'D WATCH THAT. OF COURSE, TARANTINO CAN BE A LITTLE POLARIZING, BUT EVERYBODY LOVES ROMANTIC COMEDY, SO WHAT ABOUT NANCY MEYERS' "STAR WARS: EPISODE IX: WHAT WOOKIEES WANT." ( LAUGHTER ) "SOMETIMES THE DROIDS YOU WERE LOOKING FOR WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU THE WHOLE TIME." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ONE DIRECTOR IS REALLY THROWING HIS HAT IN THE RING FOR THIS JOB, EVEN GOING AHEAD AND MAKING HIS OWN TRAILER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PRESENTING A NEW TAKE ON "STAR WARS" FROM THE NIHILISTIC GERMAN DIRECTOR OF "FITZCARALDO" AND "GRIZZLY MAN," WERNER HERZOG. AS FAR AS AWAY AS A MOTHER'S AFFECTIONATE GLANCE OR THE COLD TOUCH OF YOUR LOVER, THE EVIL FORCED ORDER SEEKS CONTROL OF THE GALAXY, FORGETTING THAT THE GALAXY ITSELF IS NOT BUT THE INFINITE VOID. THIS IS THE WAY OF THINGS. IN THE DESERT, THERE'S NOTHING BUT SUFFERING. LIFE CANNOT SUSTAIN HERE, BUT TRULY, IT CANNOT SUSTAIN ANYWHERE. DEATH IS INEVITABLE, AND IN THIS, WE FIND COMFORT. LOOK, MOSQUITOES DANCING ON THE CARCASS OF INFINITY, OUR AGONY LENDS US BRILLIANCE. I LOVE THIS GUY. HE IS A SPUNKY LITTLE ROBOT BALL, AND I LIKE THAT. THE SEARING OF THE LIGHTSABER CANNOT COMPARE TO THE UNFEELING VIOLENCE OF OUR ENDLESS UNIVERSE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JESSICA BIEL IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, IT IS FRIDAY CONFESSIONS." STICK AROUND! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THERE YOU GO. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. RIGHT OVER THERE. THAT'S THE BAND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: JON, HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. HAVE A LOVELY WEEKEND. NOW, FOLKS FOLKS, WE ARE COMING UP ON THE WEEKEND. THIS IS A FRIDAY. FRIDAY MEANS WE'RE ABOUT TO DO STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. WHICH REMINDS ME, THIS WEEKEND, GO OUT AND GET MY BOOK. "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." WE'RE GOING TO MILK THIS THING UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. THERE'LL BE AN AUDIOBOOK, "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS: THE BROADWAY MUSICAL," WHICH WILL BE ADAPTED INTO A MOVIE: "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS: TOKYO DRIFT," WHICH THEN WILL THEN BE NOVELIZED IN BOOK FORM. SO DON'T MISS THE BOAT. GET IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITH "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." DON'T FIGHT IT. BRING IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE DO MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'M A CATHOLIC, I DON'T MAKE IT TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS THERE IS CHURCH. AND WHAT I MISS MOST ABOUT THE SACRAMENTS IS CONFESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO CONFESS TO YOU, MY AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience: OF COURSE NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHEAPER ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: STANDARD DISCLAIMER: I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE, I HAVE NEVER PREHEATED AN OVEN. BUT I HAVE PRE-EATEN A FROZEN PIZZA. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, I THROW GARBAGE OUT THE CAR WINDOW WHILE PARKED IN MY NEIGHBOR'S DRIVEWAY. ( LAUGHTER ) MY KID ISN'T AN HONOR STUDENT. HE'S JUST REALLY GOOD AT FORGING BUMPER STICKERS. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES I DRINK MILK RIGHT OUT OF THE CARBON. AFTER I FILL IT WITH BOURBON. ( LAUGHTER ) MMM. MMM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DADDY'S COW'S ARE FLAMMABLE. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I HAVE A OVERDUE LIBRARY COPY OF "1984" THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO RETURN IN 1983. ( LAUGHTER ) MY SLEEP NUMBER IS PI. ( LAUGHTER ) WHENEVER I RIDE A BICYCLE, I DON'T WEAR A HELMET, BECAUSE I WANT THE AMBULANCE DRIVERS TO THINK I'M COOL. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND I'M PROUD OF IT. BUT I STILL GIGGLE WHEN I HEAR THE NAME "GAMECOCKS." ( LAUGHTER ) I SECRETLY HOPE HEAVEN HAS A V.I.P. SECTION FOR FAMOUS PEOPLE, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DO SELFIES FOR ETERNITY. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES I PLACE ORDERS AT MULTIPLE DOMINO'S JUST SO I CAN WATCH THEM RACE ON THE PIZZA TRACKER. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE?
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, RIGHT THERE? WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST GUEST IS AN ACTRESS YOU'VE SEEN IN "THE ILLUSIONIST," "VALENTINE'S DAY," AND "7th HEAVEN." PLEASE WELCOME, JESSICA BIEL! HEY! HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. COME ON UP HERE.
HELLO, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HOW'S IT GOING?
Stephen: IT'S GOING WELL. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M REALLY GOOD.
Stephen: WELL, WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE.
NO, WE HAVEN'T.
Stephen: WE HAVE NEVER SPOKEN BEFORE, BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE, YOU HAVE BEEN AN ACTOR FOR OVER 20 YEARS. ACTRESS, PRODUCER. THE ONLY ONE TO SURVIVE "THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE."
TRUE.
Stephen: THAT'S GOT TO BE ON THE C.V. SOME PLACE.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE MARRIED TO J.T. YOU MAKE THE SCENE, GLAM, GLAM, GLAM, GLAM. IT IS. YOU ALSO HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD JIECIALG YES, YES, WE DO.
Stephen: ONE OF THE LEAST-GLAMOROUS THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN TO SOMEONE.
THAT'S VERY TRUE.
Stephen: HOW MANY SURFACES OF YOUR HOME ARE COVERED WITH WHAT YOU HOPE IS CHOCOLATE? ( LAUGHTER ).
EVERY SQUARE INCH. AND IF IT'S NOT THE HOPEFUL CHOCOLATE, IT'S STICKERS AND PLAY-DOH, AND GAK, AND CRUMBS, AND WHO KNOWS? IT'S COVERED-- EVERYTHING IS COVERED WITH EVERYTHING!
Stephen: ARE YOU STILL MEASURING IN MONTHS AT THIS POINT?
NO MORE, NO MORE MONTHS.
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU STOP ON MONTHS? , 24?
YES, DONE.
Stephen: ARE YOU IN IN THE TERRIBLE TWOS.
WE ARE, WE'RE THERE.
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHILD.
FIRST.
Stephen: FENDING HOW THE TWOS GO, MAYBE ONLY.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME.
Stephen: I KNOW IF I MEET SOMEONE AND THEY CALL THE TWO-YEAR-OLDS TERRIBLE TWO IT'S THEIR FIRST CHILD BECAUSE THEY'RE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE THREES.
THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.
Stephen: IF YOU SAY THE TERRIBLE TWOS, YOU HAVE HAVEN'T HAD A THREE-YEAR-OLD.
I HAVEN'T. TO ME THIS IS TERRIBLE. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE THREE-TEEN S.
Stephen:  THE THREE-TEENS.
I THREE-YEAR-OLDS HAVE CALLED THE THREE-TEENS.
Stephen: THEY'RE AS HEADSTRONG AS THE TWO-YEAR-OLDS, BUT NOW THEY'RE PHYSICALLY STRONG AS WELL.
RIGHT. THE THINGS I HAVE TO PLY OUT OF HIS LITTLE, SLIMY HAND. I DON'T KNOW HOW-- HE'S SO STRONG ALREADY.
Stephen: IS HE GETTING AT THE CUT LARRY? WHAT ARE YOU PRYING OUT OF HIS HANDS.
EVERYTHING. THE LITTLE GUY IN HIS HAND --
Stephen: A CHOKING PAZZARD.
A CHOKING HAZARD OR POKING HAZARD. IF YOU WAKE MY KID UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BY ACCIDENT, YOU'RE DEAD TO ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Stephen: OH, ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU COME IN MY HOUSE AND YOU DO SOME CRAZY THING AND YOU MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE, YOU TURN ON THE MUSIC, ARE YOU OUT!
Stephen: HOW MUCH DOES THAT HAPPEN, JESSICA BIEL?
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COME IN, THEY'RE LOUD. THEY THINK THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME, AND THEY FORGET.
Stephen: THIS IS TIMBERLAKE'S FRIENDS, ISN'T IT?
THAT'S RIGHT. NOT MY FRIEND. MY FRIENDS ARE QUIET, DEMURE.
Stephen: YOU'RE A TV PRODUCER, HE'S IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.
HE'S A WILD MUSICIAN.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR YOUNG BOY'S NAME?
HIS NAME IS SILAS.
Stephen: THAT'S AN OLD-FASHIONED NAME. IS IT A FAMILY NAME.
HIS GRANDFATHER'S MIDDLE NAME AND HIS GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S NAME.
Stephen: IT SOUND AMISH.
LIKE AN OLD SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN GUY.
Stephen: A BIBLICAL NAME, ONE OF THE CHURCH FATHERS, SIULAR.
IT'S NOT ALL TERRIBLE, BY THE WAY. HE'S, LIKE, THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME.
Stephen: THERE ARE SOME NICE THINGS ABOUT CHILDREN.
I'M FELLA REALLY BAD. HE'S CUTE, HE'S FUNNY.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO EDIT THE PART OUT WHERE YOU'RE NICE FOR HIM AND YEARS FROM NOW I'LL PLAY THIS FOR HIS THERAPIST.
THIS IS WHERE ALL MY PROBLEMS COME FROM. SHE HATED ME.
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE A CHILD-FRIENDLY RESTAURANT.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU OWN THIS RESTAURANT?
I'M ONE OF THE OWNERS.
Stephen: OH, ONE OF, OKAY, IN LOS ANGELES.
THERE ARE SIX OF US. AND IT BASICALLY MEANS YOU CAN COME IN WITH YOUR WILD, CRAZY FAMILY AND JUST DESTROY THE PLACE AND WE'RE FINE WITH IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IS THERE, LIKE, A PLAY AREA FOR THE CHILD?
YES, THERE'S A PLAY AREA.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT.
IT'S CALLED OH, FUDGE.
Stephen: OH, FUDGE, AS IN NOT SAYING ANOTHER WORD?
THAT'S RIGHT. AS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR VOCABULARY WHEN YOUR A PARENT. YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THE FUN WORDS ANYMORE.
Stephen: ALSO WHEN YOU GET A SHOW ON CBS. THIS IS VERY MUCH LIKE BEING A PARENT.
YOU UNDERSTAND ON MANY LEVELS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE.
Stephen: OH, FUDGE. LET'S SAY I HAVE MY TWO-YEAR-OLD, THREE-YEAR-OLD AND I GO TO OH, FUDGE. MY WIFE AND I, WHAT CAN WE DO?
YOU CAN ENJOY A MEAL, THE FULL BAR, AND SEND YOUR KIDS TO THE CREATIVE SPACE, THE ROOM NEXT DOOR, AND WE HAVE OFUDGE AU PAIRS.
Stephen: DO THEY HAVE A PAROVER THERE?
THEY HAVE A BAR OVER THERE. WE'RE TRANQUILIZING THEM, IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: AND MOM AND DAD, IT'S LIKE A GOOD DATE NIGHT WITH CHILD. WE CAN GET OUR DRINK ON AND MAKE SURE SOMEBODY IS TAKING CARE OF JUNIOR OVER THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND CALL AN UBER, FOR SURE.
FOR SURE.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS?
WE'VE BEEN OPEN, OH, MY GOSH, ALMOST TWO YEARS. IT'S PRETTY NEW.  ( APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: THEY'RE ALL PARENTS. THEY'RE ALL BOOKING THEIR TICKETS TO LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW, JUST TO HAVE A COCKTAIL IN PEACE.
PLEASE COME, PLEASE COME AND SEE US.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A LIMITED SERIES, I THINK EIGHT EPISODES, U.S.A. NETWORK, CALLED "THE SINNER."
YES. >.
Stephen: AND YOU ARE THE SINNER.
YES.
Stephen: AND I DON'T THINK I'M GIVING ANYTHING AWAY, WHERE I SAY YOU MURDER A MAN WITH A STEAK NICE.
IT'S A BUTTER KNIFE.
Stephen: HOW HARD ARE YOU CHOPPING AT SOMEBODY WITH A BUTTER KNIFE.
PRETTY HARD.
Stephen: IT'S NOT A WHODUNIT? IT'S CALLED A "WHY DONE IT?"
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY. IMMEDIATELY WE'RE TELLING YOU, THIS IS THE PERSON WHO DID THIS VIOLENT ACT. OPINION MY CHARACTER IS SAYING, "I DID THIS THING. YOU SHOULD PUT ME AWAY. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT A LAWYER. I WANT NONE OF IT. JUST PUT ME AWAY."
Stephen: AND THE OTHER SEVEN EPISODES ARE...
JUST ME SITTING IN A CELL. IT'S VERY COMPELLING. THE DETECTIVE BECOMES FIXATED ON THIS CASE BECAUSE THIS BEHAVIOR IS VERY UNUSUAL.
Stephen: IT MAKES NO SENSE.
IT MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL. SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON AND HE'S OBSESSED AND HE UNRAVELS THE CASE.
Stephen: UP TO THIS POINT YOU HAVE BEEN A MODEL CITIZEN.
YES, I HAVE A FAMILY, A PRETTY NORMAL LIFE, AND THEN YOU START TO UNCOVER THE PAST THIS WOMAN HAS.
Stephen: AND I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU ON THE PHONE WITH BILL PULLMAN RIGHT HERE.
YES.
HELLO.
YOU HAVE TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.
WE REALLY SHOULDN'T BE TALKING.
TAKE ME TO WHERE YOU THINK IT HAPPENED-- THE CLUB, THE BASEMENT. MAYBE IF I COULD JUST GO, THEN I CAN REMEMBER THE REST.
IT'S THE STATE POLICE MATTER NOW. THEY WON'T LET ME TAKE YOU OUT.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M GET TO GO CLOSE TO YOU.
YOU'VE GIVEN UP.
Stephen: ANOTHER SO NOT ONLY ARE YOU STARRING IN THIS, BUT YOU'RE ALSO THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER.
YES.
Stephen: OF THIS, OF THIS SHOW.  ( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU!
Stephen: SURE. WHY NOT?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY NOT?
I'LL TAKE SOME APPLAUSE.
Stephen: NOW, HOW DOES THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER FEEL ABOUT THE STAR? IS, LIKE, ARE YOU A DIVA TO THE PRODUCER SIDE OF YOU? WHAT WERE YOUR DEMANDS LIKE IN YOUR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS?
IT WAS A TOUGH-- IT WAS A TOUGH NEGOTIATION.
Stephen: YEAH.
THE STAR WON. SHE GOT WHAT SHE --
Stephen: OH, WOW, OH, WOW.
THAT'S NOT TRUE. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. HERE'S MY ISSUE, IS I'M-- I'M A BIT OF A PUSH-OAFER PRODUCER BUT I'M KIND OF A BITCHY STAR. I'M STRUGGLING HERE. WHO IS GOING TO WIN. AND I'M A BAD PRODUCER IN THE SENSE THAT I-- I WANT EVERYONE TO JUST BE HAPPY AND FEEL GOOD, AND IF, YOU KNOW-- PART OF --
Stephen: THAT'S NOT A TERRIBLE THING FOR A PRODUCER TO BE. I WISH MY PRODUCER WAS LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB BY NOT GIVING ALL THESE THINGS. AND MY PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW, IF MY ACTOR COMES TO ME AND SAYS, "I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THIS. I NEED THIS." I'M LIKE, "NO PROBLEM. WE'LL FIX IT. WE GOT IT. YOU WANT MORE MONEY, SURE. YOU WANT A BIGGER TRAILER, GREAT. YOU WANT A DAY OFF FINE. AND MY PRODUCERRING PARTNERS ARE GOING WE CAN'T DO THAT.
Stephen: THEY'RE LIKE ACTORS ARE ANIMALS. YOU CAN ALWAYS RENT ANOTHER ONE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THEY'RE CHATTEL.
I'M CONFUSED. I BASICALLY SPENT THE ENTIRE SHOOT BEING TERRIBLE CONFUSED WITHIN MYSELF, ABOUT MYSELF.
Stephen: THIS IS A MURDER MYSTERY OF A TYPE. I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, YOU ACTUALLY WROTE KIND OF DARK STORIES OF YOUR OWN. WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD, YOU ACTUALLY WROTE YOUR OWN LITTLE SHORT STORIES THAT WERE KIND OF, MAYBE DISTURBING.
YEAH, THEY WERE WEIRD. THEY WERE INTENSE AND DARK. I HAD THIS LITERALLY IDYLLIC SORT OF --
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?
GROWING UP IN EXPERIENCE. I GREW UP IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PLACES BUT MAINLY BOULDER, COLORADO. MY FAMILY WAS GREAT. IT WAS VERY NORMAL. I DON'T KNOW, I WAS FIXATED ON DARK, SCARY, INTENSE, DRAMATIC THINGS.
Stephen: DID YOU WRITE HORROR STORIES?
I WROTE, LIKE, WEIRDO STORIES, BUT ALSO I JUST WROTE STORIES THAT WERE MEANT TO INTRIGUE YOU AND MEANT TO SOUND REALLY COOL THAT MADE NO SENSE. LIKE, I THINK ONE OF THE TITLES WAS, "THE BEGINNING OF THE NEVER BEFORE." ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I GUARANTEE YOU SOMEONE IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD BUY THAT BASED ON THE TITLE. THAT'S THE NEXT HARRY POTTER RIGHT THERE "THE BEGINNING OF THE NEVER BEFORE."
MAYBE I REALLY HAD SOMETHING GOING ON BACK THEN.
Stephen: "THE BEGINNING OF NEVER BEFORE," IT'S WHAT HAPPENS AT A TIME THAT NEVER WAS.
EXACTLY. IT'S VERY INTRIGUING.
Stephen:  EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JESSICA BIEL. GOOD LUCK GETTING JESSICA BIEL, BECAUSE SHE'S A TOTAL DIVA.
SHE IS. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. .
Stephen: "THE SINNER" AIRS WEDNESDAYS ON USA NETWORK. JESSICA BIEL, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE "WALKING DEAD." SHE NOW HOPES TO LIVE LONG AND PROSPER AS THE STAR OF "STAR TREK DISCOVERY" ON CBS ALL ACCESS.
MISSION DOWNED, 10 MINUTES, 15 SECONDS. WARNING:  PROXIMITY ALERT. SCANNING FOR DATABASE RECOGNITION. ICONOGRAPHY CONFIRMED. KLINGON.
I'M FROM THE UNITED FEDERATION OF --
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD. PLEASE WELCOME SONEQUA MARTIN-GREEN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M PRETTY DAMN EXCITED.
OH, MY GOSH! ME, TOO!
Stephen: HOW LONG-- FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: I WORK AT CBS AND I-- I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THIS YET. THEY ARE BEING SUPER PROTECTIVE OF THIS SHOW.
YEAH, EXTRA LOCKDOWN.
Stephen: IT TAKES PLACE BEFORE THE ORIGINAL SERIES, RIGHT?
YES, 10 YEARS BEFORE. 10 YEARS BEFORE. AND WE'RE-- WE'RE-- WE'RE DISCOVERING A LOT, DISCOVERING EACH OTHER THROUGH THE DISCOVERY OF OURSELVES, HONESTLY.
Stephen: THE-- THERE'S A LITTLE CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES. TELL ME IF I'M GETTING ANYTHING WRONG OR STOP ME IF I'M SAYING SOMETHING NO ONE IS SUPPOSED TO KNOW IS THAT YOUR CHARACTER-- ONE OF THE CROSSOVERS BETWEEN YOUR SERIES AND THE ORIGINAL IS THAT SERIC WHO IS SPOCK'S FATHER, RAISES YOU.
YES.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE NOT VULCAN.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'RE HUMAN.
YES.
Stephen: BUT YOUR PARENTS WERE KILLED BY KLINGONS.
YEAH. YES. I --
Stephen: I'M A LITTLE OBSESSED ABOUT ANY DETAILS I CAN GET OUT OF IT.
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A MOTION IF YOU WERE RAISED BY VULCANS?
I DO BECAUSE I AM HUMAN.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO I AM A HUMAN IN THE CULTURE OF VULCAN, RIGHT. SO THERE'S ASSIMILATION HAPPENING THERE. AND THERE'S CULTURE SHOCK THAT HAPPENED THERE.
Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THE AUDITION WAS JUST DOING THIS?
YOU KNOW, THAT'S REAL GOOD.
Stephen: THANKS.
EXCEPT YOUR THUMB HAS TO --
Stephen: HAS TO BE ON THE SIDE?
YOU NEED TO BRING YOUR THUMB OUT LIKE THAT IT CAME QUITE NATURALLY, SO MEANT TO BE.
Stephen: THE VULCAN PHILOSOPHY.
YES.
Stephen: THE BASIS OF IT.
YES.
Stephen: AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN RAISED BY VULCANS.
GET IT RIGHT.
Stephen: INFINITE DIVERSITY IN INFINITE COMBINATIONS. DOES AMERICA NEED A LITTLE "STAR TREK" RIGHT NOW?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME. YES. OH, MY GOSH. THINGS ARE AT A FEVER PITCH AT THIS POINT, DIVISION AND SEPARATIST THINKING. SO I FEEL PEOPLE NEED TO SEE-- I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO SEE WHAT WE CAN BE AND WHAT WE CAN BECOME. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOW DOES. IT ALWAYS HAS SO WE'RE JUST GOING BOLDLY IN THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS.
Stephen:  THE ORIGINAL SHOW-- OF ALL THE SHOWS, BUT GENE ROTTENBERRY CREATED THE ORIGINAL SHOW, DEALT WITH CURRENT SOCIAL SOCIETAL ISSUES OF ALL KIND.
YES.
Stephen: BY PUTTING THEM IN SPACE.
YES, BECAUSE, HONESTLY, THE FANTASY OF IT PROVIDES A SORT OF-- IT TAKES AWAY THE BARRIER, RIGHT. SO PEOPLE CAN LET GO. THEY CAN SUSPEND THEIR DISBELIEF AND BE IMAGINATIVE, AND THEN IN DOING THAT, THE MESSAGE COMES THROUGH SUBCONSCIOUSLY. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF SCI-FI, RIGHT.
Stephen: WOW, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE BRAINWASHING US.
AND THEN...
Stephen: CBS IS-- THEY'VE THROWN THE KITCHEN SINK AT THIS. THIS IS A HUGE PRODUCTION. WHAT IS-- WHAT IS, LIKE THE CRAZIEST LOCALE OR THE BIGGEST THING THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN DOING IN SHOOTING THIS?
YEAH, OH, MAN. OKAY, EVERYBODY IS ON THEIR TOP GAME, NUMBER ONE. I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT, BEHIND THE CAMERA AND IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. WE SHOT IN JORDAN, AND THE JORDANIAN CREW, THEY WERE AMAZING, SO WARM AND WELCOME. THE PRINCE OF JORDAN CAME TO VISIT SET ONE DAY. AND HE BROUGHT HIS SON. AND THEY WERE "TREK" FANS WHICH WAS AMAZING, AND I WAS SO THRENE OFF BECAUSE I GO, HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU GREET ROYALTY? THIS IS MY FIRST TIME. DO I-- DO YOU NEED ME TO BOW? DO I NEED TO CURTSY? AM I GONNA HAVE TO KISS HIS HAND? THAT'S FINE, IF THAT'S CUSTOMARY. WHAT EXACTLY DO I NEED TO DO HERE? AND HE WAS SO DOWN TO EARTH, THE HANDSHAKE WAS FINE. IT WAS KIND OF ANTICLIMACTIC, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: YOU'RE AMERICAN, YOU SAY I BOW TO NO KING. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. DON'T BOW. DON'T BOW. NOW, YOU'RE FROM ALABAMA, FROM A SMALL TOWN, RIGHT?
I AM.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT TOWN.
RUSSELLVILLE.
Stephen: THAT IS A SMALL TOWN IN ALABAMA.
IT IS. IT IS THE EPITOME OF A SMALL TOWN.
Stephen: HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME TO LOS ANGELES?
MY FIRST TRIP TO LOS ANGELES WAS IN 2010. AND I HAD ALWAYS DREAMT OF L.A., SO MY HUSBAND, KENDRICK, WAS DRIVING ME THROUGH BEVERLY HILLS. I WAS SO EXCITED, COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. AND I ALSO HAVE THIS DREAM THAT A STRANGER WILL INVITE ME IN FOR TEA.
Stephen: IN LOS ANGELES?
SURE. WHEREVER. RIGHT. I JUST HAVE --
Stephen: NO. ( LAUGHTER ).
MAYBE NOT WHEREVER.
Stephen: MAYBE NOT WHEREVER. MAYBE JORDAN.
MAYBE JORDAN, THEY'RE SO WARM THERE.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU THINK PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES WOULD INVITE YOU IN FOR TEA? BECAUSE THEY DON'T.
I KNOW, RIGHT. THEY DON'T, RIGHT. BUT I HAD SUCH HOPEFUL THINKING.
Stephen: BUT BASED ON WHAT?
BASED ON MY OWN DREAMS.
Stephen: OKAY.
YOU SEE.
Stephen: OKAY.
BASED ON WHAT I BELIEVE.
Stephen: UH-HUH... IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD-- IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD THE POLICE WHEN YOU TRIED TO--
I KNOW, RIGHT. WAIT TILL YOU HEAR IT. WE'RE DRIVING THROUGH, AND I SAY, "THAT MANSION, BABY." "I WANT TO GO THERE. AND I'M GOING TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR, IT'S GOING TO BE--" AND, OF COURSE, HE IS TRYING TO WASH ME.
Stephen: YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND TO PULL OVER SO YOU COULD KNOCK ON THE DOOR OF A STRANGER'S HOUSE AND DETEA?
UH-HUH. NOT DEMAND, BECAUSE THE DREAM IS THEY INVITE ME AND ASK.
Stephen: AND HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT SONEQUA MARTIN-GREEN?
I TOLD THEM, I SAY, "NO, BAKER LISTEN, JUST GO WITH ME. IT WILL BE OKAY. I'M GOING TO SMILE REALLY BIG. THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY I'LL NOT A THREAT. AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO 'OH, LOOK. SHE'S A YOUNG WOMAN. SHE'S NICE' AND THEY'LL SAY, 'COME ON IN. AND THEY'LL GO RANDILY, DO YOU WANT SOMA TEA? ' AND I'LL SAY YES." THAT WAS THE DREAM. AND WE ROLLED UP TO THIS HOUSE. AS A BLACK MAN-- SO SUPPORTIVE, YES, I DID MARRY A GOOD MAN. HE'S BEHIND ME, ABOUT FIVE FEET BEHIND ME. I KNOCK ON THE DOOR. BUT, SEE, WHAT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WAS SECURITY SYSTEMS. SO THEY HAD AN INTERCOM SYSTEM, AND THEN I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT DOGS, BECAUSE THEY WERE BARKING RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR. AND SO I-- I-- I JUST STOPPED, AND THE WOMAN-- A COME ANSWERS, THE WOMAN OF THE HOME, OOUM ASSUMING. AND SHE GOES, "HELLO?" AND I SAID-- I FROZE, AND KENDRICK WAS LIKE, "SAY SOMETHING, BABY." AND I SAID, "HI. YOU-- YOU DON'T KNOW ME. BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL HOME." ( LAUGHTER ) AND SHE SAYS, "THANKS." ( LAUGHTER ) AND I SAID, OKAY, BYE." AND THEN I WALK AWAY, AND I GO, "WHY DIDN'T THAT WORK?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHY DIDN'T THAT WORK?
Stephen: SO YOU BLAMED SOMEONE ELSE. ♪ ♪ ♪
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE THAT WAY.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA?
I WOULD. SEE?
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE ANY. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU.
Stephen: "STAR TREK DISCOVERY" PREMIERES SEPTEMBER 24 ON CBS ALL ACCESS. SONEQUA MARTIN-GREEN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, STICK AROUND. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, BACK BACK TO THE SHOW ALREADY IN PROGRESS. WELL, IT'S FRIDAY, AND WHAT A CRAZY WEEK IT'S BEEN. DONALD TRUMP THREATENED TO RESCIND DACA UNLESS CONGRESS DOES SOMETHING. AND HURRICANE SAVAGED THE CRIB CRAN. HOUSTON IS STILL DIGGING OUT. I NEVER WANT TO SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THAT STUFF AGAIN UNLESS DOING SO FILLS AN ACT OF MY SHOW TONIGHT. THIS IS THE BEST OF THIS WEEK'S "THE LATE SHOW."
WHAT DO YOU LIKE BETTER, READY, "MADE IN AMERICA?" "MADE IN THE U.S.A.?" WHAT DO YOU LIKE? YOU LIKE "MADE IN THE U.S.A.?" SEEMS TO BE. WE SHOULD PICK ONE OR THE OTHER PROBABLY.
Stephen: YEAH, WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PICK ONE, AND THEN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE CAN PICK THE OTHER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT SEEMS-- I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
REPUBLICANS WANTED TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING TO COVER THE NEXT 18 MONGST? THE NEXT 18 MONGST, SO THE DEMOCRATS COULDN'T USE IT AS A NEGOTIATING TOOL BEFORE THE NEXT MIDTERM ELECTIONS. THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO COVER ONLY THREE MONTHS AND THEY CONVINCED TRUMP, PROBABLY RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT, WHEN CHUCK SCHUMER SEEMS TO BE SAYING, "WHO'S A GOOD PRESIDENT? YOU ARE." SOMEBODY ELSE HAS A BOOK RIGHT NOW, HILLARY CLINTON DOES. AND SHE REMEMBERS YOU FROM THE CAMPAIGN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. AND FACED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN HILLARY'S DAILY WORKOUT PLAN AND BERNIE'S NO-MINUTE ABS, AMERICA WENT WITH POTATO ASS.
SECRETARY CLINTON RAN AGAINST THE MOST UNPOPULAR CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND SHE LOST, AND SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT IT, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT OUR JOB NOW IS REALLY NOT TO GO BACKWARDS. IT IS TO GO FORWARDS.
Stephen: ARE YOU RUNNING AGAIN? AND ARE YOU PREPARED TO BE BLAMED NEXT TIME FOR TRUMP'S RE-ELECTION? ( LAUGHTER )
BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED, I-- SEXIST THINGS WOULD HAPPEN ALL THE TIME IN MY LIFE. AND I WOULD KIND OF GO, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M FINE. I DON'T NEED TO UNPACK THAT. I DON'T NEED TO TAKE THAT APART. I'M LUCKY. I'M DOING FINE. I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE THAT." AND AFTER HE WAS ELECTED, I WENT, "I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THE NATION MUST SET AND ENFORCE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY IMMIGRANTS WE ADMIT EACH YEAR, AND THAT MEANS ALL CANNOT BE ACCEPTED. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE OR THAT OUR NATION DISRESPECTS OR DEMEANS THEM IN ANY WAY.
Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT, JEFF, DEPORTING INNOCENT CHILDREN DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE. IT MEANS YOU'RE A BAD PERSON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND-- BANNON DEFENDS TRUMP ENDING DACA, EVEN THOUGH BANNON IS A CATHOLIC, AND THE CHURCH OPPOSES THIS DECISION.
I TOTALLY RESPECT THE POPE, AND I TOTALLY RESPECT THE CATHOLIC BISHOPS AND CARDINALS ON DOCTRINE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT DOCTRINE. THIS IS ABOUT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF A NATION. AND IN THAT REGARD, THEY'RE JUST ANOTHER GUY WITH AN OPINION.
Stephen: YEAH, STEVE, AND NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SO ARE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHARLIE-- VERY MUCH LIKE THE POPE.
Stephen: YOU ARE NOT THE MOST POLITICAL, BUT YOU DIE GUYS TALK ABOUT TRUMP OVER THERE?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WORLD OF YOUR DIFFICULT SITUATION HAS REACHED US. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ACROSS THE POND.
YEAH.
Stephen: ACROSS THE POND.
Stephen: THAT'S A REALLY ODDLY CASUAL WAY TO DESCRIBE EXHAUSTED FIRST RESPONDERS RACING TO SAVE LIVES. IT REMINDS ME OF F.D.R.'S PEARL HARBOR SPEECH.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS SUDDENLY AND DELIBERATELY ATTACKED BY NAVAL AND AIR FORCES OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN. BUT THAT'S THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YEAH. HE TOOK-- HE TOOK IT WITH A LOT OF APLUMB. HE TOOK IT EASILY. YEAH, HE WAS VERY BIG ABOUT DID. YOU PLAYED A LOT OF TOUGH GUYS. SABER TOOTH, DONOVAN IS A TOUGH GUY. ARE YOU A TOUGH GUY?
NO.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT A TOUGH GUY?
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT. I THINK I'M ABSENT MINDED AND I THINK THAT FACE OF FORGETTING THINGS-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) TRANSLATES ON FILM AS TOUGH.
Stephen: I GET IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW"." SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
