THAT CONCLUDES OUR DEBATE THIS EVENING, A SPIRITED ONE.
Stephen: WOW, THAT WAS SOME DEBAY. WHAT DID YOU THINK, GHOST OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN?
DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. BUT I GOTTA SAY, THE CANDIDATES SEEMED A LITTLE PAMPERED.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IF MY DAY WE DIDN'T HAVE FANCY CAMERAS, MODERATORS AND ANTIBIOTICS. ALL WE HAD WAS OUR WITS AND THE SNAKE BOX, OF COURSE.
Stephen: THE SNAKE BOX? ANY DEBATER WINNING HAD TO ANSWER THE NEXT QUESTION WITH HIS HANDS IN A BOX OF VENOMOUS SNAKES. KEPT THE DEBATES MOVING AMONG.
Stephen: AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T HAVE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF THAT.
Stephen: IT'S CALLED TWITTER. YOU SHOULD KNOW WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT NOW.
IT'S AMAZING. I'M GLAD MY FELLOW REPS FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE EMANCIPATION PRODUCT LAMEDICATION.
Stephen: HE'S A DEMOCRAT. AFTER ALL I DID FOR THEM?
Stephen: YEP. GREAT CATCHING UP. I HAVE A LIVE SHOW TO DO. I'VE GOT TO GET DOWN TO THE THEATER.
NTHEATER. DON'T GO TO THE THEATER! IT'S A TRAP!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES ROB LOWE, KAL PENN AND EMMA WILLMAN, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S WORD WAR ONE, THE SHOW'S LIVE DEBATE COVERAGE. SORRY, AMERICA. YOUR TIME IS UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY! WHAT'S UP, JOSEPH? HOW'S IT GOING, JON? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! , WHAT'S UP? ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOO! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY! WE CAWELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, AND NOT ONLY IS THIS AUDIENCE ALIVE, TONIGHT WE ARE LIVE BROADCASTING FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOOM! LIVE MEANS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT, IF I MAKE A MISTAKE, IT CAN NEVER BE TAKEN BACK. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND, WHEN YOU GO VOTE THIS NEXT NOVEMBER. NEVER CAN BE TAKEN BACK.
Jon: PLEASE DO.
Stephen: SO DEEP BREATH, EVERYBODY. LET'S COME UP FOR AIRPORT WE ALL JUST WATCHED DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON DEBATE FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. COMING INTO TONIGHT'S DEBATE, DEMOCRATS WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO STRONG EMOTIONS, PANIC AND PANTS-CRAPPING. ( LAUGHTER ) DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT BEEN THIS NERVOUS SINCE ANTHONY WEINER ASKED TO BORROW THEIR PHONE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: WHOOPS!
Stephen: OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T DO IT. NOT WORTH IT. NOT WORTH IT.
Jon: NO.
Stephen: THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TWO SIDES WERE VERY DIFFERENT. FOR HILLARY TO WIN, HAD TO BE CONFIDENT, NOT SMUG, KNOWLEDGEABLE WITHOUT BEING KNOW IT ALL, CHARMING BUT NOT AFFECTED, COMMANDING BUT NOT SHRILL, LIKABLE, WARM, AUTHORITATIVE AND NOT COUGHING. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP HAD TO NOT COMMIT MURDER. ( LAUGHTER ) ON CAMERA. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT LOW BAR WAS REFLECTED IN DONALD TRUMP'S DEBATE PREP. INSTEAD OF DOING A BUNCH OF MOCK DEBATES, THE WORD IS THAT HE SAT DOWN WITH FRIENDS OVER BACON CHEESEBURGERS, HOT DOGS AND GLASSES OF COCA-COLA AND TESTED OUT ZINGERS. WOW! THAT'S HOW I PREPARED FOR TONIGHT'S DEBATE, TOO! ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE MAY NOT HAVE PREPARED, BUT IT ALSO LOOKED LIKE HE DIDN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, HILLARY WAS SO PREPARED, MY NEW NICKNAME FOR HER IS PREPARATION H. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH, IT'S A COMPLIMENT. IN THE PRIMARIES, SHE ALREADY PROVED SHE COULD SOOTHE THE BURN. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. OF COURSE, IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR ONE OF THESE TWO CANDIDATES TO TELL A LIE.
DONALD, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: FALSE! WHERE ARE THE FACTS CHECKERS? WHERE ARE THE FACT CHECKERS? PINOCCHIO! THEN SECRETARY CLINTON WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE ON THE TOPIC OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
DONALD THINKS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX PERPETRATED BY THE CHEESE. I THINK IT'S REAL.
I DID NOT. T'S SCIENCE --  DO NOT SAY THAT.
Stephen: LET'S GO TO THE TWEET. DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THE CONCEPT OF GLOBAL WARMING WAS CREATED FOR AND BY THE CHEESE TO MAKE U.S. MANUFACTURING NONCOMPETITIVE. LOOK, IN ALL FAIRNESS, THERE IS A CHANCE THAT TWEET WAS CREATED BY THE CHEESE TO MAKE TRUMP NON-COMPETITIVE. YOU DON'T KNOW. ( APPLAUSE ) YOU DON'T KNOW.
Jon: WE DON'T KNOW!
Stephen: FOR MONTHS NOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS QUESTIONED HILLARY'S HEALTH REPEATEDLY, AND I GOTTA SAY, THERE WAS ONE POSSIBLE HEALTH SCARE ON STAGE TONIGHT. TRUMP SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS FIGHTING OFF A COLD WITH COCAINE -- (SNIFF, SNIFF)
WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS WITH MEXICO -- (SNIFF, SNIFF) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HE SOUNDED LIKE THE COKED UP BEST MAN IN THE BATHROOM AT A WEDDING. NO, NO. YOU GUYS, I GOT IT -- SNIFF -- I KNOW HOW TO FIX THE ECONOMY. LET'S GO IN TOGETHER -- SNIFF -- BUY A BOAT. WE'RE GOING TO START A RESTAURANT TOGETHER! (SNIFF) ( LAUGHTER ) HE WAS LIKE SCAR FACE BUT WITH MORE FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE DEBATE WAS MODERATED BY NBC'S LESTER HOLT WHICH MAKES SENSE SINCE HE HOSTED DATELINE AND IS USED TO TWO RICH WHITE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MURDER EACH OTHER ( LAUGHTER ) AND AT TIMES THE CROWD WAS A LITTLE ROWDIER AN ALLOWED IN THE RULES AND LESTER HOLT HAD TO SCOLD THEM.
LET ME ADMONISH THE AUDIENCE ONE MORE TIME THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT. WE ASKED YOU TO BE SILENT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SO HELP ME I WILL TURN THIS DEBATE AROUND AND NEITHER ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PRESIDENT. STOP CLAPPING. TRUMP -- NO, NO CLAPPING. WHERE WAS I. OKAY. TRUMP WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHY HILLARY'S DETAILED PLAN TO DEFEAT I.S.I.S. WAS A BAD IDEA.
LOOK AT HER WEB SITE -- YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN. THIS SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT I.S.I.S. JUST GO TO HER WEB SITE. SHE TELLS YOU HOW TO FIGHT I.S.I.S. ON HER WEB SITE. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR WOULD LIKE THAT TOO MUCH.
Stephen: YEAH, GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR WOULD BE, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS WEB SITE YOU HAVE? AND WHAT IS THIS -- WHY IS IT ASKING ME TO DONATE $50 TO A HILLARY CLINTON? ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WHEN THE TOPIC MOVED ON TO RACIAL STRIFE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS A TOUCHY SUBJECT, TRUMP FELT HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.
FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS, AND THAT'S "LAW" AND "ORDER." (LAW AND ORDER THEME SOUND BYTE)
Stephen: THAT'S A CHEAP JOKE AND SERIOUS SUBJECT. YOU WERE SAYING? I'M SORRY.
WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER (LAW AND ORDER THEME SOUND BYTE)
Stephen: VERY GOOD SHOW. WE SHOULD BRING THAT BACK. HE'S RIGHT. FACT CHECK. A VERY GOOD SHOW. WE MISS YOU SAM WATERSTON. ( LAUGHTER ) STILL WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY, TRUMP WAS PROUD OF HIS ENDORSEMENTS.
I WAS JUST ENDORSED BY ICE.
Stephen: NOW, ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK IMMIGRATIONS AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT IS ALLOWED TO ENDORSE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IN FAIRNESS, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEING ENDORSED BY VANILLA ICE. IT SURE WASN'T ICE T. IT WASN'T PHYSICAL SCUMPLET HE ALSO KNOWS ABOUT CYBERSECURITY.
AS FAR AS SCIESH, I AGREE, CYBER --
Stephen: YEAH! HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT CYBERRING. HAS AMERICA TRIED UNPLUGGING TERRORISM AND PLUGGING IT BACK IN JUST TO REBOOT THE MIDDLE EAST? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND TRUMP WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW IF THE RUSSIANS HACKED THE D.N.C., IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE.
IT ALSO COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400 POUNDS, OKAY? ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: HEY! I DON'T CARE IF IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY, WE DO NOT SAY THINGS LIKE THAT! NO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAYBE WE DO. THEN TRUMP TOLD THE BIGGEST LIE OF THE DEBATE.
I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET MAYBE BY FAR IS MY TEMPERAMENT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: MAYBE. OF COURSE, WE'LL NEVER KNOW IF HIS TEMPERAMENT IS REALLY HIS STRONGEST ASSET BECAUSE HE WON'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. ( APPLAUSE ) DO YOU REALIZE HOW LESTER HOLT IS ANGRY WITH YOU RIGHT NOW FOR CLAPPING? ( LAUGHTER ) AND AT THE END OF THE DEBATE, THINGS REALLY STARTED TO GO OFF THE RAILS.
THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS CALLED WOMEN PIGS, SLOBS AND DOGS, AND SOMEONE WHO HAS SAID PREGNANCY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO EMPLOYERS --
NEVER SAID THAT. AND WOMEN -- NEVER SAID THAT. THOUGH I DID SAY THE SLOB THING AND IT WAS FUNNY. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WE GOT THROUGH IT. WE MANAGED TO GET THROUGH 90 MINUTES OF THESE TWO PEOPLE ON STAGE GOING AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. IN TEND, THERE WAS REALLY ONLY ONE WORD THAT SUMMED UP HOW THIS WHOLE DEBATE, THIS WHOLE ELECTION FEELS AND DONALD TRUMP CAPTURED IT.
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.
Stephen: WRONG. WRONG. ( APPLAUSE ) WRONG. THE ONLY PHRASE HE SAYS MORE OFTEN IS "I DO." WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL FIND OUT IF TONIGHT'S DEBATE CHANGED ANY MINDS, PLUS WE'VE GOT ROB LOWE AND KAL PENN! SO STICK AROUND, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: WELCOME BACK! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"! SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) KEEPING IT ALIVE. OKAY. NOW, THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS DEBATE TONIGHT, THE MAIN PRIZE THE CANDIDATES ARE VYING OVER IS THE ELUSIVE, UNDECIDED VOTER, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM. ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE AREN'T SURE WHO THEY WILL VOTE FOR. IN FACT, ONE IN TWO CANDIDATES STILL ISN'T SURE HE WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE TORN. THESE ARE THE TWO LEAST POPULAR CANDIDATES IN HISTORY. THAT'S INCLUDING THE 1892 CONTEST BETWEEN OSWALT THE ORPHAN STRANGLER AND BOX CAR JOHNNY TYPHUS. ( LAUGHTER )SO IT' IF AFTER ALL THIS TIME THE ENTIRE ELECTION IS GOING TO BE DECIDED BY THESE FEW UNDECIDED VOTERS, I WANTED TO TALK TO ONE OF THEM MYSELF. SO JOIN ME IN TALKING TO UNDECIDE VOTER CHARLES HANSEN FROM OHIO. THANK YOU, MR. HANSEN.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. MR. HANSEN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. ALSO GOOD TO BE HERE -- OR NOT! I'M STILL FIGURING IT OUT.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND, MR. HANSEN. VOTERS LIKE YOU HOLD THE ELECTION IN THE PALM OF YOUR HANDS BUT YOU HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE DECIDING. DID THE DEBATE HELP YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND?
ABSOLUTELY. I AM 100% BEHIND DONALD TRUMP.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT DID TRUMP SAY TONIGHT THAT PUT YOU OVER THE TOP?
WELL, I REALLY LIKED WHEN HE SAID HELPED TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER. I LOVE THE WOMAN STAR.
Stephen: STRONG ARGUMENT. YOU WEREN'T SWAYED BY SECRETARY CLINTON'S MOMENT WHEN SHE SAID SHE NOT ONLY PREPARED FOR DEBATING BUT FOR BEING PRESIDENT?
THAT WAS GOOD. OKAY, I'M VOTING FOR HILLARY.
Stephen: JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. SO HER MISSING E-MAILS ARE OF NO CONCERN FOR YOU?
FORGOT ABOUT THAT ONE. OKAY, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Stephen: CAN I HOLD YOU TO THAT? YOU'RE DEFINITELY VOTING FOR --
JUST REMEMBERED TRUMP UNIVERSITY. NEVER MIND. I'M FOR HER, STRONGER TOGETHER.
Stephen: YOU CLEARLY HAVEN'T PUT ENOUGH THOUGHT INTO . THIS DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BY ELECTION DAY?
DON'T -- COUNT ON IT.
Stephen: WELL, THERE ARE TWO MORE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. DO WE THINK THOSE ARE GOING TO HELP?
OUTLOOK NOT SO GOOD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES IS THIS WILL THOSE MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU?
REP -- REPLY HAZY, TRY AGAIN LATER.
Stephen: MR. HANSEN, ARE YOU ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS USING A MAGIC 8 BALL?
ALL SIGNS POINT TO YES.
Stephen: WHILE YOU REALLY, REALLY CAN'T DECIDE ANYTHING, CAN YOU?
I KNOW, STEPHEN! I FEEL SO LOST! I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND I TOLD MYSELF, TODAY I'M GOING TO DECIDE. THE NEXT THING I KNOW I'M NAKED IN A ROCK QUARRY SWALING "EMAIL SERVER" AND TAX RETURNS "IN THE DUST WITH MY TEARS!
Stephen: OKAY, CALM DOWN. I'M GOING TO HELP YOU. GO ON INSTINCT. YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW, GUN TO YOUR HEAD, TRUMP OR CLINTON? (SILENCE)
Stephen: MR. HENSON -- MR. HENSON, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
OH, I'M SORRY. I WAS IMAGINING A GUN TO MY HEAD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: UNDECIDED VOTER CHARLES HENSON, EVERYBODY! BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROB LOWE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK TO THE LIVE SHOW, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS BEEN A POLITICALLY ACTIVE DREAMBOAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN REMEMBER AND HE STILL LOOKS YOUNGER THAN YOU. PLEASE WELCOME ROB LOWE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YA! THAT WAS FUN. THAT VOTER WAS AN IDIOT, THOUGH.
Stephen: THAT GUY? HE WAS AN IDIOT.
Stephen: WHAT A TOOL. UNBELIEVABLE. I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HERE BUT I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU.
OKAY.
Stephen: BECAUSE THIS WHOLE DAMN THING MIGHT BE YOUR FAULT.
WHAT DID I DO?
Stephen: YOU'RE VERY INFLUENTIAL. YOU REALIZE THAT, RIGHT? BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU POINT THAT FACE. THIS IS IT. BECAUSE WE HAVE FOOTAGE THAT PROVES YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOMENT SINCE 2011. READY?
WHY DO YOU LIKE DONALD? I THINK DONALD SHOULD RUN. I WISH HE'D RECONSIDER, THERE'S STILL TIME. IF PALIN'S THINKING ABOUT GETTING IN, THERE'S STILL TIME FOR YOU TO RECONSIDER. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT. I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU IN A DEBATE. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE YOU KEEP PEOPLE HONEST IN A DEBATE. WILL YOU RECONSIDER?
I WILL SAY THIS, I WATCH THOSE DEBATES AND THEY ARE ON THE BORING SIDE, AREN'T THEY?
Stephen: YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANT.
ALL I HAVE TO SAY, STEPHEN, IS MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
Stephen: ARE YOU RAWNGS MOLE BY ANY CHANCE?
I AM FROM THE KGB TO RUIN THE COUNTRY!
Stephen: YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK LIKE YOUR EVIL TWIN TONIGHT WITH THAT HAIR ON YOUR FACE. THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
I TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND?
AFTER THAT, I'M GOING WITH THE CANDIDATE THAT'S THE MOSTLY DRATTED. DONALD DRANK SO MUCH WATER THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR HIS HEALTH.
Stephen: MAYBE HE ATE A LOT OF BEEF JERKY BEFORE THE DEBATE. WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO GET ROB LOWE'S VOTE? YOU HAVE BEEN POLITICALLY ACTIVE. YOU CAMPAIGNED FOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.
I CAMPAIGNED FOR BOTH SIDES TO HAVE THE AISLE. I CAN ALWAYS PICK A WINNER.
Stephen: WOW! I HAVE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF IT. HERE'S THE THING, MY NEW SHOW "CODE BLACK" IS COMING OUT. I WANT EVERY VOTER TO WATCH, NO MATTER HOW STUPID.
Stephen: NO MATTER HOW STUPID --
THE VOTERS ARE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY WHICH SIDE YOU'RE ON.
WHEN THE RATINGS COME IN, I WILL TELL YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: YOU'VE MET BOTH THESE PEOPLE, TRUMP AND MRS. CLINTON.
I HAVE. MRS. CLINTON IS ONE OF THOSE POLITICIANS THAT IN ROOMS OF SMALL PEOPLE SHE'S REALLY FUNNY, SHE TOTALLY GETS IT. THEN SOMETIMES SHE CAN BE OUT IN PUBLIC AND COME ACROSS AS STIFF AND MAYBE WHATEVER, BUT SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN REALLY SWEET AND FUNNY, AND PRESIDENT CLINTON WROTE ME A NICE NOTE ABOUT MY BOOK COMPLETELY OUT TO HAVE THE BLUE. THAT'S HOW GOOD THEY ARE. THEY WANT THAT ONE LAST VOTE IN CALIFORNIA.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE PHONE BUDDIES.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM? HAVE YOU SPENT ANY TIME WITH HIM?
I HAVEN'T.
Stephen: HAS HE WRITTEN YOU A NICE NOTE?
NO, BUT HE DONATED TO THE CHARITY I WAS ON THE SHOW PROMOTING, HABITAT FOR HUMANITY, AND HE OUT OF THE BLUE DONATED 5-GRAND TO US. SO THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.
Stephen: SO ROB REASON CAN BE BOUGHT.
NO QUESTION. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU'RE VERY LIKABLE. PEOPLE LIKE ROB LOWE, RIGHT? ( CHEERING ) HELL, HILLARY CLINTON'S LIKABILITY NUMBERS ARE LOW. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR HER? ANYTHING?
MY FAVORITE HILLARY THING IS THE MOVE SHE DOES, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, SHE DOES IT EVERY PUBLIC APPEARANCE. WHEN SHE WALKS OUT, SHE WAITS AND THEN SHE GIVES THE LOOK OF, OH, MY GOSH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE! POINT.
Stephen: CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THAT?
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE -- SHE DID IT AT THE DEBATE! IF SHE GOES TO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE, IT'S GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING.
Stephen: SHE JUST HAS TO POINT AT EVERY PERSON IN AMERICA.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Stephen: NOW, YOU NOT ONLY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF POLITICIANS BUT YOU'VE PLAYED A POLITICIAN IN THE ADAPTATION OF BILL O'REILLY'S WORK.
I PLAYED J.F.K.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PLAY TRUMP? WOULD THAT BE AN APPEALING ROLE?
WHEN I TRY MY TRUMP OUT, IT COMES ACROSS AS MY OLD MANAGER BERNIE BURLSTEIN. HE DOES THIS WITH THE HANDS.
Stephen: HE ALWAYS DHUZ. I'VE GOT THE HANDS --
Stephen: MY FAVORITE THING -- LET ME SEE THE SIZE OF YOUR HANDS.
WELL, THEY'RE SMALL ENOUGH, SAD TO SAY. MY FAVORITE MOVE OF TRUMP'S IS WHEN HE'S ON THE TELEPROMPTER, POLICY, POLICY, VERY DETAILED, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE, IT'S SO TRUE, WE ALL KNOW IT IS. IT'S SO TRUE AND ANYBODY KNOWS. AND WE KNOW IT IS. POLICY, POLICY, POLICY -- I LOVE THAT WHEN YOU GET TO SEE THE READING AND THE RIFFING.
Stephen: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT POLITICS IN ANY SERIOUS WAY IN.
YEAH, THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD EVER CONSIDER DOING IS WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID. HE WAS AN ACTOR AND RAN GORE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD PRESIDENT AND GOVERNOR AND THEN PRESIDENT. SO SCREEN ACTORS GUILD PRESIDENT I WOULD RUN FOR ONLY BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY OFFICE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT MY PLATFORM WOULD BE AND IT WOULD BE ALL ACTORS GET TO BREAK FOR LUNCH ONE HOUR EARLIER ON THE SET.
Stephen: THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR RESIDUALS AND MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND STREAMING AND THE INTERNET, I JUST WANT TO EAT QUICKER EVERY DAY.
Stephen: OKAY. AND BY THE WAY, IT WOULD CRUSH ANYBODY. SO BRING IT. YOU AND I, SCREEN ACTORS GUILD.
Stephen: I HAVE NO INTEREST IN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE TRIED TO RUN FOR OFFICE. I TRIED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT TWICE. THEY SAID, GO AWAY, YOU SMELL BAD. ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO, I HAD HILLARY CLINTON ON THE SHOW A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK AND WE HAVE ANOTHER CLIP HERE. IN APRIL, SHE AND I SHED SOME LIGHT ON SOME OF THE SMALLEST ISSUES FACING AMERICA, AND YOU CAME UP IN ONE OF THE ISSUES SHE RAISED. JIM?
AND ALL AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. IDEALLY, WHATEVER ROB LOWE IS GETTING. THAT GUY LOOKS AMAZING.
Stephen: DOESN'T HE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SHE'S GOT MY VOTE! THAT'S IT! IT'S OVER!
Stephen: YOU DID NOT COME HERE AS A PLUG FOR THIS, BUT WE FOUND THIS, YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED PROFILE MEN'S PERFORMANCE GROOMING.
YOU LAUGH NOW. PUT IT ON AND YOU WILL LOOK LIKE ME.
Stephen: I MIGHT LAUGH LATER, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) RECHARGE, AGE COMBATING SERUM.
THAT'S THE UNDEREYE SERUM.
Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THIS? IT DOESN'T GO IN YOUR MOUTH! ( LAUGHTER ) IT GOES UNDER YOUR EYES FOR DARK CIRCLES AND BAGS -- NOT THAT YOU HAVE ANY!
Stephen: I'VE GOT TO SAY, TASTES PRETTY GOOD. DO YOU ACTUALLY USE THAT STUFF?
I DO. I DESIGNED THIS LINE. IT TOOK ME EIGHT YEARS TO DO IT.
Stephen: THAT'S A SLOW WORKER.
DO YOU THINK I'M A NATURAL CHEMIST? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: EIGHT YEARS? WHAT DID YOU EXPERIMENT ON, SLOTHS?
IT HAD TO BE PERFECT.
Stephen: I REGRET EATING THAT.
YOUR TONGUE LOOKS SO YOUNG!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR PEOPLE SAYING THIS GUY NEVER AGES. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AGING AT ALL?
MY INSIDES ARE 150.
Stephen: A LITTLE ROUGH LIVING?
SOME ROUGH LIVING BUT -- NO, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH GOOD GENETICS AND I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. NOT TO GET TOO SERIOUS, BUT BEING YOUNG IS MORE ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE ON LIFE AND I THINK THAT MAKES YOU LOOK AND FEEL YOUNG SNORE ALSO NOT BEING OLD HELPS.
IT'S A MATH THING.
Stephen: IT'S A MATH THING. WHATEVER YOU ARE IN YEARS, THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
Stephen: A FIRM GRASP OF THE OBVIOUS, ROB LOWE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SHOW "CODE BLACK" IS NOT NEW, BUT YOU'RE ADDING. YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN AS A FORMER SPECIAL OPS GUY?
I'M BASED ON REAL ARMY TRAUMA SURGEONS WHO ARE BRINGING EVERYTHING WE'VE LEARNED ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN TERMS OF TRAUMA, WHICH IS WHERE ALL THE CUTTING AGE MEDICINE IS NOW, I'M BRINGING THAT INTO A LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL.
Stephen: HOW LONG SINCE YOU'VE DONE TV?
IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE SECONDS.
Stephen: DID THEY LITERALLY JUST GRAB YOU OFF ONE SET AND PUT YOU ON ANOTHER AND CHANGED YOUR CLOTHES AND DIED YOUR HAIR?
WHEN I'M A FREE AGENT, I'M NOT ON THE MARKET LOCK AND I LOVE IT. I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT. IT'S A GREAT SHOW AND I'M HAPPY TO BE ON IT. IT'S A HARD-HITTING REALLY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA AND A NICE CHANGE FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DOING COMEDY FOR SO MANY YEARS.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR DOING COMEDY WITH US.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ROB LOWE! THANKS FOR BEING ON THE LIVE SHOW! "CODE BLACK" SEASON 2 PREMIERES THIS WEDNESDAY! BACK WITH KAL PENN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST ROSE TO FAME IN A HARLTON KUMAR MOVIE AND IS NOW IN "SURVIVOR." PLEASE WELCOME KAL PENN! ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: FINE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE FOR THE LIVE SHOW.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON THE LIVE SHOW. THAT'S EXCITING.
Stephen: WE NEVER REALLY TALKED BEFORE.
CORRECT.
Stephen: I RAN INTO YOU AT THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY. THAT WAS NICE.
YES. AND BEFORE THAT I RAN INTO YOU FOR A NEIL PATRICK ON BROADWAY. YOU CAME IN BACKSTAGE AND HAD A CARD. YOU SAID TELL ME IF THIS IS FUNNY, IS THIS FUNNY? I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT I WAS SOMEBODY ELSE. I THOUGHT, STEPHEN STEPHEN IS NOT ASKING ME WHAT'S FUNNY.
Stephen: HAROLD AND CAN YOU AND KUMAR IS FUNNY. WAS THAT THING FUNNY?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
Stephen: I DON'T CARE. LEADING INTO THE DEBATE, BE WERE YOU NERVOUS BEFORE THE DEBATE STARTED?
I WOULDN'T SAY I WAS NERVOUS. I WAS CURIOUS.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT A GUY WHO WAS REALLY NERVOUS WOULD SAY AFTER HE CALLS DOWN.
OF COURSE I WAS NERVOUS. I THINK I WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT EITHER OF THEM ARE GOING TO SAY, PARTICULARLY TRUMP, RIGHT, AND I WANTED TO GIVE HIM A SHOT.
Stephen: DID YOU? I DID! I'LL TELL YOU, WHY I HAVE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO ESPOUSE VERY CONSERVATIVE --
Stephen: SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE REPUBLICANS.
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT. BUT I HEARD HIM -- I COULDN'T TELL WHETHER HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A TAX ON SOMETHING SOMETIMES OR IF HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ATTACKS LIKE ON I.S.I.S. AND THEN I REALIZED HE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN FOR EITHER SO IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER. AND THEN THAT'S WHEN I WAS JUST SORT OF WATCHING.
Stephen: YOU WORKED FOR THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE.
DID. SO I'M A LITTLE BIASED.
Stephen: YOU'RE A LITTLE MORE THAN A LITTLE BIASED HERE. WAS THERE ANYTHING HE SAID THAT COULD HAVE SWAYED KAL PENN?
I DON'T THINK SO. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CUTTING FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND TALK ABOUT DEPORTING GUYS LIKE HAROLD AND KUMAR, I JUST CAN'T GET BEHIND YOU ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I THINK HAROLD'S OKAY WITH HIM, HATE TO TELL YOU. I THINK KUMAR IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM.
THAT'S FIRE.
Stephen: I LEGALLY HAVE TO ASK YOU, ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW?
I AM NOT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: NOW, AS I SAID BEFORE, WE'RE GOING TO CHECK LATER --
SURE. IS THAT WHAT THE PEE TEST WAS FOR?
Stephen: YEAH. YOU KNOW YOU'RE SWORN IN. IF YOU LIE ON A LATE NIGHT SHOW IT'S PLAGIARISM AND IT'S LIVE,   TOO. YOU DID WORK AT THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE. WHICH IS REALLY FASCINATING. YOU WERE ALREADY A WORKING ACTOR AND YOU SAID I WANT TO STOP AND GO DO SOMETHING IN PUBLIC SERVICE. WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS SERVE OVERCASE SEAS IN IRAQ AND BUDDIES WHO COULDN'T AFFORD COLLEGE. SO LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, TO BE FAIR, TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WORK AS A VOLUNTEER ON A CAMPAIGN OR SERVE YOUR COUNTRY. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DO THIS FOR A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT'S AMAZING.
Stephen: IS IT AS SEXY AS IT SOUNDS? I WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- DO YOU USE THAT AS A PICKUP LINE?
IT'S A VERY SMALL PLACE AND YOU SHARE AN OFFICE WITH FIVE OR SIX INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN THIS TINY ROOM, ROOM AFTER ROOM, AND IT WAS AWESOME. YOU'RE VERY HUMBLED WALKING IN THERE EVERY DAY.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU SERVED AS ASSISTANT --
ASSOCIATE.
Stephen: -- ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT.
YES.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE A FANCY NAME FOR PARTY PLANNER.
I WISH.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT?
THERE ARE SEVERAL. IT USED TO BE CALLED THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC LIAISON UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, BASICALLY AN OUTREACH OFFICE. I HEADED UP OUTREACH TO YOUNG PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE. PRESIDENT WAS BIG ON MAKING SURE YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HE'S WORKING ON, WHETHER DON'T ASK DON'T TELL, PEL GRANTS, WHATEVER, AND I PUT MEETINGS TOGETHER AND BROUGHT PEOPLE TO THE TABLE.
Stephen: DID YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT.
YOU WOULD SEE HIM IN THE HALLWAY. I REMEMBER THERE WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER I WAS WORKING ON WHICH IS A PIECE OF PAPER BASICALLY HE HAS TO SIGN.
Stephen: YOU WROTE UP AN EXECUTIVE ORDER?
I'M NOWHERE NEAR SMART ENOUGH FOR THAT. AGENCIES ARE PUT TOGETHER TO SEND THIS THING THROUGH A HUGE PROCESS, BUT I WAS THE IDIOT WHO HAD TO BRIEF HIM BEFORE HE SIGNED IT? SAYING, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SIGN.
HE KNOWS BUT YOU BRIEF HIM. THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE, IT'S NERVE RACKING AND I'M THINKING I'M IS SON OF IMMIGRANTS, MY GRANDPARENTS WORKED WITH GANDHI, IT'S INCREDIBLE I HAVE A COUPLE OF YEARS TO DO. THIS YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT BEFORE, PEOPLE AROUND THE HALLWAY, I DIDN'T HAVE MEETINGS, FOCUSED ON THIS ONE THING, DIDN'T SHAVE FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE I SHAVE, GET A HAIRCUT, GET MY SUIT PRESSED AND WALKED IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHEN IT'S TIME TO BRIEF THE PRESIDENT AND I SAT ONE THING IN AND THE FIRST THING HE SAYS -- I'M THINKING I'M EXCITED TO TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- I TOOK ONE FOOT INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE AND HE SAID, HEY, LOOK WHO DECIDED TO SHAVE TODAY! ( APPLAUSE ) AND I WAS, LIKE, MAN!
Stephen: THAT'S VERY HUMBLING!
ABSOLUTELY! AND, OF COURSE, I CAN'T TELL MY MOM THIS STORY. SHE WOULD BE HORRIFIED.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YES.
Stephen: DESIGNATED SURVIVOR AIRS WEDNESDAY NIGHT ON ABC. KAL PENN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪

THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU, GUYS! AWESOME! I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE ON YOUR LIVE SHOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NICE. THIS IS GREAT. MY NAME IS EMMA WILLMANN, AND IF I SAY IT TOO FAST IT SOUNDS LIKE I SAID I'M A WOMAN. ( LAUGHTER ) SO SOMETIMES I'LL MEET PEOPLE AND THEY WILL BE, LIKE, YEAH, THAT'S COOL, I WAS PRETTY SURE. ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD TO MEET YOU. I GET SO FRUSTRATED WHEN PEOPLE THINK I'M TRYING TO LOOK LIKE ELLEN DEGENERES. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I'M TRYING SO HARD TO LOOK LIKE NICK CARTER, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NICK! I'M FROM A TINY TOWN ORIGINALLY. I GREW UP IN A TOWN OF 800 PEOPLE. WE WOULD HAVE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES THAT WOULD READ LIKE THIS -- THE THIEF HAS BEEN ARRESTED -- IT WAS RICK! ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ALWAYS RICK, EVERY TIME. THAT'S THE THIEF, RICK. WE HAD A GAY PRIDE ONCE IN MY TOWN AND IT WAS ONE PERSON SKIPPING DOWN MAIN STREET, THAT WAS IT. ONE PERSON SKIPPING AND EVERYONE WAS, LIKE, GO, STEVE, GO! ( LAUGHTER ) AND THEN A PROTESTER SHOWED UP JUST WALKING AFTER HIM, AND WE'RE GOING, STEVE, SKIP FASTER, GO, GO, GO! THE PROTESTER WAS YELLING AT HIM, LIKE, SCOP STOP SKIPPING! AND THE PROTESTER WAS HIS FATHER! ( LAUGHTER ) I USED TO GO BACK AND FORTH WHEN I WOULD COME OUT OF CLOSET IN MY STANDUP, BUT NOW I DO IT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYONE SITTING AND WONDERING IF I'M AN AWKWARD LOOKING STRAIGHT GIRL, YOU KNOW. THINK HOW WEIRD IT WOULD GET IN HERE IF I WAS, LIKE, GUYS, I'M HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MEN. YEAH. YOU WOULD BE, LIKE, SURE, I WOULD HOPE SO, ACTUALLY, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I HATE THAT STEREOTYPE THAT LESBIANS ARE MEAN TO MEN. DO YOU THINK LESBIANS ARE MEAN TO MEN? HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO A STRAIGHT MARRIED WOMAN OVER 45? MEAN TO MEN? GIVE HER SOME WHITE ZINFANDEL, SHE'LL COMMIT A HATE CRIME, SHE DOESN'T CARE. SHE IS PISSED! GET HER ALL SAUCET UP AND SHE'S GOING IN! SHE'S, LIKE, HE'S A TYPICAL MAN, A MORE RON WHO CAN'T COMMUNE CAIRKTS DOESN'T PULL HIS WEIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE. YOU'RE GOING, OKAY, LADY, WELL, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR SON AND HE'S A TODDLER, SO SCALE IT BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP NOW BUT I WAS SINGLE FOR A LONG TIME, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF MY SCHEDULE AND MY PERSONALITY, WHATEVER, WHATEVER. ( LAUGHTER ) I JUST GET SO CONFUSED. I'M ALWAYS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE I'M DYSLEXIC. WHICH MEANS I CONFUSE LEFT AND RIGHT, AND RIGHT AND WRONG, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I ALWAYS TRY TO BLAME THINGS ON MY DYSLEXIA CONSTANTLY. I'M, LIKE, I DIDN'T KNOW I'M DYSLEXIC! I'M AN IDIOT, I DIDN'T KNOW! I GET SO CONFUSED WITH DYSLEXIA! DO I PAY IN THE STORE, OUT OF THE STORE? WHAT DO I DO? ( LAUGHTER ) ONE TIME BEING DYSLEXIC WAS AMAZING. I GOT STOPPED AT A ASSOCIATE CHECKPOINT, JUST A RANDOM STOP, AND I GOT NERVOUS, AND THEN THE COP GOES, TO PROVE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING, I WANT YOU TO DO THE ALPHABET BACKWARDS -- OOH! I'M SUPER DYSLEXIC. I'M, LIKE, NO PROBLEM, BUDDY, THAT'S HOW I WAS GOING TO   DO IT, ANYWAY.  THIS IS GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) MY MOM WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT. SHE CALLS ME UP, LEAVES ME THIS LITTLE VOICE MESSAGE, BUT I NOTICE EVERY TIME SHE LEAVES ME A VOICE MESSAGE, EVERY TIME, SHE IDENTIFIES HERSELF. EVERY MESSAGE. LIKE, I WOULD GET A MESSAGE FROM MY OWN MOTHER AND BE, LIKE, WHO IS THIS? EVERY MESSAGE STARTS, HEY, IT'S YOUR MOTHER. IT'S YOUR MOTHER! LIKE ANYONE ELSE CALLING ME UP SAYING, HEY, JUST LOOKING AT YOU IN THE PICTURES WHEN YOU WERE A BABY. YOU WERE VERY CUTE. CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY. YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS. IT'S RODRIGUEZO YOUR LANDLORD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
