IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES RICKY GERVAIS. CHRISTINA RICCI. AND MUSICAL GUEST JAIN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: HEY! HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU. HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY, EVERYBODY.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. I WANT TO THANK OUR FRIEND JAMES CORDEN FOR STOPPING BY. HE'LL BE HOSTING THE GRAMMYS A WEEK FROM THIS SUNDAY. ONLY CBS. ONLY CBS? ONTO CBS. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THAT. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAPPY BLACK HISTORY MONTH, EVERYBODY! JON.
Jon: HAPPEN BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
Stephen: LOUIS. ( APPLAUSE ) ( JON LAUGHING )
Stephen: TODAY, BLACK HISTORY MONTHED THE STAY WAY ALL SHOULD-- WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT BEYONCE IS PREGNANT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE DROPPED THE KNOWLEDGE TODAY WITH THIS PHOTO ON INSTAGRAM, SHOWING US HER BABY BUMP AT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A VERY OPEN-MINDED SEARS PORTRAIT STUDIO. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY KICK ME OUT FOR WEARING A THONG, BUT SHE GETS TO DO THAT. AND IF YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT, FOLKS, HOLD ON TO YOUR LEMONADE, BECAUSE QUEEN BEY SAYS, "WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED TWO TIMES OVER." THAT MEANS TWINS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ♪ ALL THE DOUBLE BABIES! ALL THE DOUBLE BABIES! ♪ ♪ PUT YOUR HANDS UP ♪ I THINK I HAVE FULLER HIMSELF THAN BEYONCE, THOUGH. THIS MORNING, THE START OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH WAS ALSO MARKED BY ANOTHER PROMINENT PERSON OF COLOR, DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) HE HAS COLOR. HE HAS COLOR. YEAH.
Jon: MULTICOLOR.
Stephen: MULTICOLORS, EXACTLY. HE'S A RAINBOW COALITION FROM THE NECK UP. TODAY, TRUMP HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO HONOR AFRICAN AMERICAN LUMINARIES LIKE THE TWO BLACK PEOPLE HE KNOWS, BEN CARSON AND OMAROSA. AND TRUMP IMMEDIATELY SENT A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. RIGHT... THERE. SEE? THERE IT IS.
Jon: OH! OH!
Stephen: NO, WHY ARE YOU BOOING? WHY ARE YOU BOOING? TRUMP JUST THINKS BLACK PEOPLE ARE NUMBER ONE. HE JUST-- STRONG MESSAGE. AND HE IMMEDIATELY RIGHT OFF THE BEAM CONCERNED A MAJOR CONCERN OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY-- HIMSELF.
A LOT OF THE MEDIA IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITION PARTY. THEY ARE SO BIASED AND, REALLY, IT'S A DISGRACE. I DON'T WATCH CNN. I DON'T LIKE WATCHING FAKE NEWS. BUT FOX HAS TREATED ME VERY NICE. WHEREVER FOX IS, THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHAT BETTER WAY TO CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH THAN TO HAVE AFRICAN AMERICANS LISTEN TO A RICH WHITE GUY COMPLAIN THAT THE WORLD IS UNFAIR TO HIM? ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, TRUMP ALSO TOOK A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE LEGACY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING.
YOU READ ALL ABOUT DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING A WEEK AGO WHEN SOMEBODY SAID I TOOK THE STATUE OUT OF MY OFFICE, AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THAT WAS FAKE NEWS FROM THESE PEOPLE. FAKE NEWS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YES, FAKE NEWS. TRUMP DIDN'T TAKE THAT STATUE FROM HIS OFFICE. IT TRIED TO ESCAPE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT TRUMP'S DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRUGGLE DOESN'T STOP AT MARTIN LUTHER KING.
FREDERICK DOUGLASS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED MORE AND MORE, I NOTICE.
Stephen: YEAH, I NOTICED THAT, TOO, YEAH. HEARING A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS FRED DOUGLASS GUY. YOU KNOW FRED DOUGLASS, JON. ISLY A RAPPER.
Jon: NO.
Stephen: HE'S NOT THE FRED PRINCE OF BEL AIR.
Jon: DIFFERENT GUY.
Stephen: TRUMP CONTINUED TO TALK.
HARRIET TUBMAN, ROSA PARKS AND MILLIONS MORE BLACK AMERICANS WHO MADE AMERICA WHAT IT IS TODAY.
Stephen: HE'S JUST NAMING BLACK PEOPLE HE'S HEARD OF AT THIS POINT. "AH, HARRIET TUBMAN, ROSA PARKS, FAT ALBERT, THE PINE SOL COMMERCIAL LADY, ROBERT DOWNEY JR. IN 'TROPIC THUNDER.'" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU." OF COURSE, THE NEWS TRUMP REALLY WANTS US TALKING ABOUT IS LAST NIGHT'S PREMIERE OF "SO YOU THINK YOU CAN SCOTUS?" WHERE IN A RARE LIVE BROADCAST FROM THE EAST ROOM, TRUMP REVEALED THAT HIS CHOICE FOR THE SUPREME COURT FEDERAL JUDGE AND DAD FROM A WALMART PHOTO FRAME, NEIL GORSUCH.
TODAY, I AM KEEPING ANOTHER PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY NOMINATING JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, TO BE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
Stephen: DID I-- DID HE-- DID HE SAY HE WAS ALREADY "OF" THE SUPREME COURT? DID GORSUCH, LIKE, GROW UP THERE LIKE A FERAL CHILD OR SOMETHING, HIDING UNDER ALITO'S ROBES AND SURVIVING ON WHATEVER CRUMBS FALL OUT OF RUTH BADER GINSBERG'S NECK RUFFLE? I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. AND THEN IT WAS TIME FOR AMERICA TO MEET JUDGE GORSUCH.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK JUDGE GORSUCH AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE, LOUISE, TO PLEASE STEP FORWARD, PLEASE LOUISE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: "PLEASE, LOUISE. ♪ PULL ME OFF OF MY KNEES. JACK, GET BACK. ♪ COME ON BEFORE WE CRACK. LOSE YOUR BLUES. ♪ EVERYBODY CUT, EVERYBODY CUT, FOOTLOOSE ♪ LOOSE, LOOSE, LOOSE ♪ THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S THE OTHER ONE. THAT'S THE OTHER ONE. THAT'S THE FLASH DANCE. LET'S NOT MIX THESE UP. NOW, I'M NOT SURE-- THIS IS TRUMP'S FIRST CHOICE, OBVIOUSLY. THE GUY IS VERY HONORED TO BE THERE, TO BE THE NEXT JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW GREAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS. LOOK HOW TRUMP SHAKES HIS HANDS, ONE, TWO, AND YANK HER OUT! LIKE HE'S STARTING A LAWNMOWER. CAN WE PLAY THAT ONE MORE TIME? CAN WE GO BACK? YOU CAN TELL WHAT'S GOING ON. GORSUCH IS LIKE, "YOU NOMINATED ME, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT CLOSE IN THE PHOTO." AND TRUMP IS LIKE, "GIVE DADDY SOME SUGAR, AGO. I KNOW IT'S AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL BRANCH, BUT I'M GOING TO RIP THE BRANCH OFF." THAT WAS HIS ARM. THAT WAS HIS ARM I WAS PULLING OVER THERE. NOW, SINCE IT WAS A REALITY SHOW, THE ROBE CEREMONY HAD TO HAVE A RUNNER-UP. THAT WAS JUDGE THOMAS HARDIMAN. HARDIMAN DIDN'T GET THE JOB, CAME VERY CLOSE. HARDIMAN'S A FORMER TAXI DRIVER, WHICH IS WHY ALL OF HIS DECISIONS START WITH "OKAY IF WE TAKE THE TUNNEL?" NOW, HERE'S MY FAVORITE PART: APPARENTLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION "ASKED HARDIMAN TO COME TO WASHINGTON TO BUILD SUSPENSE." AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU ALREADY HAVE US ON THE EDGE OF OUR SEAT, SIR. PLEASE. I DON'T THINK WE CAN TAKE ANY MORE THRILLS. NOW, TRUMP PLAYED THE SUSPENSE PERFECTLY. CNN EVEN BROADCAST FOOTAGE OF HARDIMAN GETTING GAS ON THE WAY TO D.C. IT WAS SUCH DRAMATIC FOOTAGE, THAT CNN HAD TO CUT AWAY FROM THEIR LIVE COVERAGE OF PAINT DRYING. DRYING. ( LAUGHTER ) APPARENTLY, HARDIMAN WAS WILLING TO PLAY ALONG WITH THE RUSE BECAUSE HE WAS GIVEN A SENSE THAT THERE COULD BE A SPOT FOR HIM SHOULD ANOTHER VACANCY OPEN UP. THAT'S RIGHT. HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE RUNNER-UP NOMINEE, BUT THAT JUST MEANS HE IS GOING TO BE NEXT SEASON'S THE NOMINETTE. NOW, REPUBLICANS ARE READY TO CONFIRM GORSUCH RIGHT AWAY. THEY'RE READY TO GO. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL ACTUALLY SAID, "I HOPE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WILL AGAIN SHOW HIM FAIR CONSIDERATION WITH AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE ON HIS NOMINATION, JUST LIKE THE SENATE TREATED THE FOUR FIRST-TERM NOMINEES OF PRESIDENTS CLINTON AND OBAMA." I FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TO OBAMA'S SECOND-TERM NOMINEE. YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT KNOW? THE ASSISTANT MANAGER OF MY LOCAL APPLEBEE'S, MERRICK GARLAND. HE JUST HELPED ME MAKE A BIG DECISION IN THE CASE OF "JALAPENO POPPERS V. LOADED POTATO SKINS." IT IS SO ORDERED. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S HOW THEY SIGN JUDGMENTS IN WANT SUPREME COURT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY JOKE IF YOU USED THAT TO ORDER FOOD AT AN APPLEBEE'S. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS-- THIS PART OF THE-- NO? NO-- THIS IS THE PART OF THE MONOLOGUE THAT EDITING IS FOR RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ NOW, I'M NOT SURE THAT GORSUCH IS THE WORST NOMINEE TRUMP COULD HAVE CHOSEN. I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE PICKED HIMSELF. THAT'S A DISTURBING IDEA, I REALIZE. BUT SPEAKING OF DISTURBING IDEA, IT TURNS OUT THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW IS NOW GOING TO INCLUDE CATS. THIS IS MASS MADNESS. YOU MANIAC. DOGS AND CATS ARE COMPLETE OPPOSITES. THEY'LL BE FIGHTING LIKE SOME THINGS THAT FIGHT A LOT. SOME METAPHOR-- THUNDER AND LIGHTNING, WHAT FIGHTS A LOT. PEANUT BUTTER.
Jon: THAT'S GOOD.
Stephen: LOOK, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD-- CAT PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WHO KNOW DOG SHOWS ARE FOR DOGS. YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS HOW TRUMP GOT ELECTED, RIGHT? WE CAN'T CHANGE THE CULTURE THIS FAST. NOW, THE CATS WILL BE PART OF A "MEET THE BREEDS" EVENT. WHICH I ASSUME IS WHERE CHUCK TODD INTERVIEWS A PERSIAN LONGHAIR ABOUT TRADE POLICY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I DON'T-- CAT PLAYS WITH HIM LIKE A MOUSE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS HAPPENING. HOW ARE DOG JUDGES GOING TO EVEN EVALUATE CATS? LUCKILY, DON'T HAVE TO GUESS BECAUSE WE HERE AT THE "LATE SHOW" CAN OBTAINED SOME EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE.
THIS IS TRIXIE, A SIAMESE SHORTHAIRED MIX.
LOOK AT HER FORM AS SHE LICKS HER BUTT HOLE. AMAZING.
SO COOL.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. RICKY GERVAIS IS HERE! SO STICK AROUND.
Stephen: JON BATISTE ASK STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND OVER THERE! JON. CAN I-- MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: TO YOU LIKE ICE CREAM?
Jon: I LOVE ICE CREAM. I TEAT ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: I DO, TOO. NOT AS MUCH AS I LIKE TO, BECAUSE THESE SUITS ARE PRETTY CLOSE CUT. YOU KNOW I HAVE MY OWN ICE CREAM.
Jon: I DO, AMERICONE DREAM.
Stephen: ALL THE MONEY I GET FROM AMERICONE DREAM, GOES TO CHARITY. SO PLEASE DO-- ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: I'M SAYING I'M A REALLY GREAT PERSON IS WHAT I'M SAYING. BUT THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS I'M VERY PROUD TO ANNOUNCE TODAY BEN&JERRY'S-- WE GOT THE PINTS, YOU CAN GET AMERICONE DREAMS IN THE SCOOP SHOPS BUT BEN&JERRYS HAVE COME OUT WHAT ARE CALLED PINT SLICES, OKAY. THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME. THIS IS LIKE-- EACH ONE OF THESE IS LIKE YOU SLICED A PINT OF AMERICONE DREAM, AND YOU DIPPED IT IN CHOCOLATE, OKAY. ONE OF THESE BAD BOYS. DO YOU WANT ONE?
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT ONE OF THESE THINGS?
Jon: LET ME GET THAT.
Stephen: ANYBODY OUT HERE? ANYBODY WANT ONE OF THESE? ANYBODY UP THERE? THERE YOU GO!  ( CHEERS ) I-- I-- I NEVER SAID I WAS A BASEBALL PLAYER. I SAID I'M THE HOST OF A TV SHOW. ANYWAY, WHAT I JUST WANT TO SAY, AND I WANT TO SAABSOLUTE BEN&JERRY'S FOR THIS, I BELIEVE FEBRUARY 1 IS THE PERFECT TIME TO RELEASE A NEW ICE CREAM.
Jon: PERFECT TIME, ICE CREAM ALL YEAR ROUND, MAN.
Stephen: ANYBODY CAN EAT ICE CREAM IN THE SUMMERTIME, OKAY. THAT'S FOR THE WEEK. TRUE ICE CREAM LOVERS EAT IT ALL THE TIME.
Jon: ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: BECAUSE GUESS WHAT?
Jon: I'M WITH IT. I'M WITH IT. I'M WITH IT.
Stephen: BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? I HAVE FEELINGS ALL YEAR ROUND.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I'M EATING MY FEELINGS WHEN I EAT THE ICE CREAM. I'M EATING THE 59 RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GOT TO. GO GET YOUR THINGS OR YOU HATE CHILDREN. ALL FOR CHARITY. WHERE ARE WE? IN HERE? RIGHT HERE? MY FIRST GUEST IS THE CREATOR AND STAR OF "THE OFFICE" AND "EXTRAS." HE NOW STARS IN "DAVID BRENT: LIFE ON THE ROAD."
EXCUSE ME, CAN I HAVE THE BILL PLEASE?
SHOULD I FUT ON YOUR ROOM.
ROOMS, WE'RE NOT-- SEPARATE ROOMS.
SO YOU WANT SEPARATE BILLS?
NO, NO, NO, PUT IT ON MY ROOM, 106, BUT, NO, THAT WE'RE NOT-- I WOULDN'T-- NOT WITH HIM. AND NOT BECAUSE HE'S A BLACK MAN. BECAUSE HE'S A MAN. I'D DO IT WITH A BLACK WOMAN, FOR EXAMPLE-- NOT YOU. OH, YES, YOU. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU WERE CONSENTING. AND ABOVE LEGAL AGE, WHICH YOU, OBVIOUSLY, ARE-- NOT OBVIOUSLY.

HELLO.
Stephen: HELLO.
HI.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE YOU. YOU GOT A STANDING OVATION. NOT EVERYBODY GETS THAT
I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE THEM.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR THE ARM YANK OVER THERE. DOES THAT NOT TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?
OOOH! ( LAUGHTER ) I WASN'T POLITICAL TILL ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. I WASN'T INTERESTED IN POLITICS. BUT NOW I'M JUST FASCINATED. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT HIM THOUGH.
Stephen: THAT'S FINE. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE MORE INTERESTING.
I'M NOT. THAT'S THE-- IT'S JUST-- ( LAUGHTER ) HE IS FASCINATING-- WELL, HE'S GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH DAVID BRENT THAN SOMEONE LIKE J.F.K. DAVID BRENT WANTS TO BE FAMOUS AND LOVED AND HE'D DO ANYTHING-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: HE SEEMS VERY FRAGILE.
BUT DAVID BRENT IS SORT OF LIKE AN OLD-- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "THE OFFICE" AND THIS MOVIE, IS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED IN 15 YEARS. IT'S MUCH HARSHER, AND SO BACK THEN, DAVID BRENT SEEMED LEAK A BIT OF AN IDEA AND HE WAS LIKE A NARCISSIST. IT WAS ON A REALITY SHOW. BUT BY TODAY'S STANDARDS, HE'S NOT THAT BAD BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THERE'S A NEW FAME, THERE'S A NEW-- PEOPLE DO ANYTHING TO BE FAMOUS. THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING TO BE FAMOUS. AND WE'VE HAD THINGS LIKE "THE APPRENTICE" WHERE PEOPLE GET ON IT BY SAYING, "I WOULD DESTROY ANYONE WHO STANDS IN MY WAY." THERE IS A NEW SORT OF ALPHA MAN OUT THERE. IT'S QUITE SAD.
Stephen: DAVID BRENT IS AN ALPHA MALE?
NO, HE'S NOT.
Stephen: HE WANTS TO SEEM LIKE AN ALPHA MALE.
HE SEEMS A BIT HELPLESS BECAUSE HE'S 55 DISPP NOW HE'S A TAMPON REP, AND HE WANTS TO BE A ROCK STAR LIKE EVERYONE DOES, AND HE'S HEMORRHAGING CASH AND HE PUTS A BAND TOGETHER AND HE GOES ON THE ROAD. AND IT'S REALLY TRAGIC. BUT HE JUST WANTS TO BE LOVED, DEEP DOWN, JUST LIKE DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:, YOU KNOW, I THINK SO, TOO. I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S YANKING MERRICK GARLAND INTO THE PHOTO, STAND NEXT TO ME.
HE GOES ON TWITTER AND SAYS THINGS LIKE, "EVERYONE LOVES ME. I WAS THE BEST." HE'S LIKE A 10-YEAR-OLD. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S CRAZY.
Stephen: THE 10-YEAR-OLD WITH THE LAUNCH CODES.
THAT'S THE WORRYING THING, ISN'T IT? HE HAS GOT THOSE, HASN'T HE? MAYBE THEY'VE GIVEN HIM FAKE ONES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) THEY MUST HAVE.
Stephen: JUST A BIG-- THEY JUST-- JUST A BIG SHINY RED BUTTON THAT'S ATTACHED TO NOTHING.
THERE'S TWO. THERE'S A SHINY RED BUTTON AND THERE'S A BLUE BOTON, AND ONE'S FOR PIZZA LIKE THAT AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T REALLY WORK.
Stephen: SPEAK OF PEOPLE--
YOU JUST BLEW UP CHINA, MR. TRUMP. "GOOD, GOOD." AND HE THINKS HE'S DOING ALL THIS STUFF BUT HE ISN'T REALLY. THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE NICE. THAT WOULD BE NICE. IT'S NOT TRUE, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE. NOW, SPEAKING OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE ROCK STARS, SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS-- MAY I SHOW THIS?
SURE.
Stephen: THIS IS A PICTURE OF YOU-- HOW LONG AGO? 1983. OKAY. ( WHISTLE ) THIS IS YOU AND A GUY NAMED BILL McCRAE IN A BAND CALLED SHAWNA DANCING. IT WAS AN ACTUAL BAND.
IT WAS AN ACTUAL BAND.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE A HIT?
NO, NEARLY. IT WAS NOON 83-- I'M A FINE OLD ROCK STAR. THANKS FOR BRINGING IT UP. BUT IT'S 30 YEARS AGO. THIS THING ONLY COMES OUT NOW BECAUSE I'M FAMOUS FOR SOMETHING ELSE. AND THEY BRING IT OUT AND GO, "LOOK AT YOU." PEOPLE THINK I'M EMBARRASSED ABOUT HOW I LOOKED THEN. I AM EXWARLSED HOW I LOOK NOW.
Stephen: I DIDN'T BRING TOUT TO EMBARRASS YOU. THIS STH WHO DAVID BRENT THINKS HE IS?
DAVID BRENT-- NO, WE DIDN'T MAKE IT. WE RELEASE AID FEW SINGERS AND THEN A GOT AN A NORMAL JOB IN AN OFFICE FOR 10 YEARS WHICH IS WHAT "THE OFFICE" IS BASED ON. YOU USE ALL EXPERIENCES, GOOD AND BAD PICHES AID FAIL MUSICIAN, SO I FUSED THE TWO. THERE WERE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE FILM THAT HAPPENED TO ME. I REMEMBER IN 1985, WE DID A GIG, AND WE DID THE SOUND CHECK, AND THE GUY SAID, "YOU MIGHT AS WELL STAY UP THERE, BECAUSE YOU'RE ON NOW." AND I SAID, "WHEN ARE THEY OPENING THE DOORS TO LET PEOPLE IN?" THEY SAID, "THEY'RE OPEN. NO ONE'S COME THROUGH TO SEE YOU." I SAID, "OH, LET'S TREAT IT LIKE A FREE REHEARSAL." AND WE JUST PLAYED 10 SONGS TO NO ONE. IT WAS ANSWER ZEN. BUT YOU TAKE THOSE WITH YOU. AND IN THE FILM, OBVIOUSLY, DAVID BRENT, HE'S HIRED THESE VENUES AND HE'S TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME BUT IT'S QUITE SAD THIS FILM. BUT IT'S FUNNY. IT'S REALLY FUN NEA TRAGIC WAY.
Stephen: IT'S COMPLETELY FUNNY.
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNIER THAN MIDDLE-AGED MEN TRYING TO BE COOL. I JUST SAW YOU DANGS AND IT WAS-- HONESTLY.
Stephen: I WAS TRYING MY HARDEST. I WAS TRYING MY HARDEST.
YOU DREAMED OF BEING A DANCER, DON'T YOU.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT.
IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE MUPPETS HAVING A GO.
Stephen: IF ONLY, IF ONLY I COULD HAVE SOMEONE'S HAND UP MY ASS MAKING ME DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
TONIGHT, STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR DREAM HAS COME TRUE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SPEAK OF-- SPEAKING OF WHICH, THIS IS KIND OF LIKE IT, YOU-- YOU DO MANAGE TO GET PEOPLE UPSET AT YOU, SOMETIMES. YOU SAID THERE WAS NO SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN DAVID BRENT WAS AROUND THE FIRST TIME.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT YOU GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR AT LEAST GET ATTACKED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SOMETIMES. WE HEARD ABOUT THIS. WE ASKED YOU TO-- MAY I SHOW THIS?
YEAH. BECAUSE-- CAN I READ IT? CAN I INTERESTED FIRST?
Stephen: WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THIS PARTICULAR TWEET?
SO I GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND I LIKE TO-- I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND STUFF, AND SOMETIMES FACTS ANNOY PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE FACTS-- PEOPLE, CREATIONISTS WHO BELIEVE THE EARTH IS, LIKE, 5,000 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: 6,000 YEARS OLD.
SORRY, SORRY, MY BAD. RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) I LIKE TO SAY THINGS LIKE, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY EARTH, 4.6 BILLION YEARS OLD TODAY." SO THIS GUY CAME OUT-- IT'S A GENTLEMAN-- I LOOKED AT HIS OTHER TWEETS. HE'S A GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS. I WON'T SAY HIS NAME. HE'S BEEN EMBARRASSED ENOUGH I JUST RETWEETED IT. AND HE GOT VERY, VERY ANGRY. YOU COULD SEE HE WAS MAD BECAUSE IT'S ALL IN CAPITALS. EVERYONE-- MAD PEOPLE --
Stephen: IT'S WRITTEN ON THE BACK SO PEOPLE CAN SEE. CAN WE DO THIS?
SURE SO-- LET ME READ IT. I-- I-- I WANT YOU TO SAVOR IT. OKAY, OKAY. "YOUR SCIENCE" MY SCIENCE AND SCIENCE IS SPELL SCIENTS, SCIENCE, LIKE IT'S THE PLURAL OF SCIENT. YOUR SCIENCE WOWNT HELP YOU, HE'S TEXTING UP TO A SATELLITE DID&DOWN TO ME SO IT'S SORT OF HELPING HIM. "YOUR SCIENCE WON'T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN--," OF COURSE, HE BELIEVES IN SATAN. WHY WOULDN'T HE? HE BELIEVES GOD MADE THE EARTH IN SIX DAYS. DO YOU BELIEVE IN SATAN? NO, THAT'S A BIG IRRATIONAL, YOU KNOW. SO HE BELIEVES IN SATAN, RIGHT. "YOUR SCIENCE WON'T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS." HE'S GOT A POINT. BECAUSE IF I-- NO, HE HAS-- HE HAS GOT A POINT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
BECAUSE IF I DIE AND I FIND MYSELF IN HELL BEING RAPED BY SATAN, SCIENCE IS PRETTY MUCH LET ME DOWN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S VERY OPEN MINDED OF YOU.
YES. BUT THIS IS-- SO, SO THIS IS MY FAVORITE BIT. "YOUR SCIENCE WON'T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I'LL BE LAUGHING." SO THIS SILLY (BLEEP) IS THERE, TOO! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE'S THERE! SO HE'S-- HE'S-- HE'S A FUNDAMENTALIST CREATIONIST WHO HAS LIVED HIS LIFE BY THE OLD TESTAMENT. HEIDIZE. HE GOES-- HE FINDS HIMSELF IN HELL. HE SEES ME BEING RAPED AND HE GOES HA! AND IT CHEERS HIM UP. LIKE, HE'S OVER IT ALREADY.
Stephen: THAT'S A COMPLIMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE A COMEDIAN. YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAKING SOMEONE LAUGH IN HELL.
I'M AN ABILITYIST COMEDIAN. LIKE SATAN WOULDN'T THROW ME ASIDE AND BE WITH THE CHRISTIAN IF HE FOUND HIM IN HELL. THAT WOULD BE SATAN'S BEST DAY EVER. HE WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH ME ANYMORE. UNBELIEVABLE. THAT'S WHY IT'S MY FAVORITE TWEET. AND ALL IT WAS RETWEETING IT.
Stephen: YOU SAID-- WHEN YOU RETWEETED YOU SAID, "I BELIEVE THIS TWEET SHOULD GET A KNIGHTHOOD."
I DID, YES, I DID.
Stephen: I WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT WHEN WE COME BACK. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK RIGHT HERE. STICK AROUND. WE HAVE MORE WRECK. RICKY GERVAIS.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE HERE WITH RICKY GERVAIS. WE WERE TALKING BEFORE, ABOUT THIS TWEET BEFORE, THAT YOU LIKED THIS TWEET THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU WERE GOING IT TO GO TO HELL, THAT IT SHOULD GET A KNIGHTHOOD. DO YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN A KNIGHTHOOD? BECAUSE A LOT OF-- A LOT OF BRITISH PERFORMERS END UP, LIKE, GETTING A KNIGHTHOOD FOR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY OR DRAMA. DOES THAT INTEREST YOU?
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS. IF IT PLANTE I COULD GO DOWN THE STREET ON A HORSE WITH A SWORD KILLING PEOPLE, THEN, YES. BUT IT'S NOTHING. IT'S NOTHING-- GIVE ME A BIG SWORD AND A HORSE, AND THEN I'LL TAKE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Stephen: TALKING ABOUT HELL BEFORE, ABOUT THIS TWEET ABOUT YOU GOING TO HELL. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AN ATHEIST, CORRECT?
YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DEBATING-- THAT'S THE DEVIL WAITING FOR YOU IN HELL, BY THE WAY. DID YOU WANT TO DEBATE THIS? SO RICKY GERVAIS, WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING?
THAT'S-- THAT'S-- THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION.
THAT'S NOT THE TWO CHOICE S.
Stephen:  THOSE ARE THE CHOICES I'M GIVING YOU. I'M THE HOST. ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, I DON'T --
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO CONCEDE THE DEBATE. WHY IS THERE SOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN OUT OF NOTHING?
Stephen: WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF WHY IS THERE NOTHING? WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE EXIST AT ALL? WHY IS THERE SOMETHING?
BUT SURELY THE QUESTION IS NOT WHY BUT HOW? WHY IS IRRELEVANT.
Stephen: ANOTHER FINE, HOW IS THERE SOMETHING? IF YOU THINK OF GOD AS THE PRIME MOVER,.
I DON'T.
Stephen: IS THERE A PRIME MOVER. IS THERE A DEMI-URGE THAT STARTED EVERYTHING.
OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE AND NATURE I DON'T BELIEVE SO. SO THE INTERESTING THING IS-- THAT'S THE THING I'M AN AGNOVELTYIC ATHEIST. AGNOSTIC MEANS NO ONE KNOWS IF THERE'S A GOD. EVERYONE IS TECHNICALLY AN AGNOSTIC BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. AN AGNOSTIC ATHEIST IS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THERE IS A GOD--
YOU'RE NOT CONVICTED OF YOUR ATHEISM.
I AM. ATHEISM ISN'T A BELIEF SYSTEM. ATHEISM-- SO THIS IS ATHEISM IN A NUTSHELL. YOU SAY, "THERE'S A GOD." I SAY, "YOU CAN PROVE THAT?" YOU SAY, "NO." I SAID, "I DON'T BELIEVE YOU THEN." SO YOU BELIEVE IN ONE GOD, I ASSUME.
Stephen: UHHH, IN THREE PERSONS, BUT GO AHEAD. ( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY, SO YOU BELIEVE-- OKAY. BUT THERE ARE 3,000 TO CHOOSE FROM, YOU KNOW, OF PEOPLE --
Stephen: I'VE DONE SOME READING, YEAH.
SO BASICALLY, YOU BELIEVE IN-- YOU DENY ONE LESGOD THAN I DO. YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN 2,999 GOD. AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN JUST ONE MORE.
Stephen: RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU EVER HAVE A FEELING OF GREAT GRATITUDE FOR EXISTENCE?
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER HAVE--
I KNOW THE CHANCES ARE BILLIONS TO ONE THEY AM ON THIS PLANET AS ME AND NEVER WILL BE AGAIN.
Stephen: I KNOW I CAN'T CONVINCE YOU THAT THERE IS A GOD, NOR DO I REALLY WANT TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THERE IS A GOD. I CAN ONLY EXPLAIN MY EXPERIENCE WHICH IS I HAVE A STRONG DESIRE TO DIRECT THAT GRATITUDES TOWARDS SOMETHING OR SOMEONE.
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: ASK THAT THING IS GOD.
WE WANT TO-- WE WANT TO MAKE SENSE OF NATURE AND SCIENCE. IT IS TOO UNFATHOMABLE-- EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WAS ONCE CRUNCHED IN SOME SMALL ATOM --
Stephen: BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU'RE JUST BELIEVINGLY STEPHEN  HAWKING AND THAT'S A MATTER OF FAITH IN HIS ABILITIES. YOU DON'T KNOW IT YOURSELF. YOU'RE ACCEPTING THAT BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD YOU.
WELL, YEAH, BUT SCIENCE IS CONSTANTLY PROVED OVER TIME. YOU SEE, IF WE TAKE SOMETHING LIKE ANY FICTION, AND ANY HOLY BOOK AND ANY OTHER FICTION, AND DESTROYED IT, OKAY. IN 1,000 YEARS' TIME, THAT WOULDN'T COME BACK JUST AS IT WAS. WHEREAS IF WE TOOK EVERY SCIENCE BOOK AND EVERY FACT AND DESTROYED THEM ALL, IN 1,000 YEARS THEY'D ALL BE BACK BECAUSE ALL THE SAME TACKLES WOULD BE THE SAME RESULT.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S REALLY GOOD.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
SODON'T NEED-- I DON'T NEED-- I DON'T NEED FAITH IN SCIENCE. I DON'T NEED FAITH TON PROBABLY IF I JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW, EVERY OTHER TIME SOMEONE JUMPED OUT OF A WINDOW THEY SMASHED TO THE GROUND BECAUSE OF THIS THING CALLED GRAVITY.
Stephen: AND THEN SATAN WOULD BE RAPING YOU.
THIS IS WHY I'M A GOOD BOY.
Stephen: RICKY, PLEASE COME BACK AND DEBATE SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. "DAVID BRENT: LIFE ON THE ROAD" IS ON NETFLIX FEBRUARY 10. RICKY GERVAIS, EVERYONE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: WE HAVE A BALCONY HERE. IT'S OVERFLOW. A LOT OF TIMES I'LL HAVE GUESTS ON THE SHOW, AND I'LL THINK OH, I WONDER IF THIS IS THEIR FIRST TIME ON A TALK SHOW OR ARE THEY USED TO-- YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE YOU WERE 10 YEARS OLD, RIGHT?
SEVEN, ACTUALLY.
Stephen: SEVEN YEARS OLD. SO YOU'VE BEEN ASKED EVERYTHING. YOU'VE TALKED TO EVERYONE. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP HERE OF I THINK THIS IS-- IS THIS "REGIS AND CATHY." CAN WE SHOW THEM.

YOU HAVEN'T MET IT.
I HAVEN'T MET IT.
Stephen: SO YOU'VE BEEN ASKED EVERYTHING, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I THINK SO. A LOT OF THINGS.
Stephen: JUST LIKE I WOULDN'T MIND LEARNING FROM YOU. IS THERE SOME QUESTION THAT NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR?
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: IS THERE A GOD, CHRISTINA RICCI?
ONE TIME SOMEBODY ASKED ME, BASICALLY, LIKE, WHEN YOU FIRST CAME OUT, YOU WERE-- IT WAS BASICALLY LIKE A "WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?" QUESTION AND I THOUGHT THAT'S NOT NICE AT ALL. MY ONLY REACTION IS THAT'S NOT NICE.
Stephen: I'M GOG ASK YOU SOME OF THE QUESTIONS REGIS ASKED YOU. "THEY AUDITIONED HUNDREDS OF GIRLS FOR THIS ROLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. YOU HAD TO BE PRETTY NERVOUS, RIGHT?"
I ANSWER, OKAY. WELL, ACTUALLY, I WAS REALLY TIRED THAT DAY, BECAUSE I HAD JUST COME FROM THREE OTHER AUDITIONS AND I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO TO THE "ADAMS FAMILY" AUDITION AND MY MOM SAID, "THAT'S PERFECT. WEDNESDAY HAS NO EMOTION. AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE HAPPY." AND I THOUGHT OH, THIS IS MY PART.
Stephen: "DID YOU WORK WITH CHER? HOW WAS THAT? YOU BECAME HER PALT DURING THE MOVIE, RIGHT?"
YEAH, I DID. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THANK YOU, REGIS. NOW, YOU ARE-- YOU ARE NOW PLAYING ZELDA FITZGERALD. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHO ZELDA FITZGERALD IS, WHO IS ZELDA FITZGERALD? ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, ZELDA FITZGERALD WAS F. SPZ SCOTT FITZGERALD'S WIFE. I STILL CALL HIM F. SCOTT, WHICH APPARENTLY MAKES ME SOUND STUPID. SO F. SCOTT FITZGERALD'S WIFE, AND SHE WAS RUMORED TO BE THIS CRAZY ALCOHOLIC WOMAN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEMISE.
Stephen: SHE WAS NOT? ONLY RUMORED TO BE?
SHE ACTUALLY WASN'T. HE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC --
Stephen: DIDN'T HE HAVE HER COMMITTED?
YES. SHE HAY NERVOUS BREAKDOWN BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF LIKE, LIKE, DETAILS, AND MITIGATING FACTORS, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: THE STORY TAKES PLACE IN 1918.
WE START-- WE START WITH THE DAY THEY MET, AND HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, WE GO THROUGH-- BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO SEE THEIR RELATIONSHIP FROM ZELDA'S POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING FILM OR TELEVISION ABOUT ZELDA. AND THERE'S ALL THIS AMAZE INFORMATION ABOUT HER AND STORIES THAT HE-- EVEN A LOT OF HIS WRITING WAS HERS.
Stephen: WAIT, SHE WAS ACTUALLY WRITING THE STORIES AND HE PUT HIS NAME ON IT.
I MEAN, NOT THE WHOLE THING. BUT HE WOULD LIFT PASSAGES OUT OF HER JOURNAL AND OUT OF HER LETTERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SO THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING STUFF. AND THEN THERE'S ALL, LIKE, THE CRAZY DRAMA AND ALL THAT DYSFUNCTION.
Stephen: SO THERE WAS A MAN TAKING CREDIT FOR A WOMAN'S WORK.
RIGHT, I MEAN, SHOCKING.
Stephen: YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OF-- THEY HAD A TEMPESTUOUS RELATIONSHIP.
YEAH GR WE HAVE A CLIP HERE THAT I BELIEVE ZELDA IS VERY MAD AT SCOTT BECAUSE HE'S NOT RESPECTING HER. WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE CLIP WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE?
HE MARRIES HER. SHE MOVES WITH HIM TO NEW YORK, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH ANYMORE THE WAY SHE LOOKS.
Stephen: OKAY, JIM.
ZELDA! THIS IS OUR TIME TO SOAR. WE NEED TO PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD! YOU WERE AT THE PARTY. YOU SAW HOW THEY WERE DRESSED. WE NEED--
HAYWOOD WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE JUST AS PHONEY AND JUVENILE AND PRETENTIOUS AS THEY SAY.
I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
OH, I MEAN IT. I MEAN IT WITH ALL MY HEART. YOU'RE ASHAMED OF ME, SCOTT FITZGERALD. WELL, I'M ASHAMED OF YOU. I THOUGHT I MARRIED A MAN. AND HERE I AM, STANDING IN FRONT OF AN INSECURE LITTLE BOY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND IT ONLY GETS WORSE FROM THERE, RIGHT?
YEAR, OR MORE FUN, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU LIKE TO WATCH.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THIS, ALSO.
YES.
Stephen: AND IS THIS-- IS THIS THE FIRST RADI ROMANTIC LEA YOU'VE PLAYED?
YEAH, I THINK IT IS. YEAH, I MEAN, I FOUND THE MATERIAL, AND TOOK IT TO PRODUCERS AND WE SET IT UP. AND I DO SAY THAT IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE FIRST ROMANTIC LEAD I'VE PLAYED BECAUSE PEOPLE REALLY WOULD NEVER CAST ME IN ROMANTIC LEADS.
Stephen: PEOPLE WOULDN'T CAST YOU AS A ROMANTIC LEAD?
I THINK --
Stephen: THE OPPOSITE OF SEX, IT'S NOT ROMANTIC, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A LOVE STORY.
NO --
Stephen: IT'S NOT?
NOT SO MUCH. I MEAN, KIND OF.
Stephen: I FOUND IT ROMANTIC.
THAT HATEFUL 15-YEAR-OLD IS GOING AROUND SPEWING BIGOTRY. YEAH, IT'S REALLY ROMANTIC. ( LAUGHTER ).
