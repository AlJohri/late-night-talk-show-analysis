Stephen: WHAT TIME IS THE MEETING?
2:00. HEY, DID YOU SEE THIS? TRUMP HAS RAISED NO MONEY FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION. HE MUST BE GETTING DESPERATE.
Stephen: COME ON, THE GUY'S A BILLIONAIRE, I'M SURE HE'S GOT A FINANCIAL PLAN.
COME ON! GIVE ME MONEY, YOU LOSERS!
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES AUBREY PLAZA. HUGH DANCY. AND ANDREW ZIMMERN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"!  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU, SIR! HEY, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. WELCOME UP THERE. WELCOME DOWN THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, MARK. THAT'S NICE. JOSEPH. THANK YOU, EDDIE. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US TONIGHT. WELL, FOLKS, THE RESULTS ARE IN, AND THE ELECTION IS STILL GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON VERSUS DONALD TRUMP. IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY THAT BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE THE SAME SLOGAN, ""2016, LOOK, IT IS WHAT IT IS." WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? ( APPLAUSE ) AND THERE IS HUGE NEWS IN THE RACE TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON THAT AMERICA HAS SETTLED FOR. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION ANNOUNCED HOW MUCH CAFNG CASH EACH CAMPAIGN HAS ON HAND. AND, HILLARY CLINTON IS BURYING DONALD TRUMP $42 MILLION TO $1.3 MILLION. I CAN'T BELIEVE TRUMP HAS SO LITTLE CASH. I ALWAYS KNEW THOSE HUGE SKYSCRAPERS WERE OVERCOMPENSATING FOR SOMETHING IN HIS PANTS. I JUST NEVER IMAGINED IT WAS HIS WALLET. ( APPLAUSE ) IN FACT, DONALD TRUMP IS SO BROKE, HE'S HAD TO STOP FEEDING HIS HAIRPIECE. ( LAUGHTER ) HE SENT IT TO A FARM UPSTATE. IT WILL BE SO MUCH HAPPIER UP THERE, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS.
Jon: IN THE WILD.
Stephen: IN FACT, $1.3 MILLION-- AND THIS IS TRUE ISN'T EVEN ENOUGH TO AFFORD A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN TRUMP'S OWN BUILDING. ( APPLAUSE ) NOT THAT HE WOULD WANT IT. I HEAR THE LANDLORD IS A JERK. THIS IS KIND OF MYSTIFYING TO ME. HOW COULD TRUMP HAVE LESS CASH ON HAND THAN THE "VERONICA MARS" MOVIE RAISED ON KICKSTARTER? ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE KIND OF MYSTERY ONLY "VERONICA MARS" COULD SOLVE. IF DONALD TRUMP HAD THE MONEY TO HIRE HER, WHICH HE DOES NOT. NOT ONLY IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN POORLY FUNDED, BUT IT ESTIMATES IT CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT 30 PEOPLE ON STAFF ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE MORE FULL-TIME STAFFERS IF HE JUST HIRED ARCADE FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE: IF MY STUDIO AUDIENCE WORKED FOR THE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, I WOULD PROBABLY BE DOING A VERY DIFFERENT MONOLOGUE RIGHT NOW. GREAT! AND, GREAT! ( APPLAUSE ) KEEP IN MIND, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. IN 2012, OBAMA AND ROMNEY EACH SPENT OVER $1 BILLION. THAT'S BILLION WITH AN ILLION. BUT TRUMP ONLY HAS $1 MILLION. THAT IS A THOUSAND TIMES LESS THAN HE NEEDS. OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S AN EASY FIX HERE-- JUST MAKE HIS CAMPAIGN A THOUSAND TIMES SMALLER. START WITH TINY YARD SIGNS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CUTE, CUTE. I ACTUALLY KNOW A GUY WITH HANDS SMALL ENOUGH TO INSTALL THOSE. MEANWHILE, MEANWHILE-- ( APPLAUSE ) MEANWHILE, HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS GROWING. SHE'S GAINING NEW SUPPORTERS AS FAST AS CHELSEA CAN CRANK THEM OUT. ADORABLE. THAT'S ADORABLE. NOW, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WANT CLINTON TO NAME ELIZABETH WARREN AS HER RUNNING MATE. ( APPLAUSE ) ANY ELIZABETH WARREN FANS HERE? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU CLEARLY DO NOT WORK ON WALL STREET. JIM?
A REPORT IN POLITICO TODAY SAYING THAT WALL STREET AND FINANCIAL SERVICE INDUSTRY LEADERS, "DESPISE WARREN'S ATTACKS ON THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY." THEY ALSO THINK HER SELECTION WOULD BE DAMAGING TO THE ECONOMY, AND THEY WARNED THAT IF CLINTON SURPRISES THEM AND TAPS WARREN, BIG DONATIONS FROM THE INDUSTRY COULD VANISH.
Stephen: AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING WALL STREET CAN DO, IT'S TO MAKE MONEY VANISH. I'M SORRY, WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? EXCUSE ME, SIR, THAT'S WHICH BEHIND YOUR EAR? IS IT YOUR RETIREMENT FUND? AND IT'S GONE. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) ILLUSION! ( APPLAUSE ) AND HILLARY HAS TO TAKE THIS WALL STREET THREAT SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE WALL STREET HAS ALREADY GIVEN HER $27 MILLION. OR AS HILLARY CALLS IT, TWO SPEECHES. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF WALL STREET REALLY IS VETOING ELIZABETH WARREN, THE QUESTION IS WHO DO THEY WANT TO BE HILLARY'S VICE PRESIDENT? MY MONEY'S ON THE MONOPOLY GUY. NOT A BAD IDEA. HE'S AN AMERICAN ICON, HE'S GOT PLENTY OF ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE, AND LIKE EVERYONE ELSE ON WALL STREET, HE'S GOT A "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY! ?OEZ. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HOLD ON, HOLD ON. OH! I JUST HAD TO REFRESH MYSELF FOR A SECOND THERE BECAUSE I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU FOLKS. YOU READY FOR THIS? THIS IS A PERSONAL QUESTION. YOU GUYS READY?  ( CHEERS ) IS ANYBODY HERE A HUMAN? ARE YOU HUMAN? ARE YOU HUMAN HERE? THEN THIS NEXT STORY MAY UPSET YOU. I'M UPSET. WE ALL HAVE JOBS TO DO, RIGHT? I'M DOING MY JOB RIGHT NOW, AND I GOT THESE CAMERAS IN HERE TO PROVE IT. AND AFTER THE ATTACKS IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA, I THOUGHT MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT DO THEIR JOB AND PASS ANY KIND OF LAW, EVEN A FIG LEAF TO JUSTICE THEIR EXISTENCE. WELL, FOR THINKING THAT, I OWE ME AN APOLOGY. NOW, THERE WAS A VOTE. SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY'S 15-HOUR FILIBUSTER MADE THAT HAPPEN. BUT YESTERDAY, EACH PARTY INTRODUCED TWO GUN BILLS, AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE BILLS WERE VOTED DOWN. THEY COULDN'T EVEN AGREE TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THE TERROR WATCH LIST FROM BUYING HIGH-POWERED ASSAULT RIFLES. IT'S EASY TO FEEL HOPELESS, ESPECIALLY WITH HEADLINES LEADING UP TO THE VOTES LIKE "GUN CONTROL BILLS EXPECTED TO FAIL IN SENATE ON MONDAY." "SENATE SET TO VOTE ON FOUR GUN CONTROL MEASURES, NONE EXPECTED TO PASS." "SENATE STRIKES DEAL TO VOTE ON DOOMED GUN PROPOSALS." AND "JUSTIN BIEBER IS SET TO CASH IN MILLIONS FROM HIS NEW LINE OF EMOJIS: "JUSTMOJIS." NOW, I KNOW THAT LAST ONE IS NOT ABOUT THE SENATE, BUT IT STILL MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY HOPELESS. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SENATORS. 92% OF AMERICANS WANT TO EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN BUYERS, AND YOU JUST IGNORE THEM. SINCE WHEN DOES 8% OF THE POPULATION GET TO HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF AN ISSUE? THAT'S LIKE TAKING YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY ON A CROSS-COUNTRY CAR TRIP AND LETTING GRANDMA CHOOSE ALL THE MUSIC. ( LAUGHTER ) "NANA! "NANA! GLEN MILLER IS GREAT, BUT I'M GOING TO RUN A HOSE FROM THE TAILPIPE TO MY MOUTH." ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY, I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD TO BE IN THE SENATE AND FIND COMMON GROUND ON SUCH A POLITICALLY FRAUGHT ISSUE, AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? ( BLEEP ) THAT. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE GLOVES OFF. ( APPLAUSE ) HERE WE GO. ROUND ONE! HIT IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY SENATE HEY, SENATE, MY DOG ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN YOU THIS WEEK WHEN HE ROLLED OVER AND LICKED HIS NUTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, SENATE, I'VE SEEN BUGS TRAPPED IN AMBER MOVE FASTER THAN YOU. HEY, YOU GUYS THINK A TERRORIST WATCH LIST IS WHEN YOU PUT "HOMELAND" ON YOUR NETFLIX QUEUE. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK THE GUN LOBBY TO CHECK FOR A HERNIA, AS LONG AS THEY'VE GOT YOUR BALLS IN THEIR HAND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SENATE, SENATE, YOU COULDN'T PASS A BILL IF IT WAS COATED IN EX-LAX. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT IF YOU EVER DID PASS A BILL, IT WOULD SAY, "BE IT RESOLVED: NO KISSING, AND THE N.R.A. SHOULD JUST LEAVE THE MONEY ON THE DRESSER." SENATE, SENATE, YOU ACCOMPLISH SO LITTLE THAT KYLIE JENNER WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU DO FOR A LIVING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SENATE, SENATE, YOU'VE GOT MORE OLD WHITE MEN LYING AROUND THAN A LIFE ALERT AD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU ARE SO DIVIDED, YOU COULDN'T COME TOGETHER IF YOU HAD 30 HOURS AND A ( BLEEP ) REACH SUPERSTING. YOU'RE LIKE GRANDPA AFTER AN ALL-STARCH DINNER: YOU CAN'T GET (BLEEP) DONE. ( BELL RINGING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ I'M STILL UPSET, BUT I FEEL A LITTLE BETTER.

Stephen: I LOVE YOU, TOO, I'M A BIG FAN.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: FIRST QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY, DO YOU DO YOUR OWN STUNTS?
YES! NO.
Stephen: ARE YOU ANYTHING LIKE THE CHARACTERS? IN THIS MOVIE, YOU PLAY TWO GIRLS WHO ARE BASICALLY BIGGER GOOF BALLS THAN THE GUYS.
YEAH.
Stephen: IN THE MOVIE.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU TROUBLE?
UM, I'VE BEEN TROUBLE BEFORE, YEAH. I WOULD SAY, YEAH.
Stephen: ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT YOU, IS YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE A SECRET ALL THE TIME.
I WAS JUST ACTUALLY THINKING BACK THERE THAT I HAVE A SECRET. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT I SHOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY. AND I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
Stephen: NO.
NOT NOW, NOT TONIGHT. WHAT! WHAT!
Stephen: BECAUSE WE-- BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T LIKE THE SECRET THAT YOU HAVE?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST SAYING ( BLEEP ). I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE-- I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: THERE'S NO ACTUAL SECRET.
THAT'S EXACTLY. I HAVE NOTHING IS GOING ON UP THERE. NOTHING.
Stephen: YOU HAVE PLENTY GOING ON UP THERE, COME ON.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT? I HAVE NO IDEA. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOU LOOK DANGEROUS.
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HELP IT.
Stephen: DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT BEFORE, THAT YOU LIKE KIND OF LIKE A DANGEROUS PERSON?
YES, YEAH, SURE. I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TONE OF MY VOICE, AND SOMETHING IN MY EYES OR MY HALF-PUERTO RICAN BACKGROUND. I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: I WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT WITH A 10-FOOT POLE.
I WOULDN'T. ( SPEAKING SPANISH ).
Stephen: WHAT? DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
YEAH.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU COULD JUST MAKE IT UP. I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.
WELL WHAT, DO YOU SPEAK?
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT OF LATIN. I TOOK--
ME, TOO.
Stephen: YOU TOOK LATIN?
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( SPEAKING LATIN ).
OKAY, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
Stephen: THE FARMER IS IN GALL. THE FORUM IS IN GALL. THAT'S BASICALLY IT.
I DID TAKE LATIN. I WENT TO AN ALL-GIRLS' CATHOLIC SCHOOL.
Stephen: HOW LONG DID YOU GO?
FROM FOURTH GRADE TO 12th GRADE.
Stephen: THAT'S SERIOUS.
YUP.
Stephen: DID YOU LIKE IT? A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF THAT AS AN OPPRESSIVE REGIME, LIKE THE IRON CURTAIN.
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. I LOVED IT. AND WE WERE-- WE HAD A CONVENT ON THE CAMPUS, AND THE NUNS TAUGHT US. BUT OUR NUNS WERE COOL NUNS, LIKE SISTER BETTY PLAYED THE GUITAR.
Stephen: SHE PLATE GUITAR?
YEAH.
Stephen: WAS IT A LOT OF ♪ OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN HALLOWED BE THY NAME ♪ THAT'S COOL. LIKE INTERPRETIVE DANCE AT MASS AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
NO, WE WERE MORE TRADITIONAL ROMAN CATHOLIC KIND OF TRADITIONAL. BUT WE GOT CRAZY SOMETIMES.
Stephen: REALLY?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S A MOVIE I WOULD GO SEE. ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU KNOW, I JUST FINISHED SHOOTING A MOVIE IN ITALY WHERE I PLAY A NUN IN THE 1400s.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY.
YES, GET READY FOR THAT ONE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT TONIGHT.
Stephen: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT-- I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAD EVER CONSIDERED THE HOLY ORDERS, DID YOU EVER THINK-- YOU LIKED THE NUNS, RIGHT? DID YOU EVER THING I COULD DO THAT?
HONESTLY, YES. I REALLY-- I DID HAVE-- OH, GOD.
Stephen: I WENT TO THE TROUBLE HAVING THIS MADE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M TELLING YOU YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS MOVIE I JUST DID BECAUSE IT'S THAT BUT AN ENTIRE MOVIE OF IT.
Stephen: OF A NUN WEARING INAPPROPRIATE CLOTHING AND MORE LIPSTICK THAN A NUN WOULD EVER NO.
YEAH, NO, YEAH.
Stephen: DON'T TELL ME ABOUT THAT ONE. LET'S GET BACK TO "MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES." HAVE YOU-- WEDDINGS HAVE, LIKE, THREE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT-- THE COUPLE WANTS TO GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW.
YES.
Stephen: EVERYONE ELSE EITHER WANTS TO LEAVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE OR THEY WANT TO HOOK UP.
YEAH.
Stephen: RIGHT? HAVE YOU HAD FUN AT WEDDINGS?
UM... ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE BEEN TO, MAYBE, LIKE, TWO WEDDINGS THAT HAVEN'T MADE ME WANT TO RUN OUT THE DOOR. BUT I TRY TO HAVE FUN. YOU KNOW, I TRY TO HAVE FUN, YOU KNOW, WHEREVER I AM. AND I WAS MAID OF HONOR LAT YEAR AT A WEDDING.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT WAS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES.
I PREFER TO GO TO WEDDINGS WHERE I DON'T HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITIES. YOU HAVE FUN, YOU DRINK --
WHAT DOES THE MAID OF HONOR HAVE TO DO?
YOU KNOW, ATTEND TO THE DRESS--
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE A SPEECH?
I GAVE A SPEECH. I DON'T REMEMBER THIS SPEECH I GAVE.
Stephen: WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN WEDDING.
THE ADVICE I GOT WAS TO BE SO DRUNK BEFORE THE SPEECH THAT YOU DON'T CARE ANYMORE. I CARED, BUT I WAS ALSO WASTED. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, YOU KNOW, I-- THIS IS ON A SLIGHTLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ON A DIFFERENT TACK, SISTER PLAZA.
YES.
Stephen: THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, YOU ACTUALLY MET DONALD TRUMP.
I DID.
Stephen: AND I'VE GOT A PHOTO HERE THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. AND THIS IS YOU AND DONALD TRUMP AND A YOUNG BOY. AND THAT'S THE PHOTO RIGHT THERE.
OKAY, SO... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? WHAT IS THIS?
SO LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY ABOUT A GIRL NAMED AUBREY PLAZA WHO WAS, I THINK, AROUND 19, 20. I WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK, AND MY JOB WAS TO BE A MASCOT TO DRESS UP LIKE THAT CHARACTER, WHICH --
THIS IS WHAT DID YOU FOR A LIVING?
YEAH, AT, YOU KNOW, CONVENTION CENTERS AND THAT KIND OF THING. AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW-- IT'S A BRITISH, I BELIEVE A BRITISH CARTOON NAMED NAUGHTY THE ELF BOY OR SOMETHING. OKAY. NAUGHTY.
Stephen: DON'T PRETEND LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE AMERICANS. WE WOULDN'T LET YOU IN IF YOU WEREN'T.
ANYWAY, I WOULD PUT THAT HEAD ON AND WALK AND AROUND I DIDN'T KNOW THE CHARACTER SO I WOULD JUST MAKE UP SOME DANCE MOVES AND THOUGHT THE ELF WOULD DO THIS OR WHATEVER. THEN, SO THE LAST JOB WITH THE ELF, WAS AT F.A.O. SCHWARTZ, THERE WAS AN EVENT, AND MY BOSS AT THE TIME SAID THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO TONIGHT IS TO GET A PICTURE WITH DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S ALL I NEED YOU TO DO. DO IT OR YOU'RE FIRED. SO, YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO GET IN THERE WITH HIM, AND HE KEPT SHOEING ME AWAY, AND HE DIDN'T WANT THE PICTURE AND I KEPT DANCING OVER TO HIM, TRYING TO GET THE PICTURE. AND I FINALLY JUST KIND OF PUT MY CREEPY ELF ARM ON HIM AND FORCED HIM IN THERE AND GOT THAT PICTURE AND --
THE REST IS HISTORY.
AND THE REST IS HISTORY. AND I JUSTUE KNOW, I FEEL LIKE IF I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW, I WOULD HAVE JUST, YOU KNOW, TACKLED HIM TO THE GROUND IN THAT MOMENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WIFE, SHOULD HAVE, CACOULD HAVE. WELL, ( SPEAKING LATIN, SPRS. "MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES" OPENS JULY 8. AUBREY PLAZA, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, LIKE A LOT OF YOU PEOPLE, I LOVING IF TO THE MOVIES. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE MOVIES IN A WHILE, BUT YOU CAN'T SKIP ANY OF THE ADS. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I NEVER KNOW WHICH MOVIES TO GO TO. I MEAN, WILL I UNDERSTAND "ANGRY BIRDSY" IF I DON'T PLAY THE GAME. ONCE AGAIN IT'S TIME FOR "NOT AT THE MOVIES, WITH GIL PEACHES." IS LIKE THE INTERNET, BUT YOU ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HELLO HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. I'M GIL PEACHES. WELCOME TO "NOT AT THE MOVIES, WITH ME, GIL PEACHES." HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. HERE ARE THE MOVIES I SAW THIS WEEK. "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE." NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT FAMILIAR WITH ROMAN NUMERAL NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT ES, THAT MEANS "10 MEN APOCALYPSE." AND MY FAVORITE OF THE 10 MEN WAS MAGNETO. HIS SUPER POWER WAS RIGHT THERE IN HIS NAME, MAGNET. PROFESSOR X.SPD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROFESSOR READS YOUR MIND, AND SICLOPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN JOHNNIE LASER EYES. I CAN NOT CARE FOR THIS MOVIE UPON FOR ONE THING, I HAD TROUBLE FOCUSING ON THE PLOT BECAUSE THE FLOOR WAS VERY STICKY AND IT MADE ME WISH I'D WORN SHOES. I GIVE "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE" FOUR BASKETBALLS AND ONE VOLLEYBALL FOR CARTOON VIOLENCE. NEXT UP, "FINDING DORY." HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. NBILITY LOU, OOULT NORMALLY, I'M EXCITED TO SEE A SEE A PIXAR SEQUEL BECAUSE OF ALL THE CARS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE PLANES. BUT I JUST DON'T RELATE TO FISH. THEY SWIM IN THE SAME WATER AS THEIR POOP I HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE I WAS KICKED OUT OF THE "Y." PUT UP A SIGN, GUYS. THEY ALSO LEFT OUT MY FAVORITE PIXAR CHARACTER, SHREK. SO I HAD TO DRAW A PICTURE OF HIM ON MY POPCORN RECEIPT AND HOLD IT IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN. RIP OFF. I GIVE "FINDING DORY" THREE THUMBS UP. TWO WHITE, ONE AFRICAMERITHUMB. NEITHER UP OR DOWN. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. THE LAST MOVIE I SAW THIS WEEK WAS "MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES." NORMALLY I SEE MOVIES ALONE, BUT THIS TIME I BROUGHT MY COUSIN, JILL PEACHESES, BECAUSE SHE'S VERY SMART, AND IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S DYING WISH. >>NANA'S NOT DEAD YET BUT WE'RE GETTING THE WISHES OUT OF THE WAY.
Stephen: HELLO, I'M GIL PEACHES. GIL PEACHES.
HOW'S BRENDA,.
WE BROKE UP.
Stephen: I CALLED IT. WHO GOT TO KEEP THE SAMURAI SWORDZ.
SHE DID
SHE DID, BUT I KEPT THE BAMBOO ARMOR.
Stephen: WELL PLAYED. SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF "MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES?"
I'M ON THE FENCE.
Stephen: SIDE-SADDLE OR STRADDLING?
STRADDLING.
Stephen: OUCH.
ON ONE HAND, THE MOVIE HAD COMEDY, ROMANCE, AND HEART, AND A RAPID SERIES OF STILL IMAGES THAT CREATED THE ILLUSION OF MOTION. THAT PART GAVE ME VERTIGO. I HAD TO LIE DOWN IN THE AISLE.
Stephen: SOMETIMES THERE'S SNACKS DOWN THERE.
ALSO, NONE OF THE CHARACTERS WERE SAMURAI. VERY DISAPPOINTING. IF THEY GAVE AWARDS TO MOVIES, IT WOULD DEFINITELY LOSE. BUT THE ONE STANDOUT WAS AUBREY PLAZA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF I WERE A MOVIE PRODUCER, I'D KEEP BOTH MY EYES ON THAT ONE?
Stephen: BECAUSE SHE'S SO GOOD?
NO, BECAUSE SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE STEALS. Y( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS AFTER THE CREDITS, WHEN MY CAR WOULDN'T START BECAUSE I'D LEFT THE HEADLIGHTS ON.
SO PREDICTABLE. I GIVE "MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES" FIVE THROWING STARS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, BRENDA, GIVE ME BACK MY THROWING STARS. THERE'S A RENAISSANCE FAIRE THIS WEEKEND. AND YOU KNEW THAT.
Stephen: JILL, YOU KNOW THROWING STARS ARE NOT RENAISSANCE-ERA APPROPRIATE.
I'M GOING AS A TIME TRAVELER.
Stephen: TOUCHE. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, THAT'S A WRAP FOR THIS EPISODE OF "NOT AT THE MOVIES, WITH ME, GIL PEACHES."
AND ME, JILL PEACHES!
Stephen: UNTIL NEXT TIME, SEE YOU NOT AT THE MOVIES.
I MISS YOU, BRENDA.
Stephen: STAY STRONG, JILL. STAY STRONG.
I'D DIE FOR YOU.
Stephen: STAY STRONG. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A TALENTED ACTOR WHO NOW STARS IN THE HULU SHOW "THE PATH."
THAT'S WHY STEVE PUT ME IN CHARGE. YOU MAY HAVE KNOWN HIM LONGER, BUT I HAVE THE GIFT. YOU CAN INSPIRE THE FAITHFUL, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT I HAVE. I CAN WALK OUT ON THE ( BLEEP ) STREET AND MACH PEOPLE BELIEVE. SO I'M WRITING LAST THREE RUNS, AND THEY'LL SAY THAT I'M THE CHOSEN SON. I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED.
Stephen: WOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLEASE WELCOME HUGH DANCY! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, THIS IS ABOUT A CULT, "THE PATH." WELL WHAT, SOME WOULD CALL A CULT.
FAIR ENOUGH.
Stephen: I MIGHT FOLLOW THAT GUY IN THAT CLIP. BECAUSE THE FORCE OF THE PERSONALITY, YOU KNOW, TO BE ABLE TO GRAB PEOPLE AND MOVE THEM EMOTIONALLY, DO YOU THINK THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CULTS AND ACTING?
I THINK IT'S LIKE A FAN CLUB WRIT LARGE. I THINK THE LINK IS CONVICTION. I MEAN, I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND GIVE A PERFORMANCE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU'RE PLAYING, YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO FULLY BELIEVE IN THAT PERSON YOURSELF, AND I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE IN A CULT, YOU'RE PROBABLY LIVING A LIFE OF CONVICTION.
Stephen: I'M VERY ATTRACTED TO LIVING IN A CULT. ( LAUGHTER ) I WOULD LOVE SOMEBODY TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO ALL THE TIME.
I WOULD, TOO. NO, I THINK THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT. I THINK ALL OF US, SOME PART OF US WANTS THAT.
Stephen: DID YOU-- DID YOU GROW UP WITH ANY PARTICULAR RELIGIOSITY?
NO, IN FACT, NOT PARTICULARLY.
Stephen: SO DO YOU SEE ALL RELIGIONS AS CULTS?
I SEE-- I THINK THAT IT IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. THAT'S NOT TO SAY I DISMISS ALL RELIGION AT ALL, BUT I THINK WE HAVE THIS IDEA FROM POPULAR CULTURE OF WHAT A CULT IS, KIND OF A 1970 THING --
LIVE ON THE COMPOUND WITH FATHER AND CHILD BRIDES AND WE ONLY EAT GREEN.
YES.
Stephen: DON'T LEAVE THE COP POUND.
ALL THAT, ALL THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME BACK IN THE 70s.
YOU READ OUR LITERATURE, OBVIOUSLY.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. A CULT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS SOMEBODY ELSE'S RELIGION.
ABSOLUTELY. AND ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GOOD AND BAD.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT THIS ONE, MYERISM, IS IT GOOD OR BAD, HUGH?
IT'S GOOD, I THINK.
Stephen: THAT GUY DOESN'T SEEM THAT GOOD. HE SEEMS LIKE A BAD GUY. AND YOU'RE THE LEADER, RIGHT?
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER.
Stephen: OKAY, YOU'RE VYING TO BE THE LEADER.
I WOULD SAY THAT HE-- THAT HE FEELS LIKE HE'S TAKING ON A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE SAKE OF OTHER PEOPLE. HE BELIEVES IN THE BELIEF SMOSTLY, BUT HE'S JUST GOING TO DO SOME DODGY THINGS.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP ME FOLLOW SOMEBODY IN A CULT? IF THEY HAD YOUR ACTUAL ACCEPT. ( LAUGHTER ) WE AMERICANS THINK THAT'S KNOT STATUS.
RIGHT. I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF THOZ CULTS OUT THERE IS THERE ARE THERE CULTS IN ENGLAND? IS ENGLAND KNOWN FOR ITS CULTS? AMERICA IS KNOWN FOR THEIR CUTS. WE HAVE GOOD ONES.
ALL THE GOOD ENGLISH CULT LEADERS ACTUALLY MOVED TO CALIFORNIA.
Stephen: THE GOLD RUSH.
THAT WAS THE GOLD RUSH. GOTTA GO WHERE THE WORK IS, HUGH. WE HAD AARON PAUL ON HERE THE OTHER NIGHT AND HE SAID HE CALLS YOU FANCY DANCY.
THAT'S TRUE. NOT MOSTLY TO MY FACE, BUT HE DOES.
Stephen: IS THAT AN INSULT, FANCY DANCY?
IT'S NOT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DID HE SAY? HOW DID HE SAY IT?
Stephen: HE GOES, "FANCY DANCY."
I THINK THE TRUTH IS WHEN YOUR NAME IS DANCY, PEOPLE PRETTY EARLY ON REALIZE IT RHYMES WITH FANCY.
Stephen: AND LET'S TAKE OFF THE THE PANTSY.
NO, THAT ONE IS NEW BUT I WILL NOW LIVE WITH IT.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. I WAS AN ACTOR FOR A WHILE WHEN I WAS A KID, AND I WASN'T NEARLY AS ATTRACTIVE AND FIT AS YOU ARE. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AN AUDITION--
A PHYSICAL FIGHT.
Stephen: WE COULD FIGHT IF YOU WANT. THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR RATINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU EVER WALK INTO AN AUDITION AS A YOUNG ACTOR, AND THEY GO, "THAT'S FANTASTIC. NOW, LET'S LOSE THE PANTS." ANYTHING LIKE THAT? "LET'S SEE THE TORSO," OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
NOT EXACTLY.
Stephen: NEVER SAID, "LOSE THE PANT?" BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME TO LOSE THE PANTS ONE. AND I DID, AND I DID. AND I DIDN'T GET THE PART. ( LAUGHTER ) HONEST TO GOD, YEAH.
INSULT TO INJURY. WHAT WAS THE AUDITION FOR?
Stephen: IT WAS FOR A LEVI'S AD. AND EVERYONE YOUNG ACTOR IN CHICAGO GOT CALLED IN AND SAID, "ALL RIGHT, LOSE THE PANTS." WE DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD TO LOSE THE PANTS UNTIL WE WALKED IN AND WE ALL WALKED OUT AND WERE SHELL SHOCKED. AND WE ALL SAW EACH OTHER THE NEXT WEEK AND ASKED, "DID YOU TAKE THE PANTS OFF."
I THINK THAT'S A CALIFORNIA THING.
Stephen: MIGHT BE, MIGHT BE. YOU MIGHT KNOW, THE BREXIT IS IN TWO DAYS, RIGHT OR THE VOTE. THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW. THE BREXIT IS THE BRITS, THE UNITED KING COLM IS VOTING ON WHETHER TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE EUROPEAN UNION. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
GO IT ALONE.
Stephen: HOW DID THAT HAPPEN THAT IT EVEN GOT TO THIS POINT?
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE BASICALLY THE PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN PROGRAMMED THAT, PROMISED THIS REFERENDUM, ESSENTIALLY TO CALM DOWN MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY WHO WANTED TO LEAVE EUROPE. AND NOW IT'S COME TO FRUITION, AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S MUCH MORE OF-- MAYBE NOT A LIKELIHOOD BUT A POSSIBILITY THAN MAYBE HE OR ANYBODY ELSE HAD ENVISIONED.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS? I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN, BUT TBHAPS THEY VOTE AND THEY BREXIT, DO THEY DYNAMITE THE CHUNNEL AND CUT THEMSELVES OFF FROM ENGLAND? ARE THEY GOING TO LET THOSE PEOPLE NOT SWIM THE CHANNEL ANYMORE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
WE ALREADY HAVE A CHANNEL.
Stephen: HOW IS YOUR LOVELY WIFE, CLAIRE DANES. SHE IS A LOVELY ACTRESS.
SHE'S GREAT.
Stephen: PLEASE SAY HELLO. IT WAS LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. CONGRATULATIONS ON "THE PATH." IT IS AVAILABLE NOW FOR DOWNLOAD ON HULU. HUGH DAN SEE, EVERYBODY. WHEN WE COME BACK, ANDREW ZIMMERN WILL PUT THINGS IN MY MOUTH THAT I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD BE THERE. STICK AROUND. EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A CELEBRITY CHEF, AND STAR OF TRAVEL CHANNEL'S "BIZARRE FOODS WITH ANDREW ZIMMERN." PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW ZIMMERN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEFORE WE GET STARTED, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE TENTH SEASON.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
Stephen: OH, YES.
YES.
Stephen: WHY BIZARRE FOODS? AT ANY POINT, DID YOU EVER SAY TO YOURSELF, WHY DIDN'T I JUST NAME THIS SHOW "FOODS?"
I WANTED TO CALL IT "THE WANDERING SPOON," POSSIBLY THE WORST TITLE IN THE HISTORY OF FOOD TELEVISION. THANK GOD THAT DIDN'T WORK. THE IDEA IS, FOR ME AT LEAST, THE STORIES THAT ARE MOST INTERESTING-- AND FOOD IS GOOD, BUT FOOD WITH A STORY IS BETTER. AND THE BEST STORIES ARE THE ONES ON THE FRINGE, AND THE FRINGES ARE THE EDGES, WHERE THINGS-- THERE IS NO CHICKEN BREAST, THERE IS FERMENTED WALRUS TUSCHES.
WALRUS BUTT.
SURE, EUROPE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. LOW COUNTRY.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE LOW COUNTRY?
MANY TIMES.
Stephen: WHAT'S BIZARRE IN THE LOW COUNTRY?
WE ATE SOME WATERFOWEL, SOME TINY LITTLE BIRDS THAT WERE FANTASTIC. ALL PARTS OF THE PIG THAT RODNEY SCOTT DIDN'T THROW ON THE BARBECUE AFTER OPENING UP THAT HOG.
Stephen: CHIT LINS?
UP THE WAZOO.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY FOOD THAT'S TOO BIZARRE IF YOU TO EAT? FOR INSTANCE, HAVE YOU HAD HUMAN--
WE'VE ALL BITTEN OUR NAILS FROM TIME TO TIME.
Stephen: I'VE BITTEN THE INSIDE OF MY CHEEK FROM TIME TO TIME. SPOILER ALERT-- I'M DLIRS.
Stephen: THEY'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ABOUT YOU FOR YEARS AND THAT'S WHY YOU WERE OUR FINAL HUMAN. THE MA MADAGASCAR EPISODE DURING THE CIRC UP SCISSION OF A FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY WAS OFFERED THE FORESKIN AS A SIGN OF RESPECT. THE MATERNAL GRANDFATHER GOT SO ANGRY, HE GRABBED IT FROM ME TO EAT IT, AND THE PATERNAL GRANDFATHER GRABBED IT FROM HIM AND THREW IT DOWN HIS THROAT BEFORE HE COULD REACT AND HE WAS ANGRY THE HONORED GUEST DIDN'T GET IT. AS SOMEONE WHO IS FAMOUS FOR HAVING EATEN EVERYTHING, IF I WAS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA, AND IF THERE WAS THE LONG PIG --
THE LONG PIG BEING US. HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT WE TASTE LIKE?
IT'S LIKE CHICKEN. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
Stephen:  WHAT ARE WE EATING TONIGHT? I HESITATE TO ASK AND I BRACE MYSELF.
TONIGHT WAS THE PREMIERE OF THE NEW SEASON AND WE STARTED OFF IN SPAIN. I'LL START YOU WITH SPAIN. THIS IS THE MOST CLASSIC OF MADRID'S FAMOUS MEAT STEWS. HERE IS EVERYTHING FROM THE PIG, INTESTINE, BELLY, BLOOD SAUSAGE, KNUCKLE, FOOT, A LITTLE PIECE OF BOIN LOIN. YOU MAY WANT TO EXPLORE SOMETHING OVER THERE. CHICK PEA--
WHAT'S THIS?
THAT'S TRIBE.
Stephen: WHAT'S TRIPE?
THE LINING OF THE PIECE OF THE STOMACH.
Stephen: HOLD ON A SECOND. YOU KNOW WHAT? NOT BAD.
Stephen: THE WORD "RUBBERY" COMES TO MIND.
Stephen: IT DOES.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO TRY THE BLOOD SAUSAGE. IT'S DELICIOUS, SEASONED WITH SWEET SPICES AND ONION.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S AMAZING.
Stephen:  DOWN IN THERE A HEARTY BROTH. WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
OKINAWA IS WHERE WE GO A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW, AND THERE THEY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING CALLED YAZUNUN. THEY WERE SORT OF AN OUTLIER NATION AND THEY BELIEVE IN EATING FOODS FOR HEALTH, WELLNESS, AND MEDICINAL REASONS. SO I'M JUST GOING TO PUT A COUPLE OF PAPER-THIN SLICES HERE. AND, YES, OF COURSE, I WASHED MY HANDS. OF RAW GOAT. THEY LOVE RAW GOAT THERE. THERE'S A LITTLE SOY SAUCE.
Stephen: SOY SAUCE THERE.
HOLD ON. A LITTLE LEMON. YOU TELL ME. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.
Stephen: MMM. MMM. THAT IS--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Stephen: THAT'S ACTUALLY FANTASTIC. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN OF BEING A RECOVERED ADDICT. IS FOOD A FORM OF ADDICTION FOR YOU?
WELL, I'M OBSESSED WITH IT. YOU TELL ME. THE PROBLEM WITH MOST PEOPLE IS IF YOU HAVE A PERSONALITY CHANGE AND IT STARTS TO RULE YOUR LIFE IN A CERTAIN WAY IT'S A PROBLEM. IT'S PROBABLY MORE OF A WORKAHOLIC THAN FOODAHOLIC. 25 YEARS CLEAN AND SOBER FROM THE STUFF THAT WAS GOING TO KILL ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHAT DO WE HAVE NEXT? OKAY, I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, AND IT LOOKS QUESTIONABLE AT A DISTANCE HERE.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.
Stephen: THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE YOU FOUND THAT BY THE HIGHWAY?
THAT'S MASHED PLANTAINS. THIS IS FROM OUR BRONX EPISODE.
Stephen: PLANTAIN. I HAD HANDLE THAT?
TRY THE MEAT IN THAT. THIS IS A HODUTU, WHICH THEY USUALLY MAKE WITH FISH AND PLANTAIN BUT THEY MAKE IT WITH POSSUM.
Stephen: THAT'S POSSUM. THAT'S POSSUM. ( LAUGHTER ).
HERE TO CELEBRATE-- IT'S FANTASTIC.
Stephen: WERE YOU-- WERE YOU FRESH OUT OF RAT? ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT RAT, BUT ACTUALLY, YOU MIGHT. POSSUM HAS TO BE PURGED BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY ANIMALS IN THE WORLDS THAT EATS DEAD THINGS.
Stephen: FANTASTIC!
AT LEAST IT'S NOT RABID.
Stephen: FOR INSTANCE TMIGHT HAVE EATEN THIS.
THIS IS THE GREATEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD. A TRIBUTE TO SENEGAL, ONE THE OF THE GREAT MEAT CULTURES ON EARTH. TRY IT WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF BREAD. THIS IS ROASTED SHEEP'S BRAIN. JUST A LITTLE LEMON AND SALT. IT'S BETTER-- BELIEVE ME, IT'S BETTER THAN FOIS GRAS, AND BONE MARROW PUT TOGETHER.
Stephen: HOLD ON. I'M SO SORRY.
AND A DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, PART, THE WHOLE WORLD EATS NO TO TAIL. YOU GREW UP IN NOSE-TO-TAIL CULTURE.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GO WITH THAT?
A NICE PIN ON THE NOIR.
Stephen: OH, YES, MY FRIEND.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT WAS DELICIOUS AND A HORROR SHOW AT THE SAME TIME.
AND NOW YOU'VE CROSSED IT OFF YOUR BUCKET LIST.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANDREW ZIMMERN, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE TENTH SEASON. THE TENTH SEASON OF "BIZARRE FOODS" AIRS ON THE TRAVEL CHANNEL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'VE NEVER HAD BRAIN. THAT WAS FANTASTIC. LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE UZO ADUBA, NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY ADIA VICTORIA.
