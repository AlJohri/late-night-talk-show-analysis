SO WHAT DO YOU DO TONIGHT?
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO SEE A MOVIE.
COOL, HAVE FUN.
SEE YA. ( PHONE RINGING ).
HELLO, YOU HAVE REACHED MOVIE PHONE. PLEASE SELECT A MOVIE. YOU HAVE SELECTED A MOVIE THAT FEATURES AN ACTOR ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO CONTINUE, PRESS 1. IF YOU'D LIKE TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT MOVIE, PRESS 2. YOU PRESSED 1. CONTINUE. CLEARLY, YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN SEPARATE A PERSON'S ARTISTIC CONTRIBUTIONS FROM HIS REPREHENSIBLE BIEFER. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT YOU? PRESS 1 FOR "NORMAL PERSON." PRESS 2002 F 2 FOR "SICK INDIVID YOU PRESSED 1 FOR "NORMAL." GUESS WHAT? I'M NOT SELLING YOU A TICKET. MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL FANDANGO. TO LEARN HOW MOVIE PHONE DISCONTINUED IN 2014 IS STILL A REFERENCE IN A COMEDY BIT, PRESS 2. TO START "THE LATE SHOW,"" PRESS 3.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES: NORAH O'DONNELL AND MUSICAL GUESTS DEAD AND COMPANY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TOO KIND! IT'S FRIDAY! FRIDAY! THANK YOU OPINION WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME, ONE AND ALL, TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I-- I AM SO, SO PLEASED AND HONORED TO BE YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. WELL, IT IS FRIDAY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU CAN'T CONTROL THEM. IT'S A FRIDAY AUDIENCE. YOU CAN'T CONTROL THEM. THEY'RE LIKE WILD HORSES. AND YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT FRIDAY MEANS-- THERE IS MORE SEXUAL HARASSMENT NEWS. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S ALSO TRUE OF SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH SEXUAL HARASSMENT NEWS THIS WEEK, I WASN'T ABLE TO TOUCH ON IT ALL. NOT THAT I WANTED TO.  (  LAUGHTER  ) CLEAR! SEXUAL HARASSMENT REVELATIONS HAVE NOW REACHED CAPITOL HILL, AND AS A RESULT, "CONGRESS WILL IMPLEMENT MANDATORY SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING." THAT'S GREAT! BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THROW AN "ANTI-" IN THERE.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST SPRINKLE IT IN.
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: THEY GOT THE HARASSMENT DOWN. NOW, AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING THIS WEEK, CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEIER SHARED STORIES FROM COLLEAGUES WHO CONFIDED IN HER, AND THE STORIES RANGED FROM "HARASSERS EXPOSING THEIR GENITALS TO VICTIMS HAVING THEIR PRIVATE PARTS GRABBED ON THE HOUSE FLOOR." ON THE HOUSE "FLOOR"! HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? (IN SOUTHERN ACCENT ) "THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM ALABAMA, AND ALSO THE KNOCKERS ON THE LADY FROM MISSOURI-- THE SHOW 'EM TO ME STATE!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW--
Jon: THIS IS STRANGE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: SPEIER, MADE IT CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS AFFECTING CONGRESS RIGHT NOW.
IN FACT, THERE ARE TWO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS-- REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT-- RIGHT NOW, WHO SERVE, WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REVIEW OR NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REVIEW, BUT HAVE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
Stephen: A REPUBLICAN AND A DEMOCRAT? GUYS, THIS ISN'T WHAT WE MEAN BY "REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA COMSTOCK TOLD A STORY ABOUT A MALE LAWMAKER, WHO "ASKED A YOUNG FEMALE STAFFER TO BRING SOME PAPERWORK TO HIM AT HOME. HE ANSWERED THE DOOR IN NOTHING BUT A TOWEL. AT THAT POINT, HE DECIDED TO EXPOSE HIMSELF." I'M GUESSING HE DECIDED THAT WHEN HE PUT THE TOWEL ON.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN FACT, FEMALE STAFFERS HAVE LONG HAD AN INFORMAL LIST OF MALE POLITICIANS ON CAPITOL HILL TO AVOID, KNOWN AS "THE CREEP LIST"-- ALSO KNOWN AS THE "FREAK FILE," "THE LETCH LEDGER," AND THE "TROLL-O-DEX."  (  LAUGHTER  ) IN ADDITION, FEMALE LAWMAKERS FOLLOW A SECRET SET OF RULES DESIGNED TO HELP THEM GET BY IN THIS TOXIC CULTURE, KNOWN AS, "BEING EXTRA CAREFUL OF THE MALE LAWMAKERS WHO SLEEP IN THEIR OFFICES, AND AVOIDING FINDING YOURSELF ALONE WITH A CONGRESSMAN OR SENATOR IN ELEVATORS, LATE-NIGHT MEETINGS, OR EVENTS WHERE ALCOHOL IS FLOWING." OKAY, SO DON'T GO TO PARTIES, ELEVATORS, OR WORK. SOLVED!  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) KIND OF YOU YOU, LADIES. KIND OF ON YOU. WITH SO MANY PROBLEMS IN OUR WORLD, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TACKLING ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY-- NOT ENOUGH DEAD ELEPHANTS. BECAUSE, YESTERDAY THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED "THAT THE REMAINS OF ELEPHANTS LEGALLY HUNTED IN ZIMBABWE AND ZAMBIA CAN BE IMPORTED AS TROPHIES, REVERSING A BAN UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA."
Audience: BOOO!
Stephen: "I HATE OBAMA SO MUCH, I'M GOING TO STRANGLE DUMBO." BUT TRUMP HAS FINALLY FULFILLED HIS CORE PROMISE TO WORKING-CLASS, RUST-BELT WHITE VOTERS THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO BRING BACK EXOTIC GAME MEATS FROM THEIR AFRICAN SAFARIS.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE ALL REMEMBER THOSE HATS, "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND, ALSO, LET'S GET SOME ELEPHANT CARCASSES UP IN HERE."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THIS IS-- YEAH. I REMEMBER THAT. I REMEMBER THOSE HATS. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING, BECAUSE THE FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT IS OVERSEEN BY "RIDE WITH NORMAN REEDUS." I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO IS STUFFED. ZINKE, ZINKE IS COMMITMENTED--  ( APPLAUSE ) SWRIMPGY IS COMMITTED TO ANIMAL CONSERVATION, SPECIFICALLY IN HIS OFFICE. BECAUSE HE BROUGHT IN A TAXIDERMY MENAGERIE TO DECORATE HIS EXECUTIVE SUITE. THAT'S RIGHT-- THE ONLY TRUMP OFFICIAL TO HAVE MORE CORPSES IN HIS OFFICE IS STEVE BANNON. BUT-- BUT IF YOU ASK ME, THIS ELEPHANT TROPHY IDEA HAS GOT TO BE THE BRAINCHILD OF ERIC AND DONALD TRUMP JR.-- NEITHER OF WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP'S BRAINCHILD. BOTH OF THEM, THESE TWO FELLAS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE LOVE THE SONS. WE LOVE THE SONS. BOTH OF THEM ARE KNOWN TO BE AVID BIG-GAME HUNTERS. THERE'S EVEN THAT INFAMOUS PHOTO OF DON JR. HOLDING THE SEVERED TAIL OF AN ELEPHANT. ACTUALLY, I KNOW THAT'S TOUGH TO LOOK AT. JIM, CAN WE MAKE THAT LESS DISTURBING? THANK YOU. JUST COULDN'T LOOK AT THAT. JUST COULDN'T LOOK AT THAT ANY LONGER. NOW THAT TRUMP IS BACK FROM ASIA, HE CAN GET BACK TO THE MAIN BUSINESS OF HIS PRESIDENCY BEING INVESTIGATED BY ROBERT MUELLER. OF COURSE, SOME REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING TO GET RID OF MUELLER, LIKE TEXAS REPUBLICAN AND MR. BURNS AFTER BOTOX, LOUIE GOHMERT. DURING JEFF SESSIONS' TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THIS WEEK, GOHMERT TRIED TO GEL MUELLER AND OTHERS FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DISQUALIFIED FROM INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT BY CLAIMING THEY WERE IN CAHOOTS WITH HILLARY AND THE RUSSIANS. AND YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE BECAUSE HE HAD A CHART.
MY TIME IS RUNNING OUT, BUT WE'VE GOT A CHART HERE THAT SHOWS JUST HOW INTEGRAL THE RELATIONSHIP IS WITH MR. ROSENSTEIN, MR. MUELLER, AND TO THIS WHOLE "URANIUM ONE" THING. IT SURE STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN.
Stephen: YEAH, IT DOES STINK, BECAUSE LOUIS GOHMERT JUST CHARTED.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LOUIS GOHMERT, STUPID BUT DEADLY. AND GOHMERT'S CHART SHOWS A FASCINATING WEB OF OF LIES, DECEIT, MOONS, STARS, AND CLOVERS. SO LET'S DIG INTO IT. BRING IT OUT, GUYS! LET'S SEE THAT CHART!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, BEHOLD THE MOUTH OF MADNESS. THIS IS THE ACTUAL CHART LOUIS GOHMERT HELD UP. LET'S PLAY CANDYLAND. NOW, IF YOU START HERE AT OBAMA AND FOLLOW THE LINE OVER, YOU GET TO WHITE HOUSE STAFFER BEN RHODES, THEN FOLLOW THIS LINE UP AND TO THE LEFT, AND DOWN AND OVER YOU GET ANOTHER OBAMA! MY GOD, THERE ARE TWO OF THEM! IS THE SECOND ONE STILL ELIGIBLE TO BE PRESIDENT? PLEASE?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OBAMA, OBAMA, OKAY. NOW, LUCKILY FOR THE BARACKS OBAMA, THERE ARE ALSO TWO OBAMA STATE DEPARTMENTS, ONE DOWN HERE, OKAY. AND THIS ONE UP HERE, WHICH IS SO OUT OF CONTROL, THAT IT'S BREECHED THE CONFINES OF ITS CONSPIRACY DIAMOND. NOW, MOST OF THESE CONNECTIONS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT LINES-- FOR INSTANCE, THE ONE THAT GOES STRAIGHT FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER TO VADIM MIKERIN. DOWN HERE. NOW, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHO THAT IS, WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE I CAN'T. BUT SOME OF THE LINES ARE TRICKIER, LIKE THE LINK BETWEEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HERE. THEN IT STARTS ZIGGIN' AND ZAGGIN' ALL THE WAY TO THE SCARY GREY OVAL "ROSATOM," WHICH I BELIEVE WAS ROSEANNE AND TOM ARNOLD'S CELEBRITY COUPLE NAME.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT? NOW, OF COURSE, DOTTED LINES INDICATE A MORE TENUOUS LINK. NATURALLY ON CHARTS. THESE ARE UNPROVEN TENUOUS LINKS. AND THERE'S NO WAY TO CONFIRM A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER DOWN HERE. DOWN HERE IS "TENEX," WHICH IS THE NAME OF A RUSSIAN ENERGY COMPANY. BUT IT'S ALSO THE NAME OF AN A.D.H.D. DRUG, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN WHAT WHOEVER MADE THIS CHART WAS SNORTING. UP HERE-- COME WITH ME NOW! COME WITH ME! WOOOO! IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW! WOOO! DADDY'S ON FIRE! UP HERE, IT SAYS "FAST AND FURIOUS," WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THEY'RE SHOWING AT THE MOVIE THEATER ON THIS MALL MAP. AND THERE YOU HAVE IT: THE COMPLEX NETWORK OF POWER AND CASH THAT HILLARY CLINTON CYNICALLY LEVERAGED TO GAIN COMPLETE CONTROL OF ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. BUT IT'S ALL JUST A COLORFUL DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL STORY: THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S TIES TO RUSSIA. LUCKILY, I'VE GOT MY OWN CHART TO LAY OUT THAT SCANDAL.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY. NOW, WATCH CAREFULLY AS I SHOW YOU THE COMPLEX LINK BETWEEN OUR PRESIDENT AND RUSSIA.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOUIS GOHMERT, GIVE ME A CALL IF THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT! NORAH O'DONNELL IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, THERE ARE SOME TECH START-UPS THAT SHOULD MAYBE STOP DOWN. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND. JON, JON, I'M PRETTY EXCITED. YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING-- PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. YOU GUYS ARE PLAYING A LITTLE GRATEFUL DEAD OVER THERE.
Jon: WE'RE ROCKING IT.
Stephen: STICK AROUND. PEOPLE IN HERE, WE HAVE A GREAT TREAT TONIGHT ASHT HOME, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS. WE'VE GOT DEAD AND COMPANY. IT'S THE GRATEFUL DEADLINE FLUS + JOHN MAYER PLAYING WITH THE GRATEFUL DEAD. AMAZING CONCERT COMING UP. WE ALL KNOW THAT SILICON VALLEY IS WHERE THE WORLD'S MOST BRILLIANT MINDS COME TOGETHER TO HELP HUMANITY REACH ITS HIGHEST POTENTIAL, WHICH IS SHOPPING ON THE TOILET.  (  LAUGHTER  ) CHRISTMAS IS COMING. AND INNOVATION DON'T COME CHEAP. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, VENTURE CAPITALISTS INVESTED IN TECH COMPANIES TO THE TUNE OF $1.65 BILLION. NOW, SURE, PUERTO RICO DOESN'T HAVE WATER OR POWER, BUT SOON THEY MIGHT HAVE BLUETOOTH WAFFLE IRONS! THERE ARE JUST SO MANY GREAT TECH-PORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW, AND I WANT IN-- WHICH LEADS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, "GO FUND YOURSELF." NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK IN OPEN-CONCEPT OFFICES, BUT PRIVACY CAN BE AN ISSUE, SO INVESTORS ARE BANKING ON A NEW PRODUCT CALLED HUSH-ME, A PERSONAL ACOUSTIC DEVICE THAT PROTECTS SPEECH PRIVACY IN OPEN-SPACE ENVIRONMENTS. GREAT-- EXCEPT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING A SERIAL KILLER MAKES HIS VICTIMS WEAR. "IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN, OR ELSE IT WEARS THE HUSH-ME PERSONAL ACOUSTIC DEVICE." I'D HUSH ME.  ( LAUGHTER ) HUSH-ME MUFFLES YOUR VOICE, PLUS IT HAS SPEAKERS THAT PLAY NOISE TO COVER UP YOUR CALL, NOISES LIKE OCEAN, MONKEY, DARTH VADER, AND MINION. SO, YOU CAN GO FROM BEING THE GUY WHO TAKES PHONE CALLS AT THE OFFICE AND IS KIND OF ANNOYING, TO THE GUY WHO PLAYS MINION SOUNDS AT THE OFFICE AND WHOSE BODY HAS STILL NOT BEEN FOUND.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT'S A GREAT INVENTION. I'M GIVING IT FOR CHRISTMAS TO AT LEAST ONE PERSON.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S A GOOD LOOK. THAT'S A GOOD LOOK.
Jon: I WONDER WHO?
Stephen: BUT SILICON VALLEY REALLY LOVES A COMPANY THAT CAN DISRUPT. NETFLIX DISRUPTED THE WAY YOU WATCH MOVIES, UBER DISRUPTED THE WAY YOU GET RIDES, TINDER DISTRUPTED THE WAY YOU DATE-- UNLESS YOU WERE ALREADY HOOKING UP WITH POLYAMOROUS D.J.'S NAMED "DAKOTA." AND THE NEXT GAME-CHANGING TECH DISRUPTER IS THE PAUSE POD, A PRIVATE POP-UP RELAXATION SPACE FOR AT HOME, ON THE GO, EVEN AT WORK. POP-UP RELAXATION? LET'S LOOK AT THE LATEST CUTTING EDGE DEVELOPMENTS IN... IT'S A TENT! IT'S A TENT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT'S A TENT. TECH DUDES-- TECH-- TECH DUDES, STOP INVENTING THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY THINGS! THERE ARE SO MANY NONTHINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE INVENTED. HOW ABOUT SOME PANTS THAT AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER MY WALLET TO THE NEXT PANTS I'M WEARING? I WOULD OFFER YOU MONEY TO DEVELOP THAT, BUT I LEFT MY WALLET IN MY OTHER PANTS.  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND THIS TENT RAN A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN THAT RAISED $146,000. NOW, I KNOW YOU CAN GET A TENT ON AMAZON FOR, LIKE, TWENTY BUCKS, BUT PAUSE POD NEEDED THE EXTRA $146,000 TO DEVELOP THE LEG-SLEEVE. OH, YOU GOTTA HAVE THE LEG-SLEEVE. OTHERWISE, THIS THING WOULD BE STUPID. CHECK OUT SOME OF THE PROMO MATERIAL. YOU JUST SET UP YOUR PAUSE POD, AND TAKE A NAP IN YOUR OFFICE! WAIT, WAIT-- WHERE IS THIS OFFICE WHERE YOU CAN JUST SET UP A NAP TENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR? ARE THEY HIRING?  (  LAUGHTER  ) PAUSE POD IS ALSO GREAT FOR MAKING CHILDREN IN THE PARK PAUSE YOUR RIDDLES, TAKING A LOAD OFF WHILE ANOTHER MAN RAISES YOUR CHILD, OR EATING YOUR SHAMEFUL WORK BANANA.  (  LAUGHTER  ) NO MATTER HOW YOU USE IT-- WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP. HOWEVER YOU USE IT, POD PAUSE MAKES A STATEMENT, SPECIFICALLY, "IS RICK OKAY? HE JUST TOOK HIS BANANA INTO HIS LITTLE TENT, AGAIN. THERE'S NOTHING SHARP IN THERE, IS THERE?" THE INVENTORS CAUGHT A LOT OF HEAT FOR THE PAUSE POD-- YOU KNOW, BEING A TENT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT INSTEAD OF ISSUING AN APOLOGY, THEY GAVE AN INTERVIEW IN WHICH THEY SAID, "WE NEVER CLAIMED IT'S NOT A TENT," ADDING, "...SUCKEERRRRRRRS!" ZZZIIIPPPPPP.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, DADDY'S GOT TO GET HIS BEAK WET, TOO, SO I'M DISRUPTING THE INTRA-OFFICE PRIVACY GAME WITH MY OWN INVENTION. IT'S CALLED CUBLY. CUBLY IS THE ULTIMATE OFFICE HACK. IT BRINGS A BRAND NEW USER INTERFACE TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART WEARABLE TECH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) DISRUPTED YET? PLUS-- PLUS, CHECK IT OUT.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BANANA HOLE!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BANANA HOLE! DOES BANANA STAIN?  (  LAUGHTER  ) I'M ASKING FOR A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN SEED FUNDING, WHICH WILL GO TOWARDS MATERIALS, STAFF, AND OUR BRAND NEW 4,000-SQUARE-FOOT OFFICE SPACE IN PALO ALTO. WE HAVE A CHEF THERE WHO MAKES CREPES IN A SWEAT LODGE. AND, REMEMBER, I NEVER SAID IT'S NOT A CARDBOARD BOX. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH NORAH O'DONNELL.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS A JOURNALIST AND ONE OF THE CO-HOSTS OF "CBS THIS MORNING." PLEASE WELCOME NORAH O'DONNELL! HELLO! GOOD TO SEE YOU.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HELLO!
HI!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO BE HERE! HI, EVERYBODY!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD YOU ON JUST BY YOUR LONESOME, BECAUSE YOU'VE COME ON HERE WITH CHARLIE AND GAYLE.
YES, MY TWO MORNING COHOST S.
Stephen:  AND YOU GUYS JUST CELEBRATED YOUR FIFTH YEAR TOGETHER AT "CBS THIS MORNING." AND YOU CARRY THOSE GUYS, RIGHT? LAYOFF LAUGH COME ON. THEY'RE NOT HERE.
I'M GLAD SOMEBODY NOTICED.
Stephen: YES! YOU SHOULD HEAR THE THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.
I KNOW.
Stephen: CHARLIE ROSE, PUT OUT A SAUCER AND MILK-- MEOW! THAT GUY.
I KNOW.
Stephen: CATTY!
WE LOVE HIM. ADORE HIM.
Stephen: LOVELY, LOVELY, FELLOW. SO, OF COURSE, IS GAYLE. I BET YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST MET.
OH, MAN! THEY DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME THIS.
Stephen: IT ISN'T ON THE CARD. THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THIS.
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME WE MET.
Stephen: IT WAS IN 2005.
OH, WOW.
Stephen: I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. IT WAS THE LAST WEEKEND IN APRIL IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
Stephen: THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.
I'M FAST.
Stephen: JAKE TAPPER INTRODUCED ME TO YOU.
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME THEN.
Stephen: I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T WORK FOR CBS AT THE TIME. BUT YOU DIDN'T, EITHER, RIGHT?
NO, NBC.
Stephen: NBC. NEVER HEARD OF IT.
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE WE WORK FOR CBS.
Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THE EYE. SO YOU'VE BEEN A WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR-- FOR THIS, FOR CBS AND FOR NBC. AND YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS ALL THE THE TIME. I HAVE TO FOR THIS JOB. WE TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION. HOW ARE YOU SLEEPING AT NIGHT? BECAUSE MY EYES WON'T STOP TWITCHING.
I KNOW.
Stephen: THE WORLD IS A CLOGGED DRAIN.
I KNOW. IT IS-- I FEEL LIKE THE NEWS THESE DAYS, IT'S SORT OF LIKE TRYING TO SIP WATER FROM A FIRE HOSE. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT THAT. IT'S JUST COMING SO FAST AT US.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, IT CHANGES IMMEDIATELY. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MANIES YOU GUYS HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR SCRIPT JUST IN THE COURSE OF YOUR SHOW.
OUR SHOW IS TWO HOURS LIVE EVERY MORNING. WE SIT AROUND THE TABLE FROM 7:00 TO 9:00 AND CAN THERE ARE MEANS TIME WE TAKE THE SCRIPT AND THROW IT OUT AND DO LIVE TELEVISION, SOMETIMES UNTIL NOON IF THERE'S A BREAKING NEWS EVENT. WHEN THERE WAS THAT TERRIBLE TERRORIST ATTACK HERE, THE WORST TERRORIST ATTACK SINCE 9/11. WE DID THE SHOW STRAIGHT. WHEN STEVE SCALISE, THE CONGRESSMAN, WAS SHOT. WE DID THE SHOW SIX HOURS STRAIGHT. IT FEELS LIKE THE HURRICANES THIS YEAR-- IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF NEWS THIS YEAR.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT'S THE FUNCTION OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN NEWS OR DO YOU THINK IT'S LITERALLY A DONALD TRUMP EFFECT?  (  LAUGHTER  ) BECAUSE-- NO, I'M NOT JOKING. I'M GLAD YOU'RE LAUGHING BUT I'M NOT JOKING. BECAUSE HE'S THE LOCUST OF ALL NEWS. THE NEWS IS SOMEHOW AROUND HIM, IF HE HAS HIS SAY, AND A MOMENT'S NOTICE. HE GOES AROUND REAL NEWS PEOPLE LIKE AND YOU USES TWITTER. HE MAKES THE NEWS EVERY TIME HE TALKS, AND HE TALKS AT THE ODDEST TIMES.
LOOK, I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME FOR JOURNALISM, BECAUSE THE SMARTPHONE, WHICH WE ALL HAVE, ENABLES US TO DO A LOT OF THINGS. IT ALLOWS US TO NOT ONLY BE CITIZEN JOURNALISTS -- TAKE PICTUREES OF EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING-- BUT WE CAN CONSUME NEWS A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY. AND THAT'S, I THINK, ULTIMATELY, A GOOD THING. I THINK AN INFORMED ELECTORATE IS A GOOD THING. I THINK THE CHALLENGE, THOUGH, IS NOT JUST READING THE HEADLINE S.
Stephen:  YEAR, HOW INFORMED ARE WE, REALLY. A LOT OF IT IS FAKE NEWS, NORAH. A LOT OF IT. A LOT. YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT. EVERYBODY IS TELLING ME. EVERYBODY IS SAYING.
NOT AT CBS.
Stephen: REALLY.
NOT AT "CBS THIS MORNING."
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME YOU AGREE WITH ME? >>. DOESN'T SHE AGREE WITH ME? DOESN'T SHE AGREE WITH ME? THEY WON'T EVEN DO IT FOR YOU.
SO I DO THINK-- AND I THINK ABOUT THAT PERSONALLY AS A JOURNALIST, IS THE CHALLENGE TO GO BEYOND THE HEADLINES, RIGHT. AND I TRY AND READ THE NEWSPAPER ALL THE WAY TO THE LAST GRAPH. DO THE JUMP PAGE, FOR ANYBODY WHO STILL RESIDENT THE HARD COPY OF THE NEWSPAPER LIKE I DO.
Stephen: DO YOU DO THE WORD SCRAMBLE AND THAT KIND OF STUFF?
I DO. I HAVE MY LITTLE YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER AND READ TO THE END, WHETHER IT'S THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION OR DONAL DONALD TR TRIP IN ASIA AND WHAT HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ACHIEVED OVER THERE SOMETIMES COMES LATER IN THE STORY OR IN THE 8:30 HOUR ON "CBS THIS MORNING." SEE THAT PROMO I GOT IN THERE?
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU COVERED THE WHITE HOUSE FOR BOTH CBS AND NBC, WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE COVERING IT NOW? LIKE, HOW IS IT DIFFERENT TO COVER THE WHITE HOUSE NOW, DO YOU THINK, THAN BACK IN THE HALCYON DAYS?
IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT. THE OTHER-- THE INTERESTING THING IS TRUMP THE OTHER DAY WHO HAD TROUBLE HTO REACH FOR A BOTTLE OF WATER. THE LAST PRESIDENTS I COVERED THERE WOULD BE A NICE GLASS OF WATER THERE WITH NO COVER ON IT. AND NOW HE HAS TO DRINK OUT OF THE BOTTLES. PRESIDENTS DON'T USUALLY HAVE TO DO THAT.
Stephen: MAYBE PRESIDENTS HAVE BETTER HAND-EYE COORDINATION.  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK HE WAS-- HE WAS-- HE WAS-- I THINK HE WAS FAILING HIS APCAR TEST WHEN HE DID THAT. THE WORK THAT YOU DO NOW, OF COURSE, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE-- YOU WERE--
REPORTING.
Stephen: THAT YOU WERE COVERING THINGS.
LOOK, THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOMEWHAT ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPORTERS WHO COVER THEM. PRESIDENTS DON'T LIKE TO ALWAYS HAVE-- OR THEIR STAFF HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT THEY'RE DOING, AND IT'S JOURNALISTS' JOBS TO REPORT WHAT THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD IS DOING. THIS WHITE HOUSE IS PUBLIC P.C.LY DIFFICULT. AND, ALSO, THIS PRESIDENT HAS FOUND THE WAY TO GET THROUGH WHAT GEORGE W. BUSH USED TO CALL THE FILTER. "YOU GUYS IN THE MEDIA ARE THE FILTER. I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE FILTER." TRUMP HAS FIGURED OUT A WAY NOT TO USE THE FILTER. HE TWEETS IT. THAT'S JUST A PRESS RELEASE. THAT DOESN'T GIVE US CONTEXT. THAT DOESN'T GIVE US DEPTH. I THINK IT'S CHALLENGING TO BE A WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT RIGHT NOW. I DON'T ENVY THEIR POSITION.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE, NOT JUST ON AMERICAN TV, BUT I UNDERSTAND TV IN KOREA AS WELL.
OH, MAN.
Stephen: BECAUSE I LEARNED THAT YOU'RE AN ARMY KID AND YOUR DAD WAS STATIONED IN SOUTH KOREA.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE QUITE YOUNG, AND WE HAVE SOME FOOT ANNUAL OF YOU HERE. HOW DOES THIS-- YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME. HOW OLD ARE YOU IN THIS FOOTAGE HERE.
10 YEARS OLD. THAT WAS 33 YEARS AGO. THIS TAPE WAS ACTUALLY-- THIS IS MY FIRST TIME I WAS EVER REALLY ON TELEVISION, MY FIRST JOB.
Stephen: AND YOU USED YOUR OWN NAME? NOT A STAGE NAME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
HI, THIS IS NORAH. YES, THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS. VOICE. VOICE. NORAH DREAMED THAT SHE MET CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, BYE-BYE, EVERYBODY.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT LAST SHOT IS PERFECT.
I KNOW.
Stephen: THE NEXT THING IS REALLY SERIOUS. THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS. YOU ARE MARRIED TO CHEF JEFF. JEFF WHAT'S YOUR HUSBAND'S LAST NAME?
TRACEY.
Stephen: JEFF TRACEY, IN D.C., FAMOUS CHEF JEFF. WHAT'S HIS RESTAURANT?
THEY'RE CHEF JEFF.
Stephen: AND HE'S G-E-O-F-F.
Stephen: DO YOU TAKE COOKING SERIOUSLY? WHAT'S BRUNCH IN YOUR HOUSE?
BACON, BACON, AND BACON.
Stephen: IS THIS MADE UP OR IS THIS FOR REAL?
THIS IS FOR REAL. OUR LICENSE PLATE-- THIS IS MY HUSBAND-- SAYS "BACON." YES.
Stephen: WOW
AND IT DOES GET A LOT OF GOOD-- IN FACT, MY GIRLFRIEND JUST CALLED ME TODAY, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "I WAS AT THE STORE AND I FOUND BACON CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS. I'M DROPPING THEM OFF AT YOUR HOUSE."
Stephen: WOW, WOW. DO YOU HAVE A SPECIAL DISH THAT YOU BRING TO--
I'M NOT A-- MY HUSBAND IS A TRAINED CHEF. BUT I JUST SORT OF PICK UP STUFF. BUT I MAKE BANANA BREAD, LEME POPPY SEED BREAD.
Stephen: I MAKE BANANA BREAD.
IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS MINE.
Stephen: IT'S REALLY MY WIFE'S RECIPE. I'LL CRUSH YOU.
I'LL CRUSH YOU.
Stephen: I'LL CRUSH YOU AND SPRINKLE NUTMEG ON YOU WHEN I'M DONE.
I DON'T PUT NUTMEG IN MY BANANA BREAD.
Stephen: YOU DON'T. YOU'RE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD. YOU PUT GINGER IN IT. PLEASE TELL ME THAT I'M WORKING WITH SOMEBODY WHO PUTS GINGER IN THEIR BREAD.
I DO USE GINGER. WHEN YOU SAID "MY WIFE'S RECIPE."
Stephen: IT'S MY WIFE'S RECIPE.
OKAY WELL I HAVE MY OWN RECIPE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE BANANA BREAD BAKEOFF.
Stephen: LET'S DO IT. WE'LL DO IT ON "CBS THIS MORNING." YOU GUYS DO LOTS OF COOKING SEGMENTES, RIGHT?
WE DON'T DO ANY COOKING SEGMENTS. WE'RE ALL ABOUT NEWS.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALL ABOUT HARD NEWS. BUT YOU'RE ALL HARD NEWS, RIGHT.
.
HOW DO YOU GUYS DRESS UP FOR HALLOWEEN ON "CBS THIS MORNING"?
THE SCARIEST COSTUMES OF ALL-- OURSELVES. WE DID NOT DRESS UP FOR HALLOWEEN.
Stephen: YOU NEVER DRESS UP FOR HALLOWEEN.
WE DON'T DRESS UP. OUR SHOW IS DIFFERENT IN THE MORNING.
Stephen: IT IS.
WE SAY "THE NEWS IS BACK IN THE MORNING." EVEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT FAKE NEWS, WE WOULD SAY, "MORE REL NEWS AHEAD SM. AND WE TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. IT REFLECTS WHO CHARLIE AND GAYLE AND I. WE DID NOT DRESS UP, BUT I HAVE YOUNG KIDS SO I DRESS UP AT HOME.
Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR COSTUME.
THIS YEAR I DIDN'T DRESS UP.
Stephen: YOU JUST LIED. I JUST FACT CHECKED YOU. YOU JUST LIED. NORAH O'DONNELL. SOR WE, WE'VE GOT TO GO. YOU CAN CATCH NORAH ON "CBS THIS MORNING," MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AT 7:00 A.M. NORAH O'DONNELL, EVERYBODY! STILL AROUND, WE'VE GOT DEAD AND COMPANY WITH JOHN MAYER. ♪♪ LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS, IT HAD TO HAPPEN. WE HAVE COME YET AGAIN TO THE END OF ANOTHER EVENTFUL WEEK HERE IN THE LAND OF THE BRAVE. WE LAUGHED AND CRIED, WE EDITED OUT THE PARTS OF THE SHOW WHERE I CRIED. SO, LET'S LOOK BACK FONDLY AT THE BEST MOMENTS FROM THIS WEEK'S "THE LATE SHOW." THERE HAVE BEEN MORE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE OF ALABAMA CANDIDATE AND MAN WHO DEMONSTRATES HOW TALL YOU HAVE TO BE TO DATE HIM ROY MOORE. NOT EVERYBODY WANTS MOORE ANYMORE WHICH IS WHY SOME REPUBLICAREPUBLICANS ARE FLOATIN IDEA OF DELAYING THE ELECTION IN ORDER TO GET MOORE'S NAME OFF THE BALLOT. WAIT, YOU CAN JUST DO THAT? YOU CAN JUST MOVE AN ELECTION WHERE YOU WANT? IF THAT'S THE CASE, CAN WE MOVE THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL UP TO TONIGHT?  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, WE'VE GOT TIME. MOORE, TO DEFEND HIMSELF, HE WENT ON THE HANNITY RADIO, RIGHT, TO STRONGLY MAKE THINGS MUCH WORSE.
Audience: OOOH!
Stephen: WAIT-- HOW DID YOU JUST MAKE THIS CREEPIER?  (  LAUGHTER  ) "PERMISSION FROM HER MOTHER?" SHE'S A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL, NOT A FIELD TRIP. "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT" AN INCREDIBLE SHOW, THAT SORT OF WAS PRESCIENT ABOUT TRUMP.
SADLY, YES.
Stephen: IT WAS TRUMPING BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THIS--
EXCEPT WE GOT AN EMMY, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FINALLY BACK FROM HIS 12-DAY TRIP TO ASIA. AND ACCORDING TO HIM, THE TRIP WAS A HUGE SUCCESS, BRAGGING TO REPORTERS, "A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT'S ALMOST PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO GO THROUGH 12 DAYS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) REALLY? YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN ASIA FOREVER, RIGHT?  (  LAUGHTER  )
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, LIKE, THIS WAS A WAVE ELECTION. AND SOMEHOW --
Stephen: ONLY HE IS.  ( LAUGHTER ) ONLY HE IS TALKING LIKE THAT.
THAT'S --
Stephen: NOBODY SAID I COULD WIN. NOBODY SAID.
WELL --
Stephen: BIGGEST ELECTORAL VICTORY OF ALL TIME, OF ALL TIME, JOE, OF ALL TIME. I'M SORRY YOUR LADY LOST, BUT THE BIGGEST OF ALL TIME. JEFF SESSIONS' TESTIMONY TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE COVERED A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES, AND SESSIONS HAD THE SAME ANSWER FOR A LOT OF THEM:
I DON'T RECALL. I DON'T RECALL. I DON'T RECALL. I DON'T RECALL IT. I DO NOT RECALL. I DON'T RECALL IT. I DON'T RECALL IT. I DO NOT RECALL.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: NOT A GREAT MEMORY. IN FACT, JUST TO REMEMBER THOSE ANSWERS, HE HAD TO WRITE THEM ON HIS HAND.  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: DO WHITE AUDIENCES AND BLACK AUDIENCES GET FRIGHTENED BY THIS MOVIE IN THE SAME WAY? DO THEY EXPERIENCE THE HORROR IN THE SAME WAY?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK-- I MEAN, I THINK BLACK PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE THE SECOND-- THE MOVIE COMES UP AND, LIKE, THE PROTAGONIST IS DATING A WHITE GIRG GIRL. THEY GO, "OH, HE'S IN TROUBLE. I DON'T LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING. HE'S IN AN INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIP. GET OUT, BROTHER."
Stephen: UH-HUH. AND WHITE AUDIENCES GO, "THAT'S VERY PROGRESSIVE."
