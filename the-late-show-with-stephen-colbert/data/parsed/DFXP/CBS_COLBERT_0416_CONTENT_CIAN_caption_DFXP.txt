YOU'VE SEEN THE POWERFUL KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY "THE VIETNAM WAR." NOW GET READY FOR THE SEQUEL:  "THE VIETNAM WAR, THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE." VIETNAM WAS A CONTROVERSIAL AND BRUTAL WAR AFFECTING THE LIVES OF MILLIONS, BUT NOBODY HAD IT HARDER THAN DONALD TRUMP. FOR HIS WAR WASN'T FOUGHT IN THE JUNGLES OF SOUTHEAST ASIA. IT WAS FOUGHT IN THE JUNGLES IN HIS SHOES. TRUMP WAS FORCED TO SIT OUT THE WAR DUE TO FOUR SCHOOL DEFERMENTS, AND WHEN HE RAN OUT OF SCHOOL HE GOT ANOTHER DEFERMENT FOR TEMPORARY BONE SPURS, INCURABLE, UNLESS YOU STRETCH OR USE ORTHOTICS. THE SLIGHT INFLAMMATION IN HIS HEELS, MEANT EVERY STEP WAS HIS OWN VIETNAM. AND HE HAD TWO FEET, SO IT WAS LIKE HE HAD TWO VIETNAMS. IF THEY AWARDED A PURPLE HEART FOR MINOR FOOT DISCOMFORT, TRUMP WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST IN LINE.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, RUSSIA INVADES FACEBOOK. PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES JERRY SEINFELD! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, JON, JON, THAT-- YOU KNOW THAT'S A FRIDAY CROWD.
Jon: OH, THAT'S A FRIDAY CROWD.
Stephen: THAT'S A FRIDAY CROWD RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN'T FAKE THAT. NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M HAPPY THIS WEEK IS OVER. I'M READY FOR THE WEEKEND. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS READY FOR THE WEEKEND? DONALD TRUMP. HE TRIED AND FAILED TO REPEAL OBAMACARE FOR THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, "IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, PLEASE STOP." ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, HIS CANDIDATE LOST THE G.O.P. SENATE PRIMARY IN ALABAMA. THAT'S TRUMP'S BASE-- NEXT TO MOSCOW. AND WE'RE LEARNING EXACTLY HOW RUSSIA INFLUENCED THE ELECTION. FOR INSTANCE, "RUSSIA-LINKED TWITTER ACCOUNTS POSED AS AMERICANS AND USED BOT ACCOUNTS TO SPREAD FALSE STORIES." CAN I BELIEVE ANYTHING I READ ON TWITTER? IS BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH REALLY HASHTAG "CUMBER-LICIOUS?" I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: OH, WOW.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M TALKING LIKE THIS.
Jon: YES, YES.
Stephen: AND "FACEBOOK HAS ADMITTED RUSSIAN AGENTS COVERTLY BOUGHT ADS ON THE SITE DURING LAST YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN." YEAH, THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. I BELIEVE THE ADS PROMISED "ONE WEIRD TRICK TO OVERTHROW DEMOCRACY." HE LOOKS GOOD, HE LOOKS GOOD. LOST THAT BELLY FAT. AND TRUMP DENIED GETTING ANY HELP FROM FACEBOOK, TWEETING, "FACEBOOK WAS ALWAYS ANTI-TRUMP. THE NETWORKS WERE ALWAYS ANTI-TRUMP. HENCE, FAKE NEWS. @NYTIMES APOLOGIZED AND @WAPO WERE ANTI-TRUMP. COLLUSION?" SIR, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE IT BUT WHEN YOU END A TWEET WITH "COLLUSION?" IT REALLY FEELS LIKE AN INVITATION: "COLLUSION, ANYONE? JUST RAISE A HAND. ANYONE UP FOR COLLUSION. I'M TRYING TO TAKE A HEAD COUNT FOR PIZZA. HOW MANY FOR COLLUSION?" THEN ON WEDNESDAY, FACEBOOK C.E.O. AND VISIONARY GAP MANNEQUIN, MARK ZUCKERBERG, SAID, "AFTER THE ELECTION, I MADE A COMMENT THAT I THOUGHT THE IDEA THAT MISINFORMATION ON FACEBOOK CHANGED THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION WAS A CRAZY IDEA. CALLING THAT CRAZY WAS DISMISSIVE, AND I REGRET IT." OH, YOU REGRET IT, MARK? THAT'S NICE. WE ALL HAVE REGRETS. I REGRET EATING TOO MANY FUDGE STRIPES AT LUNCH. LET'S SEE IF THAT DESTROYS AMERICA. LET'S GIVE THE KEEBLER ELVES THE LAUNCH CODES. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, UNDER PUBLIC PRESSURE, LAST WEEK, "FACEBOOK AGREED TO TURN OVER THE RUSSIAN-LINKED ADS TO CONGRESS." GREAT. SO THEY'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AS SOON AS AN INTERN TEACHES A BUNCH OF OLD GUYS HOW TO USE FACEBOOK. "NO, SENATOR GRASSLEY, WHEN YOU COMMENT ON SOMEONE'S PICTURE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE, 'SINCERELY, CHARLES E. GRASSLEY.' THEY KNOW IT'S YOU. AND, PLEASE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LICK A STAMP AND PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER. PLEASE DON'T DO THAT." BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE RUSSIANS WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP TRUMP. WHAT WE HAVE FOUND OUT RECENTLY IS THE RUSSIANS WERE ALSO TRYING TO HURT HILLARY BECAUSE THEY USED FACEBOOK TO "BACK BERNIE SANDERS EVEN AFTER HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ENDED." AND RAN ADS IN SUPPORT OF GREEN PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE JILL STEIN. ONE SAID, "CHOOSE PEACE AND VOTE FOR JILL STEIN. TRUST ME, IT'S NOT A WASTED VOTE." I'M PRETTY SURE IF YOU VOTED FOR JILL STEIN, THEY GAVE YOU AN "I WASTED MY VOTE" STICKER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YAY! YAY! AND THE RUSSIANS ARE NO AMATEURS, FOLKS. PEOPLE FAMILIAR ABOUT THE ADS SAY THEY SHOW THE RUSSIANS HAD "A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL DIVIDES IN AMERICAN SOCIETY." THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHERE OUR DEEPEST DIVISIONS ARE-- DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. 1% AND THE WORKING PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE ONE "PROPERTY BROTHER" AND PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE OTHER "PROPERTY BROTHER." NOBODY LIKES DREW! JONATHAN DOES ALL THE WORK! TEAM DREW. MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH, THERE'S TROUBLE BREWING FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY AND LIVE-ACTION DILBERT, TOM PRICE. IT WAS RECENTLY REVEALED THAT PRICE HAS TAKEN AT LEAST 24 FLIGHTS ON PRIVATE CHARTER PLANES AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE SINCE EARLY MAY, RACKING UP A TAB OF $400,000. WOW. WOW. YEAH, SO HE PAID FOR THE EXTRA LEG ROOM. AND PRICE'S WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS COME UNDER FIRE FROM THE KING OF MODERATION, DONALD TRUMP, SEEN HERE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP HAS THREATENED-- HE DOESN'T KNOW YET. HE'LL SEE, HE SAYS. HE MIGHT FIRE PRICE. BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT PRICE IS AN IMPORTANT CABINET MEMBER, AND SOMEONE THAT HIGH UP HAS TO USE A PRIVATE JET FROM TIME TO TIME. EXCEPT FOR PRICE'S PREDECESSOR. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, WHO TOOK ONE PRIVATE FLIGHT TO A REMOTE ALASKAN VILLAGE DURING HER ENTIRE FIVE-YEAR TENURE. OOOOH, PRIVATE JET TO REMOTE ALASKAN VILLAGE. SOMEBODY WAS TOO GOOD TO DRIVE A DOGSLED ACROSS THE TUNDRA? CLASSIC WASHINGTON ELITE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT NOW PRICE IS PAYING THE... COST. YESTERDAY, PRICE ANNOUNCED THAT HE'LL BE REIMBURSING TAXPAYERS FOR THE COST OF THE CHARTER JETS, SAYING, I WILL WRITE A PERSONAL CHECK TO THE U.S. TREASURY FOR THE EXPENSES OF MY TRAVEL." THAT IS MORAL LEADERSHIP, SECRETARY PRICE. GOOD FOR YOU. AND BE SURE TO WRITE ON THE MEMO LINE, "SO I DON'T GET FIRED." PERSONALLY, I WOULD USE MY CREDIT CARD, BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO NEED THOSE FREQUENT FLYER POINTS. AND PRICE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO'S BEEN CAUGHT WITH HIS HAND IN THE TAXPAYER COOKIE JAR. EARLIER THIS SUMMER, TREASURY SECRETARY AND LAWYER WHO ONLY TAKES INDECENT EXPOSURE CASES, STEVE MNUCHIN, ASKED TO USE A $25,000-PER-HOUR GOVERNMENT JET FOR HIS HONEYMOON. NOW, MNUCHIN'S REQUEST WAS DENIED. AND AS PENANCE, HE HAD TO APPEAR ON TV TO PROMISE NEVER TO DO IT AGAIN.
CAN YOU PROMISE THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER THAT WHEN IT'S ON THEIR DIME, AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR-- FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR TENURE IN OFFICE, THAT YOU WILL USE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND AIR FLIGHTS?
I CAN PROMISE THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER THAT THE ONLY TIME THAT I WILL BE USING MIL-AIR IS WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES, EITHER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY OR WHERE WE HAVE TO GET TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT THINGS, THERE'S NO OTHER MEANS.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S CONVINCING. "HONEY, I'LL NEVER CHEAT ON YOU UNLESS VARIOUS SITUATIONS, HOT BABYSITTER, OR I CAN GET SEX BY NO OTHER MEANS." ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS WEEK HASN'T BEEN-- THIS WEEK-- THIS WEEK-- HASN'T BEEN A CAKEWALK FOR TRUMP'S KIDS, EITHER. THERE WAS A WEIRD STORY A COUPLE WEEKS BACK WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S OLDEST SON AND SKI INSTRUCTOR WHO KEEPS TOUCHING YOUR GIRLFRIEND, DONALD TRUMP JR., DECIDED TO FORGO PROTECTION BY THE SECRET SERVICE. IT WAS UNCLEAR AT THE TIME WHY DON JR. GAVE UP HIS GOVERNMENT PROTECTION. BUT WE JUST FOUND OUT HE DITCHED HIS SECRET SERVICE DETAIL TO GO ON A MOOSE HUNT IN THE YUKON. OF COURSE, THIS WASN'T DON JR.'S FIRST HUNTING TRIP. HE'S HUNTED ON SAFARI, HE'S BOWHUNTED DEER, AND HE EVEN ONCE HAD HIMSELF STUFFED AND MOUNTED IN THE FOREST. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT DON JR.'S SECURITY-FREE BACKWOODS SHOOTIN' ADVENTURE BECAUSE A REPORTER SPOTTED HIM IN A CANADIAN AIRPORT, "MILLING AROUND THE BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, LOOKING INCREASINGLY FORLORN, AS IT APPEARED HIS LUGGAGE WAS NOT GOING TO SHOW UP." ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS THE SECOND-WORST PART OF THE TRIP, RIGHT AFTER THE MOMENT HE REALIZED HE LEFT ERIC HOME ALONE. WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JERRY SEINFELD IS HERE! STICK AROUND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HAY, EVERYBODY! JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, SAY HI TO THE BAND, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. IT'S FRIDAY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT ON WEEKEND, JON? ICE CREAM. PEOPLE LOVE TO EACH ICE CREAM ON WEEKENDS. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY OUT THERE THAT I HAVE AN ICE CREAM CALLED STEPHEN COLBERT'S AMERICONE DREAM, FROM THE GOOD FOLKS AT BEN & JERRY. AND ALL THE MONEY I GET FROM THIS ICE CREAM WE GIVE TO CHARITY HERE. AND THE OTHER NIGHT WE HAD NICK KROLL ON, AND WHEN HE WAS HERE HE ASKED CELEBRITIES TO TWEET OUT AWKWARD TEEN PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES USING THE HASHTAGS #PUBERME AND #PUERTORICORELIEF BECAUSE FOR EVERY BONA FIDE CELEB WHO TWEETS ONE OUT, WE'LL DONATE A $1,000 FROM OUR AMERICONE DREAM CHARITY FUND TO "ONE AMERICA APPEAL" TO HELP PUERTO RICO REBOUND FROM HURRICANE MARIA.  ( APPLAUSE ) PUERTO RICO! LET'S HELP THOSE AMERICAN CITIZENS OUT THERE. AND THE SUPER-UNCOMFORTABLE PHOTOS JUST KEEP ROLLING IN. THIS ONE-- WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? WHERE DO I SHOW THIS? RIGHT THERE. HERE IS OUR FRIEND JIMMY KIMMEL, RIGHT THERE. THERE'S JIMMY KIMMEL, WITH HIS CAR WITH THE LICENSE PLATE "L8 NITE." I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON IS. I BET IT'S A FAMILY MEMBER AND I BET HE GAVE HIM A JOB ON HIS SHOW. THIS IS  A TALENTED YOUNG ACTOR. THIS IS TOPHER GRACE AT AGE 13, I BELIEVE BACKSTAGE AT "THAT '70s SHOW." AND THIS IS A RARITY, FOLKS. THIS IS A COLLECTIVELY. THIS IS JUDD APATOW, RIGHT THERE, LOOKING LIKE HE JUST FOUND A STACK OF "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICS THAT HAVE BOOBS IN THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, CELEBRITIES, PLEASE, TWEET US THOSE PHOTOS, BECAUSE SHOWING US WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE AT YOUR MOST SWEATY AND UNCOMFORTABLE, ISN'T JUST HILARIOUS. IT'S ALSO THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THANKS VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, FOLKS, MY FIRST GUEST IS THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR "SEINFELD" AND "COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE." HIS NEW NETFLIX SPECIAL IS "JERRY BEFORE SEINFELD."
SO I'M LEFT-HANDED. LEFT-HANDED PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THAT THE WORD "LEFT" IS SO OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE THINGS-- TWO LEFT FEET, LEFT-HANDED COMPLIMENT, WHAT ARE WE HAVING FOR DINNER, LEFTOVERS. YOU GO TO A PARTY, THERE'S NOBODY THERE. WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO? THEY LEFT.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW JERRY SEINFELD! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
THANK YOU! THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! I-- I LIKE THIS SHOW.
Stephen: YOU LIKE THIS SHOW.
I LIKE THIS SHOW. I WATCH THIS SHOW A LOT.
Stephen: YOU DO?
YEAH, I DO, I REALLY DO.
Stephen: I'M HONORED.
THAT'S NICE. ( LAUGHTER ) MY FAVORITE PART OF THE SHOW IS THE UNCOMFORTABLE GREETING AT THE STAIR WHEN THE GUEST COMES OUT.
Stephen: OH, ME, TOO. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
IS IT HARDER WITH MEN OR WITH WOMEN?
Stephen: IT'S EASIER WITH MEN BECAUSE, GENERALLY, IT'S A HANDSHAKE AND A LITTLE, LIKE, AWKWARD BUMP. BUT WITH-- BUT WITH MY FEMALE GUESTS, I DON'T KNOW WHO IS COMFORTABLE WITH A HUG, WHO WANTS-- IS OKAY WITH A PECK ON THE CHEEK. IF IT'S A EUROPEAN ACTOR OR ACTRESS, YOU KISS ON TWO WEEKS.
I KNOW, I WATCH THAT-- THAT'S THE HARDEST-- I'M FASCINATED BY YOUR AWKWARDNESS IN THAT MOMENT ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: SO AM I. AND SOMETIMES I SAY BACKSTAGE, "SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?" YOU IDENTIFIED RIGHT THERE.
WHEN I CAME OUT I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT?"
Stephen: AND I SAID HOW ABOUT A GENTLE LITTLE HUG.
WE RECEIVED THE SOPRANO TWO-HIT. REMEMBER THEY WOULD DO THAT ON THE "SOPRANOS."
Stephen: I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
THEY WOULD MEET AND IT WAS TWO HITS ON THE SHOULDER BLADE, AND THAT WAS ALL "SOPRANOS" MEETINGS. REALLY? NOBODY, "SOPRANOS?
Stephen: THAT WAS WELL STUDIED. THE GUY PAID ATTENTION TO HOW UNCOMFORTABLE I AM.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M INTERESTED IN --
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD EVERY JOKE IN THE WORLD. THERE'S NO JOKE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD.
I LIKE AWKWARDNESS. I LIKE PEOPLE NOT FEELING GOOD. I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: I DO, TOO. I LIKE PUTTING MYSELF IN AWKWARD SITUATIONS AND KIND OF HUFFING THE DISCOMFORT.
THAT'S COMEDY. YOU FIND THE COMEDY THERE.
Stephen: GOING INTO AN ELEVATOR AND SINGING, LIKE JIMMY BUFFET IN A CROWDED ELEVATOR DOESN'T GO OVER WELL.
WHO WAS IT-- I THINK IT WAS JEFF ALTMAN-- DO YOU KNOW JEFF ALTMAN.
Stephen: I DO KNOW HIM BUT I DON'T.
IF YOU GET ON AN ELEVATOR WITH HIM AND IT'S JUST THE TWO OF YOU AND SOMEBODY ELSE COMES IN, HE WILL SAY, "SO I SAID TO MY DOCTOR, 'WHY AM I VOMITING UP SO MUCH PUSS? '" THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD DO TO YOU IN THE ELEVATOR AND WANT PERSON IN THERE WOULD FREAK OUT. OH, MY GOD. IT IS SO VILE. EVERY WORD IN THERE IS SO VILE.
Stephen: SURE. WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING-- I LIKE-- I LIKE THE LEANING INTO THE AWKWARDNESS-- THAT'S COMEDY TO ME BECAUSE I HAD A VERY AWKWARD CHILDHOOD. LIKE, YOU SAW THE PHOTO OF ME BEING AN AWKWARD CHILD OUT HERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT REVISITING BEFORE YOU WERE FAMOUS JERRY SEINFELD, WHEN YOU WERE A WORK COMEDIAN--
I WASN'T WORKING.
Stephen: YOU WEREN'T WORKING?
WELL, I WAS PERFORMING, BUT WORKING IS YOU GETTING MONEY. I WAS TRYING-- TRYING TO BE A COMEDIAN.
Stephen: SO THAT JOKE WE HEARD YOU SAY IN THE-- IN THE LEAD-IN, WHEN I WAS ANNOUNCING YOU, YOU DIDN'T GET PAID FOR THAT JOKE?
NO. I DID JUST RECENTLY BECAUSE IT'S ON THE NETFLIX SPECIAL.
Stephen: THIS IS LITERALLY THE MATERIAL YOU WERE WORKING ON WHEN YOU TRIED TO BREAK IN.
THIS WAS THE MATERIAL I WROTE FROM MY BEDROOM WHEN I GREW UP TO THE FIRST TIME I GOT ON JOHNNY CARSON. EVERYTHING THAT GOT ME THROUGH THE CLUBS, THROUGH ALL THAT HIERARCHY, THROUGH ALL THAT, YOU KNOW, LITTLE STRUGGLE-- WHICH WASN'T A STRUGGLE TO ME BECAUSE I LOVED IT. I WAS IN IT. I JUST WANTED TO BE IN IT. BUT THAT WAS THE JOKE I WROTE ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND I SAID IT TO TWO FRIENDS IN COLLEGE, AND I READ IT TO THEM. I SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?" AND THEY SAID, "THAT'S FUNNY." EVERYBODY LAUGHED. AND THEY SAID, "THAT'S FUNNY." AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME I THOUGHT, "MAYBE I COULD BE A COMEDIAN."
Stephen: DID YOU SHARE THAT. HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN HUSBANDING--
THAT'S WHERE I START GLD HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN HUSBANDING THAT DREAM?
"HUSBANDING?"
Stephen: IT'S A TERM--
IT'S LIKE GIVING BIRTH TO A CALF.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN NURTURING? HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN NURTURING THAT DREAM OF BEING A COMEDIAN?
IN MY MIND PERSONALLY.
Stephen: YES.
PROBABLY SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS OLD.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID-- WHEN I FIRST SAW COMEDIANS ON TV-- I THINK I FIRST MENTIONED THIS IN THE SHOW, I FROZE SOLID. I SAID THAT GUY JUST STANDS THERE BY HIMSELF AND TELLS JOKES? THAT'S THE GREATEST THING I HAVE SEEN.
Stephen: DID YOUR MOTHER LET YOU STAY UP AND WATCH THE COMED OONS CARSON?
YES.
Stephen: WHEN WE WERE KIDS THAT WAS THE ONLY PLACE YOU COULD SEE THEM.
THE SULLIVAN SHOW.
Stephen: HERE IN THIS BUILDING, THE SULLIVAN SHOW. MY MOM WOULD LET ME STAY UP IF JOHN BIENER OR DAVID BRERN --
Stephen: DID YOU LIKE STAND-UP COMIC?
Stephen: OH, YES. I NEVER DID IT, STAND-UP.
IT'S A CERTAIN GENE, AN ANIMALISTIC GENE THAT PUSHES YOU TO TAKE THAT RISK, I THINK.
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND SAID, "I WANT TO DO THIS?" WHO WAS THE COMEDIAN.
THE COMEDIAN WAS BILL CAUSE BEE.
Stephen: WONDERFULNESS.
WHY IS THERE AIR? GREATEST-- WHAT'S WORD-- BODY OF WORK, I THINK, IN COMEDY IS HIS.
Stephen: YOU CAN STILL LISTEN TO HIS COMEDY?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH, I GREW UP ON HIS STUFF. I THINK HE SAVED MY LIFE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID, I HAD A TRAGEDY IN MY LIFE, BUT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS I LISTENED TO BILL COSBY ALBUMS EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO BED. I WOULD HIDE THE SPEAKERS UNDER MY PILLOW SO MY MOM COULDN'T HEAR IT. YOU COULD DROP A NEEDLE EYE CAN'T LISTEN TO IT NOW.
YOU CAN'T.
Stephen: NO, I CAN'T SEPARATE IT.
YOU CAN'T?
Stephen: BECAUSE THERE'S LOVE THERE. THERE'S LOVE-- THERE'S LOVE THERE.
I KNOW, IT'S TRAGIC.
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT COMEDY-- THERE'S A LOT OF TRAGEDY IN COMEDY --
Stephen: THERE'S COMEDY BECAUSE OF TRAGEDY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAGIC LIVES.
Stephen: SURE.
I KNOW. THE JERRY LEWIS THING HE DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY OF HIS SONS IN THE WELL. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
Stephen: KIND OF HILARIOUS ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, DENIED THEM MONEY, THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS SLIPPING THEM A ROOFY.
THAT UPSET ME BECAUSE I ADOREDDED JERRY LEWIS. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO NOT WATCH THE BELL BOW.
Stephen: "SAILOR BEWARE," ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES.
I NEVER SAW THAT.
Stephen: I TAUGHT MYSELF SOME OF THE MOVES FROM "SAILOR BEWARE" WHEN I WAS A KID.
WE WANT TO SEE YOU DO THEM SOME DAY.
Stephen: SOME DAY.
NOT NOW. POLISH IT UP A LITTLE.
Stephen: WAS THERE SOMEBODY WHO GAVE YOU THE BENEDICTION-- I DON'T MEAN TO DO THIS TO YOU. BUT WAS THERE SOMEBODY--
I DON'T MIND. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, YES, THERE WAS A GUY-- I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUDIENCE REMEMBERS JACKIE MASON.
Stephen: SURE.
OKAY, SO JACKIE MASON-- WHEN I HAD JUST WROTE THAT "LEFT" JOKE. I STARTED GOING AND SAYING-- COULDN'T EVEN GO TO THE CLUBS THAT HAD ENTERTAINMENT. THERE WERE RESTAURANTS THAT WOULD HAVE, LIKE, AN OPEN-MIC TALENT NIGHT AND I COULD GET ON THERE. AND JACKIE MASON WAS IN THE AUDIENCE. I WAS DOING IT, LIKE, TWO WEEKS-- AND THIS IS ALL TRUE. AND HE CAME OVER TO ME AT THE BAR, AFTER THE SHOW, AND HE SAID, "YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL, IT MAKES ME SICK." ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE-- AND I DIDN'T KNOW REALLY EVEN WHAT HE MEANT, YOU KNOW. BECAUSE I THOUGHT HOW COULD HE EVEN SEE ANYTHING? I DIDN'T EVEN-- I COULD BARELY SPEAK. AND FROM THEN ON, AND I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR MANY YEARS SINCE THEN. YEAH, THAT WAS TWO WEEKS IN. THAT WAS A VERY BIG DAY IN MY LIFE.
Stephen: THAT IS GREAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOUR DAD HAD THIS SAYING CALLED, "BREAK A FACE." THAT WAS IN SALES, RIGHT?
YEAH, THAT WAS IN CASE.
Stephen: WHAT DOES "BREAK A FACE" MEAN?
HE WOULD TALK TO A GUY HE KNEW HE WASN'T GOING TO SELL TO THE GUY, THEY HAD FACE LIKE A ROCK, AND HE JUST WANTED TO BREAK THAT FACE, YOU KNOW. JUST SAY SOMETHING TO THE GUY THAT WOULD MAKE HIM LAUGH. IT WAS EVEN BETTER TO HIM THAN GETTING THE SALE. HE REALLY HAD A GREAT COMEDIC GIFT HIMSELF.
Stephen: DID HE-- DID HE TEACH YOU HOW TO BREAK THE FACE? DID HE TEACH YOU JOKES AS A KID.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE COULD TEACH IT, BUT HE WAS A GREAT JOKE TELLER. ONE OF THE JOKES HE USED TO TELL ME, A MAN COMES HOME, HIS WIFE IS IN BED, HE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM THERE'S ANOTHER MAN BEHIND THE SHOWER CURTAIN AND HE SAYS TO HIM, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" AND THE MAN SAYS, "EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE." ( LAUGHTER ) I LIKE THAT JOKE.
Stephen: AS A CHILD, DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT JOKE WAS ABOUT?
NO, NO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT ANNOYS YOU.
OKAY, THAT'S EASY.
Stephen: JERRY SEINFELD, EVERYBODY. STICK AROUND ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) GENTLEMEN, WELCOME BACK WE'RE HERE WITH JERRY SEINFELD.
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED DURING THE COMMERCIAL, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT COSBY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T SEPARATE IT, EITHER. NOW THAT YOU SAID IT AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT-- AND I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO ANY OF THAT STUFF. I REALIZED IT WOULD BOTHER ME, AND I DON'T THINK I COULD. WHAT ABOUT BILL CLINTON? YOU CAN LISTEN TO HIM WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT --
Stephen: HE WAS NEVER AS FUNNY TO ME.
NO, NOT AS FUNNY. NOT AS FUNNY.
Stephen: NOT AS FUNNY. WELL, OKAY--
SHOULD WE SEPARATE IT OR SHOULDN'T WE SEPARATE THE ART OR THE WORK FROM THE MAN?
Stephen: UM, LISTEN, YOU CAN'T TALK SOMEBODY IN TO THINKING A JOKE IS FUNNY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN /   RIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE. SO IF YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT, YOU CAN'T SEPARATE IT.
BUT SHOULD WE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHOULD WE?
SHOULD THE COMEDIC WORK STAND ON ITS OWN SEPARATE FROM THE CRIMINALITY?
Stephen: WELL, HE TOLD A LOT OF PERSONAL STORY ABOUT HIS LIFE. HE WASN'T OBSERVING OTHER THINGS HAPPENING. HE WAS TELLING PERSONAL STORIES--
IT'S MADE UP. IT'S MATERIAL. COME ON. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S MATERIAL.
Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW THAT, BUT PART OF HIM WAS THE CHARMING FATHERLY FIGURE, TOO, AND ALL OF THAT IS DESTROYED.
RIGHT, RIGHT. I SEE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT THAT ASPECT OF IT IS GONE?
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'LL CHANGE MY MIND. I REALLY --
Stephen: I REALLY LIKE YOUR WORK. PLEASE DON'T REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) TELL ME YOU'RE CLEAN. TELL ME YOU'RE CLEAN, JERRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, ISN'T THAT FUNNY? YOU NEVER SEE ANYONE ON TV-- AND WE ALL WATCH ALL THIS ANNOYING POLITICAL CRAP, AND EVERYONE IS SCREAMING. YOU NEVER SEE SOMEBODY GO, "YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M WRONG. I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY OPINION."
Stephen: WOW.
YOU NEVER SEE THAT.
Stephen: WOW.  ( APPLAUSE ).
RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH. THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING COMPLIMENT TO YOURSELF, YOU JUST MADE. ( LAUGHTER ).
YES, IT IS.
Stephen: "NO ONE EVER DOES WHAT I JUST DID!"
THAT'S RIGHT. I SAY THAT ALL DAY LONG TO MYSELF.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT ELSE DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF? WHAT IS BOTHERING YOU THESE DAYS, JERRY SEINFELD.
WHAT IS BOTHERING ME.
Stephen: NOTHING HAS TO.
GIVE ME AN AREA.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT PHONE CALLS, JERRY /   OKAY. IF I PICK UP THE PHONE AND SAY HELLO AND THE PERSON CALLING ME SAYS HELLO, I PUT THE PHONE RIGHT BACK DOWN. YOU'RE NOT READY. I'M NOT DOING THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO INTERRUPT ME. YOU DIAL MY NUMBER AND ARE SOMEHOW CAUGHT BY SURPRISE THEY ANSWER GLD MAYBE THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU.
I DON'T CARE, DON'T SAY "HELLO." I SAY "HELLO." YOU SAY, "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?" THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS.
Stephen: WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A PURPOSE? WHAT IF I'M JUST CALLING OUT OF BLUE.
THEN JUST SAY WHAT'S GOING ON. THE WORD "HELLO" IS ANNOYING ANYWAY. IT'S FROM A TIME WHEN WE DIDN'T EVEN THINK THE CALL WAS GOING TO WORK. IT'S HELLO? IT'S A QUESTION.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT HELLOOOO! YOU WERE CALLING DOWN THE LINE.
HOW SAD IS THE HARD-LINE PHONE AS A DEVICE, JUST A SAD, PLASTIC BOX. PEOPLE MAKE ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT. "I'M CALLING YOU ON THE HARD LINE!" "PREPARE TO SPEAK THROUGH THICK WIRES HUNG FROM WOODEN POLES.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE, THOUGH. WHAT IF THE POWER GOES OUT? THE HARD LINE STILL WORKS.
EH. I DON'T LIKE TALKING ON THE PHONE. IT'S-- I DON'T LIKE THE RITUAL-- ONCE YOU CAN TEXT-- WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT TEXTING. OKAY.
Stephen: IS THAT BETTER?
YES. BECAUSE IT'S FASTER. EVEN THOUGH IT'S MAKING PEOPLE MORE PANICKY-- SOMEBODY TEXTED ME "T.Y." THE OTHER DAY. YOU EVER GET "T.Y.?"
Stephen: THANK YOU.
YES. WHAT ARE WE SAVING? AMOUNTS OF TIME THAT YOU'RE SAVING TO WATCH A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF SKATEBOARDERS BOUNCING THEIR NUTS OFF A RAILING. T.Y.?
Stephen: YOU CAN SEND ME THAT LINK? I'D LIKE TO WATCH THAT.
BOUNCE YOUR NUTS OFF A RAILING, T.Y.
Stephen: THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT TEXT SUGGEST DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER.
RIGHT.
Stephen: THE THING ABOUT THE PHONE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A RITUAL WHEN YOU GO. "HELLO, HI, THIS IS STEPHEN, JERRY. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD COME ON THE SHOW." AND YOU SAY, "YEAH, I'M SEE YOU FRIDAY." AND YOU SAY OKAY, BYE," CLICK AND IT'S OVER. WITH TEXTING IT'S THIS VAGUE--
YOU CAN SAY YOU GOTTA GO AT THE END AFTER AN EXCHANGE.
Stephen: WHAT IF YOU SEE THOSE THREE LITTLE DOTS. THEN YOU HAVE TO HANG ON AND GO, "HE WANTS TO SAY ONE MORE THING."
THE GHOSTY DOTS ARE CREEPY TO ME. IT'S, LIKE, EITHER SEND ME THE MESSAGE OR BLANK, BUT DON'T TELL ME, "SOMETHING'S COMING..." I DON'T NEED TO KNOW.
Stephen: AND THEN NOTHING COMES.
YEAH. IT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOUR PHONE, INSTEAD OF RINGING JUST WENT RIII... WAS THAT THE PHONE? DID YOU HEAR THE PHONE? RING.
Stephen: SOMETIMES I'LL PUT IN-- SOMEONE WILL GO "NIGHT." AND YOU GO "NIGHT" BACK. BUT THAT'S WAY TOO INTIMIDATE. BECAUSE YOU ONLY SAY "NIGHT" TO YOUR WIFE IN YOUR BED NEXT TO YOU. AND NOW I'M TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO I WORK WITH TALKING ABOUT SCRIMENTS AND I GO "NIGHT."
YOU'RE GOING TO H.R. FOR THAT.
Stephen: PROBABLY, PROBABLY.
WHAT ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "I GOT A CALL THE OTHER DAY OUT OF THE BLUE." ALL CALLS ARE OUT OF THE BLUE, OKAY? THERE'S NO PRECALL. THERE'S NO-- THERE'S NO PRE-BOARDING. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN PRE-BOARDING. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PRE-BOARD. TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET ON THE PLANE WITHOUT BOARDING IT? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE JUST GOING TO MAGICALLY APPEAR IN THE SEAT? WHY DO YOU EVEN NEED A PLANE? JUST ASTRO-PROJECT YOURSELF.  ( APPLAUSE ) RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PRE THING. HEALTH CARE, PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I'M NOT A PHILOSOPHER, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THINGS EITHER EXIST OR DO NOT EXIST.
Stephen: UH-HUH...
YOU HAVE A PRE-EXIST AGO BEFORE THIS DISEASE EVEN EXISTED, YOU HAD IT. THAT'S RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) I WENT TO THE DOCTOR, I SAID, "WHAT'S WRONG?" I SAID, NOTHING YET." ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME WHEN IT EXISTS. OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES ASPIRIN? STILL. YOU GOTTA GET ANOTHER DOCTOR.
IT'S AN OLD REFERENCE. I KNOW.
Stephen: IS THAT IN THE SPECIAL?
NO, NO.
Stephen: WELL, YOU EXISTED BEFORE YOU CAME OUT HERE.
YES.
Stephen: THEY KNOW OF?
RIGHT.
Stephen: OR I COULD JUST BE THE ONLY ONE WHO EXISTS IN THE UNIVERSE AND YOU'RE JUST A DREAM THAT I'M HAVING.
THAT COULD BE. WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN A PREHISTORIC TIME. WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM IN YOU'RE NOT IN HISTORY. WE'RE HERE NOW.
Stephen: WELL, HISTORY IS WHEN YOU WROTE IT DOWN.
YEAH, COULD WE BE ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL? NO, HISTORY CHANNEL STARTS AT HISTORY. YOU'RE BEFORE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I HAVE I-- I HAVE-- I HAVE KIND OF HARD NEWS FOR YOU THEN IS THAT YOU'RE MY FIRST GUEST ON FRIDAY, BUT WE'RE TAPING THIS ON THURSDAY.
WHOA! WHOA!
Stephen: THEREFORE, JERRY, WE ARE--
HANG ON!
Stephen: WE ARE PRETAPING THIS INTERVIEW.
OH, MY GOSH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?
I'M NOT OKAY.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO BE-- ( APPLAUSE )
THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WROTE THAT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.
Stephen: "JERRY BEFORE SEINFELD" IS ON NETFLIX RIGHT NOW. JERRY SEINFELD, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S NICE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS WATCH THE SHOW, I'M A STAUNCH CATHOLIC. BUT EVER SINCE I STARTED THIS SHOW I OFTEN MISS CHURCH BECAUSE I'M SO BUSY INSTEAD OF MISSING CHURCH BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHAT I MISS MOST ABOUT MY CHURCH IS CONFESSION. GETTING IN THAT BOOTH EVERY SUNDAY IS A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF INTIMATE AND PERSONAL ACT OF FAITH THEY NOW PREFER DOING ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I WAS JUST WONDERING IF I COULD EXAMINE MY CONSCIOUS WITH YOU, THE AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT?
Audience, OF COURSE, NOT!
Stephen: GREAT. THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: STANDARD DISCLAIMER:  I'M NOT SURE THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( ORG AN MUSIC PLAYING )
FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE. I LIKE TO LIE DOWN WHILE WATCHING TV SO I CAN USE MY BELLYBUTTON TO HOLD DIP. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, I-- I FEEL BAD ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T FINISHED A BOOK IN 20 YEARS. DON'T TELL ME HOW THE BIBLE ENDS. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK THIS JESUS GUY IS REALLY GOING TO PULL ONE OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I-- I THINK MOUTHWASH IS AS GOOD AS TOOTHPASTE. AND I THINK MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP ICE CREAM IS AS GOOD AS MOUTHWASH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ ♪ ♪ I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL IF AN AVOCADO IS RIPE. I JUST SQUEEZE THREE AND THEN BUY THE SECOND ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHENEVER I SEE A BOWL OF MAN "M"s AT A PARTY, I TOSS IN A COUPLE OF SKITTLES TO FREAK PEOPLE OUT LATER. I ACTUALLY ENJOY NIGHTMARES ABOUT BEING NAKED IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGH SCHOOL TEST BECAUSE BACK THEN, I WAS IN A LOT BETTER SHAPE. ( LAUGHTER ) AUDIENCE, I TELL PEOPLE I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE BANJO. BUT I DON'T. I EVEN WROTE A SONG ABOUT IT.  ( CHEERS ) ♪ OH, I CAN'T PLAY THE BANJO BUT I TELL PEOPLE I CAN-JO. ♪ MY NAME IS BANJO BOB ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DIDN'T REALLY WRITE THAT SONG. ONE OF MY WRITERS DID. ( LAUGHTER ) IN HIGH SCHOOL, I USED TO CHEAT BY WRITING THINGS ON MY HAND. BUT I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN, LIKE... 35 YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) I GAVE MY KIDS A QUARTER EVERY TIME THEY LOST A BABY TOOTH, BUT I WAS SELLING THEM FOR WAY MORE THAN THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE.
Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU!
Stephen: THANKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK TO FRIDAY, WHICH THIS DEFINITELY IS. YOU KNOW, IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE WE'VE BARELY SURVIVED ANOTHER FIVE DAYS WHEN WE GET TO THIS POINT. THAT'S WHY ON FRIDAYS, I LIKE TO SIT BACK, TAKE A KNEE, AND ENJOY "THE BEST OF THIS WEEK'S 'LATE SHOW'." JIM?
TODAY, IF THEY HIT TOO HARD, 15 YARDS, THROW HIM OUT OF THE GAME. THEY HAD THAT LAST WEEK. I WATCHED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, AND TWO GUYS JUST REALLY, BEAUTIFUL TACKLE. BOOM! 15 YARDS. THEY'RE RUINING THE GAME! RIGHT? ( APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE RUINING THE GAME.
Stephen: THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BRAIN DAMAGE. I MEAN, LOOK HOW FAR I GOT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: OOOOH!
Stephen: I GOT NOTHING. NOTHING UP HERE.
WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO SEE ONE OF THESE N.F.L. OWNERS WHEN SOMEBODY DISRESPECTS OUR FLAG IT TO SAY, "GET THAT SON OF A BITCH OFF THE FIELD RIGHT NOW. OUT. HE'S FIRED. HE'S FIRED!" ( AUDIENCE BOOING ).
Stephen: WOW. SON OF A BITCH. THAT WAS UNNECESSARY. THAT WAS UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. THERE SHOULD BE A FLAG ON THAT PLAY, AND I'M GOING TO SAY A CONFEDERATE FLAG. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO PROM WITH ME? GUESS WHAT? PROM IS CANCELED BECAUSE IT'S STUPID. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO BEGIN WITH, AND I'M NOT CRYING. YOU'RE CRYING. OKAY." YOU'RE MARRY TO THE HUNK RIGHT HERE, JOE MANGANIELLO, RIGHT THERE.
OH, YES!
Stephen: WOW, WOW.
IT'S LIKE WAKING UP EVERY MORNING TO THE EIFFEL TOWER. I MEAN, YOU DON'T GET TIRED OF THAT VIEW NO MATTER WHAT. IT'S NOT LEAK YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY, "THIS STUPID TOWER! ALWAYS IN THE WAY OF EVERYTHING." NO.
Stephen: THEY SAY IF YOU HAVE THE EIFFEL TOWER FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS, YOU SHOULD YAWRL DOCTOR.
I'VE HEARD THAT, TOO, YEAH.
WE WILL CUT TAXES FOR THE EVERYDAY, HARDWORKING AMERICANS. I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME, BELIEVE ME.
Stephen: "IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME. I MEAN, IT'S ABOUT TAXES. I NEVER PAY THOSE. NOTHING TO DO WITH ME." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AND, OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME PROTECTION. SO HERE'S A LITTLE RHYME I CAME UP WITH TO HUP REMEMBER. BEFORE YOUR STRAIGHT OR GROUP GAY SEX WRAP YOUR PENIS IN LATEX. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YEAH. TRUE. IT'S TRUE. NO DOUBT. NO DOUBT, UNCLE STEVE. OR YOU CAN SAVE 10 BUCKS AND JUST PUT A TOOTH WHITENING STRIP ON EUROPEANER. WORKS GREAT!
Stephen: DON'T DO THAT.
DO IT! ( LAUGHTER ) MY PENIS HAS NEVER BEEN WHITER.
ON HEALTH CARE, WE HAVE THE VOTES FOR HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE THE VOTES. WE HAVE THE VOTES. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE VOTES. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ONLY-- WE'RE ONLY ONE OFF. MAYBE TWO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE VOTES! IF YOU'RE ONE-- THAT'S LEAK A BASEBALL MANAGER SAYING, "AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE HOME RUN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE IT. WE'RE JUST ONE, MAYBE TWO BASES SHORT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "BUT JUST, HIT THE BALL."
Stephen: YOU SAID THAT SINGING IS PRAYING TWICE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
UM, WELL, I MEAN, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO PRAY. AND WHEN YOU WORSHIP IN SONG, THERE'S JUST-- I DON'T KNOW-- THIS-- YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT WITH MUCH MORE FERVOR. OR AT LEAST I AM. I THINK I THOUGHT I SOUNDED POETIC WHEN I SAID IT, AND CAN NOW WHEN YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IT, I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS DUMB.
Stephen: TO ME IT MEANS THE WORDS HAVE THEIR OWN MEANING BUT THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR HEART COMES THROUGH IN THE SOUND IN WAYS THAT THE WORDS CANNOT CAPTURE ♪ THE DAY IS ON ITS WAY IT COULDN'T WAIT NO MORE ♪ HERE IT COMES HERE IT COMES ♪ READY OR NOT READY OR NOT ♪
Stephen: THE SOUND OF THE SONG SPEAKS IN THE WAY WORDS CAN'T REACH. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT TO ME.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE FRIENDS.  ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY. "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. JOIN ME NEXT WEEK WHEN I'LL BE JOINED BY PIERCE BROSNAN, KERRY WASHINGTON, AND MORGAN FREEMAN. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
