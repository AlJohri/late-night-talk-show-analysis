Stephen: WHAT'S THIS? BILL CLINTON IS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION TONIGHT. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY I COULD GO BACK IN TIME TO THE 90s AND GET MY OLD CLINTON JOKES. I KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I'LL STICK ONE FINGER IN A BOTTLE OF ZIMA, AND THE OTHER IN A LIGHT SOCKET. TO THE 90s! OOOOOHH! OKAY, MARIO, IT'S TIME TO MY NEW GAME BOY. OOOOOH! OH! QUICK, STEPHEN, IT'S ME, YOU, FROM THE YEAR 2016.
WHATEVER. TALK TO THE HAND.
Stephen: NO, I REALLY AM YOU FROM 2016.
WAIT. DID YOU SAY 2060?
Stephen: NO, 2016.
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR FACE? WERE WE IN AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING? YOU'VE GOT TO MOISTURIZE.
Stephen: I JUST-- I NEED ALL YOUR BILL CLINTON JOKES.
WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU NEED CLINTON JOKESES IN THE YEAR 2016?
Stephen: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN. YOU WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND.
HILLARY'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
Stephen: YES.
OKAY, HERE'S ONE. I'VE JUST WRITTEN IT BUT THERE'S NO WAY IT WOULD STILL WORK 20 YEARS FROM NOW. "HOW ARE CLINTON SCANDALS LIKE POKEY MON? YOU'LL NEVER CATCH THEM ALL."
Stephen: YES!
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JEFF DANIELS. BASSEM YOUSEFF. AND AURORA. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S TIME FOR THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVINCING. DEATH. TAXES. HILLARY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU, JON. HEY!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THAT'S NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! WOW! THAT'S NICE. THAT'S CRISP. THAT'S NICE. ♪ ♪ ♪ MAN, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I GOTTA SAY, I WISH-- THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I WISH I HAD THAT MUCH ENERGY AT NOON. YOU PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE. IT'S FIVE TO MIDNIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER ON NIGHT TWO-- NIGHT TWO OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HILLARY CLINTHILLARYCLINTON DID IT. THE FIRST WOMAN EVER NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES! FIRST WOMAN EVER NOMINATED BY A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY. AND I'M BEING TOLD-- YES. THE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL CONSIDERED A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY. THEY HAD A ROUGH WEEK. JUST MOMENTS AGO, HILLARY CLINTON APPEARED AT THE CONVENTION BY BREAKING THE GLASS-- WALL? OH, SO CLOSE TO THE PROPER METAPHOR. JIMO, LET'S HELP HER OUT HERE. LET'S BREAK THE GLASS CEILING. WOOOOOO! I WAS AFRAID-- I WAS-- I WAS REALLY AFRAID IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN THERE FOR A SECOND. HILLARY CLINTON COULD BE THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT. AND AMERICA WILL FINALLY CATCH UP WITH 1960 SRI LANKA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO THAT'S HALF THE STORY. THAT'S JUST HALF THE STORY. THE OTHER HALF IS THAT IT IS OFFICIALLY OVER FOR BERNIE. BUT HIS SUPPORTERS SHOULD BE PROUD. IF YOU'RE A SUPPORTER OF BERNIE YOU SHOULD BE PROUD. SO MANY THINGS THEY FOUGHT FOR ARE NOW IN THE DEMOCRATIC. PARTY PLATFORM. $15 MINIMUM WAGE, OVERTURNING "CITIZENS UNITED," CLAIMING YOUR CLAIMING YOUR HACKY SACK AS A DEPENDENT. IT'S ALL IN THERE. NOW, IT WAS GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ANY SPEAKERS TONIGHT TO TOP LAST NIGHT'S IMPASSIONED PLEA BY FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA TO RAISE THE LEVEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WASN'T IT AMAZING? INCREDIBLE. SHE HAD AN IMPASSIONED PLEA FOR RAISING THE LEVEL OF OUR NATIONAL DISCOURSE.
I WANT SOMEONE WITH THE PROVEN STRENGTH TO PERSEVERE, SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THIS JOB AND TAKES IT SERIOUSLY, SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE ISSUES OF OUR PRESIDENT FACES ARE NOT BLACK AND WHITE AND CANNOT BE BOILED DOWN TO 140 CHARACTERS.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S GOOD. I'M GOING TO TWEET THAT RIGHT NOW. THAT'S GOOD. BUT THERE WERE SOME HIGHLIGHTS, TONIGHT. SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI OF MARYLAND SAID HILLARY WOULD FIGHT FOR WHAT. AMERICANS REALLY CARE ABOUT.
SHE'LL FIGHT FOR THE MACRO ISSUES AND THE MACARONI AND CHEESE ISSUES.
Stephen: YES! MACARONI AND CHEESE ISSUES! LIKE, WHAT IS THAT POWDER, REALLY? AND IT IS TIME TO STOP CALLING IT FOUR SERVINGS WHEN THEY KNOW FOR A FACT WE'RE GOING TO EAT THE WHOLE POT! AND WHEN HOWARD DEAN TOOK TO THE PODIUM TONIGHT, HE BROUGHT OUT THE CLASSICS.
BECAUSE THIS RACE IS GOING TO BE WON ON THE GROUND, AND IT WILL BE WON ON THE GROUND, AND IT'S GOING TO BE WON IN COLORADO, AND IN IOWA, AND IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND MICHIGAN, AND FLORIDA, AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE!
Stephen: WOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES! YEAH! ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT-- HE DIDN'T DO THE SCREAM! HYAAAGH! YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE SCREAM, GOVERNOR. THAT'S LIKE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN ENDING HIS CONCERT BY SINGING "TRAMPS LIKE US, BABY WE WERE BORN... GOOD NIGHT!" YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE,-- YEAH! YEAH! , OF COURSE, TONIGHT, PRIME TIME SPOT, DEMOCRATS BROUGHT OUT THE BIG DOG, POTENTIAL FIRST LADIES MAN, BILL CLINTON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S OFFICIAL. THAT'S OFFICIALLY THE NAME. I'VE COINED IT. THAT'S OFFICIALLY THE NAME FROM NOW ON. AND, OF COURSE, BILL LED OFF WITH SOME CLASSIC CLINTON CHARM.
IN THE SPRING OF 1971, I MET A GIRL.
Stephen: BILL, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HILLARY! OH, I'M SORRY. IT WAS? THAT WAS HER? I APOLOGIZE. HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THERE. OKAY. GO AHEAD.
SOMEHOW I KNEW THIS WOULD NOT JUST BE ANOTHER TAP ON THE SHOULDER. AND I MIGHT BE STARTING SOMETHING I COULDN'T STOP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: A FEELING-- A FEELING BERNIE SUPPORTERS IDENTIFIED WITH IMMEDIATELY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PHILLY PHANATIC WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR THE CONVENTION BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO SOME SORT OF BASEBALL TEAM, AND THEY CAN'T SPARE HIM BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY ENTERTAINING PART. SO THE D.N.C. BROUGHT OUT THE NEXT BEST THING, AND WE'VE GOT HIM HERE TONIGHT. THE HILLY PHANATIC. COME ON OUT HERE, HILLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, HILLY! HILLY. THEY LOVE YOU. THEY LOVE YOU, HILLY. WHO'S THE NUMBER ONE HILLARY FAN IN THE HOUSE? AND YOU'RE REALLY AMPED ABOUT HILLARY, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, LET'S SEE YOUR FAMOUS HILLY SHUFFLE. DO IT! OKAY, OKAY. I GOTTA SAY, HILLY, HILLY, YOU DON'T SEEM THAT EXCITED ABOUT HILLARY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S YOUR JOB TO GET THE CROWD PUMPED. YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. JUST THINK OF SOMETHING THAT DOES GET YOU EXCITED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ALL RIGHT, THE HILLY PHANATIC, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, HILLY. HILLY PHANATIC, EVERYBODY. NOW, I'M GUESSING IT GETS PRETTY GAMEY IN THAT COSTUME. SPEAKING OF EXCITEMENT, LAST NIGHT, CORY BOOKER GAVE A GREAT SPEECH ABOUT HOW WE MUST LOVE EACH OTHER, AND HE WAS REPEATEDLY HECKLED BY THE CROWD. YES, THE CROWD BOOED A SPEECH ABOUT LOVE. DON'T THEY REMEMBER WHAT JESUS SAID? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE NOW-- HERE NOW LIVE-- ( APPLAUSE ) HERE NOW LIVE WITH HIS REACTION TO TONIGHT'S SPEECHES, PLEASE WELCOME LIVE VIA SATELLITE SENATOR CORY BOOKER. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. SENATOR, NOW, YOU WERE THERE SITTING WITH THE CLINTON FAMILY IN THEIR BOOTH FOR BILL CLINTON'S SPEECH. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT? DID IT STIR THE CROWD?
I THINK IT REALLY DID. IT LIT THEM UP, AND TELLING HILLARY CLINTON'S STORY, WHICH AS HE SAID HAS BEEN SUCH A CARICATURE, A CARTOON, LITERALLY, BECAUSE OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING. HE GAVE A REAL GREAT DEPICTION OF HOW SHE'S LIVED A VERY DEDICATED LIFE OF SERVICE FROM THE SECOND SHE WAS OUT OF SCHOOL-- IN FACT, BEFORE SHE WAS EVEN OUT OF SCHOOL.
Stephen: THERE HAS BEEN A LOT MADE ABOUT HOW A HISTORIC MOMENT IT IS, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME YOUNG WOMEN, SORT OF TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT A WOMAN CAN BE THE NOMINEE OF THE PARTY. DO YOU THINK THAT MESSAGE WAS CONVEYED IN AN INSPIRING WAY TONIGHT?
YOU KNOW, I JUST HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLK ABOUT HOW SPECIAL THIS MOMENT WAS FOR THEM. I HEARD FROM A LOT OF MOTHERS, AND EVEN MICHELLE OBAMA SAID SO BEAUTIFULLY LAST NIGHT, IT'S WONDERFUL THAT HER DAUGHTERS COULD GROW UP IN A COUNTRY WHERE THEY COULD TAKE FOR GRANTED THE FACT THAT A WOMAN COULD BECOME PRESIDENT. IT'S A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH THAT SHE HAS THIS SENSE THAT SHE'S ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING ACTUALLY THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BIG. I THINK THERE WILL BE KIDS GROWING UP THAT WILL BE, LIKE, 16 YEARS OLD AND WILL THINK TO THEMSELVES THE NEXT TIME A WHITE GUY IS WIL ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENCY, WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT ONLY WOMEN AND BLACK GUYS COULD DO THAT JOB. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD POINT, GOOD POINT. I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT, THERE'S A REAL BREAKTHROUGH THAT TWO MEN CAN TALK ABOUT HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS FOR WOMEN RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE'VE COME A LONG WAY.
YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE BOOED. YOU WERE BOOED LAST NIGHT. HOW DID THAT FEEL? COULD YOU HEAR IT WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING?
I COULDN'T HEAR THE BOOS, ACTUALLY. BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE END OF MY SPEECH I WAS LIFTED BY THE CROWDS RISING TO THEIR FEET AS I TALKED ABOUT LOVE. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST POIFL MOMENTS OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER TO GET THAT KIND OF ENERGY FROM THE CROWD. I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT HEADLINE WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT STANDING WHERE I WAS IT ELEVATED ME AND I HOPE I SOUNDED THE RIGHT NOTE AS WE WENT INTO THE FINAL FOUR SPEECHES PERIOD OF TIME THE NATION, I TALKED ABOUT THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, WHICH HAS AT THE END OF IT THAT LAST SENTENCE, PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST DECLARATION OF INTERDEPENDENCE IN THE WORLD, WHERE WE SAID IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY WORK WE HAVE TO SHOW AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT TO EACH OTHER AND THE FOUNDERS WROTE, JEFFERSON WROTE WE MUST MUTUALLY PLEDGE TO EACH OTHER OUR LIVES, OUR FORTUNES AND OUR SACRED HONOR. IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST, GO ALONE, BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR, GO TOGETHER. WE ARE A GREAT NATION BECAUSE WE FOUND WAYS TO COME TOGETHER ACROSS RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, RACIAL DIFFERENCES TO DO INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT HUMANITY HAD NEVER DONE, GOING TO THE MOON, MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME. WHAT MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT IS THAT WE HETEROGENUOUS AND WE FIND WAYS TO LOVE EACH OTHER, WORK TOGETHER, AND ELEVATE HUMANITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SPEAKING OF UNITING PEOPLE, LAST NIGHT, LAST NIGHT, SARAH SILVERMAN ON STAGE SAID TO THE-- YOU KNOW, "NEVER HILLARY, BERNIE OR BUST PEOPLE" YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS. DO YOU THINK THE BERNIE PEOPLE ARE BEING RIDICULOUS BY STILL RALLYING FOR BERNIE AT THIS POINT?
NO, I ABSOLUTELY DON'T. IF YOU COMPARE WHAT'S RIDICULOUS IS THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAD A CONVENTION AND THEIR FOLKS JUST BOYCOTTED IT. PAST PRESIDENTS DIDN'T SHOW UP. 22 OF MY REPUBLICAN SENATE COLLEAGUING JUST BOYCOTTED IT. WE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SAID EVERYBODY COME UNDER THIS TENT. HAD WE COME UNDER THIS TENT THERE MIGHT BE A LOT OF FRICTION, A LOT OF SALTINESS BUT AT LEAST WE COME UNDER THE TENT. BUT ONE OF THE BEST MOMENTS WAS SITTING NEXT TO BILL CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS TRIED TO SPEAK AND COULDN'T BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CHEERING FOR HIM. I LOOKED AT BILL CLINTON AND HE IS CHEERING IT UP, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING. IT SHOWS WE RECOGNIZE, THIS MAN, BERNIE SANDERS CHANGED THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION. HE CHANGED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM AND BECAUSE OF HIS FIERCE COMPETITION HE MADE HILLARY CLINTON MORE READY TO LEAD THIS NATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU, SENATOR CORY BOOKER, EVERYBODY. HAVE A GREAT WEEK, SIR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A VERY SPECIAL LIVE APPEARANCE BY A VERY ANIMATED GUEST. (BAND PLAYING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING? FEELING ALL RIGHT TONIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT IS GETTING ON. WELCOME BACK TO A VERY SPECIAL LIVE "LATE SHOW"." FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST JOINING DEMOCRACY, TONIGHT HILLARY CLINTON BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN EVER NOMINATED FOR U.S. PRESIDENT BY A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY. AND I THINK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) 100 YEARS FROM NOW, OUR GRANDCHILDREN WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS DAY AND SAY, "WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE EXCITED? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?" MAYBE IT'S HILLARY CLINTON'S PERSONAL STYLE. MAYBE WE'VE JUST HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO SHE IS ANYMORE. WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET TO KNOW THE REAL HILLARY CLINTON?
YOUR ONLY OPTION IS TO CREATE A CARTOON.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, LET'S TRY IT. PLEASE WELCOME, CARTOON HILLARY CLINTON.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HELLO! HEY! HI! HI, UP THERE. THANK YOU!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, SECRETARY CARTOON CLINTON. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT TONIGHT.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT AMERICA. IT'S THE ONLY PLACE WHERE A SECRETARY OF STATE, SENATOR, AND LIFE-LONG PUBLIC SERVANT CAN BE PUT ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH A SCREAMING CANTALOUPE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH, FAIR ENOUGH. MADAM SECRETARY, FIRST, I HAVE TO ASK YOU HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR HUSBAND DID IN HIS SPEECH TONIGHT?
WONDERFUL. HE WAS HEALTHY. HE STOOD THERE. WONDERFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, PRAISE INDEED, YUP. NICELY SAID, BEAUTIFULLY SAID. LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE D.N.C. HACKED EMAILS? HAS IT RUINED THE CONVENTION FOR YOU?
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL QUESTION, AND IT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY THAT YOU ASKED IT OF ME. IT IS TRUE THAT THIS WEEK DIDN'T START EXACTLY AS WE PLANNED IT SINCE 1998. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. BUT I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR US ALL TO COME TOGETHER IN UNITY. OR HARMONY. OR SOLIDARITY. OR WHATEVER SYNONYM RESONATES MORE STRONGLY WITH YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JUST GOING TO DELETE. DELETING. DELETE. DELETE.
Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT YOU, MADAM, BUT GIVEN HOW UPSET PEOPLE ARE OVER THESE E-MAILS, CAN YOU REALLY EXPECT BERNIE SUPPORTERS TO GET BEHIND YOU?
AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR THAT POWERFUL QUESTION. TRULY, ONE OF OUR NATION'S FINEST QUESTIONS. STEPHEN, BERNIE SANDERS IS A GREAT FRIEND AND HAS BEEN FOR DAYS NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HI! HELLO! HEY, OUT THERE! I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. BERNIE LIKES TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS, WHICH IS ALSO WHAT I DO-- WHEN I AM ALONE AND NO ONE IS WATCHING. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY!
Stephen: I'M OVER HERE. I'M OVER HERE.
I'M BACK.
Stephen: LAST WEEK AT THE R.N.C. I MET A FEW REPUBLICANS, AND THEY HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU. WOULD THAT BE OKAY IF WE TOOK SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW?
A SURPRISE? HOORAY! I LOVE FITTING THOSE INTO MY SCHEDULE!
Stephen: GREAT. THE FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM A REPUBLICAN, A DEBRA IS MICHIGAN.
SECRETARY CLINTON, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE EMAILS YOU DIDN'T GIVE TO THE F.B.I.?
Stephen: THERE YOU GO.
GREAT QUESTION, DEBRA. AS A FORMER SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE, I AM THE MOST HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSON TO EVER SEEK THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. BUT AS A GRANDMOTHER, SOMETIMES I MAKE A BOO-OO ON THE COMPUTER. NOW, INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON MY E-MAILS, LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO TO FEMALES. THAT'S A VERY FUNNY JOKE, STEPHEN, BECAUSE THE WORDS SOUND SIMILAR. AND WE SMILE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) EXACTLY. THEY LIKE IT. THANK YOU! THANK YOU, OVER THERE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE ANOTHER SCWE QUESTION FROM ANOTHER REPUBLICAN DELEGATE FROM TINA IN FLORIDA.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO FIX THE ECONOMY?
YES, POWERFUL QUESTION. BHEFT QUESTION IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY. WORDS STATED EMPHATICALLY. TILT HEAD 15-- NO, 20 DEGREES. IT MAKES ME THINK OF A TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE SWING STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND I MET A SINGLE MOTHER WHO TOLD ME SHE NEEDED A JOB. I WAS SO MOVED, I HIRED HER TO BE A TALKING POINT IN MY SPEECHES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, STEPHEN, TOGETHER WE DID! HIGH TOUCH OF HANDS, STEPHEN. COME ON. YES! WE ARE SHOWING CAMARADERIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YAY! THANK YOU! HELLO!
Stephen: YOU SEEM REALLY HAPPY AND RELAXED GIVEN THE ROUGH START TO THE WEEK. HAS YOUR RUNNING MATE TIM KAINE BEEN HELPING EASE THE STRESS?
BRILLIANT QUESTION. I WISH I WAS ALWAYS ASKED THAT QUESTION. SENATOR KAINE AND I HAVE BECOME VERY CLOSE. HERE'S SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM TIM KAINE. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( LAUGHTER ) ALL. MY. FRIENDS. KNOW. THE LOW RIDER. THE. LOW. RIDER. THIS IS APPEALING, RIGHT? POPULAR MUSIC IS A SHARED CULTURAL REFERENCE POINT.
Stephen: IT IS. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE LEARNED?
I'VE ALSO BEEN LEARNING ESPANOL FROM SENYA-TORE KAI-EE-NAY. FOR INSTANCE: "HOLA," "MUCHAS GRACIAS," AND "DONDE ESTA MI ESP-OSO BILL CLINTON?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. WAIT A SECOND. IF I CAUGHT THAT LAST ONE. YOU LEARNED TO SAY "WHERE IS MY HUSBAND, BILL CLINTON?"
YES. I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN THAT IN OVER 14 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HAVE A GREAT WEEK, MADAM CARTOON HILLARY CLINTON, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JEFF DANIELS.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT, THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Stephen: PRESENT DOING IT?
YES.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW, THIS IS PART OF THE VACATION?
NO, THIS IS WORKING HARD RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, THE BEARD, IS THIS A COMMON EVENT FOR THE VACATION? IS THIS YOU RELAXED? OR IS THIS YOU PREPARING FOR SOMETHING ELSE?
IT JUST-- I JUST LET IT GO. LETTING EVERYTHING GO.
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
EVERY HAIR ON MY BODY, LETTING IT GO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: REALLY? BUT NORMALLY, YOU'RE WELL MAN-SCAPED?
YEAH, GOT A WEED WHACKER THAT COMES IN ONCE A WEEK JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE.
Stephen: NEIGHBORHOOD KID?
GOOD KID. COUPLE OF BUCKS, THROW HIM.
Stephen: IN THE WINTERTIME HE SHOVELS.
HE SHOVELS. HE SHOVELS IN THE WINTER. IN THE WINTERTIME. YEAH, NO, I'M DOING A WESTERN. I'M DOING A WESTERN IN THE FALL. AND SO --
ARE YOU A DESPERADO?
I HAVE TO LOOK THAT UP LATER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT'S A BAD GUY, SORT OF A ROMANTIC BAD GUY.
THAT, THAT-- NOT ROMANTIC. I'M TOO OLD.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. IS HE TOO OLD TO BE ROMANTIC?
Audience: NO!
Stephen: YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING MAN.
PLAYING A BAD GUY. SO I'M GROWING THE BEARD OUT. I'M ALSO HORSE RIDING IN MICHIGAN. THERE'S A GUY --
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU HAVE DONE BEFORE? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO HORSE RIDE?
YOU TELL THEM THAT YOU HAVE.
Stephen: THEY CALL YOU UP-- WHO IS DOING IT, NETFLIX? THIS IS NETFLIX, CAN YOU RIDE A HORSE. >>, "THIS IS A WESTERN, YOU CAN RIDE?" AS AN ACTOR YOU SAY YES. I DID A MOVIE 15, 20 YEARS AGO WITH ACTORS WHO ALL SAID YES, CANADIAN ACTORS, WHO ARE SOME OF THE FINEST ACTORS IN THE WORLD. ONE GUY WAS A LITTLE SHY OF HORSES AND HE SKIPPED THE HORSE TRAINING. HE TOLD EVERYBODY HE COULD RIDE. WE'RE OUT THERE IN FRONT OF 500 EXTRAS, 500 PEOPLE. WE'RE IN AMERICAN REVOLUTION-- SHOOTING IN TORONTO-- AMERICAN REVOLUTION. AND THIS GUY AND THE HORSE-- IF YOU DON'T SIT RIGHT ON THE HORSE, THE HORSE KNOW S.
Stephen:  OH, THEY CAN SMELL FEAR.
OH, THEY CAN SMELL FEAR. AND THE HORSE WENT LIKE THAT. SAILED-- THE GUY SAILED OFF THE BACK. BA-BOOM! LANDS ON HIS BACK. THE WIG CAME OFF. THE THREE-CORNERED HAT CAME OFF. 500 EXTRAS JUST WENT, "WHOA." YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY.
Stephen: ARE YOU TRAINED UP FOR THIS? ARE YOU GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE RIDING WESTERN?
I'M ALMOST CANTORRING. I'M GOING TO GALLOP IN TWO WEEKS.
Stephen: WOW.
BUT YOU LEARN-- AND BRAD CLARK, GREAT TEACHER IN MICHIGAN, RODEO COWBOY ON THE WEEKENDS. HE WEARS THE WHAT, THE WHOLE THING-- I'M WEARING A HAT NOW.
Stephen: ANY KIND OF HAT?
THE FIRST TIME I DIDN'T SHOW UP WITH A HAT. THE SECOND TIME I SHOWED UP I HAD A HAT, A COWBOY HAT I BOUGHT FOR A STUPID REASON. AND I'M WEARING IT, AND HE DOESN'T COMMENT ON IT IT. HE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING.
Stephen: OOOH.
I GOT A HAT. AND HE'S GOING, "YUP." YOU KNOW.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU BRING THE HAT? SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RIDE WITH A HAT ON?
I WANTED TO BE COOL. I WANTED TO BE LIKE A COWBOY.
Stephen: OKAY.
YOU KNOW. SO ONCE I HAD THE HAT-- AND YOU GET THE DEER FLIES. IT HELPS WITH THE DEER FLIES AND YOU GET TO DO THAT ONCE IN A WHILE.
Stephen: AND YOU GET THE WATER OUT OF THE CREEK.
I RODE THE HORSE INTO A POND AND OUT OF A POND AND YOU LEARN HOW TO RIDE --
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN. WHAT IS THAT?
THIS IS YOU AT ONE WITH THE HORSE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO TELL HIM-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU LOOK. YOU LOOK. YOU LOOK AT JOHN WAYNE, BIG JOHN WAYNE, STUD MUFFIN JOHN WAYNE, STUD MUFFIN TILL HE WAS 80. BUT DOWN BELOW, HE'S AT ONE WITH THE HORSE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: AND THAT'S LEGAL IN MICHIGAN? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, NOW, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WE'RE TALKING POLITICS.
YEAH.
Stephen: THIS WEEK. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A FEW OPINIONS ABOUT POLITICS. LAST TIME YOU WERE ON YOU LIKED BERNIE BUT WERE HEADING FOR THE HILLS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STAGECRAFT. YOU TRAINED ACTING. YOU WENT TO ACT SCHOOL? I THOUGHT DID YOU.
I WENT TO SCHOOL.
Stephen: YOU WENT TO SCHOOL FOR ACTING. DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING WHILE YOU WERE THERE THAT YOU CAN SHARE?
THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB OF IMAGINING A BETTER WORLD, IMAGINING A GREATER FUTURE, IMAGINING-- THAT'S JUST BASIC ACTING. AND YOU GUYS LIKE CORY BOOKER, OF COURSE, MICHELLE OBAMA-- THEY'RE JUST REALLY GOOD AT IT, THE ONES WHO ARE. AND IT'S JUST BASIC ACTING, WHICH IS EXERCISES LIKE ALONE IN YOUR ROOM AND SCENE WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE. AND PETTING THE KITTY. YOU HAVE --
WHAT IS THAT ONE? I DIDN'T-- I'VE NEVER--
IT'S JUST A BASIC IMAGINARY EXERCISE THAT YOU IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE A KITTY, AND YOU PET IT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU PET THE KITTY. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, LOOK. THE KITTY RAN ACROSS THE DESK. OH, LET'S GO GET THE KITTY AND BRING IT BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: I HAVE A SHY KITTY. I'M PUTTING MY KITTY DOWN BACK HERE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STAGECRAFT OF THESE CONVENTIONS,ING WHAT DO YOU THINK-- HAVE YOU WATCHED THE REPUBLICAN AND THE DEMOCRAT? HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE STAGECRAFT?
I WATCHED THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. THE LAST TIME I WATCHED IT IN FULL, LIKE, 2004. BUT BUSH AND CHENEY AND --
IT'S DIFFERENT THIS YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH. THERE'S THE "D" LIST, AND THEN THERE'S DOWN IN HERE. AND DOWN IN HERE IS WHERE WE WERE LAST WEEK. BUT I-- 2004, I WATCHED IT, AND I WAS SO STRESSED OUT, THAT I WENT AND GOT A STRESS TEST. I GOT AN E.K.G.
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD AFTER YOU WATCHED IT.
THEY SAID WHAT BROUGHT IT-- AND I SAID, "I WATCHED THE ENTIRE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION."
Stephen: WHAT DID THEY PRESCRIBE?
A MONTH IN THE BAHAMAS AND REST AND DON'T WATCH ANYTHING REPUBLICAN ANYMORE. THAT WAS BACK-- THAT WAS BACK WHEN THEY WERE SANE! THAT WAS BACK-- REMEMBER, THESE ARE THE THE GUYS WHO WERE THE STRAIGHT-FACED, GAVE YOU SARAH PALIN. THEY GAVE YOU SARAH PALIN.
Stephen: CAN I RECOMMEND SOMETHING TO CALM YOU DOWN THIS YEAR?
YES.
Stephen: MAYBE PET THE KITTY. LET ME KNOW HOW THAT GOES. JEFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. JEFF DANIELS EVERYBODY! PET THE KITTY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IVE BASSEM YOUSSEF. STICK AROUND. WELCOM BACK EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. MY NEXT GUEST HAD A POLITICAL SATIRE SHOW IN EGYPT WITH 30 MILLION VIEWERS, UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED HE SHOULDN'T ANYMORE. PLEASE WELCOME, BASSEM YOUSSEF!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THAT'S AMAZING. WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY? AND THEY'RE VERY NICE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE.
I KNOW.
Stephen: I FIRST MET YOU THROUGH OUR MUTUAL FRIEND JON STEWART.
YES.
Stephen: PEOPLE HAVE SORT OF CALLED YOU THE JON STEWART OF EGYPT. YOU'RE NOT IN EGYPT ANYMORE. YOU'RE HERE.
YES.
Stephen: DID YOU COME HERE TO ALSO OPEN AN ANIMAL RESCUE FARM LIKE JON DID.
THAT WAS THE PLAN UNTIL I SAW YOUR ELECTIONS AND I SAID, "I'M BACK IN BUSINESS, BABY, YES!" IS THERE YOU LIVED UNDERAB ACTUAL DICTATOR. WHEN YOU SEE AMERICANS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BEING A DICTATORSHIP, DO WE SOUND LIKE BABIES TO YOU?
YES. IT'S LIKE, I MEAN, WE HAVE DICTATORS WHO STAY IN POWER FOR 30 OR 40 YEARS, AND WE CALL THEM BY THE WAY FIRST TERM. AND THEN-- BUT IT'S PREDICTABLE, BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE ONE ELECTION-- ELECTIONS-- AND HE'S THERE FOREVER.
Stephen: IT'S VERY COST EFFICIENT.
YEAH, YOU DO IT EVERY FOUR YEAR. THIS YEAR, LIKE $7 BILLION AND YOU'RE ENDING UP WITH DONALD TRUMP.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW. IT COULD BE. IS THERE ANYTHING FAMILIAR ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TO YOU?
OTHER THAN BEING ORANGE?
Stephen: YES.
WELL, WELL, YES, HE GOT-- I THINK HE REMINDS PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO COME HERE AND STAY IN AMERICA, THEY'RE HOMESICK FOR DICTATORSHIP AND HE PROVIDES THAT.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT, THAT HE'S SO SURE OF HIMSELF?
OTHER THAN BEING A JERK, YES. WELL, THE THING IS, IT'S THE SAME ECHO CAME BER EVERYWHERE. IT'S LIKE "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN." "EGYPT IS THE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD." IT'S THE SAME RHETORIC. I WAS THERE AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES.
Stephen: A TRUMP RALLY.
YES, SOMEWHERE IN GEORGIA. AND EVERYTHING HE SAID, PEOPLE CHEERED HIM. "WE'RE GOING TO REPEAL OBAMACARE." YEAH! AND WE'RE GOING TO KILL ISIS, YES. AND THE BIGGEST CHEER CAME FROM THE NEXT STATEMENT, "WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK CHRISTMAS!" WHERE DID IT GO? ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT THANKSGIVING NOW? AND IT GETS WORSE NOW AS I'M COVERING --
IS THERE AN ISLAMIC VERSION OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO OUR RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS?
OH, YEAH. IT'S ALSO LIKE YOU'RE NOT ARAB ENOUGH, YOU'RE NOT EGYPTIAN ENOUGH. YOU'RE AN INFIDEL. IT'S THE SAME THING. HERE IT'S YOU'RE NOT AMERICAN ENOUGH, NOT PATRIOTIC ENOUGH. IT'S THE SAME ECHO CHAMBER. AT THE AT THE R.N.C., AND I WAS INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE A HIDDEN RACISM. THEY SAY, NO, WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MUSLIMS, BUT IF YOU HAVE A BOWL OF MAN "M"s AND THREE WERE POISONOUS, YOU BE CAREFUL. NOW I'M A POISONOUS M&M.
Stephen: YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE DELICIOUS ONES. THEY DON'T KNOW.
THEY CAN TRY AND LICK ME AND SEE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: BUT IF THEY DO THAT, IF THEY DO THAT, THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE BATHROOM IN NORTH CAROLINA. SO IT'S PUSH OR PULL. WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON? IS THERE ANYTHING FAMILIAR FROM SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM A ONE-PARTY SYSTEM OF A FAMILY PASSING POWER BACK AND PORGT. DOES THAT SEEM FAMILIAR TO YOU?
VERY. BUT IT'S DIFFERENT. HERE YOU'RE RUNNING FROM HUSBAND TO WIFE, KIND OF LIKE A GUY FROM A SON TO HIS GRANDSON TO HIS COUSIN TO-- IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS. IT'S THE SAME THING.
Stephen: CHELSEA'S COMING ALONG. CHELSEA'S COMING ALONG. SHE'LL BE THERE IN A LITTLE WHILE.
SOME PLACES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE DON'T ALLOW THEM TO DRIVE. YOU GUYS WENT A LONG WAY SO THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOUR SHOW IS CALLED?
"DEMOCRACY HANDBOOK."
Stephen: "DEMOCRACY HANDBOOK. ON fusion.net. IS THIS ANOTHER VERSION OF A POLITICAL SATIRE SHOW?
I'M TELLING YOU GUYS-- YOU GUYS HAVE STILL A VERY HEALTHY BODY OF A DEMOCRACY.
Stephen: IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A DOCTOR, RIGHT?
AS A DOCTOR, MY DIAGNOSIS FOR YOU IS YOU GUYS HAVE A VERY HEALTHY BODY OF DEMOCRACY EXCEPT A VERY LARGE ORANGE MOLE ON ITS ASS.  ( CHEERS ).
