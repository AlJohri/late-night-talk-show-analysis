NEWS ON THE MARCH. NORTH KOREA THREATENS TO BOMB GAUM. GOOD EVENING MR. AND MRS. AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEAVMENT WAR IS AFOOT. AT APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS TUESDAY, OUR ENEMY, NORTH KOREA, THREATENED THE AMERICAN TERRITORY OF GAUM, A TINY ISLAND LOCATED IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. DENISE.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? ERE'S GUAM? UNINCORPORATED U.S. TERRITORY LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN ATLANTIC.
ARE YOU SURE? COULD BE THE ARCTIC OCEAN.
FINISHED THE NEWS REAL? NOT YET. WHERE'S GAUM?
THE ARABIAN SEA. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN OCEAN AND A SEA.
I THINK THE SALINITY LEVELS. DOES ANYONE KNOW ANY GO MAINIANS?
IT'S -- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! THIS JUST IN. NORTH KOREA THREATENS NUCLEAR STRIKE NEAR GAUM. NEAR GAUM. APPARENTLY THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE GAUM IS EITHER! WE'RE SAVED! HURRAY!
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES MILLIE BOBBY BROWN, JIM JEFFERIES AND MUSICAL GUEST ZESHAN B., FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, EVERYBODY! PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE TOO KIND! SIT DOWN! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR SHOWS STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, BEFORE WE START THE SHOW TONIGHT, I'D LIKE TO GO ON THE RECORD: I DO NOT WANT THE EARTH TO BLOW UP. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHERE MY HOUSE IS. GOING TO HAVE A VACATION THERE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. BUT THINGS ARE GETTING TENSE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN. WE DIDN'T START IT. NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN TESTING THESE MISSILES AND SAYING THEY'RE MAKING THEM SPECIFICALLY TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES. SO, OBVIOUSLY, A FIRM RESPONSE IS NECESSARY, BUT MAYBE NOT "FIRE AND FURY THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? ( PIANO RIFF ) I GET IT! I TOTALLY GET IT. I UNDERSTAND WANTING TO SAY THAT, BUT THIS IS LIKE A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION, AND YOU DON'T START WITH, "GO AHEAD, KILL EVERYBODY. I'LL KILL'EM WAY DEADER. THEN WHO WINS?" ( LAUGHTER ) "OKAY, BODY COUNT." A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONED TRUMP'S THREATENING LANGUAGE, BUT THERE IS ONE WORLD LEADER WHO THOUGHT TRUMP DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH: DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS AFTERNOON, HE ADDRESSED A NERVOUS WORLD FROM THE STEPS OF THE JERSEY WHITE HOUSE.
WELL, I DON'T THINK THEY MEAN THAT, AND I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE HEARD IT LIKE THEY HEARD IT, AND, FRANKLY, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE QUESTIONING THAT STATEMENT, WAS IT TOO TOUGH,  MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH. IF ANYTHING, MAYBE THAT STATEMENT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH. IF ANYTHING, THAT STATEMENT MAY NOT BE TOUGH ENOUGH.
STEPHEN: WHAT IS TOUGHER THAN FIRE AND FURY? ( LAUGHTER ) LAVA AND RAGE? A PAPERCUT AND A LEMON? RIZZOLI AND ISLES? CRATE AND BARREL? KEY AND PEELE? WHAT? AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WONDERING --
WHAT WOULD BE TOUGHER THAN FIRE AND FURY?
YOU'LL SEE, YOU'LL SEE.
STEPHEN: WE'LL SEE? I KNOW WE'LL SEE, BUT IT MIGHT BE THE LAST THING WE SEE. BUT THE PRESIDENT WASN'T DONE.
IF NORTH KOREA DOES ANYTHING IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT AN ATTACK ON ANYBODY WE LOVE OR WE REPRESENT, OR OUR ALLIES, OR US, THEY CAN BE VERY, VERY NERVOUS. I'LL TELL YOU WHY, AND THEY SHOULD BE VERY NERVOUS, BECAUSE THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO THEM LIKE THEY NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. OKAY? NORTH KOREA BETTER GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER OR THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE LIKE FEW NATIONS EVER HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE IN THIS WORLD. OKAY?
STEPHEN: OH, MY GOD. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK HE JUST THREATENED TO BE THEIR PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT AT ALL. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. AND TRUMP KNOWS ONLY ONE GLOBAL SUPERPOWER COULD FIX THIS PROBLEM -- CHINA.
CHINA CAN DO A LOT MORE, YES. AND I THINK CHINA WILL DO A LOT MORE. LOOK, WE HAVE TRADE WITH CHINA. WE LOSE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON TRADE WITH CHINA. THEY KNOW HOW I FEEL. IT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE LIKE THAT. BUT IF CHINA HELPS US, I'LL FEEL A LOT DIFFERENTLY TOWARD TRADE. A LOT DIFFERENTLY TOWARD TRADE.
Stephen: OKAY, I THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING IS TRUMP WANTS TO START A TRADE WAR TO STOP A NUCLEAR WAR. THEN, HE'LL START A THUMB WAR TO END THE TRADE WAR, AND THEN TO STOP THAT, HE'LL LAUNCH A CUPCAKE WAR, THEN A STORAGE WAR, AND FINALLY A WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S VERY GOOD. NOT A CONVENTIONAL THRILLER. ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, NORTH KOREA ISN'T HELPING. TODAY, THEY SAID THEY'RE DRAWING UP PLANS TO LAUNCH FOUR INTERMEDIATE-RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILES INTO WATERS NEAR GUAM. NEAR TBAWM BUT NOT ON GUAM, OKAY. WHICH IS THE GEO-POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF YOUR BROTHER SAYING, "I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU. YOU CAN'T TELL MOM, 'CAUSE I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU." I'M NOT TOUCHING YOUR FACE. WHY ARE YOU CRYING? I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU. ( PIANO RIFF ) BASED ON A TRUE STORY. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY, LOU. SEEMS LIKE, RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY ONES WHO AREN'T SCARED BY THIS AGGRESSION AGAINST GUAM, IS GUAM. JUST LISTEN TO THE GOVERNOR.
THERE IS FEAR FROM SOME PARTS, BUT THERE IS ALSO GENERAL CALM, UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PEOPLE OF GUAM, WE'RE ALMOST USED TO THIS.
STEPHEN: YEAH, THEY'RE ALMOST USED TO THREATS OF NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION, WHICH EXPLAINS THE MOTTO ON THEIR FLAG: "GUAM: YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) SPEAKING OF WHICH, THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THAT THREAT THIS AFTERNOON.
LET'S SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH GUAM.
STEPHEN: NO, LET'S NOT SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH GUAM! LET'S NOT! HOW ABOUT NOT? YOU CAN'T JUST OFFER A U.S. TERRITORY FOR TARGET PRACTICE! IT'S FULL OF PEOPLE. JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T VOTE FOR PRESIDENT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT HUMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WOW. THERE ARE A LOT, A LOT OF HUMAN BEING FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERING ) THEN THE PRESIDENT LAID OUT HIS NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION PLAN.
NUCLEAR, TO ME, NUMBER ONE. I WOULD LIKE TO DENUKE THE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD THAT RIGHT. DENUKE? DENUKE? I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT WORD. IT'S DIFFERENT FROM NUKE, RIGHT? IT'S NOT LIKE FLAMMABLE AND INFLAMMABLE? "THERE ARE CHILDREN SLEEPING IN THAT BUILDING. I SAY WE MAKE IT INFLAMMABLE." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE'VE BEEN SO DISTRACTED BY TRUMP'S SHOWDOWN WITH KIM JONG-UN THIS WEEK THAT WE MISSED SOME OTHER BIG STORIES. LIKE TRUMP'S SHOWDOWN WITH SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND MAN BEING TOLD THEY STOPPED SERVING BREAKFAST AT 11:00 A.M, MITCH MCCONNELL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THERE'S A NICE GUY. SOMEBODY'S GRANDFATHER, I'M SURE. YOU MIGHT RECALL THAT THE SENATE DID NOT REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, AND DONALD TRUMP WAS -- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MM-HMM. AND BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DO THAT, BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DO THAT, DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT HAPPY. THIS WEEK, SENATOR MCCONNELL FIRED BACK! WITH A LUKEWARM, HIGHLY-MEASURED RESPONSE.
OUR NEW PRESIDENT, OF COURSE, HAS NOT BEEN IN THIS LINE OF WORK BEFORE, AND I THINK HE HAD EXCESSIVE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW QUICKLY THINGS HAPPEN IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
STEPHEN: GREAT POINT, GUY WHO VOTED FOR HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THIS -- "HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING ." NOW, THIS IS A PRETTY MILD CRITICISM, AND I'M SURE DONALD TRUMP WOULD JUST LET IT GO... AND HERE'S THE TWEET. "SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL SAID I HAD "EXCESSIVE EXPECTATIONS," BUT I DON'T THINK SO. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF HEARING REPEAL AND REPLACE, WHY NOT DONE?" YES, "WHY NOT DONE?" ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP HAVE POINT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WHY BILL NO PASS? ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP SAD! AND TRUMP NOT STOP. TRUMP TWEET, "CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT MITCH MCCONNELL, WHO HAS SCREAMED REPEAL AND REPLACE FOR SEVEN YEARS, COULDN'T GET IT DONE. MUST REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE!" AND "MITCH, GET BACK TO WORK AND PUT REPEAL AND REPLACE, TAX REFORM AND CUTS, AND A GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE BILL ON MY DESK FOR SIGNING. YOU CAN DO IT!" ( LAUGHTER ) "YOU CAN TO IT?" WAIT A SECOND. SO NOW TRUMP'S HIS CHEERLEADER, AFTER DAYS OF CALLING HIM A LOSER. IT'S ALL CAPTURED IN TRUMP'S LINE OF MOTIVATIONAL POSTERS, LIKE, "YOU SUCK, EAGLE. I BELIEVE IN YOU!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I WANT THAT. I WANT THAT. JAY YEAH.
Stephen: I THINK WE'VE ALL SAID THAT TO OURSELVES A FEW TIMES. AND THE PRESIDENT KEPT THE MCCONNELL FEUD GOING THIS AFTERNOON.
ALL I HEAR IS REPEAL AND REPLACE, AND THEN I GET THERE AND I SAY, "WHERE IS THE BILL? I WANT TO SIGN IT, FIRST DAY." AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT. AND THEY PASS REPEAL AND REPLACE, BUT NEVER HAD A PRESIDENT OR A SENATE THAT WAS GOING TO DO IT. SO I SAY VERY SIMPLY, WHERE IS REPEAL AND REPLACE?
STEPHEN: I DUNNO, MAYBE CHECK BEHIND THAT WALL YOU DIDN'T BUILD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST MIGHT BE.
Jon: HE DIDN'T BUILD NO WALL! ♪ HE DIDN'T BUILD NO WALL ♪
Stephen: HE WASN'T DONE. THE PRESIDENT TRUMPED ON.
SHOULD SENATOR MCCONNELL CONSIDER STEPPING DOWN AS MAJORITY LEADER?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,  IF HE DOESN'T GET REPEAL AND REPLACE DONE, AND IF HE DOESN'T GET TAXES DONE, MEANING CUTS AND REFORM DONE, AND IF HE DOESN'T GET-- A VERY EASY ONE TO GET DONE, INFRASTRUCTURE-- IF HE DOESN'T GET THEM DONE, THEN YOU CAN ASK ME THAT QUESTION.
STEPHEN: THAT'S A LONG LIST. YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING TO THINK MITCH MCCONNELL ISN'T A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP LOVES THIS COUNTRY. AND HE PROVED IT LAST NIGHT BY TWEETING THIS STIRRING VIDEO CELEBRATING THE BEST PART OF AMERICA: HIMSELF. ♪ AND I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN ♪ WHERE AT LEAST I KNOW I'M FREE ♪ AND I WON'T FORGET THE MEN WHO DIED ♪ WHO GAVE THAT RIGHT TO ME ♪ AND I GLADLY STAND UP NEXT TO YOU ♪ AND DEFEND HER STILL TODAY ♪
STEPHEN: I FOUND IT TRULY INSPIRING... THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND THAT MANY PHOTOS OF TRUMP WITHOUT ANY RUSSIANS IN THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT I DO HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH TRUMP'S ALL-AMERICAN SALUTE TO HIMSELF: IT WAS TOO SUBTLE. SO WE PUT TOGETHER A VIDEO THAT MAKES IT CLEAR HOW MUCH TRUMP LOVES AMERICA'S PRESIDENT. ♪ ♪ BECAUSE I'M A BAD ASS PRESIDENT ♪ ♪ AND I'VE GOT A REALLY HOT WIFE ♪ ♪ HE'S ME SITTING IN A BIG TRUCK AND DRIVING AFTERNOON EVEN BIG TRUCK ♪ ♪ HERE'S A SHOT OF ME WITH ALL MY FRIENDS ♪ ♪ CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW MANY I'VE HAD ♪ ♪ I'LL BUILD THE WALL ♪ ♪ GOD BLESS THE PRESIDENT ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: GOD BLESS HIM EVERY ONE. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MILLIE BOBBY BROWN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I HAVE THE LATEST PROCLAMATIONS FROM A BIG FURRY HAT! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, SIR! JON, GOOD TO SEE YOU. NOW, JOHN, I'M STILL INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT OUR GUEST ON MONDAY. YOU GUYS KNOW WHO WE HAVE MONDAY, WE HAVE ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI MONDAY ON THE SHOW. ( AUDIENCE BOOING )
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE EITHER SAYING THE MOOCH OR REALLY MISPRONOUNCING BRUCE. I'M EXCITED THAT HE'S GOING TO BRING ME A PRESIDENT. HE TWEETED THIS, ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, TALKING ABOUT MONEY, I AM BRINGING STEPHEN COLBERT A PROFESSIONALLY MONOGRAMMED FRONT-STABBING KNIFE.
Jon: HEY! ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: GOOD LUCK GETTING THAT THROUGH SECURITY, MY FRIEND. I DO HAVE A LOT OF SECURITY BECAUSE I'M A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON.
Jon: YEAH!
Stephen: I SPENT A LOT OF YEARS WORKING FOR A NETWORK CALLED IMPORTANT CENTRAL.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AS A LATE NIGHT HOST, I PEELED TREMENDOUS POWER, JON.
Jon: YES.
Stephen: AS MUCH AS HISTORY'S MOST RUTHLESS TYRANTS, GENGHIS KHAN, KIM JONG UN AND CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES. ( LAUGHTER ) WE ALL HAVE TWO THINGS IN COMMON, NONE OF US WILL EVER BE QUEEN OF ENG WHRAND, AND WE ALL HAVE A BIG FURRY HAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( DRUM CADENCE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MY HEAD, ALL PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. ( DRUM BEAT ) ( LAUGHTER ) HENCEFORTH, RESTAURANT BATHROOMS MUST REMOVE ALL MIRRORS. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE AFTER EATING A BLOOMING ONION. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: FROM THIS MOMENT, NO WORLD LEADER IS ALLOWED TO USE THE PHRASE "FIRE AND FURY" UNLESS THEY'RE ALSO IN A HEAVY METAL BAND. ( CHEERING ) FROM NOW ON, FAT-FREE PEANUT BUTTER MUST BE CALLED WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS: A BROWN WASTE OF TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HEED MY EDICT: THEATERS CAN ONLY SHOW A MAXIMUM OF FIVE TRAILERS BEFORE THE MOVIE STARTS, AND ONLY THREE OF THEM CAN HAVE SPIDER-MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FROM NOW ON, ANY GUY WHO MAN-SPREADS OR MAN-SPLAINS MAY BE WOMAN-SLAUGHTERED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS OF NOW, IF SOMEONE BORROWS YOUR PHONE CHARGER, APPLE MUST AUTOMATICALLY SEND YOU A NEW ONE-- BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GETTING THAT THING BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ANYONE WHO SAYS "TOTES AMAZEBALLS" WILL BE "BRUTES EXECUTED." ( APPLAUSE ) HEREINAFTER: TO MAKE "GAME OF THRONES" SEEM SLIGHTLY MORE REALISTIC, THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE SHOT OF THE DRAGONS POOPING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOUR VACATION IS NOW LIKE FIGHT CLUB. REMEMBER THE FIRST RULE OF FIGHT CLUB: DO NOT TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR VACATION. ( APPLAUSE ) FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, IF DONALD TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING DROPS BELOW THE ROTTEN TOMATOES SCORE OF THE 1996 MOVIE "KAZAAM," THEN SHAQUILLE O'NEAL BECOMES PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MILLIE BOBBY BROWN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW" ALREADY IN PROGRESS. MY FIRST GUEST RECENTLY BECAME ONE OF THE  YOUNGEST EMMY AWARD NOMINEES EVER FOR HER ROLE AS ELEVEN ON "STRANGER THINGS."
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, AREN'T YOU? WHO ARE YOU IN TROUBLE WITH?
BAD.  PEOPLE? THEY WANT TO HURT YOU? THE BAD PEOPLE? I UNDERSTAND.
STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME MILLIE BOBBY BROWN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HI. HI! IS THAT NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: YOU WERE ON MAYBE A YEAR AGO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LAST SUMMER, MAYBE, WHEN THIS THING WAS JUST EXPLODING. NOW, CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE THE BIG 1-3. YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A TEENAGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LAST SEASON, YOUR CHARACTER WAS NAMED ELEVEN. IS IT NAMED 13? ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW TO YOU LIKE BEING 13?
NOITS GOOD.
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT? ARE YOU ALREADY A TROUBLED TEEN? YOU JUST GOT HERE!
IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD.
Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING 13?
WELL, YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF AT THE AIRPORT.
Stephen: OH, MORE IS EXPECTED OF YOU NOW.
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE WORST PART OF IT.
Stephen: WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, WE WENT BY RAIL.
WHAT DID YOU DO?
Stephen: JUST RAIL AND STAGECOACH WHEN I WAS A CHILD, EVERYWHERE I WENT. SO WHEN YOU WERE 12 A MONTH AGO, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF?
NO.
Stephen: AT 13 YOU'RE THREATENING?
NOW THEY'RE LIKE, "TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF!" I'M, LIKE, YES, SIR. IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SCARY. NOW I HAVE TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF. MY PARTY WAS PROBABLY THE BEST PART OF TURNING 13 BECAUSE EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A 3-YEAR-OLD'S PARTY BECAUSE I HAD A CARNIVAL, OBSTACLE COURSES, BOUNCY HOUSES, AND COTTON FLOSS -- CANDY FLOSS -- COTTON CANDY. ( LAUGHTER ) I HAD POPCORN AND A BUCKING BRONCO.
Stephen: YOU HAD A HORSE? A BUCKING HORSE?
A BULL?
Stephen: A MECHANICAL BULL? IT'S CALLED BACK BRONCO.
Stephen: IN LONDON, THEY CALL IT BUCKING BRONCO?
I AM THE QUEEN OF BUCKING BRONCO.
Stephen: COULD YOU RIDE IT? YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
Stephen: IT'S TOUGH ON THE THIGHS, THOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE RIDDEN ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
IT'S SO INTERESTING. IT'S LIKE A WORKOUT, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: I TRY NOT TO DO THOSE.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT. MUCH EASIER WHEN YOU'RE 13.
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY FUN.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS?
I DO.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU FALL IN THE FAMILY?
I'M THE THIRD.
Stephen: OF -- I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR.
Stephen: ARE THEY ALL IN SHOW BUSINESS?
NO, JUST ME. THEY'RE ALL, LIKE, MILLIE, REALLY? YOU GOT ANOTHER JOB? OH! THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW I'M HERE TONIGHT.
Stephen: WHERE DO THEY THINK YOU ARE, MILLIE BOBBY BROWN?
THEY KNOW I'M IN NEW YORK AND THEY KNOW I'M PROBABLY DOING SOMETHING, BUT, YEAH, THEY WON'T WATCH THIS. THEY HAVEN'T SEEN "STRANGER THINGS."
Stephen: THEY HAVEN'T SEEN "STRANGER THINGS"?
THEY DON'T REALLY CARE, WHICH I LOVE THAT.
Stephen: THAT IS NICE, I SUPPOSE.
IT'S GREAT. BECAUSE THERE'S NO "ELEVEN" JOKES IN THE HOUSE.
Stephen: NO ONE SAYS, DO YOU CARE TO BE NAMED 13 THIS TIME? ( LAUGHTER )
NO, THEY DON'T. I LOVE IT.
Stephen: THAT'S GREAT FOR YOUR FAMILY.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT YOU'VE SEEN THE SHOW, RIGHT?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
Stephen: WHY? BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T OLD ENOUGH? WHY? BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF SCARY. YOU HAVEN'T DEAN IS SHOW?
NO.
Stephen: IT'S REALLY GOOD. YOU DO A REALLY FINE JOB.
THANK YOU!
Stephen: WHY HAVEN'T YOU SEEN YOUR OWN DAMN SHOW?
WELL, I WAS ON THE WAY TO LAKE TAHOE WHEN THE SHOW CAME OUT.
Stephen: AS YOU ARE. IT WAS IN THE CAR, ROAD TRIP WITH MY FAMILY. IT CAME OUT AND I JUST DIDN'T FIND THE TIME TO WATCH IT.
Stephen: WOW. DO YOU KNOW HOW IT ENDS?
I DO.
Stephen: YOU DO? YEAH. IT WAS FUN. ALL I REMEMBER IS FILMING IT AND READING THE SCRIPTS AND THAT WAS IT. SO I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO WATCH THIS SEASON BECAUSE IT'S TEN TIMES BETTER.
Stephen: REALLY? I'VE SEEN THE PREVIEW.
YES.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMMY NOMINATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL DESERVED. I'M THE HOST THIS YEAR. I'M HOSTING THE EMMYS THIS YEAR. THE FIX WILL BE IN IF YOU WANT IT.
WE SHOULD SORT SOMETHING OUT.
Stephen: DEFINITELY. I THINK I SHOULD BE YOUR CO-HOST. SO YOU HOST AND THEN I'LL, LIKE, WINK AT YOU AT SOME POINT AND YOU WILL BE, OKAY, THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE WE HAVE TO GET THE ENVELOPE AND SAY MILLIE BOBBY BROWN.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT? ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: JUST LAUGH AT ANY OF MY JOKES AND I WHETHER DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.
OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: AS A TEENAGE GIRL, YOUNG LADY, DO YOUR PARENTS EMBARRASS YOU? BECAUSE I HAVE TEENAGE CHILDREN, AND SOME ARE EVEN PAST THAT, AND I HAVE BEEN EMBARRASSING TO THEM AT TIMES, QUITE FAMOUSLY SO. DO YOUR PARENTS EMBARRASS YOU?
YEAH.
Stephen: REALLY? OH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: HOW DO YOUR PARENTS EMBARRASS YOU?
MY MOM IS FINE. MY MOM IS, LIKE, SHY AND CHILL. MY DAD IS JUST --
Stephen: LET'S HEAR IT. YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE HIM FOR IT BUT HE IS VERY EMBARRASSING, ESPECIALLY WHEN -- HE THINKS THAT PHOTO BOMBING IS COOL.
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
BUT HE PHOTOBOMBED ONE OF MY FANS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I WAS LIKE -- ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, THE THING IS, IT'S, LIKE, LATER ON, WE WERE ALL LAUGHING AND THE FAN POSTED IT ON HER INSTAGRAM AND MY DAD WAS SO EMBARRASSED.
Stephen: HE WAS? YES. AND THEN I WAS OBVIOUSLY, LIKE, DAD YOU CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN. AND THERE HE IS, ANOTHER FAN AND ANOTHER PERSON, AND EVEN A FAMILY REUNIONS, HE'S THERE IN THE BACKGROUND. I'M, LIKE, DAD, IT'S NOT COOL. IT'S NOT FUNNY.
Stephen: AT FAMILY REUNIONS, HE'S ALLOWED TO BE IN IT, HE'S IN THE FAMILY.
RIGHT, HE SHOULD SMILE. BUT THAT FACE IS NOT A SMILE.
Stephen: THAT'S A DAD FACE. THAT'S WHAT DADS ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I WANT TO JUST COMPLIMENT -- LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME TALKING TO YOU, BUT MY CONFESSION IS I HADN'T SEEN THE SHOW YET. DID I LIE AND SAY I HAD?
I THINK I DID.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK I DID. DID I LIE TO YOU?
I THINK YOU SAID -- NEVER MIND. IT'S OKAY. YOU'VE SEEN IT, RIGHT?
Stephen: IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ONE OF THE THINGS, I HAD SEEN CLIPS LAST TIME. I SAT DOWN WITHOUT STOPPING AND WATCHED THE WHOLE THING. I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE DESIGNERS. THIS WAS MY CHILDHOOD. I WAS THESE KIDS PLAYING DUNGEON AND DRAGONS. WE WERE THE GUYS DOING THAT. THESE SHEETS, WE WERE DOING THE FORT RIGHT THERE, THOSE WERE MY SHEETS AS A CHILD. THIS IS HOW FOOD THE DESIGNERS ARE ON THAT DAMN SHOW. YEAH. I HAD THE COMFORTER AND THE PILLOW CASES AND EVERYTHING.
YOU'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THOSE SHEETS.
Stephen: WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE SOMEONE CAPTURED MY CHILDHOOD. BACK THEN, KNOW GAVE US PROPS. WHEN YOU PLAYED D.&D. BACK IN 1980, OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF LOVE. YEAH.
WOW. WELL, IT'S MAGICAL, STEPHEN.
Stephen: MILLIE, LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. CONGRATULATIONS. GOOD LUCK WITH THE EMMYS. SEE YOU ON STAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MILLIE BOBBY BROWN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE BACK WITH JIM JEFFERIES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY NEXT GUEST IS AN AUSTRALIAN COMEDIAN WITH A LOT TO SAY ABOUT AMERICA. PLEASE WELCOME THE HOST OF "THE JIM JEFFERIES SHOW," JIM JEFFERIES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) JIM JEFFERIES, RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NICE TO HAVE YOU ON. "THE JIM JEFFERIES SHOW" TUESDAYS ON COMEDY CENTRAL, I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEIR WORK. IT'S A NEW POLITICAL COMEDY SHOW. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR JOKES ABOUT THEIR POLITICS, REALLY, JIM JEFFERIES?
I FEEL LIKE THEY MIGHT. I'M THE FIRST POLITICAL COMEDY SHOW. THERE WAS JOHN OLIVER, YOU, SAMANTHA BEE, TREVOR. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T COME FROM "THE DAILY SHOW."
Stephen: WOW, WHAT A REFRESHING CHANGE OF PACE.
IT'S WEIRD BEING AUSTRALIAN BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR NEWS FROM AUSTRALIANS. IF YOU HAVE A JOHN OLIVER OR YOU OR MILLIE BOBBY BROWN READ SOMETHING, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOT AN AUTHORITY TO IT.
Stephen: WELL, I WOULD SAY AMERICAN ACCENTS ARE FAMILIAR TO US AND ENGLISH ACCENTS SOUND SMART TO US. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE AUSTRALIAN ACCENT --
THIS IS THE THING, IF THERE WAS A FIRE IN BUILDING NOW AND A BRITISH ACCENT SAID THERE'S A FIRE IN THE BUILDING, PLEASE LEAVE THE BUILDING, YOU WOULD GET UP AND RUN. IN MY VOICE, IT'S, THERE'S A FIRE, EVERYONE, EVERYONE -- YOU'RE IN A LOT OF DANGER -- YOU WOULD BE, LIKE, OH, HE'LL BE OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LIKE YOU'RE INVITING US TO A PARTY. THERE'S A FIRE, EVERYONE. COME ON.
YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY COOKING A SHRIMP SOMEWHERE.
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION OF AN AMERICAN DOING AN IMPRESSION OF AN AUSTRALIAN.
YES, IT'S ME AN IMPRESSION OF YOU DOING AN IMPERSONATION OF MYSELF DOING AN IMPERSONATION OF ME.
Stephen: YOU CALL THEM PRAWNS.
CALL THEM SHRIMP. WE HAD ONE AD CAMPAIGN WITH HOGAN WHERE HE SAID IMP SH RICH AND NOW WE SAY, THROW THE SHRIMP ON THE BARBIE THING.
Stephen: THE MAN IS A NATIONAL TREASURE. YOU PUMP YOUR BRAKES.
MAYBE HE'S A NATIONAL TREASURE, BUT NOT AUSTRALIAN. LIVE PAUL HAGAN.
Stephen: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ANYMORE THAN THE FIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GUYS IN AUSTRALIA ARE MUCH MORE CLOSE TO NORTH KOREA THAN WE ARE.
YEAH BUT WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF BOMBING AUSTRALIA? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE KOREAN MISSILES CAN REACH L.A. AND CHICAGO. I DID A LITTLE JOKE ON LAST TUESDAY'S SHOW ABOUT, HEY, DIVE BOMBERS, WE CAN BE RESILIENT AS AMERICANS, WE CAN GET BY THIS. I SAID IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BOMB RENO. I DID A LITTLE REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY, I AID, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T BOMB RENO! I SAID DON'T BOMB THESE COORDINATES AND I SAID THE COORDINATES.
Stephen: OF RENO, NEVADA? THIS IS THE WHOLE THING, YOU HAVE A LEGAL DEPARTMENT. EVERY TIME YOU WRITE A JOKE, A LAWYER LOOKS AT THE JOKE.
Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE LAWYERS KNOW FUNNY. ( LAUGHTER )
THE LAWYER FOR COMEDY CENTRAL SAID ARE YOU JUST GIVING EXACT COORDINATES OF RENO? COULD YOU GIVE 40 MILES OUTSIDE? BECAUSE IF NORTH KOREA BOMBS RENO, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WE GOT IT 40 MILES OUTSIDE. I'M PROBABLY BLOWING UP AREA 51.
Stephen: OR CARSON CITY. THE OPTION I WAS GIVING RENO WAS DIE INSTANTANEOUSLY. NOW IT'S GOING TO BE A SLOW DEATH WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE IN RENO GO THROUGH ANYWAY.
Stephen: UH-HUH, UH-HUH. THIS IS A FUN CHAT, STEPHEN.
Stephen: IT IS. YOU STARTED OFF IN STAND-UP. AMERICANS, STAND-UPS, A LOT OF DRIVING, GIGS ON THE ROAD. SAME THING IN AUSTRALIA?
IT IS. BUT WE ONLY HAVE A POPULATION OF 20 MILLION. SO SYDNEY HAS TWO COMEDY CLUBS, NOT A LOT OF STAGE, SO YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY A BIT. I STARTED DOING RUNS OF GOLD MINING TOWNS IN AUSTRALIA WHICH ARE VERY INTERESTING PLACES. EVERYONE IS DOING A LOT OF MONEY. NINE MEN TO EVERY WOMAN IN EVERY ONE OF THESE TOWNS.
Stephen: YOU DIG AT A GOLD MINING TOWN?
A BIG HOLE --
Stephen: IT'S LIKE LATE 19th CENTURY.
YOU HAVE COAL MINERS, TRUMP HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIM A BIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE THING OF COAL MINERS LOSING THEIR JOBS. THEY'RE ALREADY MINERS, JUST DIG FOR SOMETHING ELSE. HOW LONG IS THIS REFRESHER COURSE? ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YO YEAH. YOU START OFF WITH, OKAY, YOU'RE A DIAMOND MINER NOW, SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BLACK AND DUSTY. NOW LOOK FOR SHINY. COURSE DONE. YOU GO INTO THE GOLD MINUS IN AUSTRALIA AND IT'S NINE MEN TO EVERY WOMAN. YOU GO INTO THE BARRACKS OF THE MEN AND SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A GAY BAR, THEY HAVE A FEMALE BARTENDER AND SHE'S TOPLESS. IT WILL BE A NORMAL BAR AND THEN THEY'LL SAY WE'VE GOT (BLEEP) OVER THERE, IT'S FINE.
Stephen: WOW. I WENT THERE TO DO A GIG WHEN I WAS 23 IN A GOLD MINING TOWN AND I HAD SEX WITH THE ONE SINGLE GIRL. WORD GOT AROUND PRETTY QUICK. A LOT OF MINERS SAID, I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON HER FOR YEARS. I DON'T REMEMBER HER NAME AND I'M SURE SHE'S HAPPY, IF YOU'RE WATCHING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: "THE JIM JEFFERIES SHOW" AIRS TUESDAYS ON COMEDY CENTRAL. JIM JEFFERIES, EVERYBODY. BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE WITH ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
