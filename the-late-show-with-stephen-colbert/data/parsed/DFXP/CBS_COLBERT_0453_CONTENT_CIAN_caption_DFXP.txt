Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES BILLY BUSH AND GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! PLEASE! HAVE A SEAT! YOU'RE VERY KIND. WELCOME. WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. WELL, IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS IS HERE. COURTESY OF ROBERT MUELLER COMING DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE CHIMNEY WITH A SACK FULL OF SUBPOENAS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MR. PRESIDENT, I GOT YOU AN EARLY CHRISTMAS GIFT, TOO. I JUST HOPE THEY'RE NOT TOO BIG ON YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, ON FRIDAY, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND MICHAEL FLYNN PLEADED GUILTY TO LYING TO THE F.B.I. AND IT TURNS OUT, THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW. ( LAUGHTER ) "DID YOU KNOW THAT? LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. MOST OF THEM WORK FOR ME." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT FLYNN'S NOT THE ONLY ONE IN MUELLER'S CROSSHAIRS BECAUSE, IN COURT, HE SAID THAT HE'S AGREED TO COOPERATE WITH THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. WOO-HOO! HE'S SINGING LIKE A CANARY! WELL, ACTUALLY, MORE LIKE AN ANGRY SHAVED EAGLE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YES, FLYNN IS TURNING ON HIS OLD FRIENDS. IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING GOES, "SNITCHES GET SIGNIFICANT TIME OFF THEIR FEDERAL PRISON SENTENCE." 'CAUSE HE WAS FACING AN ALL-YOU-CAN-SERVE JAIL BUFFET FOR CHARGES, INCLUDING FAILING TO REGISTER AS A FOREIGN AGENT, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND KIDNAPPING. SO, TO SAVE HIS OWN HIDE, HE HAD TO GIVE SOMEBODY UP. WHO? WELL, "IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE KUSHNER!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE AFTER THE ELECTION, "KUSHNER IS SAID TO HAVE ORDERED FLYNN TO CONTACT RUSSIA." THAT THREE-STAR GENERAL MUST HAVE BEEN HONORED TO GET ORDERS FROM A NO-STAR SON-IN-LAW. KUSHNER WANTED RUSSIA TO BLOCK A U.N. RESOLUTION CONDEMNING ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, OBAMA HAD JUST PUT SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA FOR TAMPERING WITH THE 2016 ELECTIONS, AND FLYNN CALLED THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR AND SAID, "PLEASE DON'T RESPOND TO OBAMA'S SANCTIONS, ONCE WE GET IN THERE WINK, WINK, NOD, NOD." AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE POLICY UNTIL YOU'RE IN OFFICE. WE ONLY HAVE ONE PRESIDENT AT A TIME. THEN IT WAS OBAMA, NOW IT'S VLADIMIR PUTIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( APPLAUSE ) SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY. STRONG LEADER. VERY STRONG LEADER. LUCKY TO HAVE HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. AND NOT ONLY THAT, FLYNN COULD AVOID JAIL TIME BY PARTICIPATING IN COVERT LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS WEARING A WIRE. "MICHAEL FLYNN'S A GOOD GUY. VERY GOOD LISTENER. SOMETIMES HE ASKS ME TO SAY THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES, DIRECTLY INTO HIS CORSAGE." VERY NICE. SO THOUGHTFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IN FACT, THE WHITE HOUSE IS PARANOID, AND EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE BEING RECORDED. THAT'S TERRIBLE, AND FLYNN FELT BAD ABOUT IT, SO THIS MORNING HE APOLOGIZED BY SENDING THEM AN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS SITUATION CAN'T GET WORSE, TO WHICH TRUMP SAID, "HOLD MY BEER." ( LAUGHTER ) HE DOESN'T EVEN DRINK BORE. ON SATURDAY, HE TWEETED, "I HAD TO FIRE GENERAL FLYNN BECAUSE HE LIED TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE F.B.I." OKAY, HERE'S THE THING -- TRUMP'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE KNOWN FLYNN LIED TO THE F.B.I. BECAUSE, THE DAY AFTER HE FIRED FLYNN, F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SAYS YOU TOLD HIM TO GO EASY ON FLYNN. THAT WOULD BE AN ADMISSION TO OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BIG -- BIG OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF ONE LIE AND YOU ACCIDENTALLY TELL A MUCH WORSE LIE. "BABY, I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN TEXTING WITH MY EX LAST NIGHT, I WAS TOO BUSY SLEEPING WITH YOUR MOM. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU KNOW MOMMA DON'T LET PHONES IN THE BOOM BOOM ROOM ." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT NOW TRUMP'S PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE DIDN'T WRITE THE TWEET. IT WAS WRITTEN BY TRUMP ATTORNEY AND NORSE GOD OF SADNESS, JOHN DOWD.
Jon: OH, MAN!
Stephen: VERY POWERFUL. SO THEY'RE SAYING TRUMP'S LAWYER WROTE A TWEET IN THE VOICE OF HIS CLIENT, WITHOUT THE CLIENT'S PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE, A TWEET IN WHICH THE CLIENT INDICTS HIMSELF FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. THAT IS MALPRACTICE. I CERTAINLY HOPE JOHN DOWD HAS A LAWYER THAT'S WAY BETTER THAN JOHN DOWD. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, NO ONE BELIEVES THIS. EVEN SUPPORTERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION CALLED IT "SLOPPY AND UNFORTUNATE." "SLOPPY AND UNFORTUNATE," BY THE WAY, ALSO ERIC AND DON, JR.'S SECRET SERVICE CODE NAMES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY LOVES THOSE BOYS. AND NOW DOWD IS SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO WROTE THE TWEET BECAUSE THE "PRESIDENT CANNOT OBSTRUCT JUSTICE BECAUSE HE IS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO EXPRESS HIS VIEW OF ANY CASE." ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) OR, AS NIXON SAID, "WHEN THE PRESIDENT DOES IT, IT IS NOT ILLEGAL ...ALSO, IF YOU'RE USING THE SAME DEFENSE AS ME, YOU'RE TOTALLY SCREWED BECAUSE I WAS A CROOK." ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A FINE LINE FROM THIS TO AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! SO THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER SEEMS TO BE TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS DAMNING TWEET. BUT DOWD ISN'T THE ONLY ATTORNEY WHO WOULD DO THIS FOR A CLIENT. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AD.
ARE YOU THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
AND THE MORON WHO CONFESSED GUILT ON TWITTER?
THEN YOU NEED THE SERVICES OF GALINO AND FONZ. WE DON'T JUST DEFEND YOU IN COURT, WE'LL TAKE YOUR CONFESSION AND SAY WE WROTE IT FOR SOME REASON. WE'LL TAKE THE HEAT FOR THE TWEET! AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. WHATEVER CRIME YOU COMMIT, WE'LL SAY WE DID IT.
AND BADLY. THAT WAS US. ARMED ROBBERY?
GUILTY AS CHARGED. CAUGHT STANDING OVER A DEAD BODY WITH A BLOODY KNIFE?
THANKS FOR HOLDING MY MURDER KNIFE, FRANK, I LEAD LIKE IT BACK.
WINK, WINK. SO CALL US.

NO HABLA ESPAÑOL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: QUALITY, QUALITY LEGAL COUNSEL. ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: AND TRUMP WASN'T DONE TWEETING. HE ALSO THREW HIS WEIGHT BEHIND REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND SHERIFF OF TEEN TOWN, ROY MOORE, TWEETING, "DEMOCRATS REFUSAL TO GIVE EVEN ONE VOTE FOR MASSIVE TAX CUTS IS WHY WE NEED REPUBLICAN ROY MOORE TO WIN IN ALABAMA. WE NEED HIS VOTE ON STOPPING CRIME, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, BORDER WALL, MILITARY, PRO LIFE, V.A., JUDGES, SECOND AMENDMENT AND MORE. NO TO JONES, A PELOSI/SCHUMER PUPPET!" AND NOBODY WANTS A PUPPET IN THE SENATE. BUT IF MOORE GETS ELECTED, THEY WILL NEED A FEW MORE OF THOSE "SHOW ME WHERE HE TOUCHED YOU" DOLLS. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) ( LAUGHTER ) THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SUPER CHAOTIC, AND WE KNOW THE CAMPAIGN WAS JUST AS CRAZY THANKS TO SOME NEW INSIDE DISH FROM FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND MAN BEING ASKED TO LEAVE STRIP CLUB, COREY LEWANDOWSKI. LEWANDOWSKI JUST WROTE A BOOK CALLED "LET TRUMP BE TRUMP." I DON'T WANT TO LET TRUMP BE TRUMP! AT THIS POINT, I'M READY TO LET TRUMP BE PENCE! LEWANDOWSKI RELEASED AN EXCERPT THAT DEPICTS TRUMP BUTTING HEADS WITH CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN AND MAN WHO OPENED NURSING HOME JUST TO STEAL RESIDENTS' JEWELRY, PAUL MANAFORT. LEWANDOWSKI'S BOOK DESCRIBES ONE PARTICULARLY HEATED EXCHANGE AFTER MANAFORT ATTEMPTED TO GET TRUMP TO CUT BACK ON THE TV APPEARANCES. HE QUOTES TRUMP AS SAYING "I'LL GO ON TV ANY TIME I ( BLEEP)( BLEEP ) WANT AND YOU WON'T SAY ANOTHER ( BLEEP) WORD ABOUT ME! TONE IT DOWN? I WANT TO TURN IT UP! I'M A PRO AT LIFE." ( LAUGHTER ) ADDING, "I KNOW GUYS LIKE YOU, WITH YOUR HAIR AND YOUR SKIN." TRUMP'S SO JEALOUS OF ANYONE WHO HAS THEIR OWN HAIR AND SKIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "WITH YOUR FINGERS AND YOUR FEET, WITH THE TORSO AND THE ELBOWS." LEWANDOWSKI ALSO RECOUNTED SOME FUN STORIES FROM THE CAMPAIGN, LIKE THE TIME FORMER PRESS SECRETARY HOPE HICKS USED A STEAMER TO PRESS TRUMP'S PANTS WHILE HE WAS STILL WEARING THEM. MAKES SENSE. COME ON -- WHAT WOMAN WOULD EVER WANT TO SAY, "MR. TRUMP, PLEASE TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! BILLY BUSH IS HERE TO TALK BUS! STICK AROUND!
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST AS A FORMER ANCHOR OF THE "TODAY SHOW" AND "ACCESS HOLLYWOOD," AND FROM ONE VERY INFAMOUS BUS RIDE. PLEASE WELCOME BILLY BUSH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: NOW, THIS IS THE FIRST INTERVIEW YOU HAVE DONE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT BUS SINCE DONALD TRUMP BECAME OUR PRESIDENT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND SINCE HE STARTED PRIVATELY DENYING THAT THAT'S HIM ON THAT BUS.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, EWOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT'S NOT ME ON THE BUS. YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I WAS THERE AND THE LAST 14 MONTHS OF MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH IT. YOU DEALT WITH IT FOR 14 MINUTES AND WENT ON TO BE THE PRESIDENT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. DON'T GIVE AWAY THE ENDING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO REMIND US ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE TAPE. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M GOING TO ROLL THE TAPE AND EXPLAIN TO US --
CAN EWITH MAKE A DEAL IT'S THE LAST TIME OR NO?
Stephen: WELL, HERE'S THE CRAZY THING -- THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD POINT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS NEW EDITORIAL YOU WROTE IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" PRINTED TODAY, AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU WROTE IT OR WANTED TO SAY WHAT'S IN HERE, BECAUSE IT'S A WELL-WRITTEN EDITORIAL AND YOU MAKE A LOT OF POINTS IN HERE WHICH IT'S REALLY WORTH READING, BUT NO ONE WOULD HAVE PRINTED THIS UNLESS THIS STORY HAD SOME BACK AROUND AGAIN BY DONALD TRUMP PRIVATELY DENYING IT. THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SORT OF THE MOMENT TO BRING THIS BUS BACK, AND I COULDN'T SHOW THIS FOOTAGE OF THE BUS UNLESS HE DENIED IT AGAIN, TOO. I DON'T THINK CBS WOULD HAVE LET ME.
THAT'S RIGHT. NO, LOOK, HE, LAST WEEK, FOR SOME REASON CAME OUT WITH "THAT'S NOT MY VOICE ON THE TAPE." LIKE I SAID, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. I WAS THERE, YOU WERE THERE, THAT'S YOUR VOICE ON THE TAPE. I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL PROBLEM WITH IT, BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT 20 WOMEN AT THE TIME -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT NUMBER IS BECAUSE THERE IS MORE -- BUT 20 WOMEN WHO USED THEIR NAMES. WE'VE GOT POWERFUL PEOPLE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE NOW AND SOMETIMES THERE IS ANONYMOUS SOURCES. ALL OF THESE WOMEN CAME OUT WITH THEIR NAMES AND TOLD THEIR DETAILED ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN HE SAID THIS, IT INFURIATED ME ON THE PERSONAL FRONT, AND THEN I ENDED UP GOOGLING AND I READ AN ARTICLE WITH ALL OF THESE WOMEN'S ACCOUNTS BECAUSE, WHEN THAT ARTICLE FIRST CAME OUT, IT WAS 13 DAYS AFTER I HAD BEEN FIRED, SO I WAS IN MY OWN PERSONAL SHOCK, FIGHT OR FLIGHT, AND, SO, I NEVER REALLY READ IT ALL THE WAY, AND AS I READ THESE, I SAID, 20 WOMEN DON'T GET TOGETHER AND SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE REALLY FUN? LET'S TAKE DOWN A POWERFUL GUY TOGETHER. HA HA. NO, THEY DON'T. AND THEIR NAMES. AND I SAID, YOU'RE REOPENING WOUNDS ON THEM, TOO. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. STOP PLAYING AROUND WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT UPSET ME. SO I WROTE.
Stephen: WELL, AND AS I SAID, HIM SAYING THAT ACTUALLY BROUGHT THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT AROUND IN CONJUNCTION WITH SORT OF THE CULTURAL MOMENT WE'RE IN NOW WHERE REVELATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE, HARASSMENT AND IMPROPRIETY ARE PUTTING NEW SPOT LIGHTS ON THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT. AND HE STUCK, I'M GOING TO SAY HIS FINGER IN THIS DOOR HINGE BY DENYING THIS. IT'S REALLY DUMB. HE'S A DUMB DUMB.
I DESCRIBED IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DESCRIBED IT.
Stephen: HOLD ON TO YOUR DESCRIBING.
NO, I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU FROM AIRING IT.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO AIR IT AND CUT EVERYTHING OTHER THAN THIS CLIP. JIM?
I'M AUTOMATICALLY ATTRACTED TO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR REACTION WHEN YOU HEAR IT ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF LATER?
THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT WAS THREE DAYS BEFORE IT LEAKED AND, SO, IT WAS LIKE A GUT PUNCH. IT'S A GUT PUNCH NOW. IT WILL ALWAYS BE. AT THE TIME, YOU KNOW, IT WAS 2005, AND HIS RATINGS WERE THROUGH THE ROOF AND HE WAS THE BIG STAR OF NBC, AND I SORT OF EQUATED WHAT HE WAS SAYING TO SOME KIND OF, YOU KNOW, CRASS STANDUP ACT, ANDREW DYESS CLAY PERFORMANCE, HE'S NOT HOME, HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: THE CAMERA WASN'T ON HIM. WHY DID IT SEEM LIKE A PERFORMANCE TO YOU?
HE WAS REGALING THE SEVEN GUYS ON THERE AND DOING HIS BIT.
Stephen: SO HE WAS JUST SORT OF --
IF I THOUGHT IT WAS A MAN DETAILING A SEXUAL ASSAULT STRATEGY TO ME I WOULD HAVE CALLED THE F.B.I., NOT JUST REPORTED IT TO MY EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. SO THAT WAS IT FOR ME.
Stephen: SO WHY WERE YOU ON THE BUS WITH HIM TO BEGIN WITH AGAIN?
WELL, IT WAS SEASON THREE OF THE "APPRENTICE. I WAS WITH HIM A LOT.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE HOST. LIKE I WROTE IN THE OP-ED, A LOT OF US WERE, THE BIG WORD IS COMPLICIT. BUT EVERYONE HAS TO KISS THE RING A BIT OF THE DONALD BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING SO MUCH MONEY FOR NBC.
Stephen: AND WHERE WAS HE WEARING THAT RING? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) I DON'T WANT TO MAKE TOO LIGHT OF IT BECAUSE YOU STATE IN HERE -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE PHRASES YOU USE -- BUT YOU FEEL SHAME WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR BEHAVIOR, BEING ASSOCIATED WITH DONALD TRUMP, THAT YOU GAVE UP SOME PART YOU EVERSELF TO A MAN YOU DIDN'T RESPECT.
THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, I MEAN, NO QUESTION, I FEEL LIKE I SACRIFICED A LET BUILT OF WHO I AM IN THE MOMENT, AND, LIKE I SAID, I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL EVER GET TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ADVANCE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING TO VICTIMS AND PERPETRATORS AND WE'RE SEEING STORY AFTER STORY AFTER STORY. EVENTUALLY WE ALL SAY IN THE MEDIA WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CONVERSATION ELEVATE AND, WHEN WE DO, WE'LL GET INTO HOW DO YOU TALK TO BOYS IN PEE-WEE HOCKEY IN LOCKER ROOMS AND TEACH THEM WHEN THE CONVERSATION GETS DEGRADING, HOW DO YOU EITHER EXIT THE CONVERSATION, CHANGE THE TOPIC OR INTERVENE IN SOME WAY? THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT. I HOPE THAT WE DO GET THERE BECAUSE I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT IT.
Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU A FEW OF THE THINGS HE SAID THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND?
SURE.
Stephen: I MOVED ON HER LIKE A PITCH BUT I COULDN'T GET THERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SENTENCE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
A LOT OF WHAT HE SAYS I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: NO MATTER HOW I INTERPRET IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT DID YOU TAKE IT TO MEAN IN THE MOMENT?
I THINK HE WAS CALLING HIMSELF A -- I THINK HE MEANT HIM, WHICH IS TOTALLY CONFUSED AND BACKWARDS. YOU KNOW, HE GETS GOING AND I DON'T THINK HE REALLY NOSE --
Stephen: HE SAID I TOOK HER FURNITURE SHOPPING. DOES THAT SEEM LIKE A COMMON FOREPLAY TO YOU?
HOW COULD YOU RESIST AN ARMOIRE? ON TOP OF THE ADVANCES OF DONALD.
Stephen: MM-HMM. NO, I MOVED ON HER -- THAT REALLY CONFUSED ME, TOO. HE WAS LIKE A REPEATER. HE REPEATS THINGS TWICE, SAYS THEM TWICE BECAUSE HIS MIND IS CATCHING UP TO WHERE HE WENT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL. HE SAYS WHAT'S NEXT? I'M GOING TO SAY BEAUTIFUL AGAIN WHILE I THINK OF WHAT'S NEXT. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
Stephen: YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT PROUD OF YOUR BEHAVIOR ON THAT BUS. YOU'RE LAUGHING ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AT THE HORRIBLE THINGS HE'S SAYING.
YEAH.
Stephen: I WOULD DESCRIBE YOUR BEHAVIOR AS BOORISH AND SORT OF CALO, BUT YOU'RE NOT THE PERSON DRAGGING ABOUT ASSAULT, YOU'RE NOT THE PERSON ACCUSED OF ASSAULT.
NO.
Stephen: ONE OF YOUR LOST YOUR JOBS, AND ONE OF YOU BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT'S IRONIC.
Stephen: DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THOSE IT IS, AT THIS POINT?
AM I THE PRESIDENT?
Stephen: NO, YOU'RE NOT. NO, I LOST MY JOB.
Stephen: WHEN YOU SAW HIM GET ELECTED, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?
STEPHEN, IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE IRONY. THE VERY DAY HE WAS SWEARING IN AS THE 45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WAS CHECKING IN TO THIS SOUL SEARCHING RETREAT IN SANTA LENA, CALIFORNIA, NINE DAYS OFF THE GRID, NO PHONE, YOU HAD TO CHECK IN YOUR PHONE. IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF ME SAYING, ALL RIGHT, GET UP, STOP BEING SORRY FOR YOURSELF, STOP WORRYING ABOUT THESE THINGS, THERE'S LIFE TO LIVE, LET'S GO, GET BETTER B A BETTER MAN, BETTER PERSON. I PASSED THE TELEVISION IN THE OFFICE WHEN I WAS CHECKING IN. HE'S GOT THE HAND UP AND I'M GOING INTO MY LITTLE CABIN TO DO THE WORK. TOUGH.
Stephen: YEAH. IRONY.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT NBC FIRING YOU? IN LIGHT OF MATT LAUER BEING FIRED FOR ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL IMPROPRIETY?
ITS A DIFFICULT TIME. I THINK IT WAS VERY HOT EMOTIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE MAN WHO WAS CLOSED TO WINNING THE ELECTION AND A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED QUICKLY, BUT MY BOSS, MONTHS LATER, SAID PLUCKILY, I THINK WE MAY HAVE MOVED A LITTLE QUICKLY.
Stephen: DID THEY MOVE ON YOU LIKE A BITCH? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I SET MYSELF UP.
Stephen: BUT DO YOU THINK -- YOU WORKED ON THE "TODAY SHOW." MATT LAUER PROTECTED  EOPLE FROM BEING FIRED FROM THAT SHOW. DO YOU WISH HE WOULD HAVE PROTECTED YOU?
WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. HE TOLD ME THAT HE WENT PRIVATE LITO THE BOSSES AND LOOK THAT LINE. I SAID I APPRECIATE IT AND ACCEPTED IT AND THANKED HIM.
Stephen: YOU BELIEVED HE DID IT?
YEAH, I WOULD SAY I WOULD HAVE LIKED A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE AUDIENCE THAT FOLLOWING MONDAY, BUT IT WAS AFTER THE DEBATE AND I THINK THE TAPE MADE IT IN TIME FOR THE DEBATE. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE EVER ADDRESSED THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO IT NOW?
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS IN THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF THE MOMENT NOW WHERE WOMEN MUST BE BELIEVED?
YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOUR QUESTION, WOMEN MUST BE BELIEVED, AND WE KIND OF HAVE TO FIND OUR WAY TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE. I'M WORRIED THAT THE DIALOGUE ISN'T GOING TO BE AROUND BECAUSE WE GET ON TO THE NEXT THING, WE GET ON TO OUR PHONES, THE NEXT OUTRAGE COMES, WE HAVE TO CONTINUE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND I HOPE WE DO THAT.
Stephen: INTERESTINGLY, THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT HASN'T ENDED.
NO.
Stephen: STARTED WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN, AT LEAST THE LATEST IT REGULATION OF IT, AND GOES ON TO THIS MOMENT.
I THINK THE BUS RIDE WAS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
Stephen: ONE MORE THING TO ASK BEFORE WE GO, DID YOU TWEET THIS THE OTHER DAY? PUT AN INSTAGRAM? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH?
I WAS PLAYING GOLF WITH SOME FRIENDS AND I GOT HIT IN THE FACE WITH A 3-WOOD -- ONE AWAY FROM A DRIVER -- FROM 60 YARDS AND A TERRIBLE SLICE RIGHT INTO THE SIDE OF MY HEAD.
Stephen: AND IS THERE ANY CHANCE DONALD TRUMP LET THAT BALL?
I DID SEE A GOLF CART SPEEDING AWAY. IT WAS A GUY IN A PAIR OF PLEATED KHAKIS, VERY HIGH, WHITE SHIRT, RED HAT, GOING QUICKLY.
Stephen: GIANT ASS? TERRIBLE PANTY LINES. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE DOCTOR TOLD ME IF IT WAS HALF AN INCH HIGHER YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED. I SAID, I'M FINALLY LUCKY, THIS IS GREAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THIS EDITORIAL. BILLY BUSH, EVERYBODY! IT'S WORTH READING! GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE IS COMING UP, BUT WHEN WE COME BACK (TAXES
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN," EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND RIGHT THERE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW. JON --
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: -- IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT YOU WERE DOWN AT THE KENNEDY CENTER HONORS THAT TAPED THIS WEEKEND.
Jon: YES.
Stephen: WHO WAS THAT?
Jon: I WAS INCREDIBLE. I WAS REALLY GLAD TO BE THERE. THE PRESIDENT WASN'T THERE, SO EVERYBODY WAS KIND OF FREE TO BE.
Stephen: OKAY.
Jon: YOU KNOW?
Stephen: YEAH, I WOULD NORMALLY HOST.
Jon: I KNOW, THEY WERE ASKING A LOT ABOUT YOU. THEY WERE SAYING WHERE'S STEPHEN? WHAT'S GOING ON? AND I TOLD THEM YOU HAD A BIG INTERVIEW TO PRAIRPT PREPARE FOR TODAY.
Jon: YEAH.
Stephen: AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP ME AWAY FROM WASHINGTON AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
Jon: I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE.
Stephen: REALLY?
Jon: I THINK YOU COULD HAVE SAID A LOT OF NICE THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: LIONEL RICHIE AND LL COOL J WERE ON THIS WEEK. DID YOU SAY HI FOR ME?
Jon: I TOLD THEM HI AND GOODBYE. I SAID, HELLO, THEY SAID, WHERE'S STEPHEN, I SAID, HE'S NOT HERE. GOODBYE. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S HOW THAT WENT.
Stephen: WELL, I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO CONGRATULATE THE SENATE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE THEY FINALLY DID IT, AND BY "IT", I MEAN ANYTHING. BECAUSE, ON SATURDAY MORNING AT 2:00 A.M., THEY PASSED A TAX BILL. IT'S CALLED THE "TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT," SHORTENED FROM ITS ORIGINAL NAME: "THE BILLIONAIRE STROKE-JOB ACT." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU MIGHT REMEMBER HOW TRUMP UNVEILED THE PLAN LAST WEEK.
WITH TRUMP AS YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO BE CELEBRATING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN, AND IT'S GOING TO BE DONE WITH A BIG, BEAUTIFUL TAX CUT.
STEPHEN: YES, THIS BILL CELEBRATES THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS: A POOR FAMILY LIVING IN A BARN AFTER BEING SPURNED BY A HOTEL OWNER. SEE, IN THE STORY OF THE NATIVITY, THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE INN. READ THE BIBLE. ALL MY JOKES ARE BETTER IF YOU READ THE BIBLE FIRST. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE WHEN THEY SAID THIS TAX CUT WOULD HELP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, THEY MEANT PEOPLE WITH MILLIONS. THOUGH, REPUBLICANS SAY THE BILL WILL LEAD TO A "MIDDLE-CLASS MIRACLE" AND THEY'RE RIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL BE A MIRACLE IF WE STILL HAVE A MIDDLE CLASS. THE BILL WILL CUT THE TAX RATE FOR BIG BUSINESSES FROM 35% TO 20%, THE BIGGEST REDUCTION EVER FOR CORPORATIONS. BUT THEY PROMISE IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU BECAUSE OF TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOW TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS WORKS, THAT'S 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NEVER HAS. ( PIANO RIFF ) BUT THE IDEA IS THAT CUTTING TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY WILL SPUR THEM TO INVEST AND CREATE NEW JOBS. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS POLL OF BUSINESS LEADERS AT A FORUM LAST MONTH WITH WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER GARY COHN.
LET ME ASK YOU ALL A QUICK QUESTION. IF THE TAX REFORM BILL GOES THROUGH, DO YOU PLAN TO INCREASE INVESTMENT-- UH YOUR COMPANY'S INVESTMENT, CAPITAL INVESTMENT, JUST A SHOW OF HANDS, IF TAX REFORM GOES THROUGH? OKAY.
WHY AREN'T THE OTHER HANDS UP? ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: "COME ON, GUYS, WHY AREN'T YOUR HANDS UP? WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. STOP DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND SLAPPING ORPHANS! THERE ARE CAMERAS HERE." AND THIS BILL COMES AT A PRICE. THAT PRICE? MONEY. THE C.B.O. ESTIMATES THAT THE TAX BILL WILL INCREASE THE DEFICIT BY $1.4 TRILLION. THAT'S A HUGE LOSS! WELL, TRUMP DID SAY HE'D RUN THE COUNTRY LIKE HE RAN HIS BUSINESS. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT? DON'T MAKE FUN OF THE MAN'S CASINOS. HE'S SOMEBODY'S LITTLE BOY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE BILL IS UNPOPULAR WITH ONE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION: PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST ONE-QUARTER OF AMERICANS APPROVE OF G.O.P. TAX PLAN, WITH 49% OF PEOPLE WHO WERE AWARE OF THE MEASURE SAYING THEY OPPOSED IT. BUT IT'S STILL POLLING VERY WELL AMONGST UNAWARE-AMERICANS, LIKE THE LOBBYING GROUP "COMA PATIENTS FOR WHATEVER'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW." ( LAUGHTER ) SO HOW DID THE REPUBLICANS PASS SOMETHING SO UNPOPULAR? AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. LOOK AT THIS VIDEO POSTED LATE FRIDAY NIGHT BY MONTANA SENATOR JOHN TESTER.
IT'S THE NIGHT WE'RE GOING TO VOTING ON THE TAX BILL. I JUST GOT THE TAX BILL 25 MINUTES AGO. THIS IS THE TAX BILL. SEE HOW THICK IT IS? HERE'S THE MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE IN IT. I CAN READ ONE WORD, IT'S CALLED ADD THIS LANGUAGE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THAT WORD IS?
STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY. ATTRIBA-DABLIX. ATTRIBA-DABLIX. YES. IT'S A COMMON WORD AS IN, THIS BILL IS GOING TO HIT THE MIDDLE CLASS RIGHT IN THE ATTRIBA-DABLIX. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST AS BRIENNE OF TARTH IN "GAME OF THRONES," AND CAPTAIN PHASMA IN THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIES. PLEASE WELCOME GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
HI.
Stephen: HELLO. HI.
Stephen: NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE KNOWN FOR PLAYING A COUPLE OF REAL BAD ASSES. OBVIOUSLY FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, THERE'S BRIENNE OF TARTH ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HERE IS CAPTAIN PHASMA RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, THE LAST MOVIE, YOU KNOW, I REALLY ENJOYED IT, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE, BUT I KEPT ON WAITING FOR YOU TO TAKE THIS DAMN HELMET OFF SO I COULD SEE GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE. DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE TAKING THE HELMET OFF IN THE LAST MOVIE?
WHEN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE CAST IN "STAR WARS," IT WAS A TINY ROLE. IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS. A FEW THINGS EVOLVED, ACTUALLY, WHICH WAS DISNEY FOUND THAT THE CHARACTER WAS REALLY WORKING FOR THEM. J.J. CREATED THIS CHARACTER, AND WHAT THEY AND I PARTICULAR LOVED ABOUT IT IS IN ALL THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT, WE ARE NOT USED TO RELATING TO A FEMALE CHARACTER BASED ON CONVENTIONALLY MUCH OTHER THAN THE WAY THE WOMAN LOOKS. SO IN PHELPS, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS USED TO GET VERY FRUSTRATED WHEN I WAS LITTLE ABOUT THE WOMAN SEEMED TO BE THE GIRLFRIEND CHARACTER, THE MOTHER OR NONESSENTIAL TO THE PLOT AND OFTEN SCANTLY CLAD IN SOME WAY. SO THE IDEA OF A GENDERLESS SUIT OF ARMOR FOR A FEMALE CHARACTER IN A "STAR WARS" FILM WHERE YOU'RE NOT FORMING A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER BASED ON HOW SHE LOOKS OR HER BODY LOOKS FELT EXCITING TO ME. IT WAS A PRACTICAL SUIT OF ARMOR AND THAT AIR OF MYSTERY IN AN AGE WE LIVE IN WHERE THERE IS JUST AN AVALANCHE OF INFORMATION ACTUALLY FELT REALLY REFRESHING TO ME.
Stephen: I LIKE PRACTICAL SUIT OF ARMOR.
PRACTICAL SUIT OF ARMOR!
Stephen: THAT'S A PRACTICAL SUIT OF ARMOR RIGHT THERE.
THAT IS IN SPACE!
Stephen: I KNOW. IT'S NOT LIKE THE PRINCESS LEAH. GOD BLESS PRINCESS LEAH. JUST LIKE THE BRASS UP HERE AND DOWN THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: NORMALLY WOMEN ARE GIVEN A BREAST PLATE AND NOT MUCH OF ONE AT THAT.
AND YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING MORE.
Stephen: AND A THONG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT YOUR THONG TO KEEP YOU WARM, LOVE! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOW FUNKY DOES IT GET INSIDE THESE HELMETS?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
Stephen: IT MUST BE GET KIND OF SWEATY IN THERE.
NOT THAT I'VE GOT A DISCO GOING ON INSIDE IT.
Stephen: NO, I DON'T MEAN FURVEGY LIKE -- ( DISCO BEAT)
NO, I'M ENJOYING MYSELF
Stephen: HOW SWEATY? IF YOU THINK FOR ONE SECOND I PERSPIRE, YOU ARE WRONG. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU GLOW. I DIDN'T GLOW, CAPTAIN PHASMA GLOWS!
Stephen: J.J. SAID YOU'RE HIS FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIES. WHAT IS IT SO SPECIAL ABOUT CAPTAIN PHASMA? I FESS WHAT I'M SAYING, IS THERE NEG YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT WHAT CAPTAIN PHASMA DOES? I SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO J.J. AND THEY'VE TOLD ME ABOUT THE BIG SURPRISE.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND WHAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION OF THAT BIG SURPRISE IN THE MOVIE?
WELL, LET ME JUST GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END.
Stephen: OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WE'LL TURN OFF THE CAMERAS. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT CAPTAIN PHASMA?
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU --
Stephen: DOES SHE HAVE A HAPPY CHILDHOOD?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Stephen: NO, I DON'T THINK SHE HAD A HAPPY --
SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO WEAR CLOTHING THAT DEVOIDS THEM OF ANY SENSES CLEARLY HAD A VERY HAPPY CHILDHOOD, FEELS COMFORTABLE AND RELAXED WITH THE WORLD, NO ISSUES HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK WHAT I CAN TELL YOU --
Stephen: YES. -- IS THAT -- WELL, WE'VE SEEN A TRAILER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M FEELING SPICEY. WE'VE SEEN A TRAILER.
Stephen: YES. AND IN THAT TRAILER THERE APPEARED TO BE SOME KIND OF CONFLICT. ( LAUGHTER ) HAVE YOU WATCHED THE TRAILER?
Stephen: YES, YOU AND FINN. OKAY, NOW I KNOW YOU WATCHED THE TRAILER.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO LIE TO ONE OF MY GUESTS?
I DON'T KNOW, WE JUST MET!
Stephen: I SEE EVERY MOVIE, I'VE READ EVERY BOOK.
OKAY, NOW I KNOW THAT.
Stephen: I'M LYING. WHO ARE YOU? YOU'RE AS MYSTERIOUS AS CAPTAIN PHASMA! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU GREW UP IN THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE.
YES, I DID.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE OWN TOWN.
I GREW UP IN A TINY VILLAGE IN THE FOOT OF THE DOWNS WHICH ARE HILLS. A DOWN IS A GENTLE, ROLLING HILL, WHERE I COME FROM.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S WHERE A YOUNG, TALL GIRL GREW UP AND WAS RELEASED INTO THE WORLDER AND SPENT HER DAYS IN FORESTS AND FIELDS. THAT IS ALL TRUE.
Stephen: THIS IS ALL TRUE. THIS IS TRUE!
Stephen: YOUR PARENTS WOULD RELEASE YOU INTO THE WORLD?
GO FORTH, CHILD! GO FORTH AND FROLIC IN THE WOODS! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DO YOU STILL LIVE IN THE COUNTRY.
NO, SORRY.
Stephen: DO YOU MISS IT? NO, SORRY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: DID YOU STUDY IN LONDON?
I DID.
Stephen: OKAY. WHERE DID YOU GO?
I WENT TO DRAMA CENTER LONDON, WHICH IS A CLASSICAL METHODS SCHOOL.
Stephen: ASO SUPPOSED TO -- JUST A CLASSICAL SCHOOL.
Stephen: AND WAS THIS SORT OF -- METHOD ACTING IS LIKE STAN STANISLOVSKI. HE SAID A SOLDIER IS AN IRON DISCIPLINARIAN.
YOU HAD TO HELP OUT IN THE THIRD-YEAR PRODUCTIONS, AND THEY KIND OF BROKE YOU DOWN AND MADE SOMETHING OUT OF YOU IN A WAY WHERE YOU PUT YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAD TO WORK ON THE THIRD YEAR PRODUCTIONS AND DISMANTLE THE STAGE AFTER THEY'D DONE THE AGENT SHOW CASE. I EWALKED IN AND SAID, HEY, WHAT CAN I DO? THEY HANDED ME A SCAFF SPANNER AND SAID GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND DISMANTLE THE STAGE. I SAID, BUT I'M WEARING THIS RICKETY OLD JUMPER! THEY SAID, GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND TAKE DOWN THE STAGE! IT LOWERED MY OPINION OF DESIGNER CLOTHES. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: "STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI" OPENS DECEMBER 15. GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY, WHEN YOU'RE READY. I SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE. ( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN, MAYBE A LITTLE MORE JOLLY, LIKE SANTA. ( LAUGHTER )
I SEE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE. I WATCH YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. OH, YEAH. I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE. I KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M MAKING A LIST AND CHECKING IT -- TWICE. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHO'S NAUGHTY OR NICE.
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE TOO INTIMIDATING.
I THINK IT'S RIGHT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT SAN ATA IS SAYING, HE'S MAKING A LIST, NAUGHTY, NICE, HE'S DETAILED, SINGLE-MINDED. HE'S AN EYE IN THE SKY BRINGING SWIFT JUDGMENT ( LAUGHTER )
OKAY, BUT HE'S ALSO BRIG TOYS TO CHILDREN.
NOT THE NAUGHTY ONES. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THAT REINDEER THAT RAN OVER GRANDMA -- I WILL LOOK FOR HIM. I WILL FIND HIM. AND I WILL KILL HIM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT DO YOU MIND IF I TRY SOMETHING? THAT'S NOT A QUESTION. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CLEARING THROAT ) OKAY. RELEASE THE KRINGLE!
