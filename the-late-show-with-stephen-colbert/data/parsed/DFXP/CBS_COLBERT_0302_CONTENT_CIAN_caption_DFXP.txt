♪ ME, ME, ME, ME, ME ME, ME, ME, ME, ME.
MR. PRESIDENT, WARMING UP FOR YOUR SPEECH?
NO, THIS IS THE SPEECH.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMESAR LISA KUDROW. FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, JOSH EARNEST. AND TONY ROCK. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: HEY! HUE ARE YOU? AND TO SEE YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: CHRIS, PAUL, MATT, MARK! COME ON, MAN, LET'S DO IT! ( APPLAUSE )
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE VERY KIND.
Audience: STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." SIT DOWN. TICKTOCK. WE'VE GOT TO GO. WOOO! MY GOODNESS! WHAT A LOVELY CROWD. WHAT A LOVELY CROWD. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. I'M JUST AS EXCITED AS YOU ARE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. AND WE ARE LIVE RIGHT NOW FROMOM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, WE'RE LIVE. RIGHT AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS.LL NOW, TECHNICALLY, THIS WAS NOT A "STATE OF THE UNION" BECAUSE I THINK IN THIS TIMELINE, THE CONFEDERACY WON. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT? I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW THIS ONE ENDS. I'M NOT SURE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE INTERDIMENSIONAL PORTHOLES AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. THERE WAS A LOT OF ANTICIPATION TONIGHT. IT WAS A HUGE EVENING. AND BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN, CNN TROLLED THE NATION WITH THE CAPTION, "TRUMP LEAVES WHITE HOUSE SOON." DON'T TEASE! NOT COOL, CNN. NOT COOL. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. WHAT'S NEXT,  COVERING THEE PRESIDENT DESCENDING A STAIRCASE WITH THE CAPTION "TRUMP STEPS DOWN"? AS HE WAS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE, CAMERAS CAUGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP APPARENTLY REHEARSING HIS LINES IN THE BACK OF THE LIMO. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, CNN'S POWERFUL MICROPHONES PICKED UP WHAT HE WAS SAYING. "UH, I'LL HAVE THE CLAMS CASINO, AND I'LL HAVE A SIDE OF STEAK. AND THE LADY WILL HAVE A COKE, NO ICE. AND I'LL HAVE HER STEAK, PLEASE. OF." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUNGRY. CNN'S POWERFUL MICROPHONES. , OF COURSE, IT'S A REALLY BIG NIGHT, AND SOME IN CONGRESS DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION. THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS WORE WHITE IN HONOR OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE, WHILE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY NICE. THEY WORE WHITE. WHILE THE REPUBLICANS WERE WHITE IN HONOR OF WHO ELECTED THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU GOTTA GIVE BACK. YOU GOTTA GIVE BACK.
Jon: ALL THE WHITE NOTES!
Stephen: YOU GOTTA DANCE WITH THE GIRL THAT BRUNG YOU.EL THEN AT LONG LAST, THE BIG MOMENT CAME.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ANY CHANCE THERE'S A MISTAKE AND "MOONLIGHT" IS THE PRESIDENT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )IS I GUESS NOT. I GUESS NOT, NO.
Jon: SHUCKS.
Stephen: AND THERE HE WAS, AT LONG LAST, THE MOMENT WE WERE WAITING FOR. HE WAS THERE IN THE CHAMBER BEING PRESIDENT AND ALL. TRUMP ENTERED THE ROOM AND DID THE TRADITIONAL HANDSHAKES WITHN EVERYBODY, SO MANY HANDSHAKES, SUCH LITTLE HANDS. LAUGH WHEN HE TOOK TO THE PODIUM TO DELIVER THE SPEECH, AS USUAL, BEHIND THE PRESIDENT, WERE THE VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN, WHO SHOWED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY, BY PURCHASING A BUY-ONE-GET-TWO-FREE SUIT-AND-TIE COMBO. RIGHT THERE MEN WEARING A BLUE SUIT WITH A BLUE TIE. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) GOIT THE MEMO. I GOT THE MEMO. NOW, THE THEME OF THE SPEECH WAS "RENEWAL OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT" WHICH REALLY JUST SOUNDS LIKE A CHINESE BOOTLEG OF "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"? TO BEGIN THE EVENING, TRUMP SPOKE IN UPLIFTING TERMS.
EACH AMERICAN GENERATION PASSES THE TORCH OF TRUTH, LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, IN AN UNBROKEN CHAIN ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE PRESENT.
Stephen: THEN HE EXTINGUISHED THAT TORCH WITH A COCONUT AND ASKED THE DEMOCRATS TO LEAVE THE ISLAND. YOU HAVE BEEN VOTED OFF. COKE NUTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN THE PRESIDENT OUTLINED HIS PLANS TO ROLL BACK GOVERNMENT WASTE.
WE HAVE BEGUN TO DRAIN THE SWAMP OF GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION BY IMPOSING A FIVE-YEAR BAN ON LOBBYING BY EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS. AND A LIFETIME BAN ON BECOMING LOBBYISTS FOR A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.
Stephen: ADDING, "OBVIOUSLY, PRESENT COMPANY EXCEPTED." I GOT YOUR BARK VLAD. AND HE'S ALREADY WORKING TO PUT HIS SMALL GOVERNMENT PLAN IN PLACE.
WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A HISTORIC EFFORT TO MASSIVELY REDUCE JOB-CRUSHING REGULATIONS CREATING A DEREGULATION TASK FORCE INSIDE OF EVER GOVERNMENT AGENCY.
A TASK FORCE. WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT BY ADDING PEOPLE TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S LIKE HOW THE KEY TO NOT GETTING HUNG OVER IS JUST TO NEVER STOP DRINKING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MIGHT FIND OUT TONIGHT. OF COURSE, TRUMP IMMEDIATELY BOASTED ABOUT HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS.
WE HAVE PLACE AID HIRING FREEZE ON NONMILITARY AND NONSTCIAL FEDERAL WORKERS.
Stephen: NONESSENTIAL FEDERAL WORKERS PURPOSE SO KELLYANNE CONWAY IS OUT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'LL BE MISSED. O AND TRUMP KEPT ON WITH THE BOASTING.
WE HAVE WITHDRAWN THE UNITED STATES FROM THE JOB-KILLING TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.
Stephen: YES, THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP IS JUST ONE OF THE TRANS THENG ADMINISTRATION IS WITHDRAWING SUPPORT FROM.  ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOW.
Stephen: DEDICATED TO THAT. NOW, THE PRESIDENT ALSO LAID OUT HIS VISION ON IMMIGRATION.
BAD ONES ARE GOING OUT AS I SPEAK, AND AS I'VE PROMISED.
Stephen: BAD ONES OUT, GOOD ONES IN. THIS NUANCED POLICY COMES FROM TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION DIRECTOR SECRETARY INCREDIBLE HULK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BAD-SMASH. WHY DOES THE HULK TALK LIKE TRUMP?  I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WILL ( LAUGHTER ) AND TRUMP LET US KNOW JUST WHAT STANDARD HE WANTS IMMIGRANTS TO MEET.
IT'S A BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT THOSE SEEKING TO ENTER A COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES FINANCIALLY.
Stephen: JUST LIKE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY SAYS, GIVE US YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR, BUT NOT SO POOR THEY CAN'T AFFORD A TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT LIKE A MITSUBISHI." THAT'S THE STANDARD. THE HUDDLED MASSES. YOU KNOW. GOOD ENOUGH. GOOD ENOUGH AND AFTER THAT-- AND THIS WAS IMPORTANT-- PRESIDENT TRUMP SOUNDED A GRAVE WARNING ON TERRORISM.
WE HAVE SEEN THE ATTACKS IN FRANCE, IN BEGIUM, IN GERMANY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.
Stephen: AND JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE ATTACKS IN SWEDEN DOESN'T MEAN THEY DID NOT HAPPEN. ALL RIGHT? INVISIBLE TERRORISTS ARE EVERYWHERE! W THEY'RE INVISIBLE! THEY'VE GOT THE RING. THEN TRUMP TURNED TOWARD THE FUTURE.
TONIGHT, AS I OUTLINE THE NEXT STEPS WE MUST TAKE AS A COUNTRY, WE MUST HONESTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE INHERITED.
Stephen: HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE INHERITED. YOU INHERITED, LIKE, $100 MILLION. LET'S BE HONEST. AS LONG AS WE'RE BEING HONEST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BALLPARK. AND HE HAD SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT.
BUT TO ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS AT HOME AND ABROAD, WE MUST RESTART THE ENGINE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.
Stephen: AND IN THE SPIRIT OF BIPARTISANSHIP, TRUMP THEN ALLOWED NANCY PELOSI TO RESTART THAT ENGINE.
NO! NO! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) T SHE'S OKAY. I'M SURE SHE'S FINE. I'M SURE SHE'S FINE. I'M SURE SHE'S FINE. TRUMP TALKED SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE MONEY WE HAVE WASTED IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND HOW IT COULD BE PUT TO MUCH BETTER USE, THANKS TO HIS BUSINESS SKILLS.
WITH THE $6 TRILLION, WE COULD HAVE REBUILT OUR COUNTRY TWICE, AND MAYBE EVEN THREE TIMES, IF WE HAD PEOPLE WHO HADS THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE.
Stephen: MAYBE EVEN REBUILD IT 10 TIMES, IF WE HAD PEOPLE WHO REFUSED TO PAY THEIR CONTRACTORS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GET NOTHING AND YOU LIKE IT. NO. NOTHING. THEN, OF COURSE, AS HE NEEDED TO, HE LAID OUT HIS ECONOMIC PLAN.
THIS EFFORT WILL BE GUIDED BY TWO CORE PRINCIPLES:  BUY AMERICAN AND HIRE AMERICAN.EN
Stephen: UNLESS YOU'RE MAKING TRUMPITIZE, THEN THE CHINESE DO AN AMAZING JOB. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) REALLY INCREDIBLE.  . SUCH, SUCH GOOD-- WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS? WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD. FINALLY, TRUMP GOT TO THE LONG-AWAITED MOMENT.
TONIGHT I AM ALSO CALLING ON THIS CONGRESS TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACA OBAMACARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I GOTTA SAY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD ON TRUMP. PEOPLE GOT SO EXCITED JUST HEARING OBAMA'S NAME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NICE OF HIM TO INCLUDE. NICE OF HIM TO GIVE A SHOUT-OUT. IT WAS A NICE SHOUT-OUT. AND AS THE EVENING DREW TO A CLOSE, DONALD TRUMP PROVIDED AN OPTIMISTIC VISION.
EVERYTHING THAT IS BROKEN IN OUR COUNTRY CAN BE FIXED. EVERY PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED.
Stephen: WELL, THERE'S ONE PROBLEM WE CAN'T SOLVE FOR FOUR YEARS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT... I AGREE WITH YOU. I AGREE WITH YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THIS SURPRISED ME. THIS NEXT THING-- I DID NOT EXPECT AT ALL. TRUMP CAME OUT AS PRO CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOLS.
THESE FAMILIES SHOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE, CHARTER, MAGNET, RELIGIOUS, OR HOME SCHOOL THAT IS RIGHT FOR THEM.
Stephen: WAIT? >>. YOU CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT HOME SCHOOL? ( LAUGHTER ) THEN I CHOOSE YOUR HOME. IT SEEMS REALLY NICE. I'LL BRING THE KIDS OVER? WHO TEACHES THEM? ERIC TEACHES THEM. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: SOMEONE'S GOT TO TEACH THEM.
Jon: TEACH THE CHILDREN. THEATRE FUTURE.
Stephen: THEN DONALD TRUMP BROUGHT THE THEME OF THE EVENING BACK TO LAW AND ORDER.
AND WE MUST SUPPORT THE VICTIMS OF CRIME.
Stephen: UNLESS THEY ARE PLAINTIFFS AGAINST ME. THOSE WOMEN ARE LYING. , OF COURSE, HIS GOAL IS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND FOR EVERYBODY WONDERING, THE TIME TRUMP THINKS AMERICA WAS GREAT, WELL, HE GAVE HIS ANSWER-- THE 1886 WORLD'S FAIR.
ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL DISPLAYED HIS TELEPHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME. REMINGTON UNVEILED THE FIRST TYPEWRITER. AN EARLY ATTEMPT WAS MADE AT ELECTRIC LIGHT. THOMAS EDISON SHOWED AN AUTOMATIC TELEGRAPH AND AN ELECTRIC PEN. IMAGINE THE WONDERS OUR COUNTRY COULD KNOW IN AMERICA'S 250th YEAR.
Stephen: WHO KNOWS?N MAYBE A CORDLESS PEN? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) W WHO KNOWS? ANYTHING. ANYTHING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CORLDLESS?
Jon: I DON'T DO THE ONE WITH THE CORD.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT BEING FAIR. WHEN TRUMP SAYS "ELECTRIC PEN" HE MEANS WHERE HE PLANS TO KEEP THE IMMIGRANTS. IT'S POSSIBLE. IF HE CAN DREAM IT, IT'S POSSIBLE. AND TRUMP LAID OUT A VISION FOR HOW WE SHOULD ALL MOVE FORWARD.
THE TIME FOR TRIVIAL FIGHTS IS BEHIND US.
Stephen: ADDING, JUST ONE MORE THING-- SUCK IT, NORDSTROM'S. SO AS WE COME TO THE END OF TONIGHT'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON ONE THING-- ONE DOWN, SEVEN TO GO. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. LISA KUDROW IS HERE. WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS' RESPONSE. STICK AROUND. I'LL BE RIGHT OVER THERE. LIVE!
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! GIVE IT UP FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN! SAY HI TO THE BAND! JON.
Jon: YEAH, BABY!
Stephen: JON, WE JUST GOT-- WE GOT-- I GOT ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES LEFT IN THE DAY, SEVEN MINUTES LEFT IN THE DAY. SO THERE IS STILL TIME FOR ME TO SAY TO YOU, HAPPY MAWRD GRAWRK MY FRIEND.
Jon: HAPPY MARDI GRAS TO YOU.
Stephen: AND THAT MEANS TOMORROW IS LENT, ASHPOSITIVE WEDNESDAY. ARE YOU GIVING UP ANYTHING FOR LENT?
Jon: I'M NOT THIS YEAR.
Stephen: I'M THINKING GO GIVING UP HOPE. IT'S EITHER THAT OR ALCOHOL. ONE OF THEM'S GOT TO GO. SPEAKING OF MARDI GRAS. I'VE GOT SOME BEADS HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST IN CASE, JUST IN CASE DONALD TRUMP IS WATCHING, SHOW US YOUR TAXES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHOW US YOUR TAXES! TAKE THE THING OFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LEGALLY-- LEGALLY, HE HAS TO NOW. LEGALLY, HE HAS TO. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DONALD  TRUMP'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, BUT HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE SPEAKING  TONIGHT. FOR THEIR REBUTTAL, THE DEMOCRATS CHOSE FORMER KENTUCKY GOVERNOR STEVE BESHEAR, WHO SPEAK FROM YOUR NORMAL, RELATABLE, EVERYDAY DINER WHERE EVERYONE FACES THE SAME DIRECTION IN TERRIFIED SILENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) GOVERNOR?
I'M STEVE BESHEAR.
Stephen: AND I'M STILL WAITING ON MY DENVEROMLET. COULD WE? ALL RIGHT. BESHEAR HAD AN INCLUSIVE MESSAGE.
I'M A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST, I'M A PROUD REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT AND MOSTLY AMERICAN.
Stephen: I'M ALSO A MAN, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST, I'M A WOMAN, AND A MAN, AND MOSTLY HUMAN, AND A DOG, RUFF-RUFF. WHO'S A GOOD BOY? I AM. ( APPLAUSE ) SHOWING A RETIRED POLITICIAN FROM A DARKENED CAFETERIA REINFORCED THE DEMOCRATS' CENTRAL MESSAGE FOR 2017-- PLEASE DON'T TELL THEM WHERE WE'RE HIDING! DEMOCRATS CHOSE BESHEAR BECAUSE HE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTEDSS OBAMACARE IN KENTUCKY AIR, DEEPLY RED STATE. ALTHOUGH, THANKS TO OBAMACARE, THE REDNESS HAS SUBSIDE AND THE SWELLING HAS GONE DOWN. ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO THANKS TO OBAMACARE'S KENTUCKY'S UNINSURED RATE DROPPED OVER 12%, WHICH MEANT THOUSANDS OF KEN TUCKIANS WERE FINALLY ABLE TO GET TREATMENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOR-- FOR THEIR DEBILITATING CASES OF BANJO THUMB. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT BESHE WAS A PASSIONATE DEFENDERT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
THIS ISN'T A GAME. IT'S LIFE AND DEATH FOR PEOPLE.
Stephen: ALTHOUGH, I'LL ADMIT, LIFE SAY GAME. IT'S FUN TO PUT THE LITTLE PEGS AND DRIVE THE LITTLE CAR AROUND AND ZZZ, ZZZ ON THE WHEEL. HE SPOKE ELOQUENTLY OF THE PEOPLE WHO MAY LOSE THEIR HEALTH CARE.
BUT JUST WHO ARE THESE 22 MILLION AMERICANS? INCLUDING 500,000 PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN KENTUCKY WHO NOW HAVE HEALTH CARE THAT DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE. LOOK, THEY'RE NOT ALIENS FROM SOME DISTANT PLANET.
Stephen: OTHERWISE, THEY SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T BE COMING HERE TO GET DECENT HEALTH CARE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BESHEAR DESCRIBED THE AVERAGE AMERICANS WHO USE OBAMACARE.
THEY'RE FARMERS, RESTAURANT WORKERS, PART-TIME TEACHERS, NURSES' AIDS, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, AND ENTREPRENEURS WORKING AT HIGH-TECH START UP.
Stephen: THEY'RE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN A DINER WITH NO MEANS OF ESCAPE.RS HELP. SEND HELP. ( LAUGHTER ) SO PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THIS NATION TO THEAP EXPERIMENT OF DEMOCRACY, TO WESTERN CIVILIZATION ITSELF, TAKE HEART, BECAUSE FOR THEIR POWERFUL REBUTTAL, THE DEMOCRATS SHOWED A REBUN OF THE "ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OBAMA PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK TO OUR LIVE "LATE SHOW" ALREADY IN PROGRESS. AND NOW FOR A LITTLE MORE ON THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, JOINING ME IS FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, JOSH EARNEST. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'M GLAD YOU GOT THE SAME MEMO PENCE AND RYAN GOT.
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I GO SHOPPING WITH PAUL RYAN.
Stephen: GOOD. NOW, LISTEN, THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING ON TV IN AN INTERVIEW, HE SAID HE GIVES HIMSELF AN "A" FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR. BUT A "C" OR A "C-"PLUS" FOR COMMUNICATION. AS SOMEONE WHO PROFESSIONALLY COMMUNICATED FOR AN ADMINISTRATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ASSESSMENT? ARE THEY-- ARE THEY GETTING THEIR MESSAGE OUT THERE EFFECTIVELY?
WELL, IT'S NOT A GENTLEMAN'S "C," I'LL TELL THAT YOU. I DO THINK, IN TERMS OF THE SPEECH TONIGHT, I DO THINK THEY SET A COUPLE OF GOALS FOR THEMSELVES. THE FIRST IS I THINK THEY WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD GIVE A SPEECH OTHERL THAN BERATING PEOPLE AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THEY CROSSED THAT BAR.
THEY DID, THEY DID.
Stephen: HE MIGHT HAVEID FALLEN, YOU KNOW--
HE MIGHT HAVE.
Stephen: HE MIGHT HAVE. HE COULD HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE TRENCH THEY HAD TO DIG TO LOWER THE BAR INTO, BUT HE CROSSED THAT BAR.
BUT HE STILL DID NOT TRIP OVER IT. THAT'S TRUE. THE SECOND THING IS, THEY ALSO CLEARLY WERE AIMING THAT SPEECH AT CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS WHO 40 DAYS INTO THE NEW PRESIDENCY ARE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT IN THEIR OWN PARTY.
Stephen: IS THAT TRUE? DO YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON THAT THEY'RE FEELING A LITTLE SHAKY?
I THINK THAT'S EVIDENT,BL PARTICULARLY THOSE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE ON THE BALLOT IN 2018. THEY KNOW THEY'RE ON THE BALLOT AND TRUMP'S NOT SO I THINK THEY HAVE A REASON TO BE CONCERNED. AND I THINK THE RANDOM TWEETS ABOUT NORDSTROM AND THE BOTCHED ROLL OUT OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS I THINK GIVE THEM SOME CAUSE FOR CONCERN. BUT LOOK, IN TERMS OF LOWERING THE BAR, I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN LOWER THE BAR ANY FARTHER THAN HOAMG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN YOUR PARTY, WHO ARE IN THE AUDIENCE, LIKE THE SPEECH YOU'VE JUSTOR GIVEN BUT --
Stephen: HE GAVE THEM SOME EXERCISE WITH ALL THE UPPING AND DOWNING THEY DID. I THOUGHT IT WAS A PERFECTLY GOOD SPEECH, YOU KNOW. HE-- HE-- HE SALUTED OUR TROOPS, THOSE WHO HAVE TACK FIESED FOR OUR NATION. THAT WAS VERY MOVING.
YEAH.
Stephen: HE CERTAINLY ADDRESSED HIS OWN PARTY'S CONCERNS. DO YOU THINK HE REACHED OUT TO THE DEMOCRATS IN ANY WAY?
I THINK HE WAS TRYING. I THINK THAT HE WAS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE TO PEOPLE THAT HE HAD HEARD SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAD BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE WAY THAT HE DOES COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC. SO HIM STARTING THE SPEECH BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE TERRIBLE SHOOTING IN MY HOME TOWN OF KANSAS CITY, YOU KNOW A WEEK OR SO AGO, I THINK WE WAITED ENTIRELY TOO LONG FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT THAT TERRIBLE ACT OF VIOLENCE.  ( APPLAUSE ) T BUT TO HIS CREDIT, TO HIS CREDIT, HE USED THE LARGEST STAGE IN AMERICAN POLITICS TO DO SO, AND THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Stephen: NOW, YOU MUST HAVE SOME SYMPATHY FOR SEAN SPICER BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL CLUB, IT'S A SMALL CLUB OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN UP THERE ON THE PODIUM IN THE PIRANHA PIT THAT IS THE PRESS POOL. HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM SINCE HE'S BEEN IN THAT JOB? HAS HE CALLED YOU UP AND SAID, "AM I ALLOWED TO PUNCH THEM?" DID YOU EVER FEEL THE WAY HE LOOKS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES. THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE FRICTION AND TENSION BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS AND THE WHITE HOUSE. THE DAY THAT THERE IS NOT FRICTION AND TENSE BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE DAY THAT THE PRESS CORPS HAS STOPPED DOING THEIR JOB. SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL WHAT, ABOUT-- WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT FIRST DAY, HIS VERY FIRST FULL DAY ON THE JOB WHEN HE GOES OUT AND HET BERAITS THE PRESS FOR HAVING THE TEMERITY TO POINT OUT THAT THERE WEREN'T AS MANY PEOPLE AT TRUMP'S INAUGURAL AS OBAMA'S EIGHT YEARS AGO. WHEN YOU SAW THAT, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?
WELL, IT SEEMED LIKE A STRANGE WAY TO START. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DO YOU THINK HE WROTE THAT? OR DID THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING HE HAD TO READ HANDED TO HIM BY SOMEBODY WITH TINY HANDS.
IT DID SEEM LIKE HE MAY NOT HAVE WRITTEN HIS REMARKS ENTIRELY HIMSELF. I THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY LIKELY. BUT, LISTEN, IT-- ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ABOUT BEING THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY IS YOUR JOB IS TO GO OUT THERE EVERY-- IT'S NOT A JOB UNLIKE YOURS. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SPEAK TO THE PRESS CORPS ON LIVE TELEVISION DISPP YOUR RESPONSIBILITY --
Stephen: WELL, WE DON'T LET THE PRESS IN HERE. WE DON'T LET THE PRESS IN HERE.
THEY HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
Stephen: WE'VE SHUT THEM OUT OF THIS GAGGLE.
SO, LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO SPENDING ALL THE CREDIBILITY HE SPENT ON THE VERY FIRST DAY, I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE SHORTSIGHTED.
Stephen: WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS LITTLE DUST-UP LAST FRIDAY WHEN THEY DIDN'T LET IN "NEW YORK TIMES," "LOS ANGELES TIMES," BUZZFEED, POLITICO, ANDE ONE OTHER-- I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS. CNN. I'VE HEARD OF THAT ORGANIZATION, CNN. INTO THE PRESS GAGGLE. PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS A VIOLATION OF THE NORMS. YOU GUYS WERE ACCUSED OF DOING THE SAME THING TO FOX NEWS BACK WHEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION STARTED. IS IT FAIR TO CRITICIZE THEM FOR HAVING DONE THIS?
IT IS ENTIRELY FAIR TO CRITICIZE THEM.
Stephen: WAS IT FAIR TO CRITICIZE YOU GUYS FOR KEEPING FOX OUT?
WE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES WITH FOX, AND THERE WERE CERTAIN SITUATION WHERE'S WE HAD SOME DUST-UPS, BUT THERE WAS NEVER A SITUATION STEPHEN, WHERE WE PREVENTED FOX FROM PAYMENTING IN THE DAILY WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING. IN FACT WE DIDN'T JUST LET THEM ATTEND THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING. EVERY DAY THAT I WAS PRESSVER SECRETARY I CALLED ON FOX NEWS AND I TOOK QUESTIONS FROM FOX NEWS. AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT-- ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S RISKY.
Stephen:
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THAT'S NOT-- THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR ON FOX NEWS. ( LAUGHTER ).
NO, IT'S NOT BUT SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP FAKE NEWS-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, THERE YOU GO. OH, THANK YOU. THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW, RIGHT?
Stephen: SURE, MOST OF THE TIME. MOST OF THE TIME.
IT'S COMEDY.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT FAKE NEWS AND ALTERNATIVE FACTS? THOSE ARE GREAT TOOLS THE ADMINISTRATION IS USING TO SORT OF DELEGITIMIZE THE PRESS, WHICH IS LIKE THE REF, ROUGHING UP THE REF.
IT'S NOT NEW. THEY TRIED THE SAME THING OVER LAST EIGHT YEARS BY TRYING TO DELEGITIMIZE PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT NOT BEING BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS NOT A NEW THING. THIS IS SOMETHING REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN, AND ONE REPUBLICAN IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON FOR A LONG TIME. WE TRIED A DIFFERENT STRATEGY. OUR STRATEGY WAS TO TELL THE TRUTH. OUR STRATEGY WAS TO MARSHAL FACTS AND TO PRESENT EVIDENCE.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND TO MAKE A CASE. AND HERE'S THE THIENG IF YOU BELIEVE PASSIONATELY THAT YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE RIGHT REASONS, THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO GO UP ON THE THERE IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC AND MAKE YOUR CASE AND PRESENT SOME AND HE WAS SAY, "LOOK WHAT WE'RE DOING. IT WORKS."
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT HE DID TONIGHT. THAT'S WHAT HE DID TONIGHT.
WELL, I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT HE DID TONIGHT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN ANY RESULTS YET.
Stephen: NO, HE SAID THERE'S A WIND SWEEPING ACROSS AMERICA AND EVERYBODY FEELS BETTER.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: JOSH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: JOSH EARNEST, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LISA KUDROW. STICK AROUND. WELCOME BACK! WELCOME BACK TO THIS LIVE "LATE SHOW"." WELL, FOLKS, SHE'S THE EMMY- WINNING ACTRESS YOU KNOW FROMBA "THE COMEBACK" AND, OF COURSE, AS PHOEBE FROM "FRIENDS." HER NEW MOVIE IS "TABLE 19."

Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: I DIDN'TIGATE CHANCE TO SAY HI TO YOU BEFORE THE SHOW BECAUSE WE WERE WATCHING THE SPEECH.
YOU WERE LIVE. YOU WERE BUSY.
Stephen: DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO WATCH THE SPEECH YOURSELF?
NO.
Stephen: I'LL CATCH YOU UP. EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
OH!
Stephen: THE WIND IS AT AMERICA'S BACK OR SOMETHING IS BEHIND US AND CATCHING UP WITH US REALLY QUICKLY.
OKAY. THAT'S EXACTLY THE REALITY I LIKE TO LIVE IN.
Stephen: EVERYTHING IT FINE.
DENIAL IT'S FINE.
Stephen: WE'RE ON A LIVE SHOW AS I SAID BEFORE. YOU'RE A LIVE PERFORMER. YOU STARTED OFF AT THE GROUNDLINGS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IN LOS ANGELES.AL WAS THAT THE LAST TIME YOU WERE UP AT MIDNIGHT PERFORMING LIVE?
YEAH ARCT THEIR NEW YEAR'S SHOW.
Stephen: YOU DO A NEW YEAR'S SHOW?
I DID A NEW YEAR'S SHOW.
Stephen: I DID NEW YEAR'S SHOW AT SECOND CITY ALL THE TIME. I LOVED TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PRETEND YOU WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME.
I DID IT ONCE. I'M SORRY, BUT THEN AFTERWARD, YOU HAVE TO HAVE NEW YEARS WITH THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen: OH, NO.
I DIDN'T KNOW THEN.
Stephen: NO! GET OUT!
IT WAS REALLY AWKWARD. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO.
Stephen: WE WENT BACKSTAGE AND HAD A SIX-PARK PAC WITH OUR FRIENDS.
WE HAD TO.
Stephen: YOU HAD TO.
I GUESS THAT WAS PART OF THE ALLURE. "YOU GET TO CELEBRATE NEW YEAR'S EVE WITH THE CAST."
Stephen: SO THEY PIMPED YOU OUT. OH, WOW.
I'M USED TO IT.
Stephen: HOW LONG WERE YOU THERE? HOW LONG WERE THRU?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
Stephen: OH!
BUT I REMEMBER I LEFT WHEN I WAS ON "FRIENDS."
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE AIR, PLAY TO GO TO AFTER THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: DID I HEAR THIS CORRECTLY THAT YOU STUDIED BIOLOGY.
YEAH.
Stephen: AT VASSER.
YES.  ( APPLAUSE ).
BIOLOGY! Y WOO! DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO BE A BIOLOGIST? WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO DO WITH YOUR BIOLOGY DEGREE?
FIRST I WAS GOING TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT THEN REALIZED THIS WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR ME.
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO DR. KUDROW.
MY DAD IS DR. KUDROW AND MY BROTHER IS DR. KUDROW.
Stephen: YOU STUDIED SOMETHING ABOUT HEADACHES.
MY FATHER, WHO IS RETIRED, WAS A HEADACHE SPECIALIST AND NOW MY BROTHER IS A HEADACHE SPECIALIST.
Stephen: YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT HEADACHES?
I DO.
Stephen: WHAT CAUSES HEADACHES?
OKAY, I'M NOT A DOCTOR. I HAVE TO SAY, THAT RIGHT? I HAVE TO SAY THAT. >GLI DON'TKNOW IF YOU HAVE TO.
I THINK I SHOULD.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT UNDER OATH RIGHT NOW.
AND I'M NOT SURE --
Stephen: SO PROBABLY BEING A DOCTOR WAS NOT THE BEST CHOICE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOUR DAD CERTAINLY TALKS ABOUT THIS. WHAT CAUSES A HPPED ACHE? IS IT DEEM NONS MY SKULL TRYING TO SCRATCH THEIR WAY OUT? THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE SOMETIMES.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DISCOVERED, YES. D NO, BUT THERE ARE NINE DIFFERENT HEADACHE TYPES. AND I THINK MOST OF THEM ARE BLOOD VESSELS DILATE AGO.
Stephen: I'M PICTURING THE BUZZFEED QUIZ, WHICH HEADACHE ARE YOU? ARE YOU A CLUCHTER HEADACHE.
CLUSTER HEADACHE WAS MY DAD'S SPECIALTY. IT'S THE WORST THING. IT'S HORRIBLE. IT'S REALLY HORRIBLE SUFFERING. IT FEELS LIKE A RED POKER BEING FORTHED THROUGH YOUR EYE. IT'S REALLY BAD.
Stephen: AND CAN WE DO ANYTHING FOR THAT NOW?
WELL, YES, WE CAN. ( LAUGHTER ) I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING A COMMERCIAL.
Stephen: IT'S A E PHARMACEUTICAL COMMERCIAL.
THEY NEED MORE!
Stephen: SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS INTERVIEW, MAY INCLUDE DRY MOUTH. MY MOTHER SAID TO ME WHEN I WAS-- WHEN I WAS A KID, I TRIED TO NOT GO TO SCHOOL BY SAYING, "I HAVE A HEADACHE, MOM." MY MOM WOULD SAY, "I HAVE HAD A HEADACHE EVERY MORNING OF MY ADULT LIFE. YOU'RE GOG SCHOOL." ALL I COULD THINK OF IS, "KILL YOURSELF. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?" IT WAS SUCH A BLEAK PICTURE OF ADULTHOOD. SPEAK OF BLEAK, "TABLE 19"--
SPEAK OF BLEAK?K YEAH.
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE--
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME-- TELL ME IF I HAVE THIS RIGHT-- IT'S ABOUT GETTING SAT AT THE LOSER TABLE. WHAT IS THE LOSER TABLE LIKE AT A WEDDING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
A WEDDING, TABLE 19 IS POPULATED WITH WANT PEOPLE YOU WERE HOPING WOULDN'T COME.
Stephen: THE COUSIN YOU HAD TO INVITE?
YEAH, STEPHEN MERCHANT PLAYSA THAT GUY, HE'S IN JAIL IN A HALFWAY HOUSE WHEN HE COMES. WHO ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO GUESS? IT'S A FUN GAME. JUNE SQUIBB, IS IN IT. SHE'S THE NANNY.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER SAT AT THE LOSERS' TABLE.
I'M NOT A LOSER. I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS A LOSER. BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT THA TABLE AT EVERY WEDDING I'VE BEEN TO. AND ONLY AFTER I DID THIS MOVIE DID I REALIZE-- ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S WHERE THEY PUT YOU?
YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS SO HAPPY. AYE GO LIKE, "OH, I'M FAR FROM THE BAND. I'M NOWHERE NEAR THE BRIDE AND GROOM. I'M NEAR THE BATH DISPRIEM CAN LEAVE WHENEVER I WANT. NO ONE SEES ME. THIS IS THE BEST." NOT REALIZING THEY DON'T WANT ME. I'M NOWHERE NEAR THEM.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF A SHOW ON TLC CALLED, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?" WHAT IS THAT? THE WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?" DID YOU IT. DID YOU SKIP GATES' SHOW.
Stephen: "FACES OFO AMERICA." YOUR GENEALOGY. WHO DID YOU THINK YOU WERE? DID YOU FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF? DID YOU PUT YOURSELF UNDER A MICROSCOPE?
I DID.
Stephen: ARE YOU WHO YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE?
I'M STILL ME, BASICALLY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THERE'S EPISODE ONE.
IT FAILED!
Stephen: AND COURTNEY COX IS COMING UP, RIGHT?
COURTNEY COX IS THIS SUNDAY.
Stephen: WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS GIMEAN, SHE'S THE BEST PERSON I KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE'S GREAT. SHE'S SWEET.

Stephen: SO HAVE YOU BEENER ON TERRIBLE DATES YOURSELF? I ASSUME--
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A BAD DATE. I'LL JUST END IT. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE.
Stephen: YOU'LL END IT?
"THIS ISN'T GOING RIGHT. I'LL CALL YOU AN URER, I'LL HOLD THE DOOR, BUT I CAN'T WASTE TIME ON A BAD DATE."
