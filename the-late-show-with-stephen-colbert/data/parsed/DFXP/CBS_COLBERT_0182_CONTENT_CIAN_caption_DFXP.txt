(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH... PLEASE DRINK RESPONSIBLY, WHETHER OR NOT I DO.
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JENNIFER SAUNDERS AND CORY KAHANEY, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY,.
Stephen: HEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! REMEMBER YET? I DON'T. AND IT WAS TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) SO LET'S REDISCOVER IT TOGETHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, AS FUN AS IT IS TO WATCH AND TALK ABOUT THE CONVENTION, THERE IS A LITTLE NON-CONVENTION NEWS OUT THERE. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU GUYS KNOW THIS, BUT IT WAS ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT FOX NEWS C.E.O. AND JABBA THE HUT COSPLAYER ROGER AILES, WHO WAS ACCUSED OF REPEATED SEXUAL HARASSMENT, HAS RESIGNED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE RESIGNATION COMES ON THE HEELS OF A FOX NEWS INTERNAL PROBE. (LAUGHTER) INTERNAL PROBE, BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S ACCUSED OF ASKING FOR. NOW, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT, ALTHOUGH I SPENT WELL OVER A DECADE MAKING FUN OF HIS NETWORK AND HIM AND THE DAMAGE I THINK HE DID TO THE WORLD, THE NEWS OF THIS MAN LOSING HIS JOB GIVES ME NO PLEASURE. (LAUGHTER) JIMMY, CAN WE GET THE CAMERA OFF ME FOR A SECOND, PLEASE? (CHEERING) IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEONE I COULD SHARE THIS LACK OF PLEASURE WITH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON: HEY, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: OH, JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU!
JON: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NORMALLY THIS TIME OF NIGHT, I'M JUST SLEEPING. WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?
Stephen: OH. WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW HOW ROGER AILES HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT?
JON: OH, I MIGHT HAVE READ SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
STEPHEN: WELL, TODAY, ROGER AILES STEPPED DOWN.
JON: HUH. JIMMY, CAN YOU TAKE THE CAMERA OFF ME FOR A SECOND? (CHEERING)
STEPHEN: SO THANKS FOR STOPPING BY. IS THERE SOMETHING I COULD HELP YOU WITH?
JON: I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD JUST MAYBE TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION FOR A LITTLE BIT.
STEPHEN: OF COURSE. FOR ME TO TO IT, I'LL PROBABLY NEED YOUR DESK.
Stephen: WANT TO SIT HERE? OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: REALLY NICE DOWN HERE.
AMERICA --
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO -- IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
STEPHEN: ACTUALLY --
JON: OH, RIGHT. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: YOU'VE GOT TO DO THIS. (CHEERING)
JON: OH, YEAH. THAT'S HAIR.
Stephen: HAVE A GOOD TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, THE CONVENTION'S OVER. I THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WAS GOING TO SPEAK. IVANKA SAID HE WAS GOING TO COME OUT TO SPEAK BUT THIS ANGRY GROUNDHOG CAME OUT AND VOMITED ON EVERYBODY FOR AN HOUR. THE REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR PLAN FOR AMERICA. THEY ARTICULATED IT WITHOUT THE CONVENTION. ONE, JAIL YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT. TWO, INJECT RUDY GIULIANI WITH A SPEEDBALL-AND-RED-BULL ENEMA, AND THREE, SPEND THE REST OF THE TIME SCARING THE HOLY BEJESUS OUT OF EVERYBODY. BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT. I'M INTERESTED IN GYMNASTICS. WITH THE REAL OLYMPICS COMING UP, I'M JUST GONNA ENJOY WATCHING THE GYMNASTICS PORTION OF THE PROGRAM THAT'S ABOUT TO OCCUR. THAT WILL BE THE CONTORTIONS MANY CONSERVATIVES WILL HAVE TO DO TO EMBRACE DONALD J. TRUMP, A MAN WHO EMBODIES ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE FOR YEARS SAID THEY'VE HATED ABOUT BARACK OBAMA.
MOST INEXPERIENCED NOMINEE TO EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENTS IN HISTORY.
NOTORIOUSLY THIN-SKINNED.
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY AUTHORITARIAN.
A RAGING NARCISSIST WHO HAS NO GRIP ON REALITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON: A THIN-SKINNED NARCISSIST WITH NO GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE. YES, THAT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE -- BARACK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) SO RIGHT WING MEDIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, NOW, JUSTIFYING THIS CHOICE. CAN THEY MAKE THE TURN? THEY ALREADY ARE. LET'S TRACE THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE EYES OF ONE OF THEIR MOST TALENTED GYMNASTS. HIS NAME ESCAPES ME, SO LET'S REFER TO HIM AS LUMPY. (LAUGHTER) HI, LUMPY. FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S HOW LUMPY FELT ABOUT BARACK OBAMA'S DIVISIVENESS.
THIS PRESIDENT IS THE MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. SCARE TACTICS, CLASS WARFARE, RACIAL RHETORIC, DIVIDED ALONG RACIAL LINES, RICH VERSUS POOR, BLACK VERSUS WHITE, OLD VERSUS YOUNG.
JON: CATS VS. DOGS, BATMAN VS. SUPERMAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ONE VS. THESE OTHER TWO! I HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR A WHILE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, ACTUALLY. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU DON'T LIKE DIVISIVENESS, WHAT ABOUT TRUMP SUGGESTING MEXICO IS SENDING US THEIR RAPISTS? IF YOU DON'T LIKE DIVISIVE RHETORIC, THEN --
PERHAPS INARTICULATE, BUT HE DID SAY, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. HE DIDN'T SAY ALL MEXICANS.
JON: AND CINCO DE MAYO! HE HAD THE TRUMP TOWER TACO BOWL! THAT IS ONE OF THE HEALINGEST MEALS ON THE TRUMP TOWER MENU. LOOK, I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON RACIAL UNITY, BUT SOME OF OUR MORE VAUNTED HISTORICAL LEADERS IN THAT AREA DID RETWEET WHITE SUPREMACISTS LESS. -- LESS THAN TRUMP. SO I BELIEVE -- I'M JUST SAYIN'. (LAUGHTER) THEN THERE WAS THE OBAMA CRONY THAT LUMPY COULDN'T STAND. HIS OLD FRIEND TELEPROMPTY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE CAN'T READ A SENTENCE WITHOUT A TELEPROMPTER. HE SLEEPS WITH THE DARN THING.
JON: YEAH, HE PROBABLY SLEEPS WITH THE DAMN THING. AND THEN PROBABLY DOESN'T CALL IT THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SAY SO ON THE TELEPROMPTER! (LAUGHTER) LUMPY, YOUR 180, PLEASE.
WE'VE SEEN HIM GIVING A SERIES OF POLICY SPEECHES, USING A TELEPROMPTER, STAYING ON MESSAGE, REALLY WELL DONE FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAD NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.
JON: YOU HATE TELEPROMPTERS! YOU'RE SAYING NOW TELEPROMPTERS ARE FOR STUPID PEOPLE! AND I THOUGHT TRUMP HANDLED IT PRETTY GOOD. (LAUGHTER) BUT INEXPERIENCE ASIDE, DIVISIVENESS ASIDE, THE WORST THING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA IS HIS ELITISM.
BARACK OBAMA IS ANYTHING BUT MAINSTREAM. SITTING IN HIS MILLION-DOLLAR HOME, CLAIMING TO BE FOR THE PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO WONDER HOW IN TOUCH HE IS WITH THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. TAKE A LOOK AT HIM ORDERING HIS BURGER WITH A VERY SPECIAL CONDIMENT. DIJON MUSTARD? I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THAT FANCY BURGER, MR. PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)
JON: YEAH, YOU ELITIST. YOU PROBABLY EAT THE BURGER WITH YOUR MOUTH, INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE A REAL AMERICAN AND HAVING A MAGNUM FIRE IT UP YOUR ASS, LIKE THEY SERVE 'EM AT ARBY'S! THAT'S HOW THEY SERVE THEM AT ARBY'S, THEY SHOOT THEM RIGHT UP YOUR ASS. MEAN WHILE, HERE'S HOW LUMPY FEELS ABOUT THE GUY WHO SITS IN A LITERAL GOLDEN THRONE AT THE TOP OF A GOLDEN TOWER WITH HIS NAME IN GOLD LETTERS AT THE TOP OF IT, EATING PIZZA WITH A KNIFE AND FORK. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT GUY?
I THOUGHT ONE OF THE MORE FASCINATING DESCRIPTIONS OF YOUR DAD CAME FROM YOU. YOU ONCE CALLED HIM ON MY SHOW A BLUE COLLAR BILLIONAIRE. (LAUGHTER)
JON: THAT'S NOT A THING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT? PLEASE -- IT IS TRUE. TRUMP SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY YOU'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND OWN A FLEET OF AIRPLANES WITH. LOOK, ALL THAT STUFF IS SUPERFICIAL. AND I'M SURE IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT ETHICS OR PRINCIPLES TO EMBRACE SOMEONE WHO EMBODIES EVERYTHING THEY SAID THEY HATED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S INSIDE. AND THAT'S WHERE LUMPY AND FRIENDS HAVE FOUND THE PRESIDENT LACKING.
WHO SITS IN THE PEWS OF JEREMIAH "GD AMERICA" AND "AMERICA'S CHICKENS HAVE COME HOME TO ROOST" AFTER 9/11? IS THAT A CHRISTIAN CHURCH TO YOU? HE SAYS HE'S A CHRISTIAN. I'M A CHRISTIAN. I WOULDN'T GO TO REVEREND WRIGHT'S CHURCH.
JON: BUT OBAMA WOULD. BECAUSE HE'S THE TYPE OF CHRISTIAN THAT'S, YOU KNOW, NOT CHRISTIAN. WELL, WHEN THE POPE SAID THAT TRUMP'S TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION WAS NOT CHRISTIAN, SURELY THAT GAVE LUMPY PAUSE.
WHO'S THE POPE TO SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A CHRISTIAN? HOW CAN A POPE OR ANYBODY DECIDE IF SOMEBODY'S A CHRISTIAN IN THEIR HEART?
JON: YEAH, WHO DIED AND MADE THAT GUY POPE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO ONE? OH, HE JUST RETIRED? I FEEL THAT. SO HERE'S WHERE WE ARE. EITHER LUMPY AND FRIENDS ARE LYING ABOUT BEING BOTHERED BY THIN-SKINNED, AUTHORITARIAN, LESS-THAN-CHRISTIAN READERS-OF-PROMPTER BEING PRESIDENT, OR YOU DON'T CARE, AS LONG AS IT'S THEIR THIN-SKINNED PROMPTER AUTHORITARIAN TYRANT NARCISSIST GIVING YOU YOUR COUNTRY BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS. YOU FEEL YOU'RE THIS COUNTRY'S RIGHTFUL OWNERS. ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT. THIS COUNTRY IS NOT YOURS. YOU DON'T OWN IT. IT NEVER WAS. THERE IS NO REAL AMERICA. YOU DON'T OWN IT. YOU DON'T OWN PATRIOTISM. YOU DON'T OWN CHRISTIANITY. YOU SURE AS HELL DON'T OWN RESPECT FOR THE BRAVERY AND SACRIFICE FOR MILITARY, POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TRUST ME. I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR WITH THEIR "BLUE LIVES MATTER" RHETORIC WHO EITHER REMAINED SILENT OR ACTIVELY FOUGHT AGAINST THE 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS BILL REAUTHORIZATION. SO I SEE YOU. AND I SEE YOUR BULL (BLEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE'RE LIVE. OH. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON: NEVER BEEN ON A TELEVISION SHOW WITH STAKES BEFORE. SO I SEE YOU. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THOSE REAL AMERICANS FIGHTING FOR THEIR PLACE AT THE TABLE? YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEN BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE -- WHAT'S REPRESENTATIVE STEVE KING'S WORD FOR IT? SUBGROUPS OF AMERICANS ARE BEING DIVISIVE. TAKE IT UP WITH THE FOUNDERS. "WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. RESPECT, LIN-MANUEL. THOSE FIGHTING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE IDEAL OF EQUALITY ARE NOT BEING DIVISIVE. THOSE FIGHTING TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE OUT ARE. SO, LUMPY, YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE EMBRACED DONALD TRUMP. CLEARLY, THE C NEXT TO YOUR NAME DOESN'T STAND FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVE, BUT CRAVENLY CONVENIENT C -- (AIR HORN BLOWING)

YES, I WROTE IT.
Stephen: WELL, MA'AM, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS TRULY THE BEST OF TIMES, IT IS THE WORST OF TIMES. I DID NOT PLAGIARIZE MY SPEECH LAST NIGHT. I WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING. I WOULD NOT, COULD NOT WITH A GOAT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I COULD NOT, WOULD NOT ON A BOAT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THAT IS BECAUSE I LEARNED HONESTY DURING MY HUMBLE UPBRINGING-- IN WEST PHILADELPHIA, I WAS BORN AND RAISED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU! ON THE PLAYGROUND IS WHERE I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS. SO TO THOSE WHO SAY I STOLE MY SPEECH, I SAY, GIVE ME A BREAK. GIVE ME A BREAK. BREAK ME OFF A PIECE OF THAT KIT KAT BAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE OUR LIVES, BUT THEY WILL NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE. YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT TO PARTY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE. HAKUNA MATATA. BA DA BA DA DA-- I'M LOVING IT.

Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO ME DRINKING ALREADY IN PROGRESS. AS YOU MAY KNOW, ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED CHARACTERS HERE ON THE "LATE SHOW" IS CAJUN POPE.
HOWDY! WE GONNA HAVE A CRAWFISH PIE AND THE I'M GONNA TAKE-A YOUR CONFESSEEON. THEN I WILL GIVE YOU ABSOLUSHEEON. CAJUN JESUS GON' GO AND RISE AGAIN FROM DAT DERE SWAMP, I GUARANTEE.
Stephen: THANK YOU, CAJUN POPE.
NICE TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN. I ENJOYED YOUR CONVENTION COVERAGE.
Stephen: HE'S A CROWD PLEASER. EVERYBODY LOVES HIM. BUT THIS WEEK WE HAD A VISIT FROM ANOTHER BELOVED "LATE SHOW" CHARACTER. JULIUS FLICKERMAN AT THE CONVENTION CENTER IN CLEVELAND. JULIUS WAS A FIXTURE OF OUR PRIMARY COVERAGE ALL YEAR. SO TONIGHT WE TAKE A FOND LOOK BACK AT THE SAVAGE BLOODSPORT THAT IS OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. IT'S LIKE THE HUNGER GAMES. NO, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT, IT'S... THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HA HA! WELCOME! HA HA HA! YES! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! YES! MMM! WELCOME TO THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES! CANDIDATES, ASSEMBLE! (LAUGHTER) AH, YES, YES, LOOK HERE, A FRESH CROP OF TRIBUTES FOR THE CAPITOL. MAY THE MARGIN OF ERROR FOREVER BE IN YOUR FAVOR! (LAUGHTER) WHO LOOKS EXPENDABLE THIS YEAR? HMM... YES, YES. HAVE THE LARGE ANGRY ONE FROM THE EAST FIGHT THE CURLY-HAIRED ONE FROM THE COAL DISTRICT. (LAUGHTER) DELICIOUS! TRIBUTES ASSEMBLE! OH... THERE THEY ARE. THERE THEY ARE, VYING TO BE CHAMPION OF CAPITAL CITY. OH, HOW THEIR RANKS ARE THINNING. THE FIELD IS GETTING ALMOST AS SMALL AS LGBT VOTERS FOR TED CRUZ! TRIBUTE ASSEMBLE! (LAUGHTER) OH, MY... OH, MY, THEY'RE DWINDLING. NOW THEY'RE JUST HILLARY CLINTON AND THE SEVEN DWARFS. AND BEN CARSON IS BOTH SLEEPY AND DOC. (LAUGHTER) OH, OH SO FEW REMAIN. THEY'RE LIKE THE BEATLES, BUT THERE ARE SIX OF THEM AND THERE ARE ALL RINGO. (LAUGHTER) CITIZENS, LAST WEEK THE GAMES LOST A BRAVE FIGHTER IN RICK PERRY. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HE'S GONE TO A BETTER PLACE, BUT I BELIEVE HE LIVES IN HOUSTON.
I'M WITHDRAWING FROM ANY CONSIDERATION OF BEING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S NOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
Stephen: YES, JIM WEBB IS WITHDRAWING FROM CONSIDERATION. I AM SURE THAT WILL COME AS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIS SUPPORTER. (LAUGHTER) SO SAD. SO SAD. YEAH... SO FAREWELL TRIBUTE, WEBB. I'D SAY WE HARDLY KNEW YE BUT HARDLY IS TOO GENEROUS A TERM SINCE YOU WERE POLLING IN OHIO AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AT ZERO PERCENT -- GOOSE EGG! JUST PROVING IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, IT WOULD STILL GET MORE VOTES THAN JIM WEBB.
WE HAVE TO STOP BEING THE SUPER PARTY. NO SECRET WE HAD A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO TARNISHED THE BRAND WITH OFFENSIVE AND BIZARRE COMMENTS. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT.
Stephen: APPARENTLY NOT BECAUSE OFFENSIVE AND BIZARRE ARE IN FIRST AND SECOND PLACE. YES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BRAVO! BRAVO! OH, YES! HA! BUT IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN ADVENTURE SO FAR FOR JINDAL. WHO CAN FORGET THE MAGIC MOMENT WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS CAMPAIGN FROM A VIDEO RECORDER FROM BEHIND A TREE LIMB. THIS IS AS CLOSE AS HE'LL EVER GET TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH! (LAUGHTER) I'M A SHARK, AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! ARGH! AHHH! (APPLAUSE) YEAH! HA HA! I'M A PIRATE, ARGH! WHEN THE VOTES WERE COUNTED IN IOWA, GILMORE WON 12. NOT 12%, NOT 12 DELEGATES, 12 PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, IF YOU LINED THOSE PEOPLE UP FROM END TO END, IT WOULD BE EASY BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 12 OF THEM. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) KEEP THIS IN MIND, HE ONLY GOT 12 VOTES! THAT IS LESS -- AND THIS IS TRUE, WE LOOKED IT UP -- THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN IOWA NAMED JIM GILMORE. BEFORE I CONTINUE, I WANT TO INTRODUCE MY NEW CO-HOST KALIGULA. HE'S LIKE MANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, WHEN HE FIRST APPEARS ON THE SCENE, HE SEEMS FIERCE, BUT THEN YOU SOON REALIZE, DEAD ON ARRIVAL! THE BLOOD LETTING BEGAN WITH NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND QUASI MOTEO'S HANDSOME GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. A BIRTHDAY PARTY WHO YOUR ARENTS MADE YO YOU ATTEND, MARCO RUBIO. RICRICK SANTORUM. WITHDRAWING FROM THE RACE AND AS A GOOD CATHOLIC WITHDRAWAL IS THE ONLY METHOD HE APPROVES OF. CHAMPAGNE IS GOING FLAT. WHERE IS MY VOICESLESS EUNUCH? THIS IS ANDRO, MY MAN BOY. MAYBE HAPPY NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) NO NEED TO THANK ME. BACK IN THE PIT, ANDRO! MMM, MMM. OH, YES. MMM. YES. THAT HAS ALL THE SPARKLE BEN CARSON LACKED.
I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THE HELP YOU GUYS HAVE GIVEN US. THERE IS KNOT MORGUE YOU COULD HAVE DONE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU COULD HAVE VOTED FOR HIM, BUT BESIDES THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU WILL NOTICE THE SLOGAN ON THE PODIUM YESTERDAY WAS STRONGER TOGETHER BECAUSE BERNIE REJECTED HILLARY'S ORIGINAL IDEA, IT'S ABOUT (BLEEP) TIME.

WHOO!
Stephen: LOVELY TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
PLEASURE.
Stephen: I WAS A BIG FAN. I WORKED ON COMEDY CENTRAL BACK IN THE DAY, IN THE '90s WHEN YOU GUYS WERE ON -- IT EXPLODED IN AMERICA. YOU HAVE BEEN A HUGE HIT IN ENGLAND. IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU, PATSY AND EDINA IN CHARACTER LAUNCHED THE LONDON PRIDE PARADE THIS YEAR.
WE DID.
Stephen: THERE YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE WITH A LOT OF YOUR FANS.
WE'RE THE SMALL ONES.
Stephen: ALSO DRESSED UP AS YOU.
I KNOW. THEY HAVE A FLOAT AND ALL THE DRAG QUEENS DRESSED UP AS PATSY AND EDINA. THEIR LEGS ARE UP HERE AND THEY HAVE FANTASTIC BODIES AND WE'RE THESE DUMPY LITTLE OLD WOMEN. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU CREATED THE SERIES IN '92, RIGHT?
YEAH, IT STARTED IN 1990 AND 1991.
Stephen: IT HAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY LONGEVITIES OF ANY.
WE DO A SEASON THEN HAVE A COUPLE OF YEARS OFF. I HAD CHILDREN.
Stephen: THAT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SPEEDING THE BEAST EVERY YEAR WITH A NEW SERIES AND YET PEOPLE ARE SO EAGER FOR THEM TO COME BACK.
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN IDEA FOR A SERIES. THEY EXIST NOW, SO THE SERIES REFERENCES WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. SOMETIMES YOU NEED A COUPLE OF YEARS FOR THE KARDASHIANS TO HAPPEN AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT WAS LIKE THIS RASH. WHO KNEW THAT WAS COMING? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: VERY COMPLIMENTARY DESCRIPTION. THE CHARACTERS DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS DO, THEY?
NO, THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICS. THEY'RE GENERALLY UNCULTURED. THEY'VE NEVER WATCHED THE NEWS. THEY WOULD NEVER BE UP IN TIME TO WATCH THE NEWS.
Stephen: DO YOU FOLLOW POLITICS?
NOW, IT'S LIKE THE BEST SOAP OPERA.
Stephen: NOT JUST HERE BUT OVER THERE.
WE'RE BEATING YOU IN POLITICS.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. WE DON'T OFTEN WIN, BUT WE'RE WINNING NOW. IT IS CRAZY OVER THERE.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE OR PATSY AND EDINA TALKING ABOUT HOW EDINA IS LOOKING AND SHE'S NOT THRILLED WITH HOW SHE'S AGING. ANYTHING ELSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW.
NO, JUST WATCH AND LOVE. I HAD THE SKIN CELLS OF A 2-YEAR-OLD CHILD INJECTED INTO MY FACE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
YOU NEED TO BE USING FETUS, BABY, SPRITZ OF AFTERBIRTH. KEEP UP, SWEETIE.
IF I CAN GET PAST THAT BIG MIRROR, I THINK I'M OFFICIALLY FATTER SIDEWAYS THAN FRONTWAYS.
YOU DON'T NEED THOSE. I AM YOUR MIRROR.
HOW DO I LOOK? FABULOUS! THANK YOU! WHOO -- NEED TO MOVE THAT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE HER SAYING IS THE CHARACTERS AGE IN REAL TIME AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE VAGUERIES OF AGING.
YES.
Stephen:   SIT EASIER FOR YOU TO DO THESE CHARACTERS THAN IN '92?
I WAS YOUNGER THAN EDINA AND NOW I THINK I'M OLDER.
Stephen: YOU LEFT HER? YES. SHE'S NOW IN HER '60s. I'M ACTUALLY IN MY LATE '50s. JOANNA IS 70 AND PATSY IS PROBABLY ABOUT 98. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: PATSY KIND OF LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST WIFE IVANA.
I THINK IVANA STOLE THAT LOOK. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY? ARE THERE JOKES YOU CAN DO AS EDINA THAT YOU CAN'T DO AS YOURSELF?
ALL OF THEM. WE USED TO DO MUCH RISKIER JOKES. I THINK PEOPLE ARE EASILY OFFENDED NOW MORE THAN THEY USED TO BE. I THINK IT'S WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EVERYTHING ELSE. WE USED TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT ALL PARTS OF SOCIETY AND EVERY RELIGION. PEOPLE NOW WOULD GO, OOH, ARE YOU SURE YOU COULD SAY THAT?
Stephen: I THINK THEY MEAN ONE RELIGION YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT TO NOW, RIGHT?
YES, SCIENTOLOGY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I HAD A GIG THIS YEAR IN HONG KONG, RIGHT, AND THEY FLEW ME BUSINESS CLASS. WHEN I WENT TO CHECK IN, THEY WERE OUT OF BUSINESS CLASS SO THEY UPGRADED ME TO FIRST CLASS. I SPENT 14 HOURS IN FIRST CLASS. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT LEVEL -- NOW, I HAD STEAK, LOBSTER, CHAMPAGNE. I UNDERSTAND WHY THE 1% WANTS TO HOLD ON TO THEIR MONEY. PEOPLE WERE LIKE, CORY, HOUSE OF CHINA? I WAS, LIKE, THE FLIGHT WAS AMAZING! NOW THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE, I COULD SEE MYSELF MAKING SOME (BLEEP) MOVES.
