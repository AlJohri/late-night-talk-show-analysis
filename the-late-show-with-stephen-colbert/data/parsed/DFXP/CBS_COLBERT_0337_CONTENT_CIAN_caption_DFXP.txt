JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE  TO GET SICK COMES A G.O.P. HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT WE ALL THOUGHT WAS BURIED! "NIGHT OF THE LIVING BILL"! SCREAM IN HORROR AS CONGRESS TRIES TO TAKE YOUR HEALTH CARE YET AGAIN!
THEY'RE COMING TO GET YOU, BARBARA.
"NIGHT OF THE LIVING BILL" STARRING BARACK OBAMA. PAUL RYAN. THE FREEDOM CAUCUS! AND AS THE BILL, THIS TRUCK! "NIGHT OF THE LIVING BILL"! COMING SOON TO A-- WAIT, NO, IT JUST GOT KILLED AGAIN.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JIM PARSONS. JEFF GARLIN. AND PAUL SCHEER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY!
Stephen: OH! WHAT'S UP? THANK YOU VERY MUCH! OH, WHAT A LOVELY AUDIENCE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO " THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL? AM I STILL THE HOST? I'M STILL THE HOST! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, FOLKS, IF YOU SAW MY MONOLOGUE MONDAY, YOU KNOW THAT I WAS A LITTLE UPSET WITH DONALD TRUMP FOR INSULTING A FRIEND OF MINE. SO AT THE END OF THAT MONOLOGUE I HAD A FEW CHOICE INSULTS FOR THE PRESIDENT IN RETURN. I DON'T REGRET THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I BELIEVE HE CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF. I HAVE JOKES. HE HAS THE LAUNCH CODES. SO IT'S A FAIR FIGHT. SO WHILE I WOULD DO IT AGAIN, I WOULD CHANGE A FEW WORDS THAT WERE CRUDER THAN THEY NEEDED TO BE. NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THE PHRASE, BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY, FOR THE RECORD, LIFE IS SHORT, AND ANYONE WHO EXPRESSES THEIR LOVE FOR ANOTHER PERSON IN THEIR OWN WAY IS, TO ME, AN AMERICAN HERO. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. I HOPE EVEN THE PRESIDENT AND I CAN AGREE ON THAT. NOTHING ELSE, BUT THAT. AND FOR ONCE, FOR ONCE, THE BIG STORY TODAY IS NOT DONALD TRUMP. IT'S WHY WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP: JAMES COMEY. THE FBI DIRECTOR SPENT THE WHOLE DAY TESTIFYING BEFORE THE SENATE. YOU GUYS REMEMBER JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION COMEY ANNOUNCED THE F.B.I. WAS RE-OPENING THE INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY'S EMAILS? HILLARY REMEMBERS, TOO. AND YESTERDAY, SHE PROVED IT.
I WAS ON THE WAY TO WINNING UNTIL THE COMBINATION OF JIM COMEY'S LETTER ON OCTOBER 28 AND RUSSIAN WIKILEAKS RAISED DOUBTS IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INCLINED TO VOTE FOR ME. YOU KNOW, IF THE ELECTION HAD BEEN ON OCTOBER 27, I'D BE YOUR PRESIDENT.
Stephen: YES, SHE'D BE OUR PRESIDENT. AND INSTEAD OF HALF THE COUNTRY DEPRESSED AND THE OTHER HALF GLOATING, WE'D HAVE HALF THE COUNTRY GLOATING AND THE OTHER HALF DEPRESSED. TOTALLY DIFFERENT. NOW, IN HIS TESTIMONY TODAY. HE WAS IN TESTIMONY ALL DAY. HE HAD THE EZ-PASS. COMEY EXPLAINED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPACT OF HIS ACTIONS.
I HAVE LIVED MY ENTIRE CAREER BY THE TRADITION IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT, YOU AVOID ANY ACTION IN THE RUN-UP TO AN ELECTION THAT MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT, WHETHER IT'S A DOG CATCHER ELECTION OR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: HE SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH DOG CATCHER. BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY DON'T GRAB PUSSIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CAT. CAT. CAT. ♪ COLD-BLOODED ♪
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU-- WHAT DO YOU? NOW, COMEY EXPLAINED HIS AGONIZING DECISION ON SECRETARY CLINTON'S EMAILS.
BUT I SAT THERE THAT MORNING, AND I COULD NOT SEE A DOOR LABELLED "NO ACTION HERE." I COULD SEE TWO DOORS, AND THEY WERE BOTH ACTIONS. ONE WAS LABELLED "SPEAK." THE OTHER WAS LABELLED "CONCEAL."
Stephen: WAIT, SO IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE RESTAURANTS THAT TRIES TO BE TOO CLEVER WITH THE BATHROOM SIGNS. "LET'S SEE, 'SPEAK' OR 'CONCEAL'... MEN SPEAK, BUT WOMEN DO ALSO. WOMEN WEAR CONCEALER, BUT MEN CONCEAL THEIR FEELINGS. OH, I GIVE UP. I'LL JUST PEE IN THE RAW BAR." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TO COMEY, TO COMEY, THERE WAS NO GOOD OPTION.
SO I STARED AT "SPEAK" AND "CONCEAL." SPEAK WOULD BE REALLY BAD. THERE'S AN ELECTION IN 11 DAYS. LORDY, THAT WOULD BE REALLY BAD. CONCEALING, IN MY VIEW, WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.
Stephen: LORDY! ( LAUGHTER ) LORDY, LORDY. SO HE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN "REALLY BAD" AND "CATASTROPHIC," THE SAME THINGS THE VOTERS HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! YAY! YAY! YAY! NO GOOD CHOICES! AND HE MADE THE DECISION TO REVEAL THE INVESTIGATION, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO INTERFERE IN THE PROCESS.
THIS WAS TERRIBLE. IT MAKES ME MILDLY NAUSEOUS TO THINK THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD IMPACT ON THE ELECTION.
Stephen: "MILDY NAUSEOUS" ( LAUGHTER ) MAYBE IT'S MORNING SICKNESS. AFTER ALL, YOU DID SCREW THE WHOLE COUNTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, REVEALING-- ( APPLAUSE ) TAKE YOUR FOLIC ACID. TAKE YOUR FOLIC ACID. NOW, REVEALING THE INVESTIGATION WAS A TOUGH CALL, BUT COMEY SAYS HE STANDS BY IT.
BUT, HONESTLY, IT WOULDN'T CHANGE THE DECISION. EVERYBODY WHO DISAGREES WITH ME HAS TO COME BACK TO OCTOBER 28 WITH ME.
Stephen: CAN I GO? CAN I GO! I JUST WANT-- I JUST WANT TO FEEL AGAIN! ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IN THE END, IN THE END, HE HAS NO REGRETS.
THE HONEST ANSWER IS NO. I HAVE ASKED MYSELF THAT A MILLION TIMES BECAUSE, LORDY, THIS HAS BEEN PAINFUL.
Stephen: YES, JAMES, IT HAS BEEN PAINFUL. BUT I GUESS THE LORDY WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. LORDY. NOW ANOTHER GUY-- I FEEL FOR HIM A LITTLE BIT. I FEEL FOR HIM A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: YEAR FEELING IT.
Stephen: ANOTHER GUY WHO'S TAKING QUESTIONS IN WASHINGTON TODAY WAS PRESS SECRETARY AND DAD BAICIAL HOLDING IT TOGETHER IN THE SIX FLAGS GIFT SHOP, SEAN SPIERS. STRANGELY, HE TOOK QUESTIONS TODAY. STRANGELY, YESTERDAY, HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. HE WATCHED MICK MULVANEY SPEAK ABOUT BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AND THEN JUST BOLTED.
SEAN!
SEAN!
SEAN!
COME ON, SEAN!
Stephen: SEAN, I KNOW IT'S CALLED A BRIEFING, BUT THAT WAS THE BRIEF-EST. YOU'VE GOT TO STAY. YOU'RE THE PRESS SECRETARY. AMERICA'S TUNING IN TO THE "SPICER POWER HOUR." YOU CAN'T PUT UP O.M.B. DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY. THAT GUY'S CLEARLY JUST AN OPENING ACT. IT SAYS RIGHT HERE ON YOUR TOUR POSTER. "SEAN SPICER, FEATURING THE MICK MULVANEY EXPERIENCE." YOU'RE THE HEADLINER. "ALL SEATS RESERVED." THE GUY CAN JUMP. THE GUY CAN JUMP. GOT LEGS. NOW THAT AUDIENCE THERE, THE PRESS, THEY WERE SCREAMING FOR AN ENCORE SO SPICER WOULD COME OUT AND PLAY THE HITS:  PLAY-- ( LAUGHTER ) PLAY "LARGEST INAUGURATION CROWD IN HISTORY!" WOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLAY "I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MISPRONOUNCE SOMETHING! WOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT PUTTING THAT BACK IN MY POCKET. THAT IS SUPER HOT RIGHT NOW. THERE YOU GO. BOOM! LET'S SEE, DONALD TRUMP-- THIS IS NEWS WITH HIM. DONALD TRUMP IS STILL TRYING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.
Audience: BOO! HE DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES. BUT, THEN AGAIN, THAT'S HOW HE GOT ELECTED. WE STILL DON'T KNOW, STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE IS TRYING TO RALLY THE TROOPS. TAKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AN HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR VOTED SADDEST EYES. HE PLEADED WITH HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS TO PASS THE BILL, SAYING, "NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO DO IT. NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT." YES, ACT NOW AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER, LIKE "WHAT DID WE JUST DO?" AND, "WHY THE HELL DID WE DO THAT?" THE CURRENT HANGUP IS THAT, UNDER THE NEW BILL, STATES COULD OPT OUT OF PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND A LOT OF MODERATE REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE THAT. BUT NORTH CAROLINA REPRESENTATIVE AND NORWEGIAN MAN PRETENDING HE UNDERSTANDS ENGLISH, ROBERT PITTENGER HAS A SOLUTION. PETTINGER EXPLAINS THAT IF YOU HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION THAT YOUR STATE WON'T COVER, "PEOPLE CAN GO TO THE STATE THEY WANT TO LIVE IN." "HEY, KIDS, DAD'S GOT PANCREATITIS. ROAD TRIP!" AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A REAL BOON FOR STATE TOURISM. LOOK FORWARD TO SIGNS LIKE: "VIRGINIA IS FOR LIVERS." "I HEART TRANSPLANT NEW YORK." AND "COME GET AN ALABAMPUTATION!" AND, OF COURSE, FLORIDA'S NEW SLOGAN, "WE HAVE PAINKILLERS. WAIT, ARE YOU A COP?" ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT INCLUDING PUPPIES! PUPPIES. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL SIT DOWN WITH JIM PARSONS. STICK AROUND! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE! HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND? CHEERS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, LORD. LORDY, LORDY. LORDY! LORDY, WHAT A CROWD! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.
FROM "THE BIG BANG THEORY," PLEASE WELCOME JIM PARSONS.
Stephen: WHEN YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST SHOW IN THE WORLD, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. EVERYBODY STANDS IN WHEN YOU COME ON.
SO YOU WEREN'T FIRED.
Stephen: NO, I WASN'T, I WASN'T. UNLESS YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T.
NO, ALTHOUGH WE BOTH WORK FOR THE SAME NETWORK, BUT NO ONE IS CALLING ME, EITHER.
Stephen: I HAD TO CUT MY PHONE CALLS AT THIS POINT.
DID YOU? ARE YOU FEELING HOMOPHOBIC?
Stephen: NO, ACTUALLY, I'M FEELING HOMOFEELIC.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY STRANGE TAG TO PUT ON THE WHOLE MONOLOGUE. YOU TAUGHT ME NEW TERMS. I MEAN, AS A GAY MAN, I DIDN'T KNOW CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU TAUGHT-- THAT'S-- IT WAS TITALATING. I WOULDN'T CALL IT HOMOPHOBIC.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME.
THAT'S JUST MY TAKE ON --
Stephen: "THE BIG BANG THEORY," 10 YEARS. 10 YEARS.
A DECADE.
Stephen: A DECADE. AS THE KIDS CALL IT. A DECADE.
HOW LONG-- HOW LONG DID YOU DO COMEDY CENTRAL?
Stephen: COMEDY CENTRAL 20 YEARS, BUT (BLEEP) 10 YEARS. WELL, I WORKED FOR--
YOU WERE WITH JON.
Stephen: "DAILY SHOW." BUT ALMOST 10 YEARS ON THE OLD GIG DOING THAT CHARACTER.
DID IT FLY BY FOR YOU?
Stephen: IT REALLY DID. UNLESS I LOOK AT PHOTOS ( LAUGHTER ).
I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT WITH A FRIEND TODAY. IT'S TRUE. YOU GET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SWEET, AND THEY MEAN IT. THEY GO, "YOU LOOK THE SAME AS YOU DID." I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, BUT IF IF YOU'RE ME AND YOU LIVE WITH THIS FACE IN THE MIRROR EVERY DAY, AND YOU SEE A SEASON ONE EPISODE, YOU'RE LIKE THERE ARE THINGS HAPPENING. OOIK LIKE, "WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FACE?" WHY DO WE HAVE TO DETERIORATE-- I LOVE GETTING OLD, BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO START FALLING APART? WHY IS THAT PART OF THE DEAL?
Stephen: I'M HOPING LIKE CRISPER AND STEM CELLS WILL TURN ME BACK INTO A TWEEN.
VERY GOOD POINT.
Stephen: BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE, LIKE, YOUNG AGAIN, WOULD YOU?
NO.
Stephen: IT'S TERRIBLE.
NO, THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT YOUTH THEY MISIN THAT WAY, EXCEPT FOR THE PHYSICAL BOUNCE-BACK. LIKE, YOU CAN'T-- NOT THAT YOU SHOULD-- YOU CAN'T DRINK LIKE YOU USED TO.
Stephen: OH, HELL NO.
NOTHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: I CAN'T GO OUT ON A SCHOOL NIGHT.
ME, EITHER!
Stephen: NO.
I'M IN BED BY 8:00 READING. THAT'S MY PLAN. I STICK TO IT THAT'S MY PLAN.
Stephen: YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO READ.
WELL.
GET A GOOD 10 PAGES IN AND THEN I GO BACK TO CANDY CRUSH TO NUMB MYSELF OUT AND THEN I ASLEEP.
Stephen: NOW, IN 10 YEARS YOU COULD GET A MASTERS AND DOCTORATE IN PHYSICS IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: HAVE YOU INCIDENTALLY LEARNED PHYSICS BY PLAYING SHELDON?
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER MET ME, NO! NO!
Stephen: I MET YOU ONCE. I MET YOU BACKSTAGE.
WE MET AT A PARTY. WE DISCUSSED THIS. IT WAS VERY UNMEMORABLE. YOU WERE VERY SOBER. YOU JUST DON'T REMEMBER. NO, I DON'T THINK I'VE LEARNED MUCH OF ANYTHING.
Stephen: NOT EVEN INCIDENTALLY?
I MEAN, NOTHING I CAN NAME OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, NO.
Stephen: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE IN ITS OWN RIGHT.
IS IT.
Stephen: THAT NOTHING STICKS TO YOU?
WELL, I THINK IT'S THE RESULT OF EXCELLENT WRITING. LIKE THE COMIC RHYTHMS AND THE BEATS AND THE WHATEVER. THAT'S SO PROMINENT, THAT ALL THAT (BLEEP) WITH SCIENCE JUST --
Stephen: WAS THAT YOUR WRITER CHARACTER.
THAT WAS MY WRITER CHARACTER.
Stephen: THE BEATS AND WHATEVER.
THAT WAS MY WRITER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT. I JUST THINK-- YOU HAVE TO MEMORIZE LIKE THAT AND THEN IT'S OVER. I DON'T KNOW. I SHIVER EVERY TIME THEY PUT A WHITEBOARD NEAR ME. YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE LAST PART OF THE EQUATION. I SAID, "THEN YOU MEAN A PLUS OR MINUS SIGN BECAUSE I CAN CANNOT GIVE YOU "A" OVER "B" OF AN "X." SHUT UP!
Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO BE OTHER THAN AN ACTOR? OBVIOUSLY NOT A PHYSICIST. WAS THERE ANYTHING ULTIMATED TO BE?
ACTUALLY, THE CLOSEST THAT WAS SCIENTIFIC-ISK, IATOID WITH BEING A METEOROLOGIST.
Stephen: THAT'S SCIENTIFIC.
YEAH, IT WAS. I DO THINK, THOUGH-- I WAS PARTLY FASCINATED BY WEATHER, BUT I WAS PARTLY-- I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO PERFORM. AND I THOUGHT WELL I COULD, YOU KNOW, I COULD SORT OF BE SORT OF IN SCIENCE AND THEN ACTUALLY BE ON TV, REALLY.
Stephen: WELL, THE WEATHERMAN IS USUALLY THE FUNNY GUY IN THE LOCAL NEWS CREW.
THEY CERTAINLY TRY, YES.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. DID YOU HAVE A WEATHERMAN NAME, LIKE--
NO, BUT WHAT'S FUNNY IS-- AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS AT THE TIME-- I WAS YOUNG AT THE TIME. BUT THE MORE I GO ON. WHY DO THEY HAVE THOSE BORDERLINE PORN STAR NAMES.
Stephen: SMOKY WONDER.
YES, WE IN L.A., DALLAS RAINS.
Stephen: SURE.
JOHNNY MOUNTAIN. WHICH SOUNDS WEATHER-IFIC. BUT IT'S A MOUNTAIN. IT'S NOT REALLY WEATHER. IT'S NOT JOHNNY CLOUD OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: HE'S NOT A GEOLOGIST.
EXACTLY! SO, NO, I NEVER HAD ONE. JIMMY-- JIMMY-- UH... PELLET? NO. HAIL.
Stephen: HAIL PELLET, I LIKE.
HI, EVERYONE! SPRINKLES! THAT'S GOOD. SPRINKLES PARSONS. SEE, NO, NOW WE'RE INTO DRAG. IT'S GONE BEYOND PORN. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SPRINKLES?
SPRINKLES PARSONS.
Stephen: NOW, YOU'RE FROM HOUSTON, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.
I ( APPLAUSE ).
OH! REALLY! I MEAN, IT'S A BIG CITY.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN ACCENT LEFT.
WEEEL... WELL, TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE, THEY BEAT IT OUT OF YOU IN SCHOOL IF YOU'RE IN THE ACTING-TRAINING STUFF.
Stephen: I AM FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND MINE WAS SURGICALLY REMOVED. I HAD MINE REMOVED BY CESAREAN.
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO PRETTY. THAT CONE-SHAPED HEAD.
Stephen: I CAN STILL WEAR A BIKINI.
EXACTLY! YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY ACCENT. WHAT THE HELL WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?
Stephen: YOU'RE FROM HOUSTON.
WELL, I DO THINK THAT I-- IF-- IT DEPENDS WHO I'M TALKING TO, HOW MUCH ALCOHOL'S INVOLVED, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: SURE.
IT'S THE-- MY MOTHER-- MY FAMILY, THEY SPEAK-- THEY ALL HAVE TEXAS ACCENTS "Y'ALL." I STILL SAY Y'ALL." I NEVER LEFT AN AUDITION WITHOUT SAYING, "THANK YOU, Y'ALL. IT'S A REFLEX. THAT CORRECT, "Y'ALL."
Stephen: YEAH.
I GOT JOBS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I DON'T LIKE THAT "Y'ALL." WE'RE NOT CASTING HIM. YOU ALSO HAVE A NEW SIRIUS RADIO PROGRAM. IT'S CALLED JIM PARSONS IS TOO STUPID FOR POLITICS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU SEEM LIKE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON.
MY INTERNATIONAL INTENT WAS TO CALL IT, "JIM PARSONS IS TOO STUPID TO VOTE." AND HE WENT BACK AND FORTH. IT WAS KIND OF MY POINT, THERE'S ALWAYS AN ELECTION COMING UP, A MIDTERM OR WHATEVER. THE ONLY THING I REALLY CARED ABOUT WAS GETTING THE "STUPID" IN THERE. LOOK, IT WAS THIS-- I REALLY DO FEEL LIKE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH MORE TO KNOW ABOUT EVERY SINGLE ISSUE, OTHER THAN IRATE, PASSION, ANGER, SADNESS, GLEE. AND-- AND IN MANY WAYS-- ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. AND IN MANY WAYS, YOU KNOW, I AS SOMEBODY WHO HAVE FOUND MYSELF IN A LIBERAL CAMP A LOT OF THE TIME, VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS MOST OF THE TIME, I REALLY THINK THERE'S A WAY TO-- FOR ME TO HEAR ABOUT AN ISSUE AND ONE OF THESE DAYS I'M GOING TO HEAR ABOUT ONE AND GO, "IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIDE IT'S ON, AND I JUST HEAR IT, I'M GOING TO GO, "I JUST FOUND OUT I HAVE A CONSERVATIVE POINT OF VIEW." I GREW UP IN TEXAS. I'M A TRADITIONAL KIND OF PERSON. I-- I-- WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M KIND OF CUTTING MY TIME HERE. I WATCH "MORNING JOE" I LISTEN TO LAURA INGGRAM. I'LL LISTEN TO-- WE HAVE A CONSENSUSSATIVE STATION ON OUR RADIO IN L.A. AND I REALLY-- I'M JUST TRYING TO LET-- THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE, DOESN'T TTO LET ALL THAT IN.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T AT ALL.
OKAY. I WANT TO HEAR THE REASON BEHIND EVERYTHING ELSE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S ADMIRABLE. THAT'S ADMIRABLE.
IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY-MAKING, BUT I'M GLAD IT'S ADMIRABLE.
Stephen: REAL QUICK, WE HAVE TO GO. THAT'S OTIS. YOUR PUPPY.
OTIS IS 13.
Stephen: OH!
HE'S MISSING HIS BOTTOM TEETH SO YOU GET TONGUE INSTEAD! IT'S SO GREAT, ALWAYS TONGUE.
Stephen: ARE YOU-- DO YOU LOVE PUPPIES?
OH, BEYOND.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE REASON I ASK YOU IS THAT WE HAVE GOT SOME FANTASTIC PUPPIES HERE IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT. AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME TELL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE ABOUT THE PUPPIES WE HAVE TONIGHT.
NOTHING WOULD THRILL ME MORE.
Stephen: IF YOU COULD STICK AROUND.
I'M BACK.
Stephen: WE'LL BE BACK WITH JIM PARSONS AND SOME PUPPIES. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"." LONGTIME VIEWERS OF THIS PROGRAM KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME WE DO A SEGMENT ON THE SHOW WHERE WE TELL LIES ABOUT LITTLE PUPPIES TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ADOPT THEM. TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN THEY ORDINARILY ARE. SO IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER EDITION OF "RESCUE DOG RESCUE"! WELCOME TO "RESCUE DOG RESCUE!" A REMINDER:  ALL THE PUPPIES WE HAVE HERE TONIGHT ARE ACTUAL ADOPTABLE DOGS FROM NORTH SHORE ANIMAL LEAGUE AMERICA. JIM, ARE YOU READY TO LIE ABOUT SOME PUPPIES TO FIND THEM GOOD HOMES?
NO, I AM NOT! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OH, I GET IT. YOU'RE ALREADY LYING. IS THAT IT?
YES! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE A VERY SMART MAN.
Stephen: THANK YOU? LET'S BEGIN. THIS LITTLE GUY RIGHT HERE. THIS IS MAX. MAX HAD THE IDEA FOR UBER WAY BEFORE ANYONE ELSE, BUT HE COULDN'T GET THE LIQUID CAPITAL TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. HE DOESN'T THINK TRAVIS KALANICK STOLE THE IDEA, THOUGH, BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THAT PARALLEL THINKING IS A REAL PHENOMENON. EVEN STILL, HE'S ASSEMBLING A TEAM OF VICIOUS LAWYERS.
THERE YOU GO! PENNY THIS IS PENNY. PENNY, LOOK AT THE CAMERA. PENNY IS A DACHSHUND MIN PIN, AND ALSO A FASHIONISTA. AND, SURPRISINGLY, SHE SWEARS THAT CARGO PANTS ARE COMING BACK. MAYBE NOT TODAY, MAYBE NOT TOMORROW, BUT THEY ARE COMING BACK. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS LITTLE FELLA IS LEO. NOT ONLY IS LEO ADORNABLE, BUT HE AND YOUR GRANDPA FOUGHT TOGETHER IN THE WAR. GEE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT HIS SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUME HE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT HIS SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUMES. ESWHATEVER HAPPENED OVER THERE, TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU'RE READY, BUDDY.
IF YOU'RE A STUDENT, THEN HE IS THE PERFECT PUPPY FOR

Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. MEET LOLA. LOLA IS A SHEPHERD MIX WHO IS GREAT WITH KIDS. BUT I'M GOING TO BE UPFRONT-- SHE'S ALSO A MOON LANDING DENIER. DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST HER. SHE CARRIES A GRUDGE OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO RUSSIAN ASTRONAUT DOG LAIKA. LOOK IT UP, BUT AFTER THE SHOW IS OVER. ( APPLAUSE )
HI, CODY. THANK YOU. MEET CODY. HI, CODY. THIS LITTLE FELLA IS THE STRONG, SILENT TYPE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF HIS FARTS. OH, MY!
Stephen: OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS JACK REACHER. ( LAUGHTER ) BEFORE YOU ASK, YES THOSE MOVIES WERE BASED ON HIM AND, YES, THEY WERE ENTIRELY ACCURATE. THE ONLY REASON THE STUDIOS WENT WITH TOM CRUISE WAS BECAUSE TEST AUDIENCES DIDN'T LIKE SEEING A DOG SHOOT HUMANS WITH A SNIPER RIFLE. HAVE A GOOD TIME THERE.
THIS IS TUCKER. HE IS A TERRIER MIX. DUE TO A CLERICAL ERROR, HE OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THE ENTIRE BEATLES CATALOG. SO EVERY TIME YOU HEAR "HERE COMES THE SUN" IN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMMERCIAL, TUCKER MAKES MAJOR BANK.
Stephen: THIS LITTLE GUY-- AND I DO MEAN LITTLE-- THIS LITTLE GUY IS RUSTY. BORN INTO THE GAMBINO CRIME FAMILY, RUSTY DID THE RIGHT THING AND TURNED STATE'S EVIDENCE AGAINST HIS OWN RELATIVES. NOW HE'S LOOKING FOR A HOME AS PART OF WITNESS RELOCATION. WHAT'S THAT? I SAID TOO MUCH? OH, COME ON. THEY WON'T FIND YOU HERE. 7 WE'LL BLUR YOUR FACE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU!
Stephen: OH, MY GOSH.
THANK YOU! ED SULLIVAN THEATER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHAT IS HAPPENING? ARE YOU A PAPARAZZO?
NO, HERE'S WHAT IT IS. FIRST OFF, THIS IS NOT MY CAMERA. ANDREW, YOUR EDSOR, WAS NICE ENOUGH TO LEND ME THE CAMERA.
Stephen: THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE LIKA CAMERA.
AND MINE WAS STOLEN AT THE PREMIERE OF THE MOVIE "HANDSOME" IN L.A. HUNDREDS OF PICTURES AND AN S.D. CARD, STOLEN. I WAS SO DEPRESSED. DURING MY PREINTERVIEW SOMEONE TOLD ME THEY WOULD LEND-- WHEN I USED TO GO ON STEWART'S SHOW AND STUFF, I HAVE PICTURES OF EVERY TALK SHOW HOST FROM THIS POSITION, WHICH NOBODY ELSE HAS. I ALSO WANT TO GET A SHOT OF YOU BEFORE YOU GET FIRED.
Stephen: OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THAT?
I DO. IT'S ALL MANUAL. I KNOW HOW TO USE IT, YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU LYING?
NO!
Stephen: YOU'RE GOOD.
I ACTUALLY HAVE LEARNED IT, LEARNED HOW TO DO IT.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
IT'S PRETTY GREAT. SO IF ANYONE IS WATCHING AND YOU HAVE MY CAMERA, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'LL GET IT TO ME, BUT TRY.
Stephen: WE KNOW EACH OTHER BACK FROM THE OLD SECOND CITY DAYS.
WE MOST CERTAINLY DO.
Stephen: WE WERE THE BACKBONE OF THAT ORGANIZATION.
WE WORKED IN THE BOX OFFICE.
Stephen: WE WORKED IN THE BOX OFFICE. WE SOLD THE TICKETS.
WE WORKED IN THE BOX OFFICE!
Stephen: WE ANSWERED THE PHONES.
I TOLD PEOPLE THAT AND THEY SAID NO.
Stephen: I THINK I REPLACED YOU WHEN YOU WENT ON TO BETTER THINGS. I HEARD STORIES ABOUT YOU.
THERE ARE ALWAYS STORIES ABOUT ME.
Stephen:  THE STORY ABOUT YOU IS WE HAD PHONES WITH ALL THESE LIGHTS-- SECOND CITY SOLD OUT EVERY NIGHT OF THE YEAR. THAT'S THE SECRET OF THAT PLACE JOIRK LIKE THREE MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME.
Stephen: 12 CALLS WAITING IN THE CUE WITH ALL THE LIGHTS AND YOU WOULD PICK UP THE PHONE AND HIT THE "GONE" BUTTONS AND SAY, "LOOK, THE LIGHTSES DISAPPEARED." PING, PING, PING! LOOK, THEY'RE ALL BACK AGAIN. UPPER THE WORST.
YOU KNOW WHAT I USED TO DO? IF SOMEONE WAS MEAN TO ME, I'D TELL THEM THEY WERE SITTING IN THE PUPPET SECTION, AND KEEP LOOKING UP BECAUSE MARIONETTE PUPPETS WOULD DROP DURING THE SHOW. AND I PUT P.S., FOR "PUPPET SECTION."
Stephen: ON THEIR TICKET?
NO IN THE BOOK. REMEMBER THE LIST THEY, USED TO DO IT BY THE LIST BACK THEN. AND PUT LIKE, YOU KNOW ""G" T." WAS THE GOOD SEATS. AND P.S. WAS PUPPET SECTION. I KNEW AHEAD OF TIME WHICH IT WAS. AND I'D SHOW UP AND I'D STAND AT THE SIDE AND JUST WATCH THEM DO THIS DURING THE SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT MADE ME SO HAPPY. ( LAUGHTER ) BE JERKY TO PEOPLE. YOU'LL PAY.
Stephen: YOU-- YOU DID-- LIKE, DID YOU IMPROV, LIKE SCENIC IMPROV AND STAND-UP. WAS THERE ONE YOU LIKED? I NEVER DID STAND-UP. DO YOU LIKE ONE MORE THAN THE OTHER?
I LOVED DOING IMPROV ON "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM." BUT I ALSO, MY STAND-UP-- ( APPLAUSE ) YES! THAT'S RIGHT! ( APPLAUSE ) OH, YES!
Stephen: YES. DRAG IT OUT OF THEM.
DRAG IT OUT OF THEM.
Stephen: DRAG IT OUT OF THEM LIKE AN OLD TOOTH.
WE'LL BE BACK IN THE FALL.
Stephen: I KNOW, FIVE YEARS AWAY.
AND YOU WERE ON "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM." YOU WERE GREAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
PUTTING THE CURSE ON LARRY. THAT WAS AWESOME.
Stephen: IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.
BUT I LOVE DOING STAND-UP MORE THAN ANYTHING, AND MY STUP IS COMPLETELY IMPROVISED. I JUST GO UP AND START TALKING AND I'M ALL GOOD. I AM! IT WORKS!
Stephen: I BELIEVE YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALL GOOD.
BY THE WAY, I ALWAYS LOVED IMPROVISING WITH YOU, WHEN I WOULD COME OUT TO NORTHWEST AND WE'D HANG OUT TOGETHER.
Stephen: SURE, SURE, SURE.
AMY SEDARIS AND PAUL DO NELO. THOSE WERE SOME OF THE GREATEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.
Stephen: YOU HAD A TENDENCY TO WALK OUT ON STAGE AND PUT A STICK OF DYNAMITE AND BLOW IT UP.
NO.
Stephen: THE AUDIENCE LOVED YOU AND WE WOULD BE WORKING ON A SCENE, AND YOU'D COME OUT, "WOULD YOU LIKE TO STROKE MY BEARD, ADMIRAL PUDI PANTS?" AND IT WOULD GET A HUGE RESPONSE. SCENE OVER! OVER!
HOLD ON!
Stephen: HOLD ON.
I WAS NOT ADMIRAL OR DR. PUDI PANTS. NO, I SAID PUDDING A LOT. I SAID A LOT OF NONSEQUITURS. I CALLED YOU GRANDMA IN SCENES WHERE YOU WEREN'T MY GRANDMA.
Stephen: I WAS AN ASTRONAUT ON THE MOON.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. OKAY, WHATEVER.
Stephen: I LOVE YOU, JEFF. IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LOVE YOU.
BY THE WAY, I NEVER GOT A BAD FEELING FROM YOU FROM IT. SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE, I GOT SOME BAD FEELINGS. YOU, DELIGHTFUL.
Stephen: WE USED TO KISS EACH OTHER ON THE SHOULDER. "HELLO," LIKE THAT. AND KISS ON THE SCHEDULE.
THE SHOULDER CIZ, YES.
Stephen: I THINK IT STARTED BECAUSE YOU WERE SO SUCH TALLER WITH ME.
DAVID PASQEZSERKS.
Stephen: GREATEST IMPROVISER.
HE WAS ALSO ON "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM." I GOT EVERYONE ON "CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM."
Stephen: THANK YOU, I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME.
YOU WERE THE BEST.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE CALLED "HANDSOME." YOU WROTE IT. DID YOU DIRECT IT?
I DIRECTED IT. IT'S THE FIRST NETFLIX MYSTERY MOVIE. I PLAY GENE HANSON, A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. THE OPENING SCENE, WE FIND OUT STEPHEN WEBBER IS THE MURDERER. SO I'M NOT RUINING THE MOVIE. THE OPENING SCENE HE GETS OUT OF THE POOL, LOOKS DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA AND SAYS,"HI, I'M STEPHEN WEBBER, AND I PLAY THE MURDERER IN THIS 'HANDSOME' MYSTERY MOVIE." YOU.
Stephen:  KNOW FROM THE BEGINNING WHO THE KILLER IS--
IF YOU REMEMBER "COLOMBO" YOU WOULD SEE DICK VAN DYKE COMMIT THE MURDER --
Stephen: HE'S THE MAGICIAN WITH THE WOMAN IN THE BOX BUT HE ACTUALLY KILLS HER THIS TIME.
THIS ONE I DID DIFFERENTLY. BUT IT'S A MYSTERY MOVIE. IT'S FUN. I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE DIG YOUR SHOW, THEY'LL LIKE IT.
Stephen: NO DOUBT. EVERYONE WATCHING THIS SHOULD WATCH YOUR MOVIE.
BY THE WAY --
Stephen: THEY'RE SIMILARLY.
NO, BUT IT'S A SIMILAR SENSIBLE.
Stephen: BY THE WAY, "I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, AND I'M THE MURDERER."
BY THE WAY, DON'T THINK I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT. DON'T THINK THAT YOU WON'T GET A CALL.

IT'S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE. IT'S LIKE WORKING FOR A COMEDY AARON SORKIN, IN THAT EVERYTHING IS SO TIGHTLY SCRIPT AND THE WORDS SO BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND THE INSULTS ARE SO HARSH. I LOVE IT.
Stephen: YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES NOW.
YES.
Stephen: WITH YOUR WIFE, JUNE DIANNE RAYFIELD. I GOT THE LAST NAME RIGHT, RAYFIELD? SHE WAS ALSO IN THIS SEASON ON "VEEP."
SHE PLAYED THE PAINTER.
Stephen: WORK TOGETHER AND SHARE A CAB. YOU HAVE TWO YOUNG SONS. AT HOME IS IT COMEDY OR JUST POOP AND "SESAME STREET." WE ARE THE MOST COMPETITIVE TO MAKE THESE KIDS LAUGH. I AM DOING A FULL-ON CARROT TOP SHOW. I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO DO THAT.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE WE TALKING?
THREE YEARS OLD AND NINE MONTHS.
Stephen: THAT'S A TOUGH AUDIENCE. NINE MONTHS IS A TOUGH AUDIENCE. THEY DON'T HAVE OBJECT PERMANENCE.
EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER ) I WOULD SAY THE MOST DEPRESSING MOMENT, THOUGH, I CAME HOME ONE NIGHT AND I CAUGHT MY WIFE STEALING ONE OF MY BITS, LIKE, ONE OF MY CLASSIC BITS, WHICH IS THE RUBBER DUCKY WHO FARTS. AND IT WORKS GREAT. THE THREE-YEAR-OLD LOVES IT. AND I CAUGHT HER DOING "THE RUBBER DUCKY OF FARTS." AND SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS CAUGHT CHEATING. AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU STOLE A BIT? HOW COULD YOU STEAL A BIT?" IT PIT A RIFT IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
Stephen: HOW DOES THE NINE-MONTH-OLD RESPOND TO THE RUBBER DUCK FART THING?
HE'S NOT THERE YET. IT'S A LITTLE ABOVE HIM. HE'S STILL IN THE REGULAR FART, NO RUBBER DUCK IS NEED GLD THAT'S TOUGH. YOU HAVE A PODCAST CALLED, "HOW DID THIS GET MAID MEAD?" WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MAKING? TWO PEOPLE HAVE HEARD IT. THAT'S TWO, TWO MORE THAN MY PODCAST.
AND THEY'RE THE BEST LISTENERS WE HAVE, TWO TWO, THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT THAT IS BEING MAD?
A MOVIE PODCAST, A BAD MOVIE PODCAST, WHERE WE TALK ABOUT BAD MOVIES THAT ARE SO BAD TATHEY'RE GOOD.
Stephen: WITH PEOPLE WHO MADE THEM?
NO. JUST WITH US. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE, LIKE, AT A DINER AFTER YOU'VE SEEN A BAD MOVIE LIKE, "YOU CAN BELIEVE THEY DID THAT? WHY WOULD THAT CHARACTER GO OVER THERE?"
Stephen: I HESITATE TO ASK, I HESITATE TO ASK--
I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT COME UP.
Stephen: BUT HAVE YOU-- I HAVEN'T BEEN IN MANY MOVIES. YOU HAVE EVER DONE ONE OF THE MOVIES THAT I HAVE BEEN IN? WE-- WE MIGHT HAVE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MOVIE "LOVE GURU." ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH, I WILL SAY, YOU ARE FANTASTIC IN.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
ONE OF THE SHINING MOMENTS OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE. YOU AND JIM GAFFIGAN, THE DYNAMIC DUO. AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. NO, WE DID TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT "LOVE GURU."
Stephen: I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW IT GOT MADE, BUT I CAN TELL YOU HOW I GOT IN IT.
HOW DID YOU GET IN IT.
Stephen: THE WRITERS' STRIKE WAS ON. AND THEY SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO BE IN THIS MOVIE?" AND I SAID, "I ACTUALLY HAVE FREE TIME." AND THEY SAID, "THERE'S NO SCRIPT. THE WRITERS' STRIKE IS ON AND WE CAN'T WRITE ANYTHING FOR THE NEW SCENE." AND GAFFIGAN AND I IMPROVISED.
YOU TWO ARE HILARIOUS IN THAT MOVIE. I'M NOT MAKING FUN OF ANYONE WHO IS IN A BAD MOVIE. I HAVE BEEN D.N.A.Y PLENTY OF BAD MOVIES, UNABARBEDLY SO. I WAS IN A MOVIE WITH EDDIE MURPHY CALLED "MEET DAVE," WHERE EDDIE MURPHY PLAYED A SPACESHIP AND I WORKED IN HIS BUTT --
Stephen: YOU'RE THE LITTLE MAN--
IN HIS BUTT. AND I WAS LIEUTENANT BUTTOCKS. AND MY LINE WAS, "SIR, WE HAD A GAS LEAK. IT WAS SILENT, BUT NOT GOOD DEADLY." CLASSIC, CLASSIC LINE.
Stephen: YOUR THREE-YEAR-OLD-- YOUR THREE-YEAR-OLD WOULD LOVE THAT.
ZOOMING RIGHT TO HIM. SO I DO THE LINE AND I SEE THE DIRECTOR LIKE, "HUH?" AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN." AND HE WAS LIKE, "MORE MILITARY. "SIR, WE HAVE A GAS LEAK, SILENT, BUT NOT DEADLY." "QUICKER." "SIR, WE HAVE A GAS LEAK, SILENT BUT DEADLY." IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN WHEN THE DIRECTOR LEAVES THE SET. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND SOMEBODY CAME OVER TO ME AND WAS LIKE, "HEY, MAN, THIS IS THE HARDEST PART OF THE JOB BUT WE'RE LETTING YOU GO." I WAS LIKE, "FIRING ME!" AND HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, THE DIRECTOR SAW YOUR HEAD SHOT AND THOUGHT YOU WERE A FAT GUY." WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE AN INSULT AND A COMPLIMENT AT THE SAME TIME. I WAS LIKE, "OKAY." AND HE'S LIKE --
Stephen: FROM THE NECK UP, YOU REALLY SHOULD WORK OUT.
"YOU GOT ONE OF THEM FAT FACES, KID!" AND HE WAS LIKE, "BUT WE HAVE A NEW ROLE FOR YOU. GET READY FOR THIS. YOU'LL NOW BE LIEUTENANT KNEECAP." AND I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT." THEY WROTE THIS PART ON THE DAY, AND GUESS THE WHOLE PREMISE IS EDDIE MURPHY'S PLANET NEEDS SALT, AND I'M NOW ON THE SHIP LATER ON, AND THEY PUT A GIANT HOT DOG-- LIKE A GIANT-- LIKE THE HOT DOG WAS THIS BIG ON MY LAP. AS TALL AS ME. AND I ATTACK A BOOIPT OUT OF THE HOT DOG. AND I GO, "SURE BEATS PROTEIN SQUARES." IT WAS CUT FROM THE MOVIE.
Stephen: SO YOU DID NOT APPEAR.
DID NOT APPEAR. MY SHOULDER APPEARS.
Stephen: REALLY NICE.
LOOK, IT WASN'T FARKT EITHER. IT WAS A SKINNY SHOULDER.
Stephen: NOW IN "VEEP" YOU PLAY A PRODUCER FOR "CBS THIS MORNING."
YES.
Stephen: THE CBS MORNING NEWS SHOW. DID YOU DO A RIDE-ALONG WITH CHARLIE ROSE.
I WAS HIS PANTS WRANGLER FOR YEARS. I HELD HIS PANTS UP. TOW I KIND OF BASED THE PRODUCERS, KIND OF LIKE THE PRODUCERS YOU HAVE ON ANY LIVE SHOW.
Stephen: THOSE GUYS THERE.
RIGHT OVER HERE. NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON, THEY DON'T CARE. "LET'S KEEP IT MOVIE. SOMEONE GOT STABBED? GREAT. GREAT STABBING, CAN WE GET THEM AN AMBULANCE. AND THE NEXT GUEST IS BOBBY FLAY. GET BOBBY FLAY. WE'RE BACK!" THAT KIND OF ENERGY. NO MATTER WHAT WAS HAPPENING IT WAS ALWAYS IN MOTION. I FEEL LIKE PRODUCERS ARE ALSO IN MOTION. "WHAT'S GOING ON." TAPPING FIELD, LIKE A FOOTBALL COACH ON THE FIELD, ""GREAT JOB, CAMERAMAN, YOU GOT THAT? GREAT, GOOD." A LOT OF ENERGY AROUND. BECAUSE MY CHARACTER ON THE SHOW IS NOT ONLY THE FLOOR DIRECTOR, A SEGMENT PRODUCER, BUT ALSO RUNS THE SHOW. SO I REALLY HAVE A LOT OF WEIGHT THERE.
Stephen: YEAH. MY PRODUCER'S GOING, "OKAY, THAT'S GREAT. CAN WE GET HIM OFF. WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING. COMMERCIAL COMING UP." THANKS. SO NICE TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. "VEEP," "VEEP" AIRS SUNDAYS ON HBO. PAUL SCHEER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANKS, MAN.
TUNE IN TOMORROW, MY GUESTS WILL BE CHARLES BARKLEY, DEBRA WINGER, AND SARAH TOLLEMASHE. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
