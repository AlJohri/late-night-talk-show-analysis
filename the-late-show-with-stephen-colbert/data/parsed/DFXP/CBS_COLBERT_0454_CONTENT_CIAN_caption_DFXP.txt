YOUR LUCKY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE WILL ENJOY HEARTFELT MESSAGES LIKE, "YOU'VE GOT A GREAT FUTURE... AND AN EVEN BETTER BEHIND." "I'D BE LION IS I SAID I WASN'T PROUD OF YOU. I'VE BEEN BANNED FROM THE MAUL." "OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GET, TO GET AWAY FROM ME." "THE SKY'S YOUR LIMIT, AND 18 YEARS OLD IS MINE." "CON-GRAT-YOU'LLATIONS.

IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, A WHOLE LOT OF MORE. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES SAOIRSE RONAN VAN JONES AND MICHELLE WOLF FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU? HEY, WHAT'S UP? WELCOME, THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE HAVE A SEAT, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. WE ARE EXACTLY-- ONE WEEK-- ONE WEEK FROM THE POSSIBLE ELECTION OF ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE AND DEPRESSING SEQUEL TO "TOY STORY," ROY MOORE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) YOU DO NOT WANT HIM TO PLAY "WOODY."  (  LAUGHTER  ) HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED-- JUST A CHARACTER NAME-- HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY AT LEAST NINE WOMEN OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WHILE THEY WERE TEENAGERS, BUT THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING BY HIS MAN FOR A SIMPLE REASON.
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT IN ALABAMA, BELIEVE ME. WE WANT STRONG BORDERS. WE WANT STOPPING CRIME.
Stephen: "YES, WE WANT STOPPING CRIME.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE JUST NOT WANT STOPPING SEXUAL ASSAULT."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) MOORE-- THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THEY'RE ON YOUR SIDE, MR. PRESIDENT. THEY'RE ON YOUR SIDE! PLEASE COME ON THE SHOW. MOORE IS GRATEFUL FOR TRUMP'S SUPPORT, TWEETING, "I LOOK FORWARD TO FIGHTING ALONGSIDE THE PRESIDENT TO #MAGA!" OF COURSE, THAT'S THE SOUND TEENAGE GIRLS MAKE WHEN THEY SEE ROY MOORE AT THE MALL, "MAGAH!"  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, MOORE HAS REPEATEDLY DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS.
I DO NOT KNOW ANY OF THESE WOMEN, DID NOT DATE ANY OF THESE WOMEN, HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WITH ANYONE.
Stephen: "I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT A WOMAN LOOKS LIKE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) THEY'RE THE ONES WITH THE BUMPY PARTS, RIGHT, WITH THE NIBLETS ON THE FRONT? I HAVE NO IDEA HOW SEX WORKS. MY PARENTS FOUND ME UNDER A CABBAGE LEAF." SO, SEE--  ( CHEERS ) YEAH, YEAH. IT'S TIME TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION! SO, STRONG DENIAL RIGHT THERE. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MOORE, THERE'S PROOF THAT HE KNOWS SOME OF THEM. ONE WOMAN WAS SO FRUSTRATED WITH HIS REPEATED DENIALS THAT, YESTERDAY, SHE SHARED NEW EVIDENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH ROY MOORE WHEN SHE WAS 17-- OR AS ROY MOORE CALLED HER, "A MATURE HONEY."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THIS WOMAN FOUND A NOTE IN HER SCRAPBOOK SIGNED BY MOORE THAT SAYS, "HAPPY GRADUATION, DEBBIE. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS CARD MYSELF. I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE A SUCCESS IN ANYTHING YOU DO." "UNLESS THAT THING IS ACCUSING ME OF WRITING YOU THIS CARD." AND THIS WOMAN SAYS SHE KNOWS THAT MOORE WAS 34 AND SHE WAS 17 WHEN THEY DATED, BECAUSE SHE SAW PHOTOS OF HERSELF IN THE YEARBOOK AND THOUGHT "THAT'S THE AGE I WAS WHEN I DATED ROY MOORE, BECAUSE MY BRACES WERE OFF."  (  LAUGHTER  ) THAT'S RIGHT-- NO, THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT-- ROY MOORE WOULD NEVER DATE SOMEONE YOUNG ENOUGH TO WEAR BRACES. HE'S MORE OF A RETAINER MAN. "LEAVE THE HEADGEAR ON. LEAVE THE HEADGEAR ON." BUT THE CAMPAIGN IS MOVING FULL STEAM AHEAD, AND THIS MORNING, ROY MOORE SPOKESWOMAN, JANET PORTER, HAD AN INTERESTING DEFENSE OF THE CANDIDATE.
POPPY, WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE'S A GROUP OF NON-ACCUSERS THAT HAVE NOT ACCUSED THE JUDGE OF ANY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR ANYTHING ILLEGAL.
Stephen: YES, LET'S BE FAIR. LET'S BE FAIR. IT'S JUST NINE WOMEN. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAVEN'T ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?  (  LAUGHTER  ) I MEAN, EVERYBODY--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, COME ON. YES. YES! YES! EVERYONE-- REMEMBER, LET'S NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. EVERYONE WAS SO QUICK TO CALL JEFFREY DAHMER A SERIAL KILLER AND CANNIBAL, BUT WE FORGET ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE HE DIDN'T EAT. COME ON!  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND THE MADNESS, THE MADNESS OF DEFENDING HIM DOES NOT STOP THERE. LISTEN TO MOORE'S CHIEF STRATEGIST, DEAN YOUNG, EXPLAIN-- WITH A CAMERA ROLLING-- THAT EVEN IF MOORE DID EVERYTHING HE'S ACCUSED OF, IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
DEAN, ARE YOU OKAY WITH, IF HE DID THIS, THAT IT WAS OKAY FOR A MAN IN HIS 30s TO BE DATING TEENAGERS?
WHAT I'M OKAY WITH IS JUDGE MOORE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR, IF HE DID DATE A TEENAGER, HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. SO, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN ON A DATE AND DIDN'T ASK A GIRL HOW OLD SHE WAS ESPECIALLY AFTER I ASKED HER MAMA IF I COULD DATE THEM.
Stephen: I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AND THAT IS WHY OUR STATE MOTTO IS, "HEY, WE'RE NOT ALABAMA."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE'S LIMITS. WHAT DOES HE MEAN, ROY MOORE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN HE DATED TEENAGERS? HERE'S A HINT: IF YOU HAVE TO ASK HER MAMA IF SHE CAN COME OUT AND PLAY, SHE'S TOO YOUNG. BUT NOT EVERY REPUBLICAN IS THROWING THEIR SUPPORT BEHIND MOORE. G.O.P. SENATOR JEFF FLAKE JUST TWEETED OUT A PHOTO OF A CHECK FOR $100 TO ROY MOORE'S OPPONENT, DOUG JONES, WITH A MEMO LINE THAT READS, "COUNTRY OVER PARTY." WOW!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE STILL USES CHECKS  (  LAUGHTER  ) REMIND ME NOT TO GET BEHIND JEFF FLAKE AT THE GROCERY STORE. , OF COURSE, IT HASN'T BEEN ALL DEFENDING PEDOPHILES FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE'S ALSO BEEN ASSAULTING MOTHER NATURE. YESTERDAY, HE SIGNED AN ORDER SLASHING THE SIZE OF BEARS EARS AND GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE NATIONAL MONUMENTS. IT'S REASONABLE THAT HE DOESN'T CACE ABOUT THEM. THEY'RE JUST NATIONAL MONUMENTS. THEY'RE NOT CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS. YES, GIVE IT UP FOR THE CONFEDERACY. JUST TRICKED YOU INTO THAT. HERE'S TRUMP MAKING HIS BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.
I WILL SIGN TWO PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATIONS. THESE ACTIONS WILL MODIFY THE NATIONAL MONUMENTS DESIGNATIONS OF BOTH BEARS EARS AND GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE.
Stephen: SO HE'S OPENING MILLIONS OF ACRES OF PROTECTED LAND TO STRIP MINING. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, "ESCALANTE" IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S EVER SPOKEN SPANISH.  (  LAUGHTER  ) IF YOU DON'T COUNT "TACO BOWL." NOW THIS IS-- AND THIS IS TRUE. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE. TRUMP CUT THESE PARKS BY TWO MILLION ACRES, WHICH IS THE LARGEST ROLLBACK OF FEDERAL LAND PROTECTION IN THE NATION'S HISTORY-- OR IT WILL BE UNTIL HE TURNS THE GRAND CANYON INTO DON JR.'s BALL PIT.  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOW, THE DECISION-- YOU KNOW HE'S PEEING IN THERE. NOW, THE DECISION ISN'T POPULAR WITH EVERYONE. SEVERAL NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES ARE SUING, IN PART BECAUSE IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BEARS EARS ALONE HOLDS MORE THAN 100,000 NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. YOU KNOW, IF TRUMP GOES AHEAD WITH THIS PLAN, I'M WORRIED THAT NATIVE AMERICANS WILL STOP TRUSTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) AND THE OUTDOOR CLOTHING COMPANY, PATAGONIA, CHANGED THEIR HOME PAGE TO A BLACK SCREEN THAT JUST SAYS, "THE PRESIDENT STOLE YOUR LAND."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S STRONG. THAT'S BOLD.
Jon: THAT'S A STRONG MESSAGE.
Stephen: THAT'S BOLD. THAT PUTS IT OUT THERE. THAT IS THE MOST SHOCKING POLITICAL STATEMENT I'VE SEEN SINCE THE TRAVELOCITY GNOME DECLARED, "FIGHT THE POWER." HEY, OH, THE OLYMPICS ARE COMING UP. DID YOU KNOW THAT, THE 2018 OLYMPICS ARE COMING UP. I AM REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE I'M OFF FOR THOSE WEEKS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ON THIS NETWORK. BUT THERE'S BIG NEWS. REMEMBER BACK IN 2014 AT THE SOCHI GAMES, WHEN RUSSIA WAS CAUGHT UP IN A HUGE DOPING SCANDAL? IT'S ALL IN THAT DOCUMENTARY "ROCKY IV."  (  LAUGHTER  ) WELL, TODAY, THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED THE PUNISHMENT, AND BUCKLE YOUR BORSCHT, BECAUSE RUSSIA IS BANNED FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE 2018 WINTER OLYMPICS.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I-- I-- I AGREE. IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING. BUT THAT IS SHOCKING: RUSSIA WAS PUNISHED FOR INTERFERING WITH THE RESULTS OF SOMETHING? NOT ONLY IS RUSSIA BANNED, BUT THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE FORBIDDEN TO ATTEND, ITS FLAG WILL NOT BE DISPLAYED AT THE OPENING CEREMONY, AND ITS ANTHEM WILL NOT SOUND. ALSO, FOR THE DURATION OF THE GAMES, ANY RUSSIAN DRESSING SERVED IN OLYMPIC VILLAGE WILL BE REFERRED TO AS "CHEATER SAUCE."  (  LAUGHTER  ) I COULD GO FOR SOME. LIKE A HAMBURGER WITH SOME CHEATER SAUCE ON THAT. BUT THE I.O.C. WON'T BAR ALL RUSSIANS. ANY ATHLETES WHO CAN PROVE THEY NEVER DOPED WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE AS INDIVIDUALS WEARING A NEUTRAL UNIFORM, BUT THE OFFICIAL RECORD BOOKS WILL FOREVER SHOW THAT RUSSIA WON ZERO MEDALS. WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE OF THE NATIONLESS ATHLETES WINS GOLD? DO THEY JUST STAND ON THE PODIUM STARING AT NOTHING WHILE WE LISTEN TO TWO AND A HALF MINUTES OF WHATEVER'S ON THE RADIO  (  LAUGHTER  ) I HOPE SO. BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO SEE A SPEED SKATER TEAR UP TO "MY SHARONA."  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SAOIRSE RONAN IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, STUPID PAUL MANAFORT TRICKS. STICK AROUND.  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN RIGHT THERE. GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND! JON.
Jon: HEY! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Stephen: JON, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT?
Jon: WHAT'S THAT.
Stephen: I'VE GOT THIS BOOK RIGHT HERE. I'VE GOT "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS." AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT-- I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE, BECAUSE IT'S JUST COME OUT THAT "ESQUIRE" MAGAZINE IN THEIR LIST OF THE TOP BOOKS OF 2017 HAS DECLARED THAT "STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS" IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THIS YEAR!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. RIGHT THERE! BEST. BOOK!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOOM! I'VE GOT TO FAN MYSELF. OH, MY LORD.
Jon: OH, IN THE GLORY LAND.
Stephen: I HAVE TO FAN MYSELF BECAUSE I'M SO EXCITED BUT I CAN'T ACTUALLY COOL DOWN BECAUSE THE BOOK IS SO DAMN HOT RIGHT NOW. GO BY BUYTHIS FOR YOUR LOVED ONES. EVERYONE IS GOING TO WANT THIS-- HUSBANDS, WIVES, GRANDCHILDREN, GRANDPARENTS, COUSINS, PEOPLE YOU HAVE NEVER MET, PEOPLE ON THE STREET. BUY THEM. HAND THEM OUT LIKE GIDEON BIBLES. THIS IS CHRISTMAS, THIS IS HANUKKAH, THIS IS KWANZAA, THIS IS-- FOR NEXT YEAR' YEAR'S RAMAD THIS RIGHT NOW. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF 2017. IT'S NOT ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF 2018. SO IF YOU BUY IT NOW, YOU'RE COOL. IF YOU BUY IT NEXT YEAR THEY'LL BE LIKE, "WHY ARE YOU BUYING THAT 2017 THING?" ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE INVOLVED.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, INFORMATION, THE INVESTIGATION BY F.B.I. DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN CONDITIONS. THERE ARE STILL SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS: WHO WILL BE INDICTED NEXT? WHO'S SECRETLY COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION? HOW MANY WALNUTS IS MUELLER STORING IN HIS CHEEKS FOR WINTER?  (  LAUGHTER  ) WELL, THIS WEEK, THE MUELLER SQUAD DROPPED A COUPLE BOMBSHELLS ABOUT FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND MAN FLIRTING WITH HIS PHONE, PAUL MANAFORT. MANAFORT'S UNDER HOUSE ARREST RIGHT NOW, AFTER BEING INDICTED FOR "LYING ABOUT MILLIONS IN PAYMENTS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, DODGING U.S. TAXES, AND CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES." IT IS A DAMNING LIST OF SERIOUS CHARGES THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS "FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER."  (  LAUGHTER  ) WITH ALL OF THOSE CHARGES AGAINST HIM, MANAFORT REALLY NEEDS TO LAY LOW, ESPECIALLY SINCE HE IS UNDER SPECIFIC COURT ORDER TO "REFRAIN FROM MAKING STATEMENTS TO THE MEDIA OR IN PUBLIC SETTINGS." PAUL MANAFORT WANTS THE COURT TO RELAX THE CONDITIONS OF HIS HOUSE ARREST, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY FOR PAUL MANAFORT, PAUL MANAFORT IS AN IDIOT BECAUSE WE JUST LEARNED THAT "AS LATE AS LAST WEEK, PAUL MANAFORT AND A COLLEAGUE WERE GHOSTWRITING AN EDITORIAL ABOUT PAUL MANAFORT'S POLITICAL WORK IN UKRAINE." THE PLAN WAS FOR MR. MANAFORT AND HIS ASSOCIATE TO GHOSTWRITE THE OP-ED TO APPEAR UNDER SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME." SOMETHING TOTALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE CLIEK "PAULINE WOMAN-FORT." OF COURSE, OF COURSE, THE MAIN THING MANAFORT NEEDS TO DO IS DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM ANY CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIA. SO, NATURALLY, HIS COLLABORATOR WAS A LONGTIME RUSSIAN COLLEAGUE, WHO IS CURRENTLY BASED IN RUSSIA AND HAS TIES TO A RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) MANAFORT IS SO TIED TO RUSSIA, HE'S GOING TO GET BANNED FROM THE OLYMPICS.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ MA-MA-MY SHARONA ♪ THIS JUST MAKES ME WONDER IF THERE ARE OTHER ARTICLES MANAFORT COULD HAVE BEEN GHOSTWRITING. BECAUSE JUST TODAY-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS I TOOK A BUZZFEED QUIZ: "WHICH 'GAME OF THRONES' CHARACTER ARE YOU THAT THINKS PAUL MANAFORT IS INNOCENT?" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SAOIRSE RONAN, EVERYBODY!  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW MY FIRST GUEST FROM MOVIES LIKE "ATONEMENT" AND "BROOKLYN." SHE NOW STARS IN ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN "LADY BIRD."
DARLENE, CAN YOU EXCUSE US?
DARLENE, STAY.
WHY AREN'T YOU IN ALGEBRA TWO.
I SWITCHED SECTIONS.
WHY?
AREN'T JENNA AND KYLE ENOUGH?
I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE JEALOUS.
JENNA IS A MORON, YOU KNOW.
SHE'S NOT, SHE'S IN A.P.  CALCULUS.
HOW DO YOU ASSIGN THE ROLE BY THE WAY. YOU JUST NEVER SHOWED UP TO CLAIM IT.
WHAT ROLE?
THE TEMPEST.
THERE IS NO ROLE OF THE TEMPEST. IT'S A MADE-UP THING SO WE ALL CAN CAP PARTICIPATE.
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOU'RE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION, YOU CAN.
YEAH, WELL YOU KNOW YOUR MOM (BLEEP) ARE FAKE, TOTALLY FAKE.
SHE MADE ONE BAD DECISION AT 19.
TWO BAD DECISION! PLEASE WELCOME SAOIRSE RONAN. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
WE'RE BACK!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?
WE ARE. BY POPULAR DEMAND.
BY POPULAR DEMAND.
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR SAYING SUCH LOVELY THINGS ABOUT THE FILM.
Stephen: I ABSOLUTE-- THIS FILM WAS ABSOLUTELY-- WE HAD GRETA GERWIG ON, AND I TALKED TO HER ABOUT THIS, BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED BY THIS FILM. IT IS FUNNY. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. IT'S HEARTBREAKING. IT'S HOPEFUL. AND-- AND I THINK I COULD PROBABLY GIVE AWAY THE ENTIRE PLOT-- I'M NOT GOG-- BUT THE ENTIRE PLOT OF THE MOVIE AND IT WOULDN'T AFFECT PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IN SOME MOVIES YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE EXPLOSION OR THE BIG EVENT.
EXACTLY. IT'S NOT OVERLY DRAMATIC AT ALL.
Stephen: THE BIG EVENT OF THIS MOVIE IS EVERY MOMENT IN THE MOVIE. PEOPLE'S LIVES HONESTLY TOLD.
YEAH, I KEEP DESCRIBING IT AS SORT OF LIKE A PHOTO ALBUM, AND EVERY MOMENT THAT GRETA HAS CHOSEN TO, LIKE, SHOW AND SPEND TIME WITH IS SO CONSIDERED AND WELL THOUGHT OUT, AND SHE'S JUST-- SHE'S DONE SUCH A BRILLIANT JOB. LIKE, THAT'S HER FIRST FILM. IT'S HER FIRST FILM AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING TO BE A PART OF THE WHOLE --
Stephen: THAT ALMOST MAKES ME ANGRY THAT IT'S HER FIRST FILM.
I GLN IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. THE PACES SHE HAS. YOU WOULD THINK A FIRST-TIME DIRECTOR WOULD BE A LITTLE NERVOUS AND RUSH MOMENTS.
ALSO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND FOR FIRST-TIME DIRECTORS AS WELL, FOR SOME OF THEM, THEY'RE FINDING THEIR FEET AND FIGURING OUT WHAT KIND OF FILMMAKER THEY WANT TO BE. AND I THINK BECAUSE GRETA WAS INVOLVED IN "FRANCIS HAHN," AND THINGS LIKE, THAT SHE'S FOUND HER STYLE ALREADY EVEN BEFORE SHE TOOK TO DIRECTING AND STUFF.
Stephen: AND, ALSO, THIS IS IN SOME WAYS HER STORY.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, THIS IS--
IN ESSENCE.
Stephen: IN ESSENCE HER STORY. BUT NOT YOURS, OKAY. YOU'RE NOT FROM SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA.
I'M NOT. I'M ACTUALLY NOT. IF YOU THOUGHT I WAS, YOU WERE WRONG.  ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ACCENT.
NO.
Stephen: I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO GO INTO THE INTRICACIES OF YOUR ACCENT BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST TIME.
WE DID.
Stephen: BUT AN EXTRAORDINARYUE HAVE AN AMERICAN NEUTRAL ACCENT, PERFECTLY, EVEN WHEN YOU SING IN THIS MOVIE-- BECAUSE YOU DO, YOU ODD DIG IN THIS MOVIE AND THAT'S WHEN THE ACCENT CAN COME BACK. HOW DID YOU-- HOW DID YOU GET YOUR HOOK? ARE THERE AMERICAN PHRASES YOU WORKED ON THAT REALLY GET YOU TO IT?
THERE'S-- IT IS-- IT IS SORT OF A GENERIC AMERICAN ACCENT IN SOME WAYS, BUT, ACTUALLY, THE SACRAMENTO ACCENT, I NEVER REALIZED BEFORE-- AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU --
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN TO SACRAMENTO. I AM AWARE OF HOW BORING IT.
SACRAMENTO IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
Stephen: VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT TO DO.
BUT VERY PRETTY AND WE LIKE IT, AND GRETA LOVES IT, AND THAT'S THE MAIN THING. THERE ARE ACTUALLY CERTAIN SOUNDS SHE WOULD PICK UP ON, LIKE THE WAY I WOULD WITH AN IRISH ACCENT, AND SHE WOULD REALLY HONE IN ON THAT. HE WOULD BE LIKE, "NO, NO, YOU HAVE TO SAY IT LIKE THIS." AND IT BECAME QUITE SPECIFIC. I FIND WITH CAPITOL HILLIAN ACCENTS IN GENERAL BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE SUN AND SUPER LAID BACK, THEY DON'T-- MY ACCENT-- WE PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST TIME-- MY ACCENT IS SO SORT OF LIKE-- ERRR! AND IT'S OUT THERE AND VERY MELODIC AND SORT OF LIKE, "LIKE ME!" I FEEL LIKE WIT WITH THE CALIFOR S.
Stephen:  I NEVER HAD A GIRL COME UP AND SAY, "LIKE ME."
BUT THE IRISH ACCENT --
Stephen: THERE'S I BOUNCE TO IT.
AND I THINK WITH A CALIFORNIAN ACCENT IT'S MORE LAID BACK. I FOUNT THAT DIFFICULT.
Stephen: YOUR SCENES WITH LAURIE METCALF, THEY'RE ACTIVELY, AND IF SHE DOES NOT WIN BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, SHE IS NOT ONLY FANTASTIC BUT SUPPORTING THE EMOTIONAL PLAYING FIELD THAT YOU'RE ON.
YEAH.
Stephen: I MEAN TSTARTS OFF WITH THE TWO OF YOU-- LIKE, SLEEPING IN THE SAME BED.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND THEN IMMEDIATELY IN CONFLICT.
YEAH, AND IT'S WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT MOMENT TO MOMENT, EVERY-- EVERY PIECE IN THIS MOVIE AND EVERY SCENE OR EVERY SHOT THAT WE SEE OR EVERY INTERACTION, IT IS JUST LIKE INVITING US INTO THIS WORLD MORE AND MORE. SO, LIKE, ONE OF THE VERY FIRST SCENES BETWEEN LAURIE AND ME SELF WE'RE IN A CAR, AND WE'RE LISTENING TO "THE GRAPES OF WRATH" AND WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE END OF IT AND WE'RE CRYING AND THE NEXT MINUTE WE'RE ARGUING. AND IT'S --
Stephen: AND THE NEXT MINUTE YOU ARE THROWING YOURSELF OUT OF THE CAR WHILE IT'S MOVING.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: YES.
THEY DON'T GET IT YET BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD SEEN SCOOEP. YEAH, THERE ARE ALL THESE WONDERFUL INTRICACIES WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP.
Stephen:
Stephen: I'M NOT THE ONLY WHON LIKES IT. IF DETHRONED "TOY STORY 2" AS THE BEST MOVIE EVER ON ROTTEN TOMATOES. IT'S 100% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.
I DIDN'T KNOW WE BEAT "TOY STORY 2."
Stephen: THEY HAD IT COMING.
I FEEL A BIT GUILTY ABOUT IT.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT BACKSTAGE HOW "TOY STORY" HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME.
Stephen: YEAH, SURE.
SO HOPEFULLY "LADY BIRD" WILL AS WELL.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. I THINK IT WILL. BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT'S JUST ABOUT HOW PEOPLE RELATE TO EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
Stephen:  NOW, THAT COLLICISM IS A BIG PART OF THIS MOVIE DID WE TALK ABOUT IT THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE?
I DON'T THINK WE DID.
Stephen: WERE YOU RAISED CATHOLIC?
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC, YES. AND IT'S A MUCH MORE SORT OF CULTURAL THING IN IRELAND-- THERE ARE, OBVIOUSLY, VERY RELIGIOUS CATHOLICS AS WELL. I WENT TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND MADE CONFIRMATION AND FIRST COMMUNION --
Stephen: THIS MOVIE YOU ATE UNCONSERATED COMMUNION CRACKERS.
THERE IS NO WAY YOU WOULD GET AWAY WITH THAT IN IRELAND.
Stephen: IT'S BREAD.
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.
Stephen: IT'S DEFINITELY AGAINST THE RULES.
GOD WILL BE LOOKING DOWN ON YOU JUDGING YOU, STEPHEN --
Stephen: THAT ACCENT PUT A CHILL DOWN MY BACK JUST NOW. YOU'RE LIKE A CHARACTER IN A JAMES JOYCE NOVEL.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW THE TITLE-- I DON'T THINK I'M GIVING ANYTHING WAY HERE-- WHEN I SAY THE TITLE COMES FROM-- THE CHARACTER'S NAME IS CHRISTINE.
CHRISTINE, YEAH.
Stephen: BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE CALLED CHRISTINE. SHE WANTS TO BE CALLED LADY BIRD. SAOIRSE, IF YOU'RE NOT FROM IRELAND, IT'S A BIT OF A CONFUSING NAME.
IT IS, AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER GO BY ANOTHER NAME? DID YOU GIVE YOURSELF A NICKNAME AS WELL?
I NEVER GAVE ME SELF ANOTHER NAME. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER NOBODY WAS CALLED SAOIRSE, I HAD NEVER MET ANOTHER SAOIRSE, AND SO WHEN I WAS A KID, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE, YOU KNOW, TOO DIFFERENT. SO I THOUGHT, MAYBE I'LL ASK PEOPLE TO CALL ME SARAH OR HANNAH OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, NICE AND SIMPLE LIKE THAT. AND-- BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED. AND THEN LATER ON, I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO, I WAS IN AN AIRPORT, AND I WAS BEING PICKED UP BY SOMEONE, AND THEY HAVE YOUR, YOU KNOW, THE NAME ON THE BOARDS AND STUFF. AND I WAS SCANNING THROUGH, AND I WAS LIKE I CAN'T FIND MY NAME ANYWHERE. IT'S ALWAYS MISPELLED. THEY NEVER GET IT RIGHT. I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS MASSIVE TYPO. AND I LOOKED THROUGH, AND THEN I, LIKE, SCANNED AGAIN, AND I SAW A BOARD THAT JUST SAID, "SHELLY RONAN." AND I WAS LIKE THAT'S ME. SHELLY IT IS. MAYBE I SHOULD BE SHELLY, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK A MOVIE ABOUT A 17-YEAR-OLD, PINK-HAIRED GIRL IN A CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO IS RESONATING WITH SO MANY PEOPLE? WHY DO YOU THINK THAT-- I MEAN, I'M NOT A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL FROM A CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO.
OH,.
Stephen: SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS.  ( LAUGHTER ) WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS SO-- THIS MOVIE IS COMING OFF AS S SO... GRIPPING, EVEN THOUGH, AGAIN, NO QUALITY KILLS.
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE NOT THE THINGS THAT DEFINE HER IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN SORT OF CATEGORIZE ANY HUMAN. AND YOU'RE WATCHING THIS PERSON FIGURE THEMSELVES OUT, AND I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN THINK-- IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT A TEENAGED COMEDY. I DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY WANT TO CALL IT "COMING OF AGE." YOU'RE WATCHING A HUMAN BEING JUST, ALMOST, LIKE, TRY THESE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ON TO SEE WHICH ONE FITS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ALL DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO. AND IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE-- A VERY SORT OF, LIKE, LIFE-AFFIRMING EXPERIENCE TO, LIKE, KNOW THAT YOU CONNECT WITH JUST AS MUCH AS A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHOSE GONE TO, SAY-- OR A GUY WHO WENT TO N.Y.U. 10 YEARS AGO AND HE CAME FROM A SMALL TOWN, TOO. BECAUSE IT'S HUMAN, YOU KNOW. IT'S A GENDER LESSON AWAY. AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT THE FILM SO.
Stephen: SO DO I. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "LADY BIRD" IS IN THEATERS NOW. SHELLY RONAN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH VAN JONES.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR AND CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR WHO HAS A FEW OPINIONS ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. PLEASE WELCOME VAN JONES. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU-- NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YES.
Stephen: I INTERVIEWED YOU A LONG TIME AGO IN CHARACTER OVER AT "THE COLBERT REPORT." HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS THAT?
NINE AND A HALF YEARS AGO. MY FIRST NATIONAL TV SHOW WAS WITH YOU, NINE AND A HALF YEARS AGO.
Stephen: NO WAY. I'M HONORED. THAT WAS BEFORE BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT'S THAT GUY DOING THESE DAYS?
HE'S LAUGHING AT ALL OF US.
Stephen: HE'S ON DAVID GIVEN'S BOAT RIGHT NOW.
HE'S LIKE, "HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW? YOU WERE ALL COMPLAINING."
Stephen: YOU ARE A CONTRIBUTOR OVER AT CNN. HOW IS THE FAKE NEWS NETWORK DOING? HOW FAKE IS IT? DO YOU GUYS GET TOGETHER AND DECIDE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FAKE THE NEWS EVERY DAY.
FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF ALL, I WISH THIS NEWS WAS FAKE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP. YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS STUFF UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO I WISH IT WAS FAKE.
Stephen:
Stephen: ARE YOU GUYS-- CNN HAS DECIDED-- FOR PEOPLE OUT THERE, THERE'S A CHRISTMAS PARTY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE PRESS GETS INVITED. THERE'S A SERIES OF THEM, AND THE PRESS GETS INVITED TO ONE OF THE WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS PARTIES. AND CNN SAID, "NO, WE'RE NOT GOING THIS YEARMENT. IT'S A NICE PARTY. IT'S A NICE PARTY.
I THINK WE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT BACK OUT ALIVE. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, LIKE, THE RED WEDDING YOU KNOW "GAME OF THRONES."
Stephen: WHY IS ANY NEWS ORGANIZATION WILLING TO GO TO THAT PARTY IF THEY'VE BEEN CALLED FAKE, THEY'VE BEEN CALLED THE ENEMY OF AMERICA BY THE PRESIDENT. ANYBODY BUT FOX NEWS, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," AND THE "NEW YORK POST" SHOULDN'T GO.
I'M SURE THEY HAVE GOOD HORS D'OEUVRES BUT IF I WAS A REPORTER, I WOULDN'T EAT ANY OF THEM.
Stephen: ON A SLIGHTLY SERIOUS NOTE, WHY WOULD YOU GO TO A WHITE HOUSE-- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ACCESS. YOU WON'T GET NEWS THERE. YOU ARE JUST THERE TO GO, "ISN'T THIS FUN TO BE WITH A GUY WHO DISO DOES NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS."
THAT IS MY VIEW AND THAT IS WHY CNN IS NOT GOING. I THINK WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. HE HAS LIKE A PEANUT ALLERGY TO FACTS AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. LITERALLY, IF YOU JUST SAY THINGS THAT ARE TRUE, HE GETS MAD.
Stephen: CNN SHOULD HAVE A LABEL BEFORE EVERY SHOW, "PROCESSED IN A FACTORY THAT ALSO PROCESSES INFORMATION."  ( APPLAUSE ) JUST AS A WARNING. NOW, THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION-- THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS ESCALATING. IS IT POSSIBLE TO DOWNPLAY IT ANYMORE? IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY, "THIS ISN'T GOING TO GO ANYWHERE?"
LISTEN, I WILL TELL YOU THIS. YOU HAD FLYNN PLED GUILTY. I DID CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORK IN OAKLAND FOR A VERY LONG TIME. HERE'S HOW I WOULD SAY IT:  WHEN YOUR MAIN HOME BOY TURNS SNITCH, A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE ARE ABOUT TO GO TO JAIL. THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS. THAT'S JUST HOW THAT WORKS.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT JUST WISHFUL THINKING? YOU THINK THAT'S REASONABLE. WHAT ARE THE ODDS MAKERS, IF YOU'RE IN VEGAS AND LAYING ODDS ON SOMEBODY GOING TO THE GRAY BAR HOTEL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME ON THAT ONE?
ZERO, BECAUSE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ARE ABOUT TO GO TO JAIL.
Stephen: YOU WON'T GIVE ME ANY ODDS ON THAT. YOU'RE A FORMER OBAMA ADVISER. YOU'RE A LIBERAL VOICE. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HOW DID THE DEMS-- BECAUSE YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT. YOU BELIEVE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY-- HOW DID THE DEMOCRATICS SCREW IS UP SO BADLY THAT A GUY LIKE TRUMP WOULD WIN? HOW DID YOU PERSONALLY DO IT, VAN JONES? YOU'RE THE ONLY DEMOCRAT IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. HOW DID YOU DO IT-- NO, NO, NO, THEY'RE ALL INDEPENDENTS.
HELP ME! HELP ME!
Stephen: HOW DID YOU DO IT?
LOOK, I THINK-- I WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT WAS WARNING, BEG, PLEAD IEG GREW UP IN TENNESSEE. I KNEW HE HAD A REAL SHOT. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE DIDN'T FIGHT THAT HARD TO STOP TRUMP. I REMEMBER IN 2008, PEOPLE WORKED HARD. 2012, PEOPLE WORKED HARD. WE GOT IN THAT OBAMA BUBBLE BATH, MAN, AND IT JUST FELT SO GOOD, YOU KNOW. AND --
Stephen: I NEVER GOT INVITED TO THAT PARTY.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
IT WAS-- IT WAS AMAZING!
Stephen: I BET.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE STOOD UP AND WE'RE ALL WET AND WRINKLY AND NOT READY TO FIGHT. AND SO WHEN TRUMP CAME ON--  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: YOU CAN STOP RIGHT THERE. OKAY, SO, YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE. IT'S CALLED "BEYOND THE MESSY TRUTH." THE SUBTITLE IS HERE, "HOW WE CAME APART. HOW WE COME TOGETHER." THAT'S A GOOD MESSAGE BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DOES WORRY ME IS WHAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ALL THIS? YES, WE'RE AT THE LOWEST CONFIDENCE OF OUR GOVERNMENT OF ALL TIME AND MORE DIVIDE BETWEEN NOW AND ANY TIME SINCE THE CIVIL WAR AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION. HOW DO WE COME BACK TOGETHER, VAN JONES. IT'S A NOBLE GOAL AND, OBVIOUSLY, SACRIFICE WILL HAVE TO BE MADE ON BOTH SIDES. WHAT ARE THOSE?
A COUPLE OF THINGS. I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT ABOUT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ABANDON IMMIGRANTS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ATTACK MUSLIMS. THERE IS SOME STUFF WE HAVE TO FIGHT ABOUT AND THAT'S OKAY. IN A DEMOCRACY YOU DON'T HAVE TO. BEYOND THE BATTLEGROUND, THERE'S ACTUAL COMMON GROUND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ANYMORE. THIS ADDICTION CRISIS IS KILLING BLACK INFORMATION, WHITE INFORMATION, LATINOS. WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER ON THAT. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS BROKEN, I WORK WITH CUT50.ORG, TO FIX THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT'S COMMON GROUND. WHERE WE DISAGREE, WE SHOULD DISAGREE STRONGLY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DISRESPECT AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DISREGARD, AND WE DON'T HAVE TO HATE EACH OTHER JUST TO VOTE AGAINST EACH OTHER. THAT HAS TO STOP IN AMERICA. THAT HAS TO STOP.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD MESSAGE. THE MAN IS VAN JONES. THE BOOK IS "BEYOND THE MESSY TRUTH." IT'S AVAILABLE NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MICHELLE WOLF, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪  ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪  ( BAND PLAYING )   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  HEY, EVERYBODY!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A COMEDIAN WHO JUST HAD HER FIRST HBO STANDUP SPECIAL. PLEASE WELCOME MICHELLE WOLF!  ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HELLO.
HI! HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: WE MET BRIEFLY BACKSTAGE AT "NIGHT OF TOO MANY STARS."
TERRIFIED THAT NIGHT.
Stephen: WERE YOU? WHY, BECAUSE YOU WERE IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.
IT WAS LIVE.
Stephen: SURE.
AND EVERYONE I LOVE WAS BACKSTAGE.
Stephen: YES, I IT WAS AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE. MICHELLE WOLF WAS THERE.
SHE WAS TERRIBLE!
Stephen: NOW, YOU WORKED AT A COUPLE OF GREAT SHOWS. "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MYERS." NOW YOU'RE AT "THE DAILY SHOW WITH TREVOR NOAH." I HEAR VERY GOOD THINGS. YOU ALSO JUST RELEASED YOUR FIRST-- PLEASE SAY HI TO BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE, PLEASE.
I WILL.
Stephen: YOU JUST RELEASED-- I HAVE A BIG POSTER HERE-- YOUR FIRST HBO SPECIAL. 2-S CALLED "NIGHT OF TOO MANY STARS." YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS POSTER HERE?
WELL, I WANTED TO-- IT'S "NICE LADY" BECAUSE I'M NOT A NICE LADY. AND I WANTED TO LOOK LIKE I WAS, LIKE, BURNING IT ALL DOWN. AND THIS WAS THE CONCEPT THEY CAME UP WITH, WHICH I LOVED. BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M THROWING A LIGHTER. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK ISSUE WITH THAT. A LOT OF REAL NERDS ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER WERE LIKE, "UM, SO ARE YOU THROWING A SECOND LIGHTER?"  (  LAUGHTER  )
Stephen: OH, BECAUSE-- BECAUSE IF THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED, THEN YOU THREW THE LIGHTER TO SET OFF THE THING--
YES, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I SET THE EXPLOSION! I LIT A FUSE.
Stephen: OH, SO WHY ARE YOU THROWING AWAY YOUR LIGHTER?
IT'S EVIDENCE. I'M NOT A SMOKER, SO I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T NEED THIS."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "GET OUT OF HERE."
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT THIS OTHER CARD HERE WITH-- A TWEET YOU JUST SENT RECENTLY.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: AND I THINK IT'S GOT A STRONG MESSAGE.
YEAH, I THINK --
Stephen: IT'S A STRONG MESSAGE. IT'S ABOUT SORT OF-- THE RASH OF REVELATIONS OF SEXUAL IMPROPRIETY AND SEXUAL ABUSE. AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE, I THINK. WOULD YOU MIND SAY IT. IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT ON THE BACK HERE.
(  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT GO? DO YOU HAVE TO SAY "YOUR PENIS? OR JUST "PENIS" THREE TIMES. YOU SAY "YOUR PENIS" OR "PENIS."
WOULD SAY BEETLE JUICE. PENIS-- WAIT, WE'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO IT BEING THREE TIMES.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M INSULTED BY THE IMPLICATION.  (  LAUGHTER  ).
THERE'S A LOT OF MEN HERE.
Stephen: WHAT? OH, OKAY. WELL, WHAT IS YOUR-- LIKE, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE THESE REVELATIONS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT? WHICH, OBVIOUSLY, WOMEN KNOW AND TALK ABOUT AND MEN, TO I A CERTAIN DEGREE, WITH WILLFULLY IGNORANT.
THERE IS SO MUCH SEXUAL HARASSMENT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF CENTURYS.  (  LAUGHTER  ) JUST ALL THESE BRAND NEW ALLEGATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME. I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE BIBLE. THEY WERE LIKE, "AND ON THE THIRD DAY GOD WAS LIKE 'HEY, SUGAR (BLEEP)'." I JUST IMAGINE EVERY MORNING MEN, LIKE, SCROLL THROUGH THE NEWS ON THEIR PHONE AND THEY'RE LIKE, "AHHHH... I LIVE ANOTHER DAY!"
Stephen: IT'S LIKE CHECKING THE OBITS TO SEE IF YOU'RE DEAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, DO YOU HAVE-- DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE ON, LIKE, YOU KNOW, HOW TO PROPERLY APPROACH A WOMAN IN A WAY THAT IS NOT-- OBVIOUSLY NOT AT WORK. OBVIOUSLY NOT IN POWER DYNAMIC? I'M NOT REFERRING TO US, BUT AN UNEQUAL POWER DYNAMIC? WHAT DO YOU THINK A PROPER WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE?
IT'S SO-- THE THING THAT'S SO ANNOYING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS THAT IT'S SO EASY NOT TO SEXUALLY HARASS. LIKE, MEN, YOU'RE BEING DUMB. LIKE, WOMEN-- WE WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING YOU WANT. WE'RE SO EASY TO MANIPULATE. YOU'RE JUST TAKING THE SHORTCUT. YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE WORK. YOU KNOW. DON'T JUST PULL OUT YOUR PENIS. YOU KNOW, LIKE, PUT IN THE WORK. SAY SOMETHING LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?"  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE MASTURBATING IN FRONT OF US WITH OUR CONSENT. IT'S LIKE, "YEAH, SURE YOU CAN DO THAT. I FEEL SO SKINNY."  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) THEN WE'RE BOTH ORGASMING FOR DIFFERENT REASON S.
Stephen:  WHAT WE SHOULD NOT SAY TO A MAN SOTHER OH, MY GOD, HAS YOUR PENIS LOST WEIGHT." DO YOU THINK-- DO YOU THINK THAT THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS IMPROVING IN ANY WAY? DO YOU THINK-- LIKE, IN GENERAL OR RIGHT NOW IT'S IMPROVING IN ANY WAY?
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THEY'RE GET SOMETHING FEMALE SUPER HEROES. WE HAVE WONDER WOMAN.
Stephen: GREAT MOVIE.
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD ADMIT-- MAYBE WE'RE READY AS A SOCIETY TO ADMIT WONDER WOMAN IS A TERRIBLE SUPER HERO. NO, TAKE A WALK WITH ME. I-- SHE SUCKS. HER POWER IS THEULA SO OF TRUTH. THAT'S A REALLY BAD POWER. AND I'M ALSO-- I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S SEXIST. THE GUY THAT CREATED HER IS LIKE IF WOMEN COULD HAVE ANY POWER, ANY POWER AT ALL, THEY'D WANT THE TRUTH!  (  LAUGHTER  ).
Stephen: WE GET TO BE INVISIBLE AND FLY.
YEAH. IT'S LIKE, WE WANT THE TRUTH. WHICH IS CRAZY, BECAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT THE TRUTH. IF I COULD HAVE ANY POWER IT WOULD BE THE POWER TO MAKE A MAN HAVE MY BABY. "YOU HAVE MY BABY. YOU HAVE MY BABY. YOU HAVE MY BABY. YOU HAVE MY BABY." BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF LITTLE REDHEADS RUNNING AROUND HERE, AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. TRUTH-- TRUTH IS A BAD POWER. BECAUSE VILLAINS AREN'T BAD BECAUSE THEY LIE. VILLAINS TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. IT'S ONE OF THE TRADEMARKS OF A VILLAIN.
Stephen: RIGHT.
LIKE THE JOKER'S LIKE, "I PUT A BOMB IN GOTHAM. YOU HAVE 90 MINUTES." WONDER WOMAN SHOWS UP AND SHE'S LIKE, "I MEAN, HE WAS HONEST, SO... IT'S REALLY ALL YOU CAN ASK."
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: "MICHELLE WOLF: NICE LADY" IS AVAILABLE ON HBO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE ED HELMS, CHRISTOPHER JACKSON, AND MUSICAL GUEST BLEACHERS. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, MATTHEW BRODERICK, GINA RODRIGUEZ, AND CHRISTOPHER MELONI. GOOD NIGHT!
