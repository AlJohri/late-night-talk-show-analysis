Stephen: THIRD DEBATE TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT, JULIAN, TIME TO LEAK SOME WIKIS. WATCH OUT, HILLS. WAIT TILL THE WORLD SEES YOUR AMAZON PRIME ORDER HISTORY-- 12 6-PACKS OF FEBREEZE PLUGINS? WHAT SMELLS ARE YOU COVERING UP? AND WIKI-WICK. WHAT'S THIS? CANNOT CONNECT TO INTERNET. CHECK NETWORK... ALL RIGHT. ALL LOOKS GOOD. THAT ALL SEEMS IN ORDER. WHAT'S UP? I'LL JUST RE-ENTER MY USERNAME: PUTIN-PAL-16. AND PASSWORD: SEXY-GHOST-MAN. DAMN IT. WHAT'S WRONG?
SENOR ASSANGE, THE NATION OF ECUADOR DOES NOT SUPPORT YOU INTERVENING IN THE U.S. ELECTION. NO MORE INTERNET. ALSO, YOU CANNOT JUST LEAVE YOUR LAUNDRY ON THE FLOOR AND EXPECT THE AMBASSADOR IT TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOU. PICK UP THOSE SOCKS!
Stephen: NO INTERNET! FINE. GOOD THING I PRINTED OUT HILLARY'S E-MAILS. I'LL JUST SEND THEM VIA CARRIER PIGEON. ( LAUGHTER ) UPO FLY, WIKI-PIGEON, FLY!
IT'S THE "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WOMANS HUGH LAURIE, PAUL REISER. AND NATE SILVER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE THE EDSULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S BADGE A TROIS:  THE LATE SHOW'S LIVE DEBATE COVERAGE, THE FINAL DON-STALLMENT.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU!
Jon: HEY, YEAH! YEAH!
Stephen: COME ON! WHAT'S UP, CHRIS? WHAT'S GOING ON, PAUL? HEY, MARCUS! WHAT'S UP? LET'S KEEP IT LIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: OH, THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THAT'S NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"" BROADCASTING LIVE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. I'M TONIGHT'S MODERATOR, STEPHEN COLBERT. WE JUST WITNESSED THE THIRD AND FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BECAUSE TWO'S NOT QUITE ENOUGH, AND I THINK FOUR WOULD MAKE US GO CANNIBAL. NOW, LET'S SEE. LEADING UP TO THE DEBATE, TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THIS ELECTION IS RIGGED. AND I WHERE TO SAY THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE TONIGHT. LOOK WHAT IT SAID BEHIND HILLARY, RIGHT THERE! RIGGED! THAT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD. I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP. YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT UP. YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT UP.
Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
Stephen: AND THOUGH IT CAME HALFWAY THROUGH THE DEBATE TONIGHT, I THINK THE DEFINGATIVE MOMENT OF THE EVENING, OF THE ELECTION, OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT, CAME WHEN CHRIS WALLACE ASKED DONALD TRUMP IF HE WOULD ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 8, AND TRUMP HAD THIS TO SAY.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT PREPARED NOW TO COMMIT TO THAT PRINCIPLE?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, I'LL TELL YOU AT THE TIME.AC I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OH MY GOD. THAT'S, THAT'S-- I'M SORRY, WHAT'S THE WORD?
THAT'S HORRIFYING.
Stephen: THANK YOUING! THANK YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU! I JUST-- I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEARD THAT CORRECTLY. JIMMY, CAN I HEAR THAT ONE MORE TIME?
I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE.
Stephen: OH! OH, SUSPENSE! DEMOCRACY'S GOING TO END IN A CLIFFHANGER. I GUESS WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER 9 TO FIND OUT IF WE STILL HAVE A COUNTRY. IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOOD FOR A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. OR IF HE'S GOING TO WIPE HIS FAT ASS WITH THE CONSTITUTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OOOH! OOOOH!
Stephen: WITH TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT NOT ACCEPTING THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION, I DO NOT ENVY HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER UPON KELLYANNE CONWAY, AND I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE FOOT ANNUAL OF HER TAKING QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERRED IN THE SPIN ROOM. SHE'S GOOD. SHE'S REALLY GOOD.
Jon: SHE GOT THAT VIBE!
Stephen: SHE'S REALLY GOOD. I BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE REST OF THE DEBATE. I'LL KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE. TO PSYCHE OUT THEIR OPPONENTS, EACH CANDIDATE BROUGHT SPECIAL GUESTS TONIGHT. H YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BRING PEOPLE IN TO SIT IN THE AUDIENCE FOR YOU. TRUMP INVITED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HALF-BROTHER, MALIK, WHICH I THINK MEANS THE PRESIDENT'S HALF-BROTHER HAD SEX WITH BILL CLINTON?EO I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.T  THEN LATE TONIGHT, TRUMP ALSO REVEALED THAT HE WAS ADDING SARAH PALIN TO HIS INVITE LIST. I'M NOT SURE HOW HE GOT PALIN TO INTERRUPT HER BUSY SCHEDULE OF ... I'M GONNA SAY SHOOTING KILLER WHALES WITH A BAZOOKA FROM A JET SKI. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, NOW, I WAS SURPRISED TRUMPN AGREED TO DEBATE IN VEGAS, ESPECIALLY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, BECAUSE HE HASN'T HAD A LOT OF LUCK WITH CASINOS OR UNIVERSITIES.RE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND REMEMBER, THIS WAS TRUMP'S LAST CHANCE TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON UNDECIDED VOTERS. PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT HIM IN THE LAST 16 MONTHS. SO, FOREST DWELLING HER MITTS AND CRAB FISHERMEN WHO HAVE BEEN SWEPT OUT TO SEA.HE AND WITH TRUMP FAR BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON IN THE POLLS, HE REALLY NEEDED HER TO MAKE A CRITICAL MISTAKE TONIGHT, LIKE, MISPRONOUNCE THE WORD "AMERICA, "OR SHOOT SULLY SULLENBERGER IN THE FACE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEY BOTH CAME, YOU KNOW, LOOKING THEIR BEST.
Jon: RIGHT.
Stephen: DONALD TRUMP WORE HIS TRADEMARK RED POWER TIE,U WHILE HILLARY CLINTON CAME DRESSED AS "STAR TREK "DEEP SPACE POPE. NOT A BAD LOOK. NOT A BAD LOOK. RIGHT OFF THE BAT, TRUMP PAINTED A GRIM PICTURE OF A CLINTON PRESIDENCY.
I BELIEVE IF MY OPPONENT SHOULD WIN THIS RACE-- CAN WHICH I TRULY DON'T THINK WILL HAPPEN-- WE WILL HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH WILL BE A VERY, VERY SMALL REPLICA OF WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: YES, A TINY REP REPLICA OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, MAYBE PUT OUT BY THE FRANKLIN MINT, SO SMALL. ON THE PLUS SIDE, AT LEAST THEN IT WILL FIT HIS TINY, TINY HANDS. WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT? HILLARY CLINTON DID NOT SHY AWAY FROM THIS TOUGH ISSUE ABOUT SUPPORTING GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION.
I WAS UPSET BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY, DOZENS OF TODDLERS INJURE THEMSELVES, EVEN KILL PEOPLE, WITH GUNS.
Stephen: NOW, IF I HEARD THAT CORRECTLY, HILLARY CLINTON TOOK THE POSITION OF TODDLERS KILLING PEOPLE EQUALS BAD. I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE FINDS THE COURAGE TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT. ON THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION, HOT-BUTTON ISSUE, THIS YEAR AND REALLY EVERY ELECTION YEAR, TRUMP WAS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION TO TASK.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DEPORTED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE JUST THE WAY--
SECRETARY.
Stephen: YEAH, OBAMA DEPORTED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND DONALD TRUMP THINKS THAT'S...NS BAD? ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD? TRUMP JUST PRAISED OBAMA? I DON'T-- THAT BORDER WALL BETTER BE TALL JUST TO KEEP OUT THE FLYING PIGS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )LL IT WAS SURPRISING. THROUGHOUT THE DEBATE, SOMEHOW TRUMP FOUND TIME TO TWEET REPEATEDLY. IT WAS PRETTY SURPRISING, BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW WHERE HIS HANDS WERE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE THIS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS HANDS THE WHOLE TIME. YOU DON'T KNOW. HE COULD HAVE BEEN CHURNING BUTTER. HE COULD HAVE BEEN CHURNING BUTTER THE ENTIRE TIME, OBVIOUSLY. THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IT'S A FAMILY-FRIENDLY LIVE SHOW.
Jon: YUP,IUM. >, YUP.
Stephen: THE TWO OF TH POLITICIANS GOT INTO A BIT OF AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS DOING VAD PIRPUTIN'S BIDDING.
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'D RATHER HAVE A PUPPET.
NO PUPPET. YOU'RE THE PUPPET.
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR YOU WON'T ADMIT THAT THE RUSSIANS --
NO, YOU'RE THE PUPPET.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE PUPPET.
NO, YOU'RE THE PUPPET.
YOU'RE THE PUPPET.
YOU'RE THE PUPPET.
YOU'RE THE PUPPET! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, PUPPET. I LOVE-- OH, YOU LOVE ME, TOO! OH, YOU LOVE ME, TOO! THAT WAS LESS JUVENILE THAN THEO DEBATE. M ( APPLAUSE ) TRUMP-- THIS ONE WANTS TO CHURN SOME BUTTER. ( LAUGHTER ) TRUMP-- IT'S A PUPPET! GROW UP! TRUMP HAD SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S RECORD.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU TALK BUT YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE, HILLARY. YOU DON'T. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU RAN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. $6 BILLION WAS MISSING. HOW DO YOU MISS $6 BILLION?
Stephen: OH, I KNOW THAT ONE-- OPEN SIX CASINOS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, TRUMP WAS QUICK TO SHOOT DOWNTOWN SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM, OF COURSE,.
MR. TRUMP.
NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT FOR WOMEN THAN I DO, NOBODY.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I USED TIC-TACES. IT'S OUT OF RESPECT. NOBODY WANTS TO BE GROPED AND HAVE BAD BREATH, OKAY. SECRETARY CLINTON WENT AFTER DONALD TRUMP FOR HIS TENDENCY TO BLAME HIS LOSSES ON EVERYTHING BEING RIGGED AGAINST HIM.
THEN TRUMP UNIVERSITY GETS SUED FOR FRAUD AND RACKETEERING, HE CLAIMS THE COURT SYSTEM AND THE FEDERAL JUDGE IS RIGGED AGAINST HIM. THERE WAS EVEN A TIME WHEN HE DIDN'T GET AN EMMY FOR HIS TV PROGRAM THREE YEARS IN A ROW, AND HE STARTED TWEETING THAT THE EMMYS WERE RIGGED.
SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YEAH. HE MAY HAVE A POINT THERE. HE MAY HAVE A POINT THERE. WITH THE EMMYS. I I'M BEGINNING TO SUSPECT THOSE TELEVISION AWARD MAY BE CONTROLLED BY MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA. AND, YOU KNOW, DONALD, YOU REALLY SHOULD GET ONE. THEY'RE FANTASTIC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I LOVE YOU. OH, YOU LOVE ME, TOO. FANTASTIC! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE GREAT!TI IT REALLY IS. I THINK-- THIS YEAR, HE MIGHT GET ONE. TRUMP LOST TO "THE AMAZING RACE." THIS YEAR IT COULD GO TO "THE AMAZING RACIST." AND, TRUMP, I GOTTA SAY, TRUMP DID DO A DECENT JOB HOLDING HIS BASER INSTINCTS IN CHECK, BUT AT THE END, HE LET HIS TRUMP FLAG FLY WHEN HILLARY TALKED ABOUT TAX REFORM.
MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYROLL CONTRIBUTION WILL GO UP, AS WILL DONALD'S, ASSUMING HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUT OF IT. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REPLENISH--
SUCH A NASTY WOMAN.
Stephen: OH, YEAH. SO NASTY. ALSO, QUICK REMINDER-- NO ONE RESPECTS WOMEN MORE THAN ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO NASTY. SO NASTY. SO NASTY. LOOK, LOOK, SO NASTY, MY NAME IS DONALD TRUMP. MISS JACKSON, IF YOU'RE NASTY. SO IT WAS AN HOUR AND A HALF OR A YEAR AND A HALF AND IN THE END, CHRIS WALLACE, I BELIEVE, PROVED HIMSELF TO BE AN INSIGHTFUL MODERATOR WHO... SUMMED UP EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO SAY.
HOLD ON, FOLKS. THIS DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD FOR ANYONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND JUST LIKE THAT-- AND JUST LIKE THAT, HE DESCRIBED TRUMP'S WHOLE CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. STICK AROUND. HUGH LAURIE IS HERE. BUT FIRST, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TRUMP'S ALLEGATION THAT DEAD PEOPLE ARE VOTING, WITH A SURPRISE GUEST. STICK AROUND. CAN I SEE THOSE THINGS? CAN I SEE THOSE ?INGZ COME ON, T BABY. STICK AROUND. CAN I SEE THOSE THINGS? ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK TO OUR LIVE POSTDEBATE SHOW. GOING INTO TONIGHT'S DEBATE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN TELLING HIS VOTERS AND HIS SUPPORTERTHE ELECTION IS RIGGED.G  AND YESTERDAY, TRUMP HELD A RALLY IN GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN-- WHICH FINALLY EXPLAINS WHY HE'S BEEN WEARING THAT CHEESEHEAD-- AND HE TOLD THE CROWD ABOUT THE MOST SINISTER RIGGING OF ALL.
MORE THAN 1.8 MILLION DECEASED INDIVIDUALS RIGHT NOW ARE LISTED AS VOTERS. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. ( BOOING ) WELL, IF THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, WE WILL THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT? BUT I HAVE A FEELING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME. OF THE 1.8 MILLION, 1.8 MILLION IS VOTING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
Stephen: YES, IF YOU BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP, ALL THE DEAD PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR CLINTON. AND IF YOU BELIEVE HIS CLAIMS ABOUT HER HEALTH-- SHE'S ONE OF THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, EVERYONE, EVERYONE-- EVERYONE WHO IS NOT DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT VOTER FRAUD IS INCREDIBLY RARE. IN FACT, A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF VOTES CAST SINCE 2000 FOUND THAT THERE WERE ONLY 31 CREDIBLE INCIDENTS OF VOTER FRAUD OUT OF 1 BILLION BALLOTS CAST. 31 IN A BILLION. COINCIDENTALLY, ALSO GARY JOHNSON'S ODDS OF WINNING THE PRESIDENCY. FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT! WELL, I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THE DEAD ARE REALLY VOTING, SO I DID WHAT ANY JOURNALIST WOULD DO. I SACRIFICED AN INTERN TO THE ELDER GODS, AND REACHED THROUGH THE VEIL OF DEATH TO COMMUNICATE WITH A 19th CENTURY VOTER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLEASE WELCOME, LIVE VIA PLEASE WELCOME, LIVE VIA SATELLITE, HORACE McNULTY. MR. McNULTY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US LIVE VIA SATELLITE.
HAPPY TO BE HERE, STEPHEN, BUT I'M NOT TECHNICALLY "LIVE" VIA SATELLITE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. SO HORACE, I HOPE WE DIDN'T TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ANYTHING IMPORTANT.
NO, I JUST WAS PLAYING GOLF WITH MARILYN MONROE AND JULIUS CEASAR. W
Stephen: REALLY? WHO WON?
NO ONE. WE EACH GOT 18 HOLES IN ONE. HEAVEN IS INCREDIBLY BORING.
Stephen: OKAY. SO, HORACE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF DONALD TRUMP'S CLAIMS THAT THE DEAD ARE ALL VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS?
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY A LIFE-LONG REPUBLICAN.
Stephen:  OH, YOU SUPPORT TRUMP?
NO. A "LIFE" LONG REPUBLICAN. I'M A DEATH-LONG-L INDEPENDENT. I VOTE ON THE ISSUES.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE ISSUES?
HEALTH CARE. IF I HAD ANY I'D STILL BE ALIVE.
Stephen: YOU CHID FROM A PREVENTIBLE DISEASE?
HAVE THEY FOUND A TREATMENT FOR SUCKED INTO A WHEAT THRASHER. I'M FOR HILLARY ALL THE WAY.
Stephen: TRUMP IS RIGHT, THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED?
IT'S NOT RIGGED. YOU LOOK AT THE OPTIONS. GARY JOHNSON, JILL STEIN. THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL. I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOME FRIENDS DOWN THERE. ALAN, ENJOY THE FIRE, BUDDY. SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED ME IN THAT WHEAT THRASHER. I'M ON TV!
Stephen: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. TRUMP DOES NOT APPEAL TO YOU AT ALL.
OH, SURE, I LOVED TRUMP, ON "THE APPRENTICE." BUT AS PRESIDENT, NO. DEAR GOD, EVEN IN MY DAY WE DIDN'T TREAT WOMEN LIKE THAT. BACK THEN, A WOMAN'S BEST CAREER OPTION WAS DYING IN CHILD BIRTH.
Stephen: SOUND LIKE A ROUGH TIME. SO THAT'S IT. ALL THE DEAD ARE VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
YES, INDEED, WE ALL ARE. EVEN BERNIE SANDERS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HORACE, HORR ABERNIE STANDERS ISN'T DEAD?
RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )ER
Stephen: HORACE McNULTY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SOMEBODY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, HUGH LAURIE!  McNULTY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SOMEBODY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, HUGH LAURIE! ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS A MULTI-TALENTED BRIT WHO AMERICAN AUDIENCES KNOW MOSTLY AS "HOUSE."  HE NOW STARS IN THE T PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMA, "CHANCE."
A HOMICIDAL HOMICIDE DETECTIVE, YEAH, I WOULD SAY. HE KNOWS HOW TO GAME THE SYSTEM.
HE IS THE SYSTEM.
AND YET, I WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS PROBLEM CANNOT BE SOLVED. I WILL NOT.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME HUGH LAURIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
WHAT AN HONOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WALK LIKE A MAN WHO TROD THE BOARDS. YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO TAKE A STAGE, HUGH LAURIE.
DID I OVERDUE IT.
Stephen: NO.
I DID A LITTLE BIT. I WAS GIDDY. I WAS GIDDING WITH EXCITEMENT. IT'S SO INCREDIBLE TO BE HERE INSPECT LOOK AT THIS.
Stephen: ISN'T IT A BEAUTIFUL SPACE? EXTRAORDINARY, ISN'T IT. IT'S AN HONEST-TO-GOD BROADWAY THEATER.
THAT'S THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARE.
Stephen: DID YOU-- DID YOU WATCH THE DEBATE BACKSTAGE?
I CERTAINLY DID, AVIDLY.
Stephen: AVIDLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: ANY QUICK IMPRESSIONS?
PLENTY, AND I FEEL I HAVE TO KEEP TO MYSELF BECAUSE I'M NOT FROM HERE.
Stephen: BUT YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES.
BUT I'M NOT A CITIZEN. I'M VERY AWARE OF BEING A GUEST IN THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING BACK FOR? WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU.
WELL, THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHAT'S NOT TOS LOVE?
WELL, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.RY HE'S UNSPEAKABLE. ( LAUGHTER )en ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )O HE'S ABSOLUTELY --
AND YET HE JUST KEEPS SPEAKING.
AND YET HE WILL CONTINUE TOW SPEAK, IT'S TRUE. REALLY AN ASTOUNDING CHARACTER.
Stephen: REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. YOU-- YOU PLAYED DR. HOUSE, OBVIOUSLY, FOR MANY YEARS, POPULAR ON TELEVISION IN THE WORLD FOR MANY YEARS. AND NOW YOU PLAY ANOTHER DOCTOR, ELDON CHANCE, ON THE SERIES "CHANCE" ON HULU. HE'S A FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST?
NEUROPSYCHIATRIST.
Stephen: NEUROPSYCHIATRIST, OKAY. AS A FORENSIC NEUROPSYCHIATRIST, COULD YOU DIAGNOSE EITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES? ( LAUGHTER ).
I MEAN, I AM PRETENDING IN THE SHOW. I DIDN'T STUDY --
I WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
GREAT, GREAT, WELL, THEN --
JUST DAZZLE ME WITH B.S.
I WOULD SAY-- I MEAN, IT MAY BE TOO LATE BUT FOR TRUMP I WOULD SUGGEST BREAST FEEDING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HE MIGHT TAKE YOU UP ON IT.
I THINK HE MIGHT GO ALONG WITH THAT.
Stephen: WARN THE WOMAN FIRST, THOUGH.
YES, IT WOULD BE A CONSENSUAL TREATMENT, OBVIOUSLY. HILLARY I'M MORE PUZZLED BY-- I'M NOT PUZZLED BY HILLARY, I'M PUZZLED BY THE PEOPLE WHO HATE HILLARY HATE HER SO MUCH. I FEEL AS IF IT'S ONE-- AS IF I'VE COME IN-- I'VE MISSED THE FIRST REEL OF THE FILM WHERE SHE BURNED DOWN THE ORPHANAGE, OR SOMETHING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE WHOLE AUDIENCE IS JUST LIKE THIS. AND I JUST DON'T KNOW-- BUT SHE SEEMS FINE TO ME. WHAT-- WHY-- I DON'T KNOW. SO IT'S, OBVIOUSLY, A THING I'M NOT EAT.
Stephen: IT WAS THE 90s.
WAS IT.
Stephen: IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. WHEN SHE FORCED US TO WEAR THE PARACHUTE PANTS. HAMMER DON'T HURT HIM, THAT WAS HER.
MY ONLY PRESCRIPTION FOR HER WOULD BE MAYBE A SOFT, VERTICAL STRIPE ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: GOING UP HER BODY.
HER ENTIRE BODY. NOTHING TO DO WITH HER CLOTHES. HER CLOTHES, I JUST THINK THAT-- I'M GETTING-- YEAH. ) IT'S.
Stephen: A LITTLE CLINICAL.
IT IS A LITTLE CLINICAL.
Stephen: ANOTHER AS SOMEWHAT OF AN OUTSIDER YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF AS NOT REALLY FROM HERE EVEN THOUGH YOU LIVED HERE A LOT. PEOPLE ARE REALLY-- PEOPLE ARE MAD AND KIND OF DEPRESSED AND IS THERE ANY BRIGHT SPOT THAT YOU AS SOMETHING OF AN OUTSIDER CAN SORT OF SEE IN AMERICA, TO MAKE US HAPPIER?
YES. YES. I MEAN, I THINK THIS WHOLE ELECTION HAS BEEN SOLD TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF INCIPIENT DISASTER. AND I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY --
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT? ONE OF US WENT TO CAMBRIDGE.
NOW, STOP. I HEARD YOU SPEAKING LATIN THIS AFTERNOON. SO JUST, YOU KNOW, DON'T PLAY THAT ON ME. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: ( SPEAKING LATIN ).
THERE GUAGAIN. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT. I DON'T THINK-- THE WORLD IS NOT AS GRIM AS PEOPLE-- THERE'S PROFIT IN SAYING THAT THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END, AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE.
Stephen: EVENTUALLY IT WILL.
I SUPPOSE, I SUPPOSE. BUT THE AMERICAN VOTER IS NOT GOING TO BE KILLED BY ISIS. I JUST SORT OF PROMISE YOU THAT. YOU ARE GOING TO BE KILLED-- ( APPLAUSE ) I'M SORRY.
Stephen: THAT'S A CHEAP CLAP.
IT IS.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE! ANYBODY!
I'M SAYING THE AMERICAN VOTER WILL BE KILLED BY DIABETES, FOR EXAMPLE. ( LAUGHTER )TH I MEAN, THAT'S JUST A FACT. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND --
AND WE HAVE KNOT TO FIGHT DIABETES WHEREVER THEY ARE.
AND IF ISIS WERE HALFWAY DECENT AT THEIR JOB, THEY WOULD BE OPENING A CHAIN OF DONUT SHOPS. IF THAT'S REALLY-- BUT FORTUNATELY, THEY'RE VERY DIM, AND THEY HAVEN'T SORT OF WORKED THAT OUT. I THINK THERE ARE ALL SORT OF-- I WAS KAY CAB --
A CAB. NO LIMOS? YOU'RE A STAR. YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS IN THE WORLD.
EVERY NOW AND THEN I LIKE TO SEE-- NO.
Stephen: JUST MAKING SURE.
I WAS IN A CAB. AND THE GUY WAS LOOKING AT ME IN THE MIRROR, AND HE SAID, "I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I WANT YOUR ADVICE ON FINDING AN AGENCY." AND, OF COURSE, IT'S LOS ANGELES SO I THOUGHT EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE AN ACT OOBVIOUSLY, EVERYBODY. AND I SAID, "WELL, WHAT KIND OF AN AGENCY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?" AND HE SAID, "ONE WHERE I COULD MAYBE WORK AS A LOOK-ALIKE." AND I WAS GOING, "OKAY, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU LOOK LIKE?" AND HE SAID, "WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M MIDDLE EASTERN." HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAID MIDDLE EASTERN, HE SAID MIDDLE ESATRIN. HE SAID,"I'M MIDDLE EASTRIN, AND, THEREFORE, I COULD GET WORK AS A TERRORIST." NOW, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? THAT'S A WOMAN GOING, "HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?" THERE'S JUST NO-- THERE'S NO WAY TO-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: "DO THESE PANT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST?"
EXACTLY. I SAID-- I SAID-- "CAN YES, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD LOOK LIKE-- "AND HE SAID YES, BECAUSE I'M MIDDLE EASTRIN, AND THEREFORE I COULD GET WORK PLAYING A TERRORIST IN FILMS AND TV SHOWS." AND I THOUGHT THAT IS SO WONDERFUL IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE GRAND COLLISIONS OF IDEAS AND, YOU KNOW, POWER PLOKS AROUND THE WORLD THAT OUR IDEA THAT THE WORLD IS COMING TO ANTH END, THE WAY MOST PEOPLE THINK IS, "HOW CAN I MAKE A BUCK OUT OF THAT?" I JUST THOUGHT THAFT SO-- IT WAS JUST SO INSPIRING IN A WAY. IT WAS SORT OF-- IT WAS SILLY BUT IT WAS INSPIRING THAT THERE WAS A GUY THINKING, WELL, THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE THINKS OF ME AND THE WAY I LOOK, AT THE SAME TIME, I'VE GOT TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. I SUPPOSE I COULD PLAY A TERRORIST. I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS WONDERFUL. IT MADE ME REALLY ADMIRE HIM.
Stephen: THAT'S THE SADDEST, MOST HOPEFUL STORY I'VE EVER HEARD.
IT IS.
Stephen: WELL, HUGH LAURIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: "CHANCE" IS AVAILABLE ON HULU RIGHT NOW. HUGH LAURIE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH PAUL REISER. WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW"" LIVE. MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ACTOR, COMEDIAN, AND AUTHOR WHO'S BEEN MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH FOR OVER 30 YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME PAUL REISER! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
WOW!
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU.
WHAT EXCITEMENT.
Stephen: NOW, WE HAD SOME EXCITEMENT BACKSTAGE. BOTH YOU AND HUGH LAURIE, I UNDERSTAND, WERE WATCHING THE DEBATE.
YES.
Stephen: IN MY WRITERS' ROOM.
YES.
Stephen: WHILE PEOPLE WERE CAIRCHGING ON THE SHOW.W,
THEY WERE MUCH FUNNIER THAN WE WERE. Q. NO, YOU'RE VERY FUNNY PEOPLE. TO THE DEBATE YOURSELF? DID YOU HAVE ANY REACTION?
IT'S INTERESTING. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT HOW QISIVE AND EVERYBODY IS DIVIDE. I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY IS UNITED AND EVERYBODY IS THINKING THE SAME THING WHICH IS, "CAN THIS BE OVER! PLEASE! WE'D LIKE IT TO BE OVER."
Stephen: THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE.  ( APPLAUSE ).
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER ENDING AND IT'S EXHAUSTING-- IT'S NOT UNLIKE PARENTING.
Stephen: YOU HAVE WRITTEN BOOKS ABOUT PARENTING.
IT'S EXHAUST, IT'S NEVER ENDING. BUT I FEEL LIKE IN THIS CASE WE'RE RAISING TWO AND VERY DIFFERENT TROUBLED CHILDREN, EACH WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS. AND YOU GOTTA-- YOU'D LIKE THEM TO GET ALONG BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEM BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE THEM IN THE A ROOM TOGETHER, SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT. HERE'S THE THING-- IF YOU ASK THEM WHAT HAPPENED, THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE ADOLESCENTS. SHE STARTED IT. I'M NOT YOUR PUPPET. EVERYBODY IS BLAMING. AND AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, YOU'RE THINKING WHAT HAVE WE DONE WRONG? YOU BLAME YOURSELF.
Stephen: IS IT OUR FAULT THAT THESE ARE THE TWO CANDIDATES?
REALLY, THE GOOD SIDE IS WE MUST LOVE OUR COUNTRY SO MUCH TO GO THROUGH THIS. THAT'S HOW MUCH WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, I'VE DECIDED.
Stephen: INSTEAD OF JUST TOSSING IN THE TOWEL AND GOING BACK TO ENGLAND.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE OPTIONS. I'M LIKE, NO, I'M GOING TO STICK IT OUT.
Stephen: AS SOMEBODY WHO, YOU HAVE KID YOUR OWN. YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT PARENTING.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S HARD TO TALK TO KIDS ABOUT--
I TRY NOT TO. , A VOID THEM. THAT'S WHEN THEY COME AT ME. AND I GO, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT HERE?"
Stephen: I HAVE A FRIEND WITH A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD AND WHEN THE KID WALKS INTO THE ROOM HE HITS THE MUTE IF IT'S ABOUT TRUMP AND HIS BUS-RIDE TALK, BUT THE CLOSED CAPTIONING CAME UP AND THE KID CAME IN ANDRY READ-- HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED AND HE SAID DADDY, WHAT'S A.
HE'S READING AND THAT'S PROMISING.
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD.
YOU GET SOMETHING POSITIVE OUT OF IT.
Stephen: AS EXHAUSTING AS THIS CAMPAIGN IS EYE HAVE KIDS, YOU HAVE KIDS-- THERE'S NOTHING MORE EXHAUSTING THAN BEING A PARENT, RIGHT?
IT IS THE MOST REWARDING AND THE MOST EXHAUSTING. IT IS-- BUT CHILD FATIGUE IS DIFFERENT THAN ELECTION FATIGUE. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN-- IT'S A DEEPER FATIGUE. IT'S TO THE BONE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I-- HERE'S THE ANALOGY I HAVE. YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOUR PHONE RUNS OUT OF BATTERY AND IS IT WILL SAY 0%, BUT SOMETIMES THE BATTERY IS SO DEAD TCAN'T EVEN TELL YOU THAT. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ALL THE TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) I FEEL I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE NAP JUST TO GET THE STRENGTH TO DISWIEB HOW TIRED THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING ME.
Stephen: I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS THREE-- HAS THREE KIDS, AND WHEN HER THIRD CHILD WAS BORNG I SAID TO HER,"ARE YOU GET ANYTHING SLEEP?" AND HE SAID, "SLEEP? OH! I DWREEM OF SLEEP."
YEAH, THAT'S GONE. YEAH. YOU HAVE THREE KID, AND YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL JOB. SEE, I DON'T HAVE THAT. YOU'RE HERE EVERY DAY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A JOB.
NOT THAT YOU'D NOTICE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE "RED OAKS:
YES, THAT'S THE SEAM AS YOU, REALLY.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE BACK TO STAND-UP.
I AM DOING STAND-UP AGAIN, AND I FEEL LIKE GEORGE CARLIN WHO USED TO SAY, "I WORK FOR Y FREE, BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY ME TO GO THROUGH THE AIRPORT." THAT'S THE HARD PART, THEE TRAVEL-- YEAH, I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME DOING STAND-UP?
Stephen: AS-- DOING THE-- IN THIS TELEVISION SHOW CALLED "RED OAKS" IT TAKES PLACE AT A COUNTRY CLUB. AND YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNTRY CLUB.
I'M THE BIG CHEESE.
Stephen: YOU'RE A JERK IN THIS.
OH, THE CHARACTER. WHEW!
Stephen: THE CHARACTER IS KIND OF A JERK--
I THOUGHT THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR.
Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVES YOU FROM "MAD ABOUT YOU." YOU'RE GENERALLY LIKE A NICE GUY. IS IT NICE? DO YOU ENJOY PLAYING THE JERK. THE ONLY JERK I HAVE SEEN YOU PLAY IS IN "ALIENS.
YOU SAY JERK. AND I SAY MISANDERSON.
Stephen: AND DEVOURED BY THE ALIEN IN THE THEATER AND WE ALL CHEERED.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON, WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS. I HAD TO OTHER STAT CALENDAR OVER.
Stephen: CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS TO ME? WHAT IS THIS?
I DIDN'T SEE WHAT IT IS.
Stephen: IT SAYS-- IT'S ALL IN CHINESE, AND IT SAYS, "MAD ABOUT YOU," UP THERE.
THEY THOUGHT I WOULDN'T KNOW. BUT I COULD TELL IT SAID "MAD ABOUT YOU." "MAD ABOUT YOU" HAS BEEN BOUGHT AND RECREATED IN CHINA. SKI UNDERSTAND THEY'RE MARRIED-- ACTUALLY, THE ACTORS ARE ACTUALLY MARRIED. AND I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. I HAVEN'T HEARD THEM. AND IF I HEARD THEM I WOULDN'T KNOW.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP ACTUALLY.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW FUNNY WE ARE IN CHINA.
Stephen: USE INTRODUCED YOUR EPISODE WITH "HELEN HUNT."  THEY SAY "MAD ABOUT YOU," BUT IT MEANS "WEDDING APARTMENT." HERE'S THE LATEST EPISODE.
LET'S SEE IF IT'S FUNNY. ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT PLAYS ANYWHERE? THAT'S GOING TO PLAY ANYWHERE. THROW THE FLOUR ON THE HEAD.
Stephen: FLOUR GROUND FROM SOMETHING ELSE.
A BUDDY OF MINE WHO WORKED ON "MAD ABOUT YOU" WENT OVER THERE AND SUPERVISED TO THE EXTENT THEY WOULD LET HIM SUPERVISE. THEY TOOK OUR SCRIPTS, TRANSLATED THEM INTO CHINESE TO SEE IF THEY WERE DOING A GOOD JOB OF IT, THEY WOULD TRANSLATE IT BACK INTO ENGLISH. YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD COME BACK THE SAME. BUT SOMEHOW-- IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU CHANGE MONEY, YOU GET SCREWED ON BOTH ENDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HOW DID I GET LESMONEY? APPARENTLY, COMEDY GETS SUCKED OUT BOTH WAYS. BUT I WISH THEM LUCK.OU IT'S APPARENTLY A VERY BIG HIT.
Stephen: YOU WERE ONE OF THE CREATORS OF "MAD ABOUT YOU."
YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU GETTING YOUR BEAK WET ON THIS?
I HAVE GOTTEN NOTHING SO FAR. 60 MILLION PEOPLE WATCH IT A WEEK WHICH IS A ONE SHARE OVER THERE. IT'S A VERY BIG COUNTRY. IT'S DOING VERY WELL BUT I-- I'M WAITING. I'M WAITING FOR SOME SORT --
MAYBE YOU COULD DO A WALK-ON.
THAT WOULD BE FUN WITH THE POWDER.
Stephen: WITH THE POWDER. JUST LEARN SOME MANDARIN.
HOW HARD COULD THAT BE.
Stephen: THE I THINK HARDEST THING ON THE PLANET.
IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD.en THE SECOND SEASON OF "RED OAKS" COMES OUT ON AMAZON NOVEMBER 11. PAUL REISER, EVERYBODY!LD THANKS CRCH, PAUL THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ELECTION POLL GURU NATE SILVER. STICK AROUND. WE'RE LIVE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ELECTION POLL GURU NATE SILVER. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO THE LIVE SHOW. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE SEER OF SEERS, SAGE OF SAGES, THE PROGNOSTICATOR OF PROGNOSTICATORS, AND ELECTION PROPHET EXTRAORDINARY. PLEASE WELCOME NATE SILVER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COME ON UP. RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. CAN CLOSE TO ME, PLEASE. ALL RIGHT, NATE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ISN'T IT LOVELY HERE?
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU. YOU ARE THE FOUNDER AND EDITOR IN CHIEF OF fivethirtyeight.com. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, I'M GOING ON START WITH Aen QUESTION EVERYBODY ASKS YOU EVERY TIME THEY SEE YOU:  WHO WILL WIN?
WELL, LET'S PUT IT LIKE THIS. SO CLINTON CAME IN WITH ABOUT A SEVEN-POINT LEAD.
Stephen: TONIGHT.
BEFORE THE DEBATE, AND THE POLLS SHOWED AND THE SCIENTIFIC POLLS-- AND THE UNSCIENTIFIC POLLS SHOWED CLINTON WINNING THE DEBATE. IT'S AS THOUGH SHE WAS READY IN THE FOOTBALL GAME AND TRUMP THREW A PICK-SIX. SO IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD FOR DONALD J.TRUMP.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING-- YOU HAVE BEEN SURPRISINGLY ACCURATE OVER THE LAST FEW ELECTIONS WITH ONE EXCEPTION, WITH ONE CANDIDATE. WHO IS THE CANDIDATE YOU GOT WRONG?
WE EVOLVED. WE WERE SKEPTICAL.
Stephen: WHO DID YOU GET WRONG. WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
DONALD J. TRUMP.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU GET HIM WRONG?
WE HAD SILLY IDEAS AND DIDN'T LOOK AT THE POLLS. THE POLLS WERE PRETTY ACCURATE IN THE G.O.P. PRIMARY AND HAD HIM AHEAD THE WHOLE WAY. A COUPLE OF STATES LIKE IOWA WHERE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN HE DIDN'T. THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW HE HAS ONLY ABOUT 38% OF THE VOTE. CLINTON HAS 45% OF THE VOTES. THERE ARE SOME UNDECIDEDS LEFT. I DON'T THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB OF PERSUADING THEM TONIGHT.
Stephen: WHO IS UNDECIDED? I THINK AT THIS POINT THOSE PEOPLE DON'T NEED MORE INFORMATION. THEY NEED MORE MEDICATION. WHO IS UNDECIDED?
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T T LIKE EITHER CANDIDATE. THERE IS A GUY NAMED EVAN McMULLIN IN UTAH WHO IS LITERALLY SOMEONE NO ONE HEARD OF AND HE IS LEADING IN POLLS IN UTAH BECAUSE UTAH IS WEIRD AND PEOPLE ARE SO FED UP WITH THE MAJOR CANDIDATES.
Stephen: HE'S RUNNING FOR CANDIDATE?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT'S HIS NAME.
EVAN McMULLIN.
Stephen: THERE IS A GUY I NEVER HEARD OF WHO MIGHT WIN THE ELECERAL VOTE IN UTAH?
LITERALLY, NOBODY HEARD OF HIM UNTIL SEVEN DAYS AGO.
Stephen: SEVEN DAYS AGO?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HE MOVED FROM 10% TO 31% IN THE POLLS IN THE SPAN OF ABOUT A WEEK.
Stephen: WOW! OKAY. WHAT ARE THE ODDS THIS IS OVER ON NOVEMBER 9? BECAUSE TRUMP SAYS, "YEAH, I'LL LET YOU KNOW."
I MOON, PEOPLE-- TRUMP HAS OCCUPIED SO MUCH SPACE IN MY HEAD FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND A LOT OF AMERICANS' HEADS, I KIND OF THINK I KNOW-- I CAN'T SWEAR BUT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN REACTION TO TELL HIM TO MAYBE BE QUIET, TO SHUT UP AFTER NOVEMBER --
BUT HE DOESN'T GENERALLY RESPOND TO THOSE REQUESTS.
PEOPLE ARE SO EXHAUSTED BY THIS ELECTION, THOUGH, AND USUALLY-- LOOK, EVEN AL GORE, JOHN KERRY, MITT ROMNEY, WHO ALL LOST THE ELECTIONS BY RELATIVELY NARROW MARGINS, PROBABLY NARROWER THAN TRUMP DID, THEY STOOD DOWN AND PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM IN ANY WAY BUT A GRACIOUS WAY. TRUMP HAS 35% OF THE COUNTRY THAT WILL BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAYS. BUT PEOPLE DO GET SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME ACT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
Stephen: ARE THERE ANY STATE OUT THERE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT, THAT ARE SORT OFI SURPRISE, STORIES YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT TO A STATE-BY-STATE BASIS?
RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF TRADITIONALLY RED STATES LIKE TEXAS AND ARIZONA. THOSE STATES ARE ACTUALLY CLOSER THAN PENNSYLVANIA OR COLORADO RIGHT NOW. IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE DOWN BY SEVEN POINT. IT KIND OF SWINGS PRETTY UNIFORMLY. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, TRUMP IS UNDERPERFORMING AMONG THE TRADITIONAL G.O.P. SUBURBAN BASE. HE GETS SOME OF THEM, BUT IF YOU ONLY GET 80% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOU USUALLY GET 92%, THEN THAT MEANS YOU CAN LOSE A STATE LIKE ARIZONA, FOR EXAMPLE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS FOR GIVING US THE0 INFORMATION. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOVEMBER 8. THANKS ARE THE INFORMATION. FOR MORE ELECTION COVERAGE, VISIT fivethirtyeight.com. NATE SILVER, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR OUR LIVE POST-DEBATE "LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE TIGER WOODS, ELIJAH WOOD AND JORGE RAMOS. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, TOM CRUISE AND ANNA FARIS. GOOD NIGHT! GER WOODS, ELIJAH WOOD  access.wgbh.org  HIS GUESTS, TOM CRUISE AND ANNA FARIS. GOOD NIGHT!
