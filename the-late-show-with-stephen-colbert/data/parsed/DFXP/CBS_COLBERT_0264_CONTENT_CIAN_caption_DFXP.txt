SANTA'S HERE! YAY!
HELLO, BILLY AND SUSIE.
SANTA, WHY DO YOU LOOK SO PAD?
WELL, SANTA DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH TIME IT TOOK TO DO STOP-MOTION ANIMATION, BUT HE DOES UNDERSTAND A COMMITMENT TO CBS FOR A NOVELTY HOLIDAY SPECIAL. BUT I DIGRESS. HERE, I BROUGHT YOU PRESENTS. THIS, UH... BALL!
YAY, A BALL!
AND THIS... SNAKE! ( LAUGHTER ).
OKAY.
WAIT A MINUTE, GIVE ME THAT SNAKE BACK.
HEY!
HO-HO, ECONOMIC IT OUT.
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!
IT SURE IS. MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE. AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT. NOW UP THE CHIMNEY I GO! OOOOH! THAT'S A TIGHT FIT. OOPS. ( LAUGHTER ) MERRY CHRISTMAS!
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES NEIL PATRICK HARRIS AND MEGAN MULLALLY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY!
Stephen: HEY, JON. GOOD TO SEE YOU!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. THANKS VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "LATE SHOW,"" FOLKS. I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU CAN CAN TELL-- ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THE HOLIDAYS. I'M FEELING GOOD. I'M FEELING GOOD THIS CHRISTMASTIME. ALMOST ALL MY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING IS STARTED. I'M AHEAD. I'M AHEAD. YOU KNOW WHO'S HAVING A GOOD CHRISTMAS? DONALD TRUMP. HE GOT WHAT HE WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS-- AMERICA. AND HE'S REGUESTING IT TO HIS BUDDIES. HE'S APPOINTED MORE PEOPLE TO HIS CABINET. YESTERDAY, A GUY NAMED STEPHEN MILLER WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SENIOR POLICY ADVISER. NOW, WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HIM. SO FAR, WE KNOW HE'S A PICKER, A GRINNER, A LOVER, AND SINNER. SOME PEOPLE CALL HIM MAURICE. THIS IS THE DOPE ON THIS GUY. DURING THE CAMPAIGN, STEPHEN MILLER'S JOB WAS TO "WARM UP CROWDS BEFORE TRUMP TOOK THE STAGE AT RALLIES." "ALL RIGHT, WELCOME TO THE RALLY. HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS FROM? OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO DEPORT YOU BACK TO THERE." TRUMP'S CABINET IS REALLY TAKING SHAPE, AND IT'S IMPORTANT, IT TAKES SHAPE, BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THING CALLED THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. IT INVOLVES MOST OF THE CABINET. IT GOES PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, SECRETARY OF STATE, THE GRIMACE, I BELIEVE. JUST KIDDING, OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE ALL WHITE.
Jon: HEY.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE. GRIMACE IS A PERSON OF COLOR. PURPLE, PURPLE, BUT STILL. HERE'S AN ACTUAL CHART FOR THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. WHICH DOUBLES AS THE CHART OF HAIRCUTS YOU CAN GET AT THE SENIOR CENTER. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU CONCERNED WITH DIVERSITY, DON'T WORRY. THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE APPEARS TO BE A BLACK GUY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS. DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM. DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM. BUT HE SEEMS VERY NICE. YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP WAS IN WISCONSIN, HIDING FROM HIS INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING, AND HE SURPRISED THE CROWD WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE FELT ON ELECTION NIGHT ABOUT ALL THE POLLS THAT SAID HE WOULD LOSE.
I REALLY ASSUMED I LOST. I BELIEVED THESE THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CORRECT, SO I SORT OF THOUGHT I LOST, AND I WAS OKAY WITH IT.
Stephen: YES, I WAS, TOO. I WAS OKAY WITH THAT. I WAS OKAY WITH THAT.
Jon: I SAW THAT, I SAW THAT. I WAS THERE, TOO.
Stephen: THAT IDEA DID NOT UPSET ME. THEN TRUMP SHARED A VERY PERSONAL MOMENT.
I GO AND SEE MY WIFE. I SAID, "BABY, I TELL YOU WHAT." WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN TONIGHT."
Stephen: THAT IS ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE SINATRA SONG. HIT IT, JOHNNY! ♪ BABY, WE'RE NOT GONNA WIN TONIGHT ♪ THE CROOKS ON THE NEWS WERE RIGHT ♪ IT WOULD'A BEEN A THRILL TO LOCK UP HILL ♪ BUT, BABY, WE'RE NOT GONNA TO NIGHT ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A LITTLE HIGH. A LITTLE HIGH. TRUMP THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE THE MOMENT THAT HE REALIZED VICTORY WAS WITHIN HIS TINY GRASP.
YOU KNOW, WITH THE MAP-- BING! BING! BING! BOY, THAT MAP WAS GETTIN' RED AS HELL! THAT MAP, THAT MAP WAS BLEEDING RED!
Stephen: WOW. THE FACT THAT HE WAS SHOCKED ON MAKES ME FEEL CLOSER TO DONALD TRUMP. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS. IT TURNS OUT HE ALSO WOULD HAVE BEEN UNPREPARED TO HOST MY ELECTION NIGHT SHOW. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TWO OF US. A BIT OF A SHOCKER. POINT IS, WE'RE ALL STILL DISSECTING WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ELECTION. JILL STEIN IS DEMANDING RECOUNTS, AND HILLARY CLINTON IS IN THE WOODS RE-STAGING THE DEBATES WITH A DEAD SQUIRREL. WE'LL GET THEM. WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS ONE. ONE THING THAT MAY HAVE TIPPED THE BALANCE WAS WIKILEAKS RELEASING THOUSANDS OF CLINTON EMAILS OBTAINED BY RUSSIAN HACKERS. AND WE JUST FOUND OUT HOW THEY DID IT. APPARENTLY, HACKERS SENT HILLARY'S CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN, JOHN PODESTA, A FAKE WARNING EMAIL TELLING HIM HE HAD TO CHANGE HIS PASSWORD, AND WHEN THE CLINTON FOLKS CLICKED ON IT, RUSSIAN HACKERS GOT ACCESS TO ALL OF HIS E-MAILS. I CAN'T BELIEVE A TRICK THIS OBVIOUS TOOK DOWN THE MOST SOPHISTICATED CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY. THAT WOULD BE LIKE WINNNG WORLD WAR II BY LURING HITLER OUT OF HIS BUNKER WITH A FAKE LADY HITLER. BY THE WAY, FAKE LADY HITLER IS MY SECOND FAVORITE SINATRA SONG ♪ FAKE LADY HITLER, GOOSE-STEPPING INTO CZECHOSLOVAKIA ♪ NO? NO? ♪ FAKE LADY HITLER FAKE LADY HITLER ♪ I LIKE YOUR MUSTACHE I'M RUNNING TOWARDS YOU ♪ I'M GONNA DASH ♪
Jon: HEY, I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: IT WAS NEVER RELEASED. SINATRA NEVER RELEASED THAT ONE.
Jon: YEAH, THE DEEP CUT.
Stephen: AND IT GETS EVEN CRAZIER BECAUSE THIS HACK NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING: WHEN A PODESTA AIDE TRIED TO VERIFY IF THE HACKER EMAIL WAS REAL, ANOTHER STAFFER REPLIED, "THIS IS A LEGITIMATE EMAIL," WHEN HE HAD MEANT TO TYPE THAT IT WAS AN "ILLEGITIMATE EMAIL." SO THAT'S IT. THERE IT IS. THE ENTIRE ELECTION HINGED ON A TYPO. IT REALLY LEGITIMIZES OUR DEMOCRACY-- SORRY, DE-LEGITIMIZES. THAT'S A TYPO. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. SO NOW-- SO NOW-- ( APPLAUSE ) CLAPPING FOR THE END OF DEMOCRACY.  ( CHEERS ) SO NOW TRUMP IS GETTING READY TO MOVE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND HE HAS ANNOUNCED HIS FIRST DECORATION FOR THE OVAL OFFICE-- A LETTER WRITTEN TO HIM BY PRESIDENT NIXON. HE IS GOING TO MOUNT IT ON THE WALL RIGHT NEXT TO HIS STUFFED HEAD OF JEB BUSH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN-- IT'S A REAL LETTER, IT WAS WRITTEN IN 1987 AND IT SAYS: "DEAR DONALD, I DID NOT SEE THE PROGRAM, BUT MRS. NIXON TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE GREAT ON "THE DONAHUE SHOW." AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, SHE IS AN EXPERT ON POLITICS, AND SHE PREDICTS THAT WHENEVER YOU DECIDE TO RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU WILL BE A WINNER!" WHAT POLLSTER DID PAT NIXON USE, NOSTRADAMUS? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: THAT WASN'T THE ONLY LETTER NIXON SENT TRUMP. WE AT "THE LATE SHOW" HAVE OBTAINED FROM OUR CONTACTS DEEP WITHIN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES A TROVE OF HITHERTOFORE-- HITHERTOFORE-- HITHERTO-- UNRELEASED CORRESPONDENCE FROM PRESIDENT NIXON TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. THESE ARE THE NIXON TRUMP LETTERS. VOLUME ONE. LET ME GET INTO CHARACTER HERE. I'M RICHARD NIXON! OKAY. I'M RICHARD NIXON. ( LAUGHTER ) BOOINGA-BOOINGA. "DEAR DONALD, I WASN'T WATCHING THE TV, BUT PAT TELLS ME THAT YOU WERE EXCELLENT ON WRESTLEMANIA. ( LAUGHTER ) I SUSPECT THE WHOLE THING IS A FRAUD. HOW CAN THE MACHO MAN TAKE THAT MANY FOLDING CHAIRS TO THE HEAD? GIVE MY BEST TO THE HULKSTER. YOURS, DICK." I'M REALLY GETTING INTO CHARACTER.
Jon: I SEE THAT. "DEAR DONALD, I DID NOT SEE THE PROGRAM, BUT PAT SAYS YOU WERE WONDERFUL ON 'THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR.' JUST LIKE HIM, ON THE PLAYGROUND WAS WHERE I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS, CHILLIN' OUT, MAXIN', RELAXIN', ALL COOL. I HOPE WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE, YOU WILL USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO REACH OUT TO AFRO-AMERICANS. PLEASE REMIND THEM THAT LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN. LOVE, DICK." ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS ME BEING CASUAL. "DEAR DONALD, PAT I HAVE FOLLOWED YOUR CAMPAIGN CLOSELY. HOW DO YOU KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS (BLEEP)? ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN-- I MEAN, LEAKED RECORDINGS SUNK MY REPUTATION, AND YOU TALK ABOUT (BLEEP) AND STILL GET ELECTED? YOU GOT SOME BALLS, BUDDY. SINCERELY, RICHARD NIXON'S GHOST." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS SO MUCH. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. NEIL PATRICK HARRIS IS HERE. STICK AROUND!
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS A TONY AND FOUR EMMIES AND A BOATLOAD OF TALENT. PLEASE WELCOME, NEIL PATRICK HARRIS. ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: WELCOME! CONGRATULATIONS. THE LAF TIME I SAW YOU, YOU HAD NOT YET WON YOUR TONY. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT.
IT WAS SO FUN.
Stephen: TONY IS WHERE IT'S AT, MAN. ANYBODY CAN WIN AN EMMY, RIGHT? I'VE GOT, LIKE, NINE OF THEM, RIGHT, WHO'S COUNTING. OSCARS YOU CAN WIN FOR DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT, AND AGREEMENT HAS SPOKEN WORD. TONY YOU HAVE TO BRING IT LIVE. YOU CAN'T FAKE THE TONY.
YOU CAN'T FAKE THE TONY. IT WAS SUPER FUN AND EXCITING TO DO BUT WE HAD A THEATRICAL CHAPTER TOGETHER.
Stephen: IT WAS BRIEF.
STEPHEN SONDHEIM'S "COMPANY" AT LINCOLN CENTER. AND YOU WERE SO GOOD.
Stephen: YOU DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB AND I STOOD ON STAGE WITH YOU. IT WAS FANTASTIC. THERE IS VIDEO TO PROVE IT.
THAT WAS NOT TRUE. I WAS WILDLY UNDERPREPARED. AND YOU WERE SO ON YOUR GAME --
WE WERE ALL UNPREPARED. WE NEVER REHEARSED THE SHOW TOGETHER UNTIL WE DID THE SHOW LIVE IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE. IT'S TRUE.
NOW YOU'RE JUST LYING.
Stephen: IT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
I HAD MY SCRIPT IN MY HAND. I ARRIVED A WEEK LATER YOU GUYS. YOU WERE COMPLETELY OFF BOOK. YOU AND MARTHA PLIMTON HAD SCENES TOGETHER, YOU CAN KUNK-FU SCENES TOGETHER.
Stephen: A LOT OF SONDHEIM IS KUNG FU. >FU. I JUST DID SINATRA, MY FRIEND. THE ABILITY TO DO A MUSICAL.
I DON'T MEAN SKILL SET.
Stephen: I AM OUT OF HERE!
NO, NO, NO. NO, I'M SAYING QUITE THE OPPOSITE. I'M SAYING THAT YOU HAVE THE TALENT TO DO A MUSICAL, BUT YOU HAVE THIS GIG HERE --
IT'S NICE TO BE ON BROADWAY EVERY NIGHT.
IF YOU COULD DO A MUSICAL, WHAT WOULD DO YOU?
Stephen: "JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, ." DO YOU KNOW "JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR."
I'VE HEARD OF IT.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU WANT?
FAKE LADY HITLER. IT'S A GREAT SHOW.
Stephen: I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S AN ENTIRE SCORE "FAKE LADY HITLER." WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY HITLER OR FAKE LADY HITLER.
I WON A TONY FER HEDGEWICK.
Stephen: WHEN YOU GET A TONTONY CAN YOU WALK UP TO ANY S AND SAY, "I THINK YOU HAVE TICKETS FOR ME. 'HAMILTON'" IS NOT SOLD OUT. HOW ABOUT FOR MY FRIEND, ANTHONY. DOES HE HAVE TICKETS? YOU'RE DOING WELL, AND EVEN THOUGH, LIKE, YOU'RE A BIG STAR AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT, AND I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY ROLLING IN IT, YOU MIGHT GET A HURT ON YOUR BUDGET THIS CHRISTMAS BECAUSE YOUR SON, GIDEON-- YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND, DAVID HAVE, TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, GIDEON AND HARPER.
TWINS.
Stephen: AND DPIDON HAS PUT OUT A CHRISTMAS LIST. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. IT SAYS, "1, BOUNCE HOUSE." ( LAUGHTER ) "2--" AND IS THIS WHAT IT SAYS-- "LIFE-SIZED ROCKET SHIP." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S WHAT HE WANT S.
Stephen:  DID THIS GET MAILED TO SANTA?
NOT JUST YET. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT HE'S AFTER.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU LIVE IN THE CITY, RIGHT?
WE LIVE IN THE CITY! WE HAVE-- YEAH AIR, BROWNSTOWN IN THE CITY. THAT'S WHAT I SAID THOIM, "WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO PUT A LIFE-SIZED ROCKET?"
Stephen: IS THERE A CHANCE THE ROCKET WILL COME TRUE?
IT MIGHT NOT BE LIFE-SIZED. BUT IT WILL-- OUR DAUGHTER, HARPER, ASKED FOR PINK KARAOKE MACHINE.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE.
PINK? ( LAUGHTER ) I GET THE KARAOKE PART. BUT DOES IT NEED TO BE PINK?
Stephen: SHE-- SHE IS FINE WITH, YOU KNOW, WESTERN GENDER NORMATIVE CHOICES.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND YOU ARE NOT TO JUDGE HER FOR THAT.
I DON'T JUDGE THE GLIRCHG DO NOT JUDGE HER CHOICES. HOW SHE IDENTIFIES IS NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!
THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE. AND IT'S REALLY SANTA'S LIST. THE OTHER THING SHE ASKED FOR WAS A DOLLHOUSE, BUT A LIFE-SIZED DOLLHOUSE FOR HER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HOW BIG WAS IT? WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PHOTO. WE HAVE A PHOTO RIGHT HERE.
SHE'S 48 INCHES TALL.
Stephen: THERE'S YOU AND DAVID AND THE KIDS.
THAT WAS HALLOWEEN. I SAID, "HARPER, A LIFE-SIZED DOLLHOUSE IS JUST A HOUSE. HE'S NOT GOING TO GET A HOUSE FOR YOU." AND SHE SAID, "YEAH." I SAID, "WHAT IS IT WITH THESE GIANT GIST T GIFTS? WHERE DO WE PUT A LIFE-SIZED DOLLHOUSE THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH FOR YOU OR A PERSON?" AND SHE SAID, "ON THE ROOF. WE'LL PUT IT ON THE ROOF."
Stephen: WITH THE ROCKET SHIP.
SO, YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE A LATE NIGHT ON THE 24th.
Stephen: YOU AND DAVID PUT OUT SOME INCREDIBLY ADORABLE PHOTOS OF YOU AND THE KIDS. THIS IS YOUR HALLOWEEN PHOTO, RIGHT?
WE DO A FUN HALLOWEEN PICTURE EVERY YEAR.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BECOME AN ARM'S RACE, LIKE EVERY YEAR THERE'S A CUTER ONE. AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GOING TO PEAK OUT. AND THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GO, "DAD, YOU TOTALLY FAILED THIS YEAR. WHAT IS GOING ON?"
I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I JUST LOVE HALLOWEEN AND I THINK IT'S SUPER FUN AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ON SILLY COSTUMES AND GET SCARED EYE LOVE HAUNTED HOWS." WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE TOUGH IS WHEN THEY START DICTATING WHAT THE COSTUMES ARE GOING TO BE. RIGHT NOW WE CAN SAY, "WE HAVE A GREAT IDEA. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. OLD HOLLYWOOD. SEE THIS, HER NAME IS MARILYN MONROE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH A LITTLE CLIP FROM MARILYN MONROE." AND THEY'RE OKAY WITH IT. BUT IN A YEAR OR TWO THEY'RE GOING TO DECLARE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S THE ARMS RACE.
Stephen: THEY WILL, ABSOLUTELY. BY THE TIME THEY BECOME TEENAGERS, YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF THEY TALK TO YOU, OF COURSE,.
UNDERSTOOD.
Stephen: YOUR COSTUME IS, "YOU TWO ARE INVISIBLE." AND WE'RE GOING TO GO HAVE FUN. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. DON'T GO NO WAY--

SHAM HAS A PEG LEG. YOU CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT.
Stephen: THIS GUY? HE HAS A PEG LEG?
I HAD TO WALK AROUND WITH A PEG LEG AND MY LEG-- UP MY BUTT. SO THAT WAS HARD. SHIRLEY HAD PADDING, SO THAT WAS HARD. GOING TO THE BATHROOM WAS TOUGH AS SHIRLEY.
Stephen: YEAH?
BECAUSE I HAD, YOU KNOW, UNDERWEAR AND THEN HOSE AND THEN PADDING AND THEN, LIKE, SPANX, TO COVER IT ALL. YOU HAD TO PUT ALL THAT ON, AND THEN WHEN YOU HAD TO PEE, YOU HAD TO TAKE IT ALL OFF AND TRY NOT TO GET IT EVERYWHERE AND THEN YOU HAD TO GET IT ALL BACK ON AGAIN.
