PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES GROWING CRITICISM OVER A COMMENT THAT HE MADE WHILE HONORING NATIVE AMERICANS DURING THE EVENT FOR NAVAJO CODE TALKERS, HE REFERRED TO SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN AS POCAHONTAS.
AND I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY, VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. YOU WERE HERE LONG BEFORE ANY OF US WERE HERE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS WHO THEY SAY WAS HERE A LONG TIME AGO. THEY CALL HER POCAHONTAS.
WHAT THE HELL! THAT POCK HAUNTAS CRACK IS THE MOST OFFENSE THING UTTERED BY A PRESIDENT ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS THAT I, ANDREW JACKSON, HAVE EVER HEARD. AND REMEMBER MY NICKNAME WAS "THE INDIAN KILLER." I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAIL OF TEARS. SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHY IS A PORTRAIT OF ME HANGING BEHIND A CEREMONY HONORING NATIVE AMERICANS? AGAIN, MY NICKNAME WAS "INDIAN KILLER," NOT "INDIAN TICKLER," NOT "INDIAN HONORER," "INDIAN KILLER." LITERALLY, ANY OTHER PORTRAIT WOULD BE LESS INSULTING TO NATIVE AMERICANS -- THE MASCOT FOR THE CLEVELAND INDIANS, THE LANDO LAKES BUTTER LADY, THE GUY WHO DRESSED UP LIKE AN INDIAN WHO CRIEDLY IN THE COMMERCIAL. JOHNNY DEPP AS TONTO, ANYTHING. BUT TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT SO TO SHOW MY RESPECT FOR NAVAJO CODE TALKERS. I WILL SPEAK IN CODE. LET THEM CRACK THAT ONE.
IT'S "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." PLUS, STEPHEN WELCOMES: JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE AND SAN JUAN CARMEN YULIN CRUZ FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW, LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT!  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HELLO! WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY? THANK YOU, PLEASE, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. TOO KIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT, I AM ONE OF THE FEW MONEY STILL ALLOWED ON TELEVISION BECAUSE TODAY MATT LAUER WAS IS LET GO FROM NBC'S MORNING SHOW, THE "TODAY' SHOW, THIS MORNING, TODAY. ACCORDING TO THE CHAIRMAN OF NBC NEWS, LAUER WAS FIRED DUE TO "INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE." NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH "APPROPRIATE" SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE. BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT EXIST.  (  LAUGHTER  ) WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT LAUER HAD A STRANGE OBSESSION WITH WOMEN. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT ANY OF HIS ACTUAL HALLOWEEN COSTUMES. DOLLY PARTON, "BAYWATCH" BABE, PARIS HILTON, AND LUCY FROM PEANUTS. GOOD GRIEF. AFTER LOOKING AT THOSE PHOTOS, I THINK HE COULD HAVE BEEN FIRED FOR SEXUALLY HARASSING HIMSELF. BUT HE WASN'T, BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME DETAILS, AND THEY ARE NOT GREAT. TURNS OUT, LAUER ONCE GAVE A COLLEAGUE A SEX TOY AS A PRESENT. IT INCLUDED AN EXPLICIT NOTE ABOUT HOW HE WANTED TO USE IT ON HER. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT HE GAVE HER A SEX TOY, BUT HE ALSO GAVE INSTRUCTIONS? HE FOUND A WAY TO MANSPLAIN SEXUAL HARASSMENT!  (  LAUGHTER  ) "YOU'RE DOING THAT WRONG! LET ME GET IN THERE."  (  LAUGHTER  ) "THIS IS WHY YOU LIKE WHAT I'M DOING."  (  LAUGHTER  ) AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. ON ANOTHER DAY, HE SUMMONED A DIFFERENT FEMALE EMPLOYEE TO HIS OFFICE AND THEN DROPPED HIS PANTS, SHOWING HER HIS PENIS. AFTER THE EMPLOYEE DECLINED TO DO ANYTHING, VISIBLY SHAKEN, HE REPRIMANDED HER FOR NOT ENGAGING IN A SEXUAL ACT. I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT THAT WOMAN HONESTLY COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT "WHAT A DICK."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE DON'T HAVE TO BLUR THAT, DO WE? WE DON'T HAVE TO BLUR THAT. WE DON'T HAVE TO BLUR THAT. THIS MORNING, HODA KOTB AND SAVANNAH GUTHRIE HAD TO ANNOUNCE LAUER'S DEPARTURE ON THE "TODAY" SHOW, WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN AWKWARD FOR THEM, AND EVEN MORE AWKWARD FOR THE FANS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. WOOO! GO HAWKS! WHERE'S MATT? WHY'S EVERYBODY SO SAD IN THERE? KAREN, WILL YOU MARRY ME?" KAREN, LOOK AT MY PENIS!  (  LAUGHTER  ) IT WAS THE THEME. IT WAS THE THEME OF THE MORNING. WHILE THE NEWS ABOUT LAUER IS SHOCKING, THERE WERE SOME HINTS, LIKE THIS 2012 INTERVIEW BETWEEN KATIE COURIC AND ANDY COHEN.
YOU COHOSTED THE "TODAY" SHOW WITH MATT LAUER FOR 15 YEARS. WHAT IS MATT'S MOST ANNOYING HABIT?
HMMM... HE PINCHES ME ON THE ASS A LOT.
Audience: OOOOH!
Stephen: WELL, THAT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS THEIR OLD REOCCURRING SEGMENT, "WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE MATT LAUER'S HANDS?" YOU  (  LAUGHTER  ) DONALD TRUMP WEIGHED IN ON THE LAUER STORY TWEETING, "WOW." WAIT A MINUTE, "WOW"? I'M STILL NOT USED TO A PRESIDENT TYPING THE WORD "WOW." THAT'S LIKE IF THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS WAS "HOLY GUACAMOLE, THIS WAR SUCKS." WOW. WOW.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BACK TO TRUMPS TWEET: "WOW, MATT LAUER JUST FIRED FROM NBC FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE.' BUT WHEN WILL THE TOP EXECUTIVES AT NBC AND COMCAST BE FIRED FOR PUTTING OUT SO MUCH FAKE NEWS." BY "FAKE NEWS" DO YOU MEAN, "MORE THAN A DOZEN WOMEN HAVE ACCUSED TRUMP OF IMPROPER CONDUCT OR SEXUAL ASSAULT."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY "FAKE NEWS?" LISTEN UP! YOU DON'T GET TO COMMENT! THAT IS THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE AT 3:00 A.M. AND ASKING WHAT SHE'S WEARING. PLUS, REMEMBER THE WHOLE BILLY BUSH BUS THING? TURNS OUT, IN PRIVATE, TRUMP'S TOLD MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIM ON THE TAPE AFTER ALL. AND "WE DON'T THINK THAT WAS MY VOICE." QUICK TIP: IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY CRAZY, DON'T REFER TO YOURSELF AS "WE." "ALL THE VOICES IN OUR HEAD TELL US THAT'S NOT OUR VOICE." WHAT'S THAT? YEAH, THEY AGREE WITH ME.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT? QUIET. THEY'RE SO LOUD. THEY'RE SO-- THEY REPEAT THEMSELVES, BUT, LORD, THEY'RE LOUD." BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. MAYBE IT WASN'T HIM
Stephen: WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT AGAIN, IT CAN'T BE HIM BECAUSE ANYBODY WHO SAID THAT WOULDN'T GET ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE'S GOT TO BE INNOCENT THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT.
Jon: WOW!
Stephen: CAN'T HAVE BOTH. AND I GUESS THIS CAN'T BE TRUMP, EITHER.
I SAID IT. I WAS WRONG, AND I APOLOGIZE.
Stephen: ADMITTING HE WAS WRONG AND APOLOGIZED IN THE SAME SENTENCE. THE ONLY WAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE UN-TRUMP IS IF HE SAID IT WHILE EATING A VEGETABLE.  (  LAUGHTER  ) NOT AN ONION RING. MEANWHILE, THERE'S AMAZING NEWS OUT OF A DIFFERENT CRUMBLING EMPIRE. BECAUSE WE JUST LEARNED THAT PRINCE HARRY GOT ENGAGED! I'M APLUTTER. AND WHO'S THE LUCKY BRIDE-TO-BE, SOME THIRD COUSIN FROM LUXEMBOURG WITH A PROMINENT JAW? NO, TURNS OUT IT'S ACTRESS MEGHAN MARKLE, KNOWN FOR HER 2011 BREAKTHROUGH ROLE AS AMBITIOUS PARALEGAL RACHEL ZANE IN THE HIT TV SERIES "SUITS," BUT WILL BE OFFICIALLY LEAVING AFTER SEASON SEVEN, FOLLOWING HER ENGAGEMENT NEWS. SEE A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM THAT. ONE, THERE'S APPARENTLY A SHOW CALLED "SUITS"? I SAW THE ADS, BUT I ASSUMED USA NETWORK JUST GOT BOUGHT BY MENS WEARHOUSE. AND, TWO, IT'S BEEN ON FOR SEVEN YEARS! AND MEGHAN MARKLE IS A BIRACIAL, DIVORCED AMERICAN, WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR THE GENE POOL OF THE ROYAL FAMILY. THEY ARE A LITTLE INBRED. MOST OF THEM HAVE TO BE PUT DOWN WITH CANINE HIP DYSPLASIA. NO IT'S SAD. IT'S VERY SAD. I AGREE. IT'S EXTREMELY SAD. THEY'RE PARTLY ROTWIELLER. BUT, ENGLAND, A WORD OF WARNING: WE HAD A COOL BIRACIAL LEADER FOR A WHILE, TOO. AND I CAN TELL YOU, YOU NEED TO SAVOR IT BECAUSE THE NEXT PRINCESS... IS GONNA SUCK.  (  LAUGHTER  )  ( APPLAUSE ) SUUUCK. SUCK. HERE ARE THE WEDDING DETAILS. IN MAY, PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE WILL MARRY AT ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR CASTLE. NOW TRADITIONALLY IT'S AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY, BUT IT WAS BOOKED FOR A HARRY-POTTER-THEMED BAR MITZVAH. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS HERE. BUT WHEN WE RETURN, I PONDER LIFE'S BIGGEST QUESTIONS WITH LIFE'S BIGGEST STAR. STICK AROUND.  ( BAND PLAYING )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: THAT I'VE GOT IN THE BOOK RIGHT NOW.
Jon: SO MUCH FUN.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO CLEANSE YOUR SOUL BEFORE THE COMING OF JESUS ON CHRISTMAS DAY. OR IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN JESUS, IT DOESN'T MATTER, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO CLEANSE. I HAVE SOME CONFESSIONS YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT, I TAKE SALAD BAR SNEEZE GUARDS AS A PERSONAL CHALLENGE. I CAN STILL NAME ALL FOUR OF THE TELETUBBIES, AND HAVE DONE SO IN MY WILL.
Jon: OH, WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
Stephen: BUY IT FOR SOMEONE YOU LOVE. BUY IT FOR SOMEONE YOU LOVE.
Jon: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
Stephen: NOT MY PROBLEM. LISTEN, FOLKS, I THINK YOU CAN TELL FROM THAT AND THE CONVERSATIONS I HAVE JON OUT HERE, JUST THE BASIC VIBE OF THE SHOW, BUT I'M A PRETTY DEEP GUY, WHICH IS WHY SOMETIMES I HAVE TO ASK LIFE'S BIG QUESTIONS, LIKE WHY AM I HERE? AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE? AND, "NEW PHONE, WHO DIS?" AND SOMETIMES I NEED TO EXPRESS THESE THOUGHTS, THOUGHTS THAT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY ANOTHER VERY DEEP A-LIST CELEBRITY.

Stephen: CAN I ASK YOU  REALLY, LIKE, REALLY PERSONAL QUESTION?
SURE, WHY NOT. I FEEL REALLY CLOSE TO YOU RIGHT NOW.  ( CHEERS ) WHEN YOU BROUGHT THE SEXY BACK, WHERE HAD IT GONE?
WOW. NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED ME THAT. SEXY WAS ACTUALLY JUST THE NAME OF MY NEIGHBOR'S RABBIT. YOU SEE, THEY WERE IN NEBRASKA FOR THE WEEKEND, AND I WAS PET SITTING, BUT THEY WERE WORRIED I WOULDN'T RETURN THE RABBIT, SO I WANTED TO ASSURE THEM, VIA SONG, THAT I WAS, INDEED, BRINGING SEXY BACK.

WELL, IT'S NOT GOING AS FAST AS IT SHOULD. WE STILL HAVE ABOUT 60% GENERATION. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, GENERATION IS NOT THAT PEOPLE HAVE POWER. BECAUSE ALL THE POWER IN THE ISLAND GETS GENERATE FROM THE SOUTHERN PART. AND THEN IT JUST GETS SENT AROUND THROUGH MOUNTAINS.

WELL, ABOUT 50% OF THE POPULATION STILL DOESN'T HAVE POWER. AND THE ONES THAT DO HAVE, IT'S VERY UNSTABLE.

AND A LOT OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE ELDERLY THAT LIVE IN BUILDINGS, I SAY THEY'VE BECOME HUMAN CAGES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HAVE THE WATER PUMPED UP. IN THE MIDDLE OF --
Stephen: IS THERE FRESH WATER?
WELL, ABOUT 90% HAVE WATER BUT WE'RE STILL UNDER A HEALTH ADVISORY, SO YOU EITHER HAVE TO FILTER THE WATER OR YOU HAVE TO BOIL THE WATER, BUT, OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T BOIL THE WATER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY. SO IT'S-- IT'S A TOUCH-AND-GO SITUATION STILL. AND THIS NEW "TAX" REFORM IS NOT GOING TO HELP US, EITHER, BECAUSE IT PUTS A 20% EXCISE TAX ON ALL OF THE IMPORTS THAT COME FROM PUERTO RICO INTO THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: BUT, WAIT, SO THERE'S A 20%--
20% INCREASE INCOME TAX FROM ALL OF THE IMPORTS THAT WILL COME FROM PUERTO RICO INTO THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: BUT PUERTO RICO IS THE UNITED STATES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ARE A TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE CITIZENS?
YES, SIR, SINCE 1917. AND I MEAN, MAYBE THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO SAY IT, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN UP TO THE STANDARDS THAT THIS COUNTRY DESERVES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THIS IS A SHOT-- THIS IS A SHOT OF YOU IN THE FLOODWATERS.
THAT WAS WATER WITH HUMAN EXCREMENT.
Stephen: IF IT. DOWN IN-- IS THIS IN SAN JUAN.
IN SAN JUAN, A PLACE CALLED OCEAN PARK.
Stephen: AND AT THIS TIME AND SINCE THEN-- ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS TIMEUE WERE CRYING OUT FOR HELP SAYING THE PEOPLE IN SAN JUAN IN PUERTO RICO WERE DYING AND YOU NEEDED MORE HELP. AND YOU GOT THIS RESPONSE FROM THE PRESIDENT, "MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, WHO WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, HAS NOW BEEN TOLD BY THE DEMOCRATS THAT YOU MUST BE NEWSCAST TOW TRUMP." AND HERE IS-- THIS WAS YOUR--
THAT WAS MY REPLY.
Stephen: THIS WAS YOUR REPLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT-- I HAVE-- I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, IF I MAY. JUST A LITTLE REPLY WITH A TWIST. YOU GET YOUR OWN NASTY SHIRT WITH A LITTLE PUERTO RICAN TWIST IN IT. THIS IS JUST FOR YOU.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.
Stephen: THANK YOU. ARE THESE AVAILABLE, OR, LIKE--
WE-- WE STARTED-- THAT'S THE FIRST ONE WE MADE. WE STARTED A FOUNDATION BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE-- AND, AGAIN, I DON'T MEAN TO BE HARSH, BUT THERE'S A STARK CONTRAST BETWEEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEIR HUGE HEART AND YOU HAVE POURED YOURSELF OUT IN SUPPORT TO US, AND HOW YOU OFTEN ASK-- YOU'VE DONE IT ON YOUR SHOW SO MANY TIMES. AND THOSE THAT CAN SEE YOU-- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE ELECTRICITY-- ARE REALLY COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE VOICES THAT HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN US, AND FOR THAT I WANT TO BE VERY GREATFUL TO YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE STARTED THIS FOUNDATION, THE FOUNDATION IS CALLED "SOMEBODY HELP US. SOMEBODYHELPUS.ORG. YOU CAN SEND THERE IF YOU WANT. I GOT $20 BILLS FROM PEOPLE IN TEXAS. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SUCH BIG HEART, AND THE CONTRAST WITH THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT THAT HAS SUCH A BIG MOUTH.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOW, HOW MANY-- HOW CAN PEOPLE-- HOW CAN PEOPLE OUT THERE CONTINUE TO HELP RIGHT NOW? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN KEEP US IN YOUR THOUGHTS. WHENEVER YOU SEE SOMETHING FOR PUERTO RICO, RETWEET IT, OR PUT IT ON FACEBOOK. SECONDLY, YOU CAN DONATE TO THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. THEY'RE DOING THIS WHOLE THING WITH OPERATION BLESSING, CLARITY FILTERS. IF YOU DONATE, YOU GET A CLARITY FILTER, MADE BY KHOLLER, TO A FAMILY IN PUERTO RICO SO THEY CAN HAVE CLEAN WATER. YOU CAN DONATE TO THE UNIONS, THE A.F.L.-C.I.O., TOOK 320 WORKERS AND THEY STAYED IN PUERTO RICO FOR TWO WEEKS, HELPING SAN JUAN, 42 COMMUNITIES. OR YOU CAN GO TO SOMEBODYHELPUS.ORG, AND MAKE A SMALL CONTRIBUTION. DOESN'T MATTER. YOU PEOPLE, AGAIN, I HAVE TO THANK YOU, BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER LEFT US ALONE, AND I HOPI NEVER FORGET US BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US, BUT-- CAN YOU SAY "DAMN IT" ON TV?
Stephen: SURE.
SO, DAMN IT, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
