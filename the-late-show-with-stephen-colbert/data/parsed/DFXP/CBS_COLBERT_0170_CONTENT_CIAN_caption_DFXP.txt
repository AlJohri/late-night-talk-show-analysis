WOW.
WHAT YOU READING?
Stephen: THE INTERNET.
OH, I READ THAT, IT'S GOOD.
Stephen: IT SAYS RESEARCHERS AT M.I.T. TAUGHT A COMPUTER TO WATCH TWO PEOPLE ON TV AND PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO KISS.
HEY, WE'RE ON TV. IS YOUR COMPUTER WATCHING US?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. BUT WHO I KISS IS NONE OF MY COMPUTER'S BUSINESS. ( LAUGHTER ) OOOH. GIVE ME A KISS.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES SAMUEL L. JACKSON. JULIE KLAUSNER. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY SCHOOLBOY Q. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH! GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU, CHRIS. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS. I LIKE IT. PLEASE, PLEASE, COME ON. YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS. YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I AM YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN MONTHS LEFT IN THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY. YOU NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE GOING TO MISS A GUY UNTIL YOU SEE THE OPTIONS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT BARACK OBAMA WILL DO AFTER HE'S PRESIDENT. THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION. I READ TODAY THAT HE IS THINKING ABOUT BECOMING A VENTURE CAPITALIST IN SILICON VALLEY. OBAMA'S A PERFECT FIT FOR SILICON VALLEY. HE'S A NERD WHO GOT WAY MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL EVER IMAGINED. SO, EVIDENTLY, OBAMA IS GOING TO BE GOING FOR THE CASH. GOOD FOR HIM. BUT HE MAY HAVE TO MAKE A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO HIS POSTER FROM "CHANGE" TO "KA-CHING!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHY NOT? NOW, COMPARE OBAMA'S POST- PRESIDENTIAL PLANS TO JIMMY CARTER, WHO FAMOUSLY TOOK A LOW-PAYING CONSTRUCTION JOB. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE STILL MAKING THAT MAN WORK. HE'S 91 YEARS OLD! LET HIM RETIRE, POOR PEOPLE. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, SO SELFISH. LISTEN, HEY, THAT'S NOT ME. THAT'S JIMMY CARTER THEY'RE ABUSING. OF COURSE, WITH OBAMA ON THE WAY OUT, BY LAW, SOMEONE ELSE HAS TO MOVE IN TO THE THE WHITE HOUSE. AND IT COULD BE PRESIDENT TRUMP. ( AUDIENCE BOOING )
Stephen: MAKES ME EXCITED, TOO. TRUMP IS MAKING A REAL EFFORT TO APPEAR MORE PRESIDENTIAL THESE DAYS. YESTERDAY, HE WENT TO A PENNSYLVANIA RECYCLING PLANT WHERE HE UNVEILED PART OF HIS ECONOMIC PLATFORM. AND INSTEAD OF WEARING HIS TRADEMARK BASEBALL CAP, HE STOOD IN FRONT OF A GIANT PILE OF GARBAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE PLAN. HE'S GOING TO REVIVE THE ECONOMY BY TURNING IN EMPTIES FOR THE REFUND. ( LAUGHTER ) IN MICHIGAN, WHERE IT'S 10 CENT. MICHIGAN FANS HERE. OR RECYCLING FANS. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, IN THE WAKE OF BRITAIN'S EXIT FROM THE E.U.-- THE BREXIT-- TRUMP OUTLINED HIS PLAN FOR A TRUMP EXIT, OR TREXIT.
NUMBER ONE, I AM GOING TO WITHDRAW THE UNITED STRAIGHTS FROM THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.
Stephen: HOLD ON, HOLD ON ( LAUGHTER ) DID I-- DID HE JUST SAY "UNITED STRAIGHTS?"
Jon: YES, HE DID. WELL, YOU HEARD HIM, STRAIGHT PEOPLE. TRUMP IS NOW DEMANDING A HETEROSEXIT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) ♪ ♪ ♪ THAT'S ME. BYE, BYE! OF COURSE, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS HAD MONEY PROBLEMS LATELY. HE STARTED JUNE WITH AN ALARMINGLY LOW $1.3 MILLION. DID YOU REALLY JUST GO AAH! THE MAN SAYS HE HAS $10 MILLION AND YOU GO AAW. YOU ARE THE NICEST PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO VOTE. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN RESPONSE TO THESE LOW NUMBERS HAVE AMPED UP THEIR FUNDRAISING, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY HAVE GONE OVERBOARD-- AND OVERSEAS. BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT HAVE BEEN GETTING REPEATED E-MAILS FROM TRUMP ASKING FOR MONEY. OOH... JUST FIVE DAYS TOO LATE. AND THE BRITISH MPs ARE NOT HAPPY TO RECEIVE THESE E-MAILS. NATALIE McGARRY, A SCOTTISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, WROTE TRUMP BACK, SAYING: ( PRIM ACCENT ) "QUITE WHY YOU THINK IT APPROPRIATE TO WRITE. E-MAILS TO U.K. PARLIAMENTARIANS WITH A BEGGING BOWL FOR YOUR... REPUGNANT CAMPAIGN IS COMPLETELY BEYOND ME." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN SHE WHIPPED OUT HER WAND AND CRIED, "EXPECTO GO-BITE-ME!" NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE COMPLAINING. BECAUSE I'VE GOT ONE OF TRUMP'S SPAM EMAILS RIGHT HERE. "HELLO, SEX FRIEND, LOOKING TO MAKE AMERICA COUNTRY AGAIN GREAT. PURR WITH DELIGHT. MAKE LADY AMERICA GO WOW, WOW, WOW, BIG TIME! CITIZEN ENJOY LOVELIEST PRESIDENT. PLEASE DONATE WITH PLEASURE. TRUMP 2016. BIG HUGE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) YOU KNOW, IF TRUMP WANTS TO HIT THE BRITS UP FOR MONEY, HE SHOULD TRY THE QUEEN BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT QUEEN ELIZABETH COULD BE GETTING A HUGE RAISE NEXT YEAR. AND SHE NEEDS IT TO KEEP UP HER EXPENSIVE LIFESTYLE. I MEAN, SOMEONE'S GOT TO PAY FOR ALL THOSE CORGIS SHE EATS. OH, SO DELICIOUS. SO DELICIOUS. IT'S LIKE A TWO-BITE BROWNIE BUT WITH MEAT. AMAZING. INCREDIBLE. SO WELL MARBLED. APPARENTLY, THE QUEEN IS EXPECTED TO EARN 45.6 MILLION POUNDS NEXT YEAR. AND IF YOU ASK ME, SHE'S EARNED EVERY FARTHING. I MEAN, JUST LOOK HOW HARD SHE WORKS. ♪ ♪ ♪ SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY SO HARD FOR THE MONEY ♪ SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY SO HARD FOR THE MONEY ♪ SHE WORKS HARD FOR THE MONEY SO YOU BETTER TREAT HER RIGHT ♪

Stephen: OH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! GET IT! GET IT! YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT TONIGHT! FOLKS, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS. BUT I WANT TO BE UP FRONT AND SAY THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW SO IT'S FAKE BAD NEWS. BECAUSE THERE IS ACTUAL BAD NEWS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. AND ALL OF OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AND OUR GOOD WISHES GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD AT THE HANDS OF TERRORISM. THIS TIME, IT'S ISTANBUL. AND IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THIS HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND JUST AN ASIDE, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING TO ALL THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE. IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO SHOW US PHOTOGRAPHS OR ROLLING VIDEO OF A TERRORIST EXPLODING? THAT REALLY SEEMS LIKE ADVERTISING FOR SOMEONE'S CAUSE IN A WAY THAT THEY MAY LIKE. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO SEE THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ) MEANWHILE, IN THE WORLD OF FAKE TRAGEDY, EVIDENTLY, THE EARTH IS RUNNING OUT OF HELIUM. IT'S A NON-RENEWABLE GAS USED IN ROCKET ENGINES, SEMICONDUCTORS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IN BACHLORETTE PARTY PENIS BALLOONS. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE BEEN TOLD. I WOULDN'T KNOW. THE SHORTAGE IS SO DIRE THAT MANY OF THOSE PENIS BALLOONS CAN ONLY BE INFLATED TO HALF-MAST. IT'S SAD. FORTUNATELY, WE MAY HAVE A SOLUTION BECAUSE A HUGE HELIUM GAS FIELD HAS BEEN FOUND IN TANZANIA. GEOLOGISTS WERE CONFIDENT THEY HAD FOUND A NEW HELIUM RESERVE WHEN THEY SAW THE SPOT MARKED "TO A GRAD WHO'S OUT OF THIS WORLD." JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS THIS AMAZING DISCOVERY, WE ARE JOINED LIVE VIA SATELLITE I BELIEVE BY TWO SCIENTISTS AT THE HELIUM SITE OVER IN TANZANIA. THE TWO SCIENTISTS ARE DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL RESEARCH AT M.I.T. DR. GERALD REINHARDT. AMD DISTINGUISHED CHAIR OF EARTH SCIENCES AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY, DR. REBECCA TAVAGE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. DOCTORS.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. ( HIGH-PITCHED VOICE )
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE.
Stephen: TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT THE TWO OF YOU OVER IN TANZANIA HAVE DISCOVERED AT THE SITE.
WELL, IN JUST ONE SECTION OF TANZANIA'S EAST AFRICAN RIFT VALLEY, WE'VE FOUND 54 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF HELIUM.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS A BUTTLOAD OF HELIUM. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THIS IS VERY FASCINATING DISCOVERY. THIS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE WE WERE DUE TO RUN OUT OF HELIUM IN JUST 20 YEARS, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.
ABSOLUTELY, STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT IS NOTHING TO JOKE ABOUT.
YOU SEE, HELIUM IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT IN THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER AND M.R.I. MACHINES, SO THIS FIND WILL-- EXCUSE ME. I DROPPED SOMETHING. -- BRING RELIEF TO MILLIONS OF GRAVELY ILL PATIENTS WHO DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OKAY, YES. CAN YOU ADD TO THAT DOCTOR.
STEPHEN, I'VE GOT TO TIE MY SHOES.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T WANT TO FALL OVER THERE. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ON SOME HILLS. YOU MIGHT TUMBLE DOWN THE HILLS THERE.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING THIS SO SERIOUSLY. THE ENTIRE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY IS UNIFIED IN SAYING WHEEEEEE!
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME, BOTH OF YOU OVER THERE IN TANZANIA. I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY, DISTINGUISHED SCIENTISTS.
OUR PLEASURE STEPHEN! YAY! BYE!
Stephen: THEY'RE DOING GREAT WORK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SAMUEL L. JACKSON. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR WHO IS NOW INTERNATIONALLY SUPER-STARRING IN "THE LEGEND OF TARZAN."
I FEEL FOOLISH FOR ASKING, BUT YOU CAN REALLY TALK TO THE ANIMALS?
YOU'RE AN EDUCATED MAN, DR. WILLIAMS. YOU TELL ME.

Stephen: NOW, WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND-- NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THAT'S A NICE JACKET. I WAS WONDERING WHY YOU WERE UT HERE WITH WHERE YOU WITH YOUR JACKET OFF.
SHOWING OFF, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: HOW DOES ONE GET A PORTRAIT OF THEMSELVES INSIDE THEIR OWN SUIT? BECAUSE I'VE JUST GOT MORE LINING ON THED IN OF MINE.
THE TAILOR SAID, "SO WHAT DO YOU WANT IN THE LINING?" I SAID, "ME." AND HE'S LIKE, "I GOT THAT." AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE LIKE PUT, "SAM, SAM, SAM," ON A PIECE OF THING BUT HE LAID IT OUT.
Stephen: THAT'S ALL YOU. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU JUST GOT A B.E.T. LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD.
YES, I DID. ( APPLAUSE )

ACTUALLY, SOMEBODY TOLD ME IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE 165 AND SO I HAVE TO DO AT LEAST 35 MORE MOVIES TO GET TO 200.
Stephen: YOU ARE AT 165?
YES.
Stephen: WOW. JESSE WILLIAMS ALSO GAVE A SPEECH AT THIS THING.
WHOA!
Stephen: IT WAS AN AMAZING SPEECH. I SAW YOU STANDING AND CLAPPING. WHAT DID THAT SPEECH MEAN TO YOU?
IT WAS-- IT WAS THE MOST UNADULTERATED ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR WORLD, AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT-- LIKE, I USED TO HEAR PEOPLE SPEAK IN THE 60s. I WAS AROUND EYE COULD HEAR STOKEY CARMICHAEL AND RAP BROWN. I HEARD PEOPLE TALK. AND IT WAS THE FIRST SPEECH THEY HEARD IN A VERY LONG TIME OF THAT NOT A SPEECH THAT SAID LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. BUT LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. IT WAS A CALL TO ACTION.
Stephen: DID IT INSPIRE YOU?
IT WAS AWESOME.
Stephen: YOU WERE VERY POLITICALLY ACTIVE WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER?
A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: ARE YOU SUPPORTING ANYBODY THIS TIME AROUND?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
Stephen: FOR PRESIDENT. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE LIKE BERNIE IS NICE BUT YOU DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD MAKE IT. YOU WERE HEADING FOR THE HILLSES.
I'M THERE. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO. I'M THERE. PLEASE, DON'T THINK-- DON'T THINK THE OTHER THING CAN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHY THE BREXIT IS TRYING TO GET A RECALL RIGHT NOW.  ( APPLAUSE ) WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A DO-OVER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A DO-OVER.
Stephen: ANOTHER SO 165. YOU HAVE TO DO 35 MORE TO GET TO 200.
AND 100 MORE TO GET TO THREE.
Stephen, OF COURSE. ARE YOU EVER GOING TO SLOW DOWN? YOU DO, LIKE, FOUR MOVIES A YEAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
FOUR, FIVE, YEAH.
Stephen: HOW MANY DAYS ARE YOU OUT ON THE ROAD IN THE WORLD?
I'M NOT SURE. A LOT I'M OUT MORE THAN I'M IN AT HOME.
Stephen: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WHERE IN THE WORLD IS SAMUEL L. JACKSON?
I FLEW TO L.A. FRIDAY, FROM BULGARIA TO START "TARZAN" PRESS. I'M GOING TO START MY VACATION ON FRIDAY, CUT IT SHORT ON THE SIXTH, AND GO TO AMSTERDAM AND FINISH SHOOTING THE MOVIE. "THE HIT MAN'S BODY GUARD" WITH RYAN REYNOLDS, AND I CAN GO BACK ON VACATION AT THE END OF THE MONTH.
Stephen: YOU WERE JUST IN VIETNAM FOR KONG, RIGHT.
SKULL ISLAND.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THIS WAS THE RIDE YOU GOT TO WORK.
THAT WAS THE RIDE TO WORK. THESE LADIES, WE HAD TO GO THROUGH SOME CAVES, A SYSTEM OF CAVES, AND THEY ROW YOU THROUGH THE CAVES. SOME OF THEM ROW YOU THIS WAY, AND SOME OF THEM LAY BACK AND ROW YOU THIS WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT-- IT'S AWESOME!
Stephen: DID THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS AT ALL THAT THAT WAS YOUR RIDE TO WORK THROUGH CAVES?
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A WHILE. THEY KNOW THE ROUTE. IT'S COOL. IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOING TO WORK HERE IN NEW YORK. THERE ARE PEOPLE GOING THE OTHER WAY. THERE ARE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE JUNGLE THE OTHER WAY AND THEY'RE SAYING, "GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING." IT'S LIKE A REGULAR COMMUTE FOR A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU DIE A LOT IN MOVIES.
I HAVE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE DIED IN QUITE A FEW MOVIES. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE WAY YOU'VE DIED IN A MOVIE?
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE "DEEP BLUE SEA."
Stephen: CAN I TELL YOU, THAT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIE DEATHS OF ALL TIME. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE KEEP THIS CLIP ON HAND ALL THE TIME. JIMMY?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT ANYMORE! WE'RE GOING TO PULL TOGETHER, AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO GET OUT OF HERE! FIRST, WE'RE GOING TO SEAL OFF THIS-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT'S THE GREATEST DEATH OF ALL TIME. GREATEST DEATH OF ALL TIME.
IT'S PERFECT, TOO, BECAUSE IT'S SHARK WEEK, RIGHT.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
IT'S SHARK WEEK. THAT'S GOOD. AND THAT WAS THE CUE TO EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE MOVIE, ANYBODY CAN DIE. BECAUSE WE JUST KILLED THE GUY WHO MADE THE MOST MONEY.
Stephen: I ASSUME YOU DO YOUR OWN STUNTS.
I DID THAT TIME, YEAH.
Stephen: EXCELLENT WORK.
ONE OF THE LAST STUNT I EVER DID. I HATE TO DEPRIVE MY STUNT MAN OF ANY ACTIVITY THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO SHINE.
Stephen: IN "THE LEGEND OF TARZAN," OBVIOUSLY, TARZAN IS NOT A REAL GUY, BUT YOU ACTUALLY PLAY A CHARACTER THAT IS BASED ON A REAL PERSON I UNDERSTAND.
GEORGE WASHINGTON WILLIAMS.
Stephen: WHO WAS THIS MAN?
WHEEFS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO GO INTO THE CONGO AND EXPOSE WHAT KING LEOPOLD WAS DOING IN TERMS OF ENSLAVING THOSE PEOPLE AND CREATING THE FIRST AFRICAN HOLOCAUST THAT TOOK PLACE. HE KILLED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AFRICANS EXACTING RUBBER, DIAMONDS, AND IVORY OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: SO THIS GUY WENT OVER THERE TO EXPOSE-- HE WAS AN AMERICAN?
HE WAS AN AMERICAN. AND HE FALSIFIED HIS CREDENTIALS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET PLACES. AND HE TOLD THOSE PEOPLE IN EUROPE HE WAS THE ENVOY FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND THERE BEING NO INTERNET AND NO REAL FAST MAIL, THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD CHECK THAT.
Stephen: IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOUR CHARACTER FROM "THE HATEFUL 8."
AND HE WORKED HIMSELFS INTO THE CONGO SO HE COULD DO THAT, AND HE WROTE LETTERS TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS. KING LEOPOLD, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS EXTRACTING ALL THOSE RICHES HE RAN OUT OF MONEY BUILDING THE RAILROAD SO HE STARTED BORROWING MONEY FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS. GEORGE WASHINGTON WILLIAMS WAS WRITING LETTERS TO VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS TELLING THEM WHAT HE WAS DOING AND TO STOP SUPPORTING HIM AND, OF COURSE, THE UNITED STATES WAS ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT KING LEOPOLD AND HE WAS TRYING TO STOP THEM FROM DOING IT ALSO.
Stephen: IN THAT SCENE, ARE YOU ACTUALLY IN AFRICA IN THOSE SHOTS?
WE'RE IN A BEAUTIFUL, AIR CONDITIONED BUG-FREE STUDIO IN LONDON.
Stephen: THAT SHOT RIGHT THERE WASN'T ANYWHERE ON THE AFRICAN BELT?
WE DIDN'T TOUCH AFRICA. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HOW MUCH OF YOUR WORK THESE DAYS IS IN A GREEN ROOM, LIKE, LOOKING AT A BROOM WITH PING-PONG BALLS GLUED TO IT?
I WOULD SAY, I DON'T KNOW, EACH MOVIE HAS A BIT OF IT BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS. BUT NO MORE THAN-- A THIRD. THIS MOVIE JUST HAPPENED TO BE ON THE LOT FOR SOME REASON. THEY-- THEY FELT LIKE THEY COULD CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENT BETTER.
Stephen: KEEP THE GORILLAS INSIDE.
THE GUYS IN THE GREEN SUITS THAT LOOKED LIKE GORILLAS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN TO AFRICA YOURSELF?
I HAVE.
Stephen: SAFARIS?
I HAVE SPENT A NIGHT AT A GAME PRESERVE.
Stephen: DOES THAT FREAK YOU OUT?
JUST THE NOISES AT NIGHT. WE DIDN'T LIVE ON A CAT RESERVE. SEE, THAT'S WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO WALK AROUND WITH GUYS WITH GUNS BECAUSE CATS ARE OUT AT NIGHT HUNTING. THEY DON'T HUNT DURING THE DAY WHEN IT'S HOT. THEY WAIT UNTIL IT'S COOL AT NIGHT.
Stephen: I WENT A FEW YEARS AGO AND MY BOYS GOT OW OF THE JEEP AT ONE POINT TAKE AND WE WERE TAKE A BREAK AND THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND THE JEEP AND I WAS RUNNING AFTER THEM AND OUR GUIDE STOPPED US AND SAID, "DON'T RUN. WHEN YOU RUN, YOU ARE FOOD." ( LAUGHTER )
YEAH.
Stephen: SO WE GOT BACK IN THE EXPWREEP WE DIDN'T GET BACK OUT OF THAT JEEP AGAIN ALL DAY LONG.
EVEN THEN, WHEN WE WERE OUT, WE SAW A LOT OF THINGS, BUT MY DAUGHTER WAS LIKE, "WHERE ARE THE ELEPHANTS? I WANT TO SEE AN ELEPHANT." WE WERE COMING BACK AT NIGHT AND SHE ROLLTHE WINDOW DOWN AND STARTING GOING... AND OUT OF NOWHERE, THIS HUGE ELEPHANT JUST COMES RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. AND WE WERE ALL LIKE OH, NO, NO, NO!
Stephen: HE THINKS YOU STOLE HIS BABY!
YEAH. AND THE GUY'S LIKE, "THAT WAS VERY GOOD. YOU GOT THE ELEPHANT TO COME. BUT STAY MET TRUCK."
Stephen: "DON'T DO THAT AGAIN."
DON'T GET OUT OF THE TRUCK.

IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS IN THE 20th SEARCHRY. I WAS AN INTERN. I WAS SUCH A FAN OF THE SHOW.

I TRIED AND I TRIED. AND WHAT WAS A GIRL TO DO? IT WAS ALSO THE EARLY DAYS-- OH, WHAT'S THIS "HAMILTON" SHOW. PERHAPS I CAN GO ON STUBHUB. AND I THOUGHT I HAVEN'T USED CRAIGSLIST FOREVER. WE HAD THIS GUY MEET UP WITH US, AND HE GAVE US THESE TICKETS AND THEY LOOKED LEGITIMATE. AND I SHOWED UP AT THE THEATER AND THE USHER SCANNED THEM AND SAID, "THESE TICKETS ARE FRAUDULENT."

Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE A PODCAST ABOUT POP CULTURE. AND YOU MIGHT BE A PERSON TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE NOW. IS THERE A POP CULTURE ANYMORE, A THING THAT EVERYONE AGREES IS THE POP CULTURE RIGHT NOW, OR ARE WE ALL JUST TOO BALKANIZED TO RECOGNIZE A SINGLE POP CULTURAL MOMENT?
I THINK IT'S VERY SEGMENTED. I NEVER FELT A BIGGER DIVIDE FROM PEOPLE LIKE FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN I AM. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE KIDS TODAY HAVE THEIR OWN CELEBRITIES BECAUSE OF INSTAGRAM OR SNAPCHAT, WHICH I TRIED FOR AN HOUR TO FIGURE OUT ON SUNDAY AND I ENDED UP THROWING MY PHONE IN A FISH TANK, AND I DON'T EVEN KEEP FISH. SO I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY MORE, AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT SORT OF FIND EACH OTHER AND THE WEIRD STUFF CAN THRIVE A LITTLE MORE EASILY. IS THERE A POP CULTURE? I CERTAINLY HOPE FOR-- I CERTAINLY HOPE SO FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF KIDS LIKE ME THAT GREW UP WATCHING MORE FILM AND TV THAN THEY DID SOCIALIZING WITH THEIR PEERS IN A HEALTHY WAY.
Stephen: OH, SO IN OTHER WORDS THE DISTANCE YOU PUT BETWEEN YOURSELF AND OTHER HUMAN BEINGS IS WHAT LEADS YOU NOW TO BE A CREATIVE ARTIST, BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO LIFE WITH HUMANS? ( LAUGHTER ).
