Stephen: GOOD EVENING. THANKS FOR JOINING US. OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW. BUT IT'S ONE THAT TALKS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. AND TODAY, THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION IS ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS IN LAS VEGAS, AND JOKES AREN'T APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS THE SHOCK AND GRIEF AND ANGER WE FEEL. BUT I DO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE WE BEGIN THE SHOW: ONCE AGAIN, WE WANT TO SEND OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND EVERYONE WHO WAS HURT BY THIS UNIMAGINABLE CRUELTY. NOW, TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE WORLD. SOMETIMES, LIKE TODAY, WE FEEL THAT THEY'VE RISEN TO A NEW LEVEL. BUT WE CAN'T ACCEPT THAT AS A NEW NORMAL. TODAY, THE PRESIDENT CALLED THIS AN "ACT OF PURE EVIL." AND I THINK HE'S RIGHT. SO, WHAT, THEN, ARE WE WILLING TO DO TO COMBAT "PURE EVIL?" THE ANSWER CAN'T BE NOTHING. IT CAN'T. THIS TIME, IT WAS A CONCERT IN LAS VEGAS. LAST TIME, IT WAS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN AND THEIR STAFF UNDER FIRE ON A BALL FIELD. LAST WEEK, REP. STEVE SCALISE RETURNED TO THE FLOOR AND WAS GREETED WITH A BIPARTISAN, HERO'S WELCOME. IT WAS THE KIND OF MOMENT THAT GIVES HOPE THAT CONGRESS MIGHT WORK TOGETHER FOR THE COMMON GOOD. AND THE BAR IS SO LOW THAT CONGRESS CAN BE HEROES BY DOING LITERALLY ANYTHING. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS OR COME UP WITH A BETTER ANSWER. ENFORCE OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT DENIED THE MENTALLY ILL GUN PURCHASES. OR A BETTER ANSWER, RE-INSTATE THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BAN. OR COME UP WITH A BETTER ANSWER. ANYTHING BUT NOTHING. DOING NOTHING IS COWARDICE. DOING SOMETHING WILL TAKE COURAGE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT TOOK COURAGE FOR THE PEOPLE AT THAT CONCERT LAST NIGHT TO HELP EACH OTHER AS BULLETS FLEW AND COURAGE FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO RUSH IN AND DO THEIR JOBS. IT TOOK COURAGE FOR PEOPLE IN LAS VEGAS SIMPLY TO GO ABOUT THEIR DAY TODAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP-- YOU'VE SAID YOU WANT TO BE A TRANSFORMATIVE PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE WAY THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DONE IN WASHINGTON. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT. I MEAN THIS SINCERELY -- YOU DON'T OWE THE REPUBLICANS ANYTHING. YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICANS TRIED TO STOP YOU FROM BEING PRESIDENT. SCREW 'EM. WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? DO SOMETHING THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO. PASS ANY KIND OF COMMON SENSE GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WANT. BECAUSE IF WE ARE FACING PURE EVIL, THEN BY ALL MEANS OFFER THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND PRAY FOR THE COURAGE TO DO IT. JON?
Announcer: IT'S "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! TONIGHT, TRUMP DUMPS ON PUERTO RICO. PLUS STEPHEN WELCOMES PIERCE BROSNAN, JASON ALEXANDER AND TA-NEHISI COATES, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." AND NOW LIVE ON TAPE FROM THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WHOO! THANK YOU SO MUCH! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NEARLY UNLIMITED POWER TO WAGE WAR AT HIS FINGERTIPS, AND THAT'S JUST TWITTER. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS WEEKEND, HE LAUNCHED AN ASYMMETRICAL TWEET ASSAULT AGAINST THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO, CARMEN YULIN CRUZ. HERE'S HOW IT STARTED: IN RESPONSE ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S RELIEF EFFORTS, ON THURSDAY, ACTING SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, AND LIBRARIAN ON THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE, ELAINE DUKE SAID THIS:
I AM VERY SATISFIED. I KNOW IT'S A HARD STORM TO RECOVER FROM, BUT THE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE, AND I REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE ANY SUPPORT THAT WE GET. I KNOW IT IS REALLY A GOOD NEWS STORY IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO REACH PEOPLE AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF DEATHS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN SUCH A DEVASTATING HURRICANE.
STEPHEN: YOU KNOW YOU WORK FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHEN ONE OF THE WORST DISASTERS IN HISTORY SEEMS LIKE A GOOD NEWS STORY TO YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO BE POSITIVE HERE, BUT THE GLASS IS NOT REALLY HALF-FULL. OR IF IT IS, THAT'S NOT WATER. DON'T DRINK IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WHAT SAY YOU, MAYOR CRUZ?
DAMN IT, THIS IS NOT A GOOD NEWS STORY. THIS IS A "PEOPLE ARE DYING" STORY. THIS IS A "LIFE OR DEATH" STORY. THIS IS "THERE'S A TRUCKLOAD OF STUFF THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN TO PEOPLE" STORY. THIS IS A STORY OF A DEVASTATION THAT CONTINUES TO WORSEN.
STEPHEN: OKAY, THAT'S A LEADER STANDING UP FOR THE NEEDS OF HER CONSTITUENTS WITH A STATEMENT THAT DOESN'T MENTION DONALD TRUMP, SO I'M HAPPY TO SAY HE TOOK THE HIGH ROAD AND LET IT GO. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M JUST KIDDING. HE TOOK IT VERY PERSONALLY: "THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, WHO WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, HAS NOW BEEN TOLD BY THE DEMOCRATS THAT YOU MUST BE NASTY TO TRUMP." OKAY, KEEP IN MIND, 95% OF THE PEOPLE THERE REMAIN WITHOUT POWER AND ONLY 11% OF PUERTO RICO HAS CELL SERVICE. SO, TO DELIVER THEIR MESSAGE TO SAN JUAN'S MAYOR, THE DEMOCRATS MUST HAVE USED SKYWRITING. ( LAUGHTER ) VERY CREATIVE. VERY CREATIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FREE DOROTHY! ( PIANO RIFF ) AND THAT FIRST TWEET WAS JUST THE TIP OF THE DOUCHE-BERG. BECAUSE HE SENT OUT 20 TWEETS ABOUT PUERTO RICO THIS WEEKEND. HE CONTINUED: "DOT, DOT, DOT SUCH POOR LEADERSHIP ABILITY BY THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, AND OTHERS IN PUERTO RICO, WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THEIR WORKERS TO HELP. THEY DOT, DOT, DOT, DOT" "DOT, DOT, DOT WANT EVERYTHING TO BE DONE FOR THEM WHEN IT SHOULD BE A COMMUNITY EFFORT." YES, TRUMP IS BLAMING THE VICTIM. "I LIKE ISLANDS THAT WEREN'T HIT BY A HURRICANE." ( LAUGHTER ) "OKAY? THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. YES ." ( PIANO RIFF ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S SAYING -- OE'S COMPLAINING THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE FOR THEM. KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS A MAN WHO LITERALLY HAS A BUTTON ON HIS DESK THAT HE PUSHES AND A BUTLER BRINGS HIM A COKE! ( PIANO RIFF ) TRUMP ALSO TOOK THIS SHOT AT PUERTO RICO ON FRIDAY.
ULTIMATELY, THE GOVERNMENT OF PUERTO RICO WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH US TO DETERMINE HOW THIS MASSIVE REBUILDING EFFORT, WHICH WILL END UP BEING THE BIGGEST EVER, WILL BE FUNDED AND ORGANIZED, AND WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXISTING DEBT ALREADY ON THE ISLAND.
STEPHEN: WHAT? ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) YOUR NEIGHBOR IS DROWNING AND INSTEAD OF THROWING HIM A LIFE JACKET, YOU'RE SAYING, "IN A SECOND. FIRST, LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE HEDGE CLIPPERS YOU BORROWED." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU COULD ALSO LOSE A FEW POUNDS. TRUMP REITERATED AGAIN ON FRIDAY WHY BRINGING RELIEF TO PUERTO RICO IS SUCH A HARD JOB.
THIS IS AN ISLAND. SURROUNDED BY WATER. BIG WATER, OCEAN WATER. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE, I GUESS. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT? HE SOUNDS LIKE A FOURTH GRADER WHO'S NOT PREPARED FOR HIS BOOK REPORT. ( LAUGHTER ) "I GOTTA SAY, TREASURE ISLAND IS AN ISLAND SURROUND BID WATER, BIG WATER, OCEAN WATER AND ALSO TREASURE ISLAND HAS TREASURE. IT HAS BIG TREASURE, SHINY TREASURE. I'M GOING TO GUESS THE TREASURE'S WET, WITH THE WATER AND ALL. OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. LONG JOHN SILVER IS THERE AND HE BROUGHT THE BATTER FRIED COD AND WE DID THE TREASURE MAP ON THE BACK OF THE PLACE MAP AND FOUND THE TREASURE IN THE BACK OF THE CAVE WHERE WE SAVED BECKY FROM INJUN JOE. HOW MUCH MORE TIME DO I HAVE?" ( APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) "IT'S A VERY GOOD BOOK. I LIKE THE BOOK. I DIDN'T FINISH READING IT. I SAVED SOME OF IT FOR LATER BECAUSE I LOVE READING SO MUCH." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT DESPITE HOW CHALLENGING THIS IS, TRUMP HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY WHAT NO ONE IS THINKING: "WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION IN PUERTO RICO. OUTSIDE OF THE FAKE NEWS OR POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INGRATES." YEAH, PUERTO RICO, SHOW SOME GRATITUDE WHILE YOU'RE WADING THROUGH SEWAGE. "PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR RICARDO ROSSELLO JUST STATED: 'THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRESIDENT, EVERY TIME WE'VE SPOKEN, THEY'VE DELIVERED.'" SEE, HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. IT'S LIKE IF NERO HAD TWEETED 2,000 YEARS AGO: "ROME BURNING. DEVASTATION. GETTING A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON MY FIDDLING. #MRGA!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) #MRGA!" ( PIANO RIFF ) OH, ONE THING I FORGET TO MENTION, HE DID ALL THIS TWEETING FROM HIS GOLF COURSE. AND, ON SUNDAY, HE DID SOMETHING SPONTANEOUS AND UNEXPECTED FOR HURRICANE VICTIMS:
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS, AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF-- IF YOU LOOK TODAY AND SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING, HOW HORRIBLE IT IS BUT WE HAVE IT UNDER REALLY GREAT CONTROL-- PUERTO RICO AND THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA WHO HAVE REALLY SUFFERED OVER THIS LAST SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH THE HURRICANES, I WANT TO JUST REMEMBER THEM. AND WE'RE GOING TO DEDICATE THIS TROPHY TO ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WENT THROUGH SO MUCH THAT WE LOVE-- A PART OF OUR GREAT STATE, REALLY PART OF OUR GREAT NATION. ( AUDIENCE REACTS )
Stephen: YES, YES. THAT'S HOW I EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE, TOO. THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S LETTING THEM SPLIT A GOLF TROPHY. IT'S LIKE JESUS SAID, "FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME A GOLF TROPHY? WHAT THE HELL? I CAN'T EAT THIS!" ( LAUGHTER ) ( PIANO RIFF ) AM I GETTING THAT RIGHT? BUT WE AT THE "LATE SHOW" ALSO HAVE AN AWARD TO HAND OUT. TO DONALD TRUMP, WE'D LIKE TO DEDICATE THIS TROPHY FOR THE WORLD'S EMPTIEST GESTURE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) THIS IS IT. WE WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS. YES, OF COURSE. OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT TO ACCEPT THE AWARD, THE INGRATE. ( LAUGHTER ) PUT THAT SOMEPLACE SECURE, PLEASE. BUT IT WASN'T JUST A GOLF TROPHY, TRUMP ALSO HAD A MESSAGE FOR THE ISLAND: "TO THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO: DO NOT BELIEVE THE #FAKENEWS! #PRSTRONG. FLAG EMOJI." YES, FAKE NEWS. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HOW PARTISAN THE NEWS COVERAGE HAS BEEN DOWN IN PUERTO RICO: OH, WAIT, THERE IS NO NEWS DOWN THERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ELECTRICITY, YOU NUT LID!
Jon: OH! ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: YEAH, NUT LID! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU POP TOP NUT LID! ( PIANO RIFF )
Stephen: THANK YOU! YOU SEE, TRUMP CAN'T FUNCTION IF HE HEARS ANY CRITICISM. IT JUST SHUTS HIM DOWN. AND SINCE HE IS OUR PRESIDENT, LIKE IT OR NOT, I'VE INSTRUCTED OUR IN-HOUSE NEWS TEAM "REAL NEWS TONIGHT" TO DO A REPORT ON TRUMP'S HURRICANE RESPONSE THAT I THINK HE'S GOING TO LIKE.
WELCOME TO REALNESS TONIGHT. I'M JILL NEWS LADY, I'M JIM ANCHORTON.
BREAKING NEWS FROM PUERTO RICO. PUERTO RICO IS A GOOD NEWS STORY. BUENO.
MUI BUENO, JILL. PUERTO RICO IS SO SATISFIED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DISASTER RELIEF THEY AREN'T SENDING OUT ANY NEGATIVE PHONE CALLS TEXTS.
THAT MAY BECAUSE THEY'RE POLITICAL INGRATES WHO WANT EVERYTHING DONE WITH HIM.
UNLIKE THE PEOPLE FROM THE VIRGIN ISLANDS WHO ARE HARD WORKERS.
AND VIRGINS. PUERTO RICO IS SURROUND BID BIG WATER.
FULL OF JELLYFISH AN WET SNAKES. EXPERTS ARE NOW SAYING THE HURRICANE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IFN BEGGAR DISASTER HAD PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT KNOCKED IT OFF COURSE WITH HIS STRONG MASSIVE HANDS ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
ANOTHER SMART TRUMP THING IS THAT TODAY TRUMP HELPED HURRICANE MARIA VICTIMS BY AIR DROPPING EMERGENCY GOLF TROPHIES ALL OVER THE ISLAND.
CONGRATULATIONS, PUERTO RICO, YOU EARNED IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. I SIT DOWN WITH PIERCE BROSNAN, BUT WHEN WE RETURN, AWKWARD CELEBRITY PUBERTY PHOTOS! STICK AROUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK! JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" RIGHT THERE! THERE'S THE MAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JOHN, DID YOU HAVE A NICE WEEKEND THIS WEEKEND?
YEAH.
Stephen: I HAD A FUN TIME THIS WEEKEND BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW IT OUT THERE, BUT I GOT A LITTLE SIDE HUSTLE GOING ON AS A MASCOT FOR AN ICE CREAM, STEPHEN COLBERT'S AMERICONE DREAM RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IF YOU DO THE DAIRY, CHECK IT OUT BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY I GET FROM THIS GOES TO CHARITY. WE USUALLY GIVE IT AWAY AT THE END OF THE YEAR, BUT LAST WEEK NICK KROL WAS ON THE SHOW TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW NETFLIX SERIES BIG MOUTH WHICH IS ABOUT THE AWKWARDNESS OF PUBERTY AND HE ASKED US AND OTHER CELEBRITIES TO TWEET OUR PUBERTY PHOTOS, AND I SAID FOR EVERY CELEBRITY WHO PUTS UP A PUBERTY PICTURE OF WHEN THEY'RE 13 -- AND I'LL DECIDE WHAT A CELEBRITY, IS THANK YOU -- I'LL GIVE A DONATION. HOW MUCH MONEY SHOULD GO WITH EACH CELEBRITY WHO DOES THIS?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
Stephen: HOW MUCH? $1,000.
Stephen: WELL, $1,000 PER AWKWARD PHOTO, AND THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN WONDERFULLY AWKWARD. I LED OFF WITH THIS ONE. THAT'S ME. THAT'S ME AT AGE 13 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I THINK RIGHT THERE IS A QUADRUPLE WINDSOR KNOT, BECAUSE IF YOU DO A SCALE, THAT KNOT IS THE SIZE OF MY FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WE'VE GOTTEN GREAT RESPONSES FROM A TON OF CELEBRITIES. HERE'S A BONA FIDE CELEBRITY, OUR OLD PAL CONAN O'BRIEN. CHECK IT OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN MOMENTS BEFORE LASSIE SAVED HIM FROM THAT WELL. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS ONE'S GREAT. I LOVE THIS ONE BECAUSE I LOVE THIS PERSON. THIS IS RACHEL BLOOM FROM CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND. CHECK OUT THIS ONE, JIM.

I BELIEVE THOSE LENSES WERE THE SAME ONES USED ON THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I THINK OUR FRIEND THE GREAT STEVE MARTIN MIGHT HAVE WON WITH THIS ONE RIGHT HERE. HE SENT THIS VERY EMBARRASSING PHOTO. IT SAYS HERE I AM JUST BEFORE HITTING PUBERTY. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH. HE WAS NOT EVERYBODY. NOT EVERY ONE'S PUBERTY TURNS THEM INTO CAT STEPHENS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THESE, RIGHT? WE LITERALLY HAVE HUNDREDS OF CELEBRITIES AT THIS POINT. SO WE'RE GOING TO VET WHO'S ACTUALLY A SHERBERT. BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S HUNDREDS. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU WHO HAVE DONE THE SAME AND IS IT TOMORROW? HOPEFULLY TOMORROW WE'LL GIVE YOU A TOTAL OF ALL THE MONEY GOING TO ONE AMERICA APPEAL, OKAY?

Stephen: HI, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO "THE LATE SHOW." MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT WAS ACTUALLY RECORDED LAST WEEK IN THIS VERY CHAIR OVER HERE. YOU KNOW HIM AS REMINGTON STEELE, THOMAS CROWN AND, OF COURSE, JAMES BOND, PLEASE WELCOME PIERCE BROSNAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
I WAS GETTING READY TO COME OUT!
Stephen: THERE YOU GO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I LIKE THAT. NOT EVERYBODY BLOWS A KISS TO THE AUDIENCE.
WHY NOT?
Stephen: WHY NOT? THEY DESERVE A LITTLE SUGAR.
YES.
Stephen: SO NICE TO MEET YOU. I NEVER MET YOU BEFORE I MET YOU BACKSTAGE A SECOND AGO.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.
Stephen: YOU'RE A DEAD RINGER FOR PIERCE BROSNAN.
YOU LOOK LIKE STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH! LISTEN, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU AS JAMES BOND AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. YOU'RE ALWAYS THOMAS CROWN TO ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: SUCH AN AMAZING MOVIE. IT'S A GREAT PERFORMANCE.
IT WAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL, YEAH -- NO, IT HANGS HIGH THERE ON THE WALL IN THE MOVIES THAT I'VE MADE. I LOVE MAKING THE MOVIE, I LOVE NEW YORK CITY, I PAINT, SO IT HAPPENED AT A TIME IN MY LIFE WHICH --
Stephen: YOU PAINT? I DO.
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
I STARTED AS A COMMERCIAL ARTIST WAY BACK WHEN.
Stephen: REALLY? IN LONDON?
IN LONDON, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT SORT OF THINGS WERE YOU DOING?
I WAS DOING FURNITURE REPRODUCTION. I WAS STRAWING STRAIGHT LINES, MAKING CUPS OF TEA AND WATERING THE SPIDER PLANTS.
Stephen: WOW. LIKE ANDY WARHOL, HE STARTED AS A COMMERCIAL ARTIST.
HE STARTED DOING SHOES.
Stephen: AND IF HE HAD BEEN TALL AND HANDSOME, HE WOULD HAVE HAD YOUR CAREER.
WELL, HORSES FOR COURSES, I GUESS.
Stephen: YES. THAT'S THE DESTINY OF LIFE. BUT, NO, THOMAS CROWN WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE TO DO.
Stephen: IT'S ON CONSTANTLY ON TNT. I WATCH IT EVERY TIME. THEY SUCK ME IN EVERY TIME.
THANKS GOD NOR RENEE RUSSO. WITHOUT HER, I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IN THE WATER. YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD WOMAN BESIDE YOU.
Stephen: DO YOU MISS THE BOND THING AT ALL? THE TUXEDOS, THE GADGETS AND ALL THAT STUFF.
IS THIS GOOD LORD, NO.
Stephen: NO? IT WAS FANTASTIC. IT WAS BRILLIANT WHEN IT LASTED AND ALLOWED ME TO HAVE MY OWN COMPANY AND MAKE THOMAS CROWN, SO IT WAS A GREAT SEGUE, AND ONCE YOU PLAY THAT ROLE, IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY. YOU HOPE FOR THE BEST AND HOPE YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN NORTHERN IRELAND?
SOUTHERN IRELAND. I GREW UP ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BOWEN COUNTY MEAD 60 MILES OUTSIDE OF DUBLIN.
Stephen: HOW DOES A BOY WHO GROWS UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, HOW DOES HE BECOME A BRITISH ICON? HOW DO YOU -- WHERE'S YOUR ACCENT IS WHERE I'M ASKING?
OH, THE ACCENT GOT MANGLED WAY BACK THERE TRYING TO FIT IN, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I LEFT IRELAND IN 1964 AS A COUNTRY BOY AND, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO FIT INTO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY, SOCIETY IN SOUTH LONDON. I JUST -- IT WAS, I SUPPOSE, ONE OF MY BEST PERFORMANCES, ENDING UP BEING FROM SOUTH IRELAND AND TALKING LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, MATE?
Stephen: I DO. ( APPLAUSE )
SO YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY, PART OF THE GANG. AND I REALIZED I WASN'T, AND I WAS GOOD AT A BIT OF ART. I LEFT SCHOOL AT 15 WITH A CARDBOARD FOLDER OF DRAWINGS AND GOT A JOB IN THIS TINY STUDIO AND, LIKE I SAY, DRAWING TRYING TO LINES AND WATERING SPIDER PLANTS AND MAKING CUPS OF TEA. ONE DAY I WAS HANGING MY COAT UP AND TALKING TO A GUY ABOUT THEATER AND MOVIES AND HE SAID YOU SHOULD COME ALONG TO THE ARTS LAB, IT'S CALLED THE THEATER CLUB. I WENT IN AT AGE 18, THE HEIGHT OF THE '60s, IT WAS A WORLD THAT WAS EXOTIC AND WONDERFUL TO ME AND I BECAME AN ACTOR.
Stephen: THE NEW MOVIE CALLED "THE FOREIGNER," AND WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU AND JACKIE CHAN. I DIDN'T COLLECT THAT. AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: T CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SCENE HERE?
THIS IS JACKIE AND MYSELF. HE'S -- YOU KNOW, HE'S A CHINAMAN LIVING IN LONDON. HE'S A HUMBLE MAN, HIS DAUGHTER GETS BLOWN UP IN AN EXPLOSION AND HE WANTS TO FILL OUT WHO KILLED HIS DAUGHTER AND I PLAY THE IRAN FIRST MINISTER LIAM HENNESSY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE AN IRISH ACCENT IN THIS ONE.
I PLAY A MAN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND, YES.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT CONFUSED ME. ( LAUGHTER ) JIM?
SIT. I'M WEARING A BOMB. ANYONE COMES IN, I TOUCH IT, AND WE DIE. GIVE ME THE NAMES.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY REALLY ARE. I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIND OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE --
YOU'RE LYING! WHO KILLED MY DAUGHTER?!
I'M SORRY! I TRULY DON'T KNOW YET! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I REALLY BELIEVE YOU'RE IRAN.
THANK YOU. I HOPE THEY DO, TOO.
Stephen: NOW, ONE OF THE MOVIES I MOST ADMIRE OF YOURS IS THE MATADOR, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. MY FAVORITE SCENE IN THE MATADOR IS WHEN YOU TELL A LITTLE KID TO GET AWAY FROM YOU. JIM?
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TELL YOU NEVER TO TALK TO STRANGERS?
SHE'S OVER THERE AND SHE SAYS THAT I SHOULD TALK TO YOU.
SHE DID? YES. SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE. I THINK SHE THINKS YOU'RE CUTE.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AND I'M ONLY INTERESTED IN YOUR MOTHER IF SHE LOST 20 POUNDS AND 30 YEARS SO I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU GOT THE (BLEEP) AWAY FROM ME.
WHATEVER. , GOODBYE, SKA DOODLE.
SEE  IA WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YA.
SMELL YA, SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL YA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LOVELY SCENE AND MOVIE. THE REASON I LOVE IT SO MUCH IS THAT YOUNG MAN GOT HOOKED ON SHOW BUSINESS AND HE IS NOW ONE OF MY PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, JONAH MEYERSON. GET OUT HERE, JONAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, PIERCE, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO JONAH BEFORE WE GO?
JONAH, SERIOUSLY, GET THE (BLEEP) OUT OF HERE. GET THE (BLEEP) OUT OF HERE. GO ON. THEY TOLD ME TO SAY THIS! I'D REALLY LIKE IT IF YOU JUST GET THE -- AWAY FROM ME.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JONAH FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE. PIERCE BROSNAN, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW ALREADY IN PROGRESS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW MY NEXT GUEST AS GEORGE COSTANZA ON "SEINFELD." HE NOW STARS IN THE UPCOMING SHOW "HIT THE ROAD" ON THE AUDIENCE NETWORK. PLEASE WELCOME JASON ALEXANDER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HELLO. HELLO. CAN I SAY SOMETHING RIGHT OFF THE TOP?
Stephen: UH-HUH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING TONIGHT. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND NECESSARY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ON A SHOW LIKE THIS TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT THANK YOU.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY. I HAVE BEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA ALL DAY AND EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T STOP A MAD MAN, YEAH, YOU CAN'T, BUT YOU CAN STOP THEM FROM GETTING THESE WEAPONS AND WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HOPEFULLY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME HOPE FOR THAT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT'S NIECE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I SAW YOU ONCE BEFORE.
WE HAD A LOVELY DINNERING TO AND I SAT NEXT TO YOUR WIFE AND I THINK SHE WAS MOVED.
Stephen: I BET SHE WAS. DID YOU SEE WHO THAT WAS?! EVERYONE KNOWS YOU AS GEORGE COSTANZA BUT I THINK OF YOU AS A SINGER -- ( LAUGHTER ) I'M NOT JOKING. ON THIS STAGE WHEN DAVE WAS THE HOST OF "THE LATE SHOW," YOU DID MAN OF LA MAN CHA. ( SINGING ) ( WITHER OVER THEY BLOW ♪ ♪ ONWASHED TO GLORY I GO ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YES. HOW HAVE I NOT BEEN CAST IN THAT ROLE OF THE THIN, STRING BEAN OLD MAN --
Stephen: OR WINDMILL. EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU AND I HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE WITH STEVE SONDHEIM.
SURE YOU DO.
Stephen: YOU WERE IN THE ORIGINAL CAST OF MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG.
YES.
Stephen: I KNOW 2010 STEPHEN SONDHEIM. WHAT WAS THE 1981 STEPHEN SONDHEIM LIKE?
LOVELY, BRILLIANT, AMAZING.
Stephen: SURE. A DIFFICULT SHOW. THERE'S A WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARY LONNIE PRICE MADE ABOUT SOME OF OUR TIME TOGETHER. BUT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SHOWS WHERE I WAS 20 YEARS OLDICS SONDHEIM, PAL HAL PRINCE AND WOR WITH THE GUYS. IT WAS A MASS CATTLE CALL AND I WAS RIGHT FOR THAT ROLE AND IT WORKED OUT. BUT THEY STRUGGLED. I WAS NOT PART OF THE STRUGGLE. I HAD A CHARACTER THAT WAS VERY CLEAR IN A SHOW THAT WAS OFTEN UNCLEAR. SO I WAS COAST ALONG BEAUTY BEAUTIFULLY, HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE AND EVERY DAY THEY WOULD REWRITE MASSIVE PARTS OF THE SHOW AND PUT THEM IN BUT NEVER ME, I WAS FINE. ONE DAY I REMEMBER SITTING IN THE THEATER AND THERE WAS A LOT OF STRESS. THEY WERE ALL KIDS AND COULDN'T HAVE BEEN KINDER AND THEY TOOK CARE OF US BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF STRESS. SONDHEIM CAME OUT ON STAGE AND HE WAS LOOKING AROUND LIKE HE WAS UPSET AND HE LOOKS INTO THE HOUSE OF THE THEATER AND I SAID, OH, SOMEBODY'S IN TROUBLE, SOMETHING'S UP, AND HE LOOKS IN THE AREA WHERE I'M SITTING AND STARTS HEADING DOWN. I WENT, OH, IT MUST BE SOMEBODY NEAR ME. WHO COULD IT BE? AND HE COMES UP TO ME AND REALLY UPSET, GOES, NEVER MESS AROUND WITH MY SCORE! AND TURNS ON HIS HEEL AND OFF HE GOES. I'M LIKE A PUPPY FOLLOWING MY MOTHER GOING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID! DON'T WALK AWAY! DON'T WALK AWAY! WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT, I HAD GOTTEN SO COMFORTABLE THAT HE WROTE A LINE OF MUSIC THAT WENT,. ♪ THERE'S NOT A TUNE YOU CAN HUM ♪ AND I GOT COCKY AND SAID,. ♪ THERE IS NOT A TUNE YOU CAN HU-UM ♪ I APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY AND HE WAS AS SWEET AS IT COULD BE AND WE COLLABORATED EVER SINCE. BUT THE GOD OF THEATER ALMOST ENDED MY LIFE THAT DAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE A NEW SHOW CALLED "HIT THE ROAD "  COMING OUT OPEN AUDIENCE NETWORK. FOR A FEW PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE AUDIENCE NETWORK IS --
LIKE MYSELF.
Stephen: WHAT IS AUDIENCE NETWORK AND WHAT IS "HIT THE ROAD"?
THE AUDIENCE NETWORK IS THE CHANNEL OF DIRECT TV. IF YOUR TELEVISION COMES TO YOU VIA DIRECT TV, YOU HAVE THE AUDIENCE CHANNEL. I WAS NOT FULLY AWARE OF THEM. THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING. "MR. MERCEDES" WAS A BIG ONE FOR THEM THIS SUMMER. "HIT THE ROAD" IS THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY ON ACID.
Stephen: I'D WATCH THAT. INDEED. IT'S A FAMILY BAND WITH A MOTHER, FATHER, FOUR KIDS, ONE ADOPTED AFRICAN-AMERICAN KID, TRYING TO BE ONE OF AMERICA'S WHOLESOME BANDS.
Stephen: FOUR KIDS, ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
YES.
Stephen: SO IT'S ALSO "THIS IS US" ON ACID.
IT IS, INDEED.
Stephen: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE "SEINFELD" ON ACID.
I UNDERSTAND YOU DID RECENTLY, SO, YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS. ( LAUGHTER ) NO! ( PIANO RIFF ) COME ON!
Stephen: WELL, YOU HAVE A SHOW HERE IN NEW YORK.
YEAH.
Stephen: "THE PORTUGUESE KID," IT OPENS OCTOBER 24 AT THE MANHATTAN THEATER CLUB. THE SHOW IS "HIT THE ROAD" ON THE AUDIENCE NETWORK, THE MAN IS JASON ALEXANDER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TA-NEHISI COATES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS A NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE ATLANTIC AND A MACARTHUR GENIUS. PLEASE WELCOME, TA-NEHISI COATES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) THANKS FOR BEING HERE! COME ON UP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.
Stephen: A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THE LAST TIME WE HAD A CONVERSATION TOGETHER, I WAS IN CHARACTER ON THE COLBERT REPORT, AND I THINK YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS ONE MORE.
IT'S FINE.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT. FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHO HAVEN'T READ YOUR PIECES IN "THE ATLANTIC" OR YOUR BOOKS, YOU ARE A MacARTHUR FELLOW, NOT A GENIUS. YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE THE GENIUS THING. YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES" LEADING BLACK PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL.
I MIGHT PREFER GENIUS OVER THAT.
Stephen: INTELLECTUAL SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE INVITED TO LESS PARTIES.
OR MORE BUT THE KIND YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO.
Stephen: LOOKS LIKE "NEW YORKER" MAGAZINES.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU ARE A LEADING BLACK PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL -- ( LAUGHTER ) CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROTEST GOING ON NOW STARTED BY COLIN KAEPERNICK AND CO-OPTED AS A WEDGE ISSUE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE STATE OF THE PROTEST NOW AND THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE?
WELL, IN TERMS OF THE PRESIDENT, I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BEEN VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL. IT'S THE NATURAL COURSE THAT PROTEST STARTS IN A REALLY RADICAL PLACE AND ENDS WHERE IT IS NOW WHERE IS JERRY JONES AND THE DALLAS COWBOYS TAKING THE MESSAGE OF UNIT WHICH IS NOT THE MESSAGE WHEN IT STARTED. ALL PROTEST FACES THAT ISSUE. BUT THE FACT THAT KAEPERNICK, WHO IS NOT ON AN N.F.L. TEAM, BY THE WAY, ACTUALLY FORCED THE LEAGUE TO AT LEAST IN SOME WAY ADDRESS THIS. I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT. THE SECOND THING IS, PEOPLE ARE LESS AWARE OF THIS, COLIN KAEPERNICK MADE A PLEDGE TO GIVE AWAY A MILLION DOLLARS AND IF YOU GO TO HIS WEB SITE TO VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH MONTH HOW MUCH HE'S GIVING AWAY, THE ORGANIZATIONS HE'S GIVING IT TO AND WHAT THE MONEY HAS GONE TO. SO I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL, ACTUALLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT, WELL, THIS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE PLACE TO PROTEST, YOU'RE POLITICIZING A VENUE.
IT'S NEVER APPROPRIATE.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROTEST, IT'S NOT A PROTEST.
NO, NO, IT'S NEVER APPROPRIATE. YOU SEE THIS FROM TIME TO TIME. YOU SAW IT WHEN "BLACK LIVES MATTER." THERE'S AN IDEA, FOR INSTANCE, DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS REALLY POPULAR. CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY POPULAR AND APPROPRIATE AND PEOPLE APPROVED OF THEIR PROTESTS. UNFORTUNATELY OR FORTUNATELY, WE HAD POLLING DATA FROM THAT PERIOD, AN IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT N.F.L. PROTESTS TODAY. MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD A PIECE. IN 1966, 60% OF AMERICANS DISAPPROVED OF MARTIN LUTHER KING SPECIFICALLY AS A PERSON. HE DIDN'T GET KILLED OUT OF NOWHERE. THAT CAME OUT OF A WAY THAT THE COUNTRY FELT ABOUT HIM. IT WAS ONLY AFTER HIS DEATH HE BECAME DEFIED AND AMERICANS APPROVE OF HIM.
Stephen: THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DIDN'T APPROVE THE BUS BOYCOTTS OR THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON.
NO, WHY WOULD THERE? IF THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS APPROVED THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR A PROTEST IN THE FIRST PLACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED "WE WERE EIGHT YEARS IN POWER, AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY." SO THE EIGHT YEARS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BARACK OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY. WHAT IS THE TRAGEDY?
THE TRAGEDY IS THAT YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS EFFECTIVELY CONDUCTING DIPLOMACY WITH A NUCLEAR ROGUE STATE VIA TWITTER. THAT HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING VERY, VERY, VERY TRAGIC. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE EVEN IN THAT POSITION. EVERY DAY SOMETHING NEW HAPPENS AND I THINK WE FORGET HOW FAR GONE WE ACTUALLY ARE. AND THE CASE I MAKE, YOU KNOW, IN THAT BOOK IS THE VERY SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE REACTION TO THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. THIS IS ACTUALLY IN MANY WAYS A DIRECT RESULT OF IT ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT DOES SEEM A LOT OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING IS MOTIVATED MERELY TO TRY TO REVERSE SOMETHING THAT BARACK OBAMA DID.
EXACTLY. THERE'S BEEN JOURNALISM ABOUT THIS. THE FIRST THING HE WANTS TO KNOW IS WHAT WAS OBAMA'S POSITION ON IT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE HAD A HARD TIME IN SOME INTERVIEWS EXPRESSING A SENSE OF HOPE THAT THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN THIS COUNTRY.
YES IS THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY HOPE TONIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE ABOUT HOW WE COULD BE A BETTER COUNTRY, HAVE BETTER RACE RELATIONS, BETTER POLITICS?
NO. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I'M NOT THE PERSON YOU SHOULD GO TO FOR THAT. YOU SHOULD GO TO YOUR PASTOR. YOUR PASTOR PROVIDES YOU HOPE. YOUR FRIENDS PROVIDE YOU HOPE. THERE ARE FIGURES THAT EXIST -- IN BETTER TIMES, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES YOU HOPE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT KIND OF MORAL PLACE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S NOT MY JOB. THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOB.
Stephen: I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO MAKE (BLEEP) UP. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU PERSONALLY SEE ANY CHANCE FOR CHANGE IN AMERICA?
MAYBE. MAYBE. I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE (BLEEP) UP TO ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN A SATISFYING WAY IS THAT WHAT ABOUT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS IN AMERICA? WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, DEMOCRACY ITSELF WHILE NOT RUBBER IS PLASTIC AND AS THE DEMOGRAPHICS CHANGE, AS WHITE PEOPLE BECOME THE MINORITY IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS COMING, DO YOU SEE A CHANGE FOR --
YOUR QUESTION PRESUMES THERE IS A STATIC DEFINITION OF WHITENESS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE BEFORE.
Stephen: WHO GETS TO BE WHITE NEXT TO MAKE SURE WE OUTNUMBER BLACK PEOPLE.
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. IRAN, JEWS, ITALIANS WERE NOT CONSIDERED WHITE. THINGS CHANGE. IN THE VERY DEFINITION OF WHITENESS BEING MALLEABLE, THE ABILITY TO VOTE AND ACCESS TO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS ALSO A MALLEABLE THING, ALSO. SO YOU MIGHT HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS ACTUALLY CHANGING, BUT WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS IN AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM THAT MIGHT ALSO CHANGE, TOO?
Stephen: I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.
I HOPE I'M WRONG, TOO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TA-NEHISI COATES, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: "WE WERE EIGHT YEARS IN POWER" RACIAL SIGHT NOW. TA-NEHISI COATES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE MICHAEL WEATHERLY, NATASHA LEGGERO, AND MUSICAL GUEST, PAUL WELLER. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDEN AND HIS GUESTS, DEBRA MESSING, JAY PHAROAH, AND LIZ GILLIES. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
